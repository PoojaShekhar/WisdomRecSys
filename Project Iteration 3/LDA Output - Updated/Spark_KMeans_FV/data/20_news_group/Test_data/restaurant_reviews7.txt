Review Text :
A quiet nicely decorated Indian restaurant in the southwest area of town.  We were the only diners on a Sunday night (which usually isn't a good thing), but they are hidden away.The Husband and I shared:* Lamb Biryani "Baked casserole of basmati rice and lamb richly flavored with saffron." ($16.95) - The Husband has a special liking to biryani and immediately looked through the menu for this item.  He ordered it spicy and definitely enjoyed it, more so with the leftovers the next day.* Malai Kofta "Mixed vegetable dumplings in savory creamy spiced sauce." ($12.95) - I'm all about any kind of creamy sauce and there are very few I don't like in Indian cuisine.  Their version was super tasty and really good with the garlic nan bread.  Yum!  I chose medium for my spice.  It also came with rice.  The dumplings were just okay though.* Garlic Nan "Leavened bread baked with fresh chopped garlic in the tandoor." ($2.95) - When going nan, garlic is the only way to go.  So good, I could only wish for more.Overall, the food was pretty good.  Our waiter was definitely attentive, until he got stuck on the phone with a to go order.  It is rather expensive for the two entrees and condiment we ordered, even with an Entertainment Book coupon.  We'd consider going again, but definitely know why the Indian lunch buffets do so well in the city.Oh boy. A rare bad review. Let me state clearly that I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt. At first I thought "Maybe it's because I'm here on (insert any day of the week but Monday)", or maybe because "I'm here (alone/with a date/with colleagues)" . a half-dozen "benefits of the doubt". No more! I'm never going back.No cocktails, no beer, only wine. "Lunch Specials" are advertised, but apparently no lunch buffet. In no way could this restaurant be considered competitive. Not in the West End of London (by far!), not in Silicon Valley, not in Washington D.C. ,  and not even in the desert wasteland of Indian Cuisine that is The Southwest Neighborhood of Las Vegas. Even in a field of 1, this restaurant doesn't rate.  Unless you live in the Southwest Neighborhood, you would never know this place exists except for listing conglomerators with apps in the app store. And that's probably just as well . Service is consistently slow, though courteous. This is truly the only Indian restaurant west of Decatur but you would never know it. Ask for a booth or table right next to the telephone...so you can listen to the chirping of the ringer ring of the hook the -entire- length of your dinner. This is a classic example of a poorly-run restaurant that gives Las Vegas restaurants a bad name.  Why is the phone ringing off the hook? Because everybody from a 10-mile radius is ordering from one of those UHAUL-style food delivery places and this is the only Indian-cuisine restaurant in the area. Is the food authentic? Is the food fairly priced? Is the wine list good? I  think the answers to these questions is "probably, yes", but really what is "authentic Indian cuisine"? If you read the original owner's numerous publicly-available print-media articles you would conclude there is no more  "authentic Indian cuisine" than this restaurant. I  don't think most people who are frequent customers choose to eat here because of this restaurant's value, authenticity, or wine list...and really couldn't care less about the poor service. I  think most frequent customers of this restaurant eat here because they work in the nearby Dignity Heath San Martin hospital complex, they live in the traffic-jam-central nearby housing developments of  Mountain's Edge or Rhodes Ranch (both developments notoriously crammed to the gills with more residential units than can be supported by the surrounding businesses causing huge infrastructure problems... ) or any of the mega-complex apartment villages that plague the Southwest Neighborhood. This restaurant will never attract a sufficient level of tourist traffic because of its location, and there is no alternative restaurant of this ethnic specialty within any reasonable amount of driving time, and the residents of the aforementioned housing developments and local employers like the hospital are totally accustomed to poor quality and poor service, so this business will always remain. The ambience of the restaurant holds no value for a romantic liaison, a business conversation, or even a large gathering like a UYE. Only those with a LOT of time on their hands come here at night. Like only retirees and families with multiple children bother coming here at night (which describes the predominant makeup of those who live in this neighbourhood). I  doubt anybody but the management of this restaurant and Yelpers who will never have the chance to visit this restaurant will ever read this review. That being said, I offer one piece of advice, and I  bet you can't guess what it is.... Is it "Try the Lamb Vindaloo" or "Save room for a Mango Lassi"? No. It is simple: Bring a bottle of water in your purse when you come here for dinner. Better yet, just go next door to Teriyaki Madness and save your money.(Why is this restaurant's ambience poor? The telephone ringing constantly, for starters. Secondly, the interior design seems like it was designed in some computer game like "The Sims" or by midgets with vengeance against tall people. Also, the second booth has cloth so thread bare the stuffing is poking out. The booths are placed so close together you have to be a little person to fit into them without feeling like the table is poking you in the stomach and I am by far certainly not a candidate for weight loss! The "mantra" here should be "if you have time to lean you have time to clean" but it is, sadly, not.)

Review Text :
Heading to the heart of Las Vegas's Chinatown, I'm checking out Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant for their dim sum.  It's about 1 pm on a Saturday and this restaurant isn't as busy as I had hoped.  (Not a good sign.)My friend and her dining companion are already enjoying their Pineapple Buns with Egg Custard when we arrive. This is definitely a good sign!  (I'm not sure if the buns were hot when they came out, since I arrived a bit late.)  I enjoyed the sweetness of the custard, but the BF found it to be too sweet for him.We ordered their standard shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings.  Both were standard.  They even had the Shanghai dumplings readily available as well.  They were tastier than Orchids Garden's version, that's for sure! http://www.yelp.com/biz/Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ?hrid=aU3RP30FNJmzdi1e-Ksa-g  And since the red vinegar is left out on the table, you can feel free to drown it as much as you'd like!We also had Chinese broccoli, shrimp on tofu, crab/shrimp puff thing, shrimp rice noodle, and chicken feet in black bean sauce.  All were pretty good.  We even had the salt and pepper shrimp that came right out of the kitchen, so it was nice and hot.  The downside?  Service was blah, I mean really blah.  The ladies never smiled or showed any personality whatsoever.  And the guys working there were not that great either.  They refilled our teapot, but left it on the far end of the table, out of our reach.  One lady was very indifferent as she slid our order across our table.  They were quick to clean up our plates once the bill was settled, which can be a good or bad thing.  (It usually means they want you out of their fast so they can have the table back.)Instead of sending the carts to the back for refills, they have waiters carrying a bunch of dishes in their hands or stacking them up and then placing them on a the cart.  I'm not so sure this is visually appealing.  The bill was about $40 for four, not including tip.  We found this to be a bit more expensive than Orchids Garden and Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine since we know we ate less here.  (The BF wasn't so sure we got the correct bill even since the guy handling all the checks seemed quite unorganized.)Overall, the selection was there, although lacking in desserts.  (I did see the sweet tofu come out, but no custard tarts!)  They did have a few things that some of the other dim sum restaurants didn't seem to have.  Sometimes you get the feeling they are really trying to push a dish on you.  I mean, how often can the congee lady come by asking if we want congee?  Because the restaurant is a bit smaller and they don't push the carts into the back, you'll find the ladies 'idling' by one side of the restaurant, which was pretty much hanging out by our table.  They could really use a lesson or two in customer service.  If they can fix this a bit, I might even be willing to give them a better score rather than a stiff 3 star.There's a reason why Harbor Palace ranks on the bottom of my list of dim sum places in Vegas.It was my second visit ever and it just reconfirmed my experience from the first time I went.Saturday brunch - 11:30 am arrival.  Not as busy as I would expect.  (Bad sign.)We have a large party, five adults and four children.  As a result, we're seated in one of the larger tables in the room set off to the right of the restaurant.We had barely sat down, especially with getting all the young kids seated, when the cart lady was hollering, "You want dim sum!?"  I was immediately put off with her attitude and probably would have left if it was just the Husband and I.  (My Chinese friend mentioned that her mom has a simple standard of dim sum restaurants - tea should be placed on the table before the food is brought out.  And she's right.  Growing up, that's the first thing I remember from my many dim sum brunches.  The waiters ask what kind of tea you want (usually as you're getting situated), and before the carts come, the tea is on your table.)But in this case, we felt so pressured to order from the lady's cart and had baskets of food on our table way before the beverage guy came around to ask what we wanted to drink.  (I will say that he brought the tea and water over quickly and had our tea pots filled the whole time, of course with my help of flipping the cover up.)  We got the typical orders of pork dumplings and shrimp dumplings.  Nothing special here, more dried out from over-steaming, if that makes sense.  We got a couple orders of beef balls and was surprised they didn't cut it in half (I've always seen it cut in half), nor was any Worcestershire sauce given.Rice noodle dishes came by and I asked (in Cantonese) if they had Beef Noodle Roll.  She said they did, looked around, then asked if I wanted the Pork Spare Ribs one.  I said fine, and then she asked about the Shrimp one too, which I said was fine.  (Although she did try sneaking another one onto our table until we caught her in time to just say only one!)  And of course, the beef one never showed up.  I asked for Egg Custard Bun, and she said they had it, but tried passing off some yellow bean one as well.  We did eventually get the Egg Custard Bun and it was not good....hard, dry and old.  Bleh!Deep fried chicken wings were decent the first time around, but even better when we got them nice and hot.  The deep fried salt and pepper shrimp was also nice and hot when we got it too.Other dishes included steamed pork buns, chow mein noodles, Chinese broccoli (been sitting out too long), shrimp and tofu, chicken feet, and steamed beef tripe.  Nothing memorable though.The Husband wasn't eating much from the very start and I had to wonder why.  He discreetly pointed to the HAIR that was sitting on his rice noodle dish.  Oh. Yuck.  (And unfortunately we did not say anything about it then or at the end since we were with guests.  But normally, we would have at least tried to point it out after we paid.  And no, you never say anything during your meal because we all know what happens at Chinese restaurants if you complain.)Overall, Harbor Palace is just not that good. We weren't that impressed the first time and we aren't impressed now.  And the service is beyond bad here.  Sure, I know everyone says you can't expect much on service at dim sum restaurants, but this places leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  It's not even worth tolerating.They do have hot chili oil available on the tables, not just regular chili sauce.  And please stop asking for Sriracha sauce, you know who you are!

Review Text :
I've driven past this place dozens of times and wondered if they were any good.  I found the existing reviews inconclusive so we decided to drop in for dinner one evening.When we arrived we immediately liked the outdoor area and the warm decor inside.  A couple came in behind us and we inquired if they had been there before.  They replied that they had and we asked if it was good.  The husband shrugged and uttered, "Meh.  It's gringo."We stayed and shared an appetizer and an entree.  We were served a small dish of frijoles and a small dish of salsa.  To our surprise the frijoles were rather hot.  Not terribly flavorful, just spicy.  The salsa was ok and spicy as well.As if to continue in the same vein, our enchiladas arrived and the filling was very spicy.  Again, not terribly flavorful, just spicy.  We had one pork enchilada and one beef enchilada.  I couldn't tell which was which for sure.The tacos el carbon appetizer that we shared had so much fresh, raw onion on it that we were tearing up and picking it off.  Strange.Well, now we know and we won't wonder about it when we drive by but we certainly won't be back.I like spicy food that is flavorful not just hot for the sake of being hot and nothing else going on.If it was possible, I would give this place ZERO stars, actually negative stars. My family had hands down the WORST service experience here we have ever had at any restaurant in AZ. The sad part is we had been coming to this place for several years now, and even had my 30th Birthday party with family and friends here last year. We have noticed the both the quality of the food and quality of the service has been severely declining recently. However, tonight's debacle takes the cake for all time worst experience ever. Here's what happened... We arrive at 6:15 and get a table for 5 plus a highchair. We are seated within less than 5 minutes. Server arrives (Sean) soon after we sit down and gets water for the table. We had to wait a while for him to take our order because he disappeared for a bit... maybe waited 15 min for him to come back. Here is where things really start to go south... so we are waiting, and waiting, and waiting... at about 6:50 he comes out and says our food should arrive shortly. Then 7:00 rolls around, still no food. Then the table next to us (about 6-8 people I think) that arrived a good 30 minutes or so AFTER us gets their food. Then another table that arrives after us gets their food too... then a table of 4 that arrived literally 15 minutes ago, gets their food. Now we are thinking something is wrong with this picture.  So we ask for our server, he is no where to be found. So we wait... and wait... and wait... AGAIN. When he does show up, we ask for our food to-go because we have been waiting over an hour at this point (it was 7:20pm) and we had no food and had to go because our baby was getting fussy. He takes my husbands credit card to charge us for our food and says he will bring it right back... 10 minutes later... STILL NO FOOD and no server to be found, which means my husbands card has gone missing. In this time frame I had gone to the front to speak with the Manager with my Mom to let her know what happened and to see if they could locate our server, food and most importantly our credit card. The manager, the sorry excuse for a manager that is, arrives and is downright rude. She never apologizes and only says "we are really swamped" as I look around at half full rooms of people and say "are you serious?". We have been waiting well over an HOUR, all of the tables around us have food, the people that arrived 15 minutes ago next to us have their food. We want to leave and we want our card now. She disappears in the back and never returns. Meanwhile in the dining room... my food arrives (at 7:45pm) and guess what... they put it on FLOUR tortillas, even though I specifically asked for corn and said I cannot have flour because of a gluten intolerance. My husband noticed the mistake and asked the waiter "are these flour? My wife can't have flour, we told you that." and the waiter (Sean) says "well yes, but she can just scrape the food off and eat it without the tortilla." WHAT!?!? You have to be kidding me!?!? So someone with an allergy should just "scrape food off" to eat it?? This is literally no joke... the guy actually said "scrape it off, she will be fine" We then say, we are leaving please give our card back... and the waiter said he didn't charge it. We get home and check our account... guess what?? THEY CHARGED THE CARD!!! For food that arrived over an hour late, was cold, the wrong thing, and most of all this waiter was so ignorant to suggest "scraping it off to eat it". The ignorance and lack of any fiber of customer service or common sense is baffling. Save yourself the hassle and go to a different place where the wait staff is helpful, and the food is much better... or even arrives at your table.I used to live right down the street from La Casa Blanca and my wife and I used to visit once a week but that was 3 years ago. We moved to Gilbert and didn't visit until tonight. Walking in on a Friday night in the past you had to wait but now none of the tables in the front room had customers only the booths were used and the back room didn't have anything going on. I read the past reviews and I was stunned because it used to be a 4 star eats. But now I didn't believe it was possible to have food there without flavor and how do you make Mexican food bland? Is it even possible? But yes it is possible but man they did a great job and the wait staff was just blah. They could not care if we were there if we there. They were not rude just not engaged at all. I'm very sad at what happened to this place. I don't know if it changed owners or management but we won't be returning. Good Luck out there.

Review Text :
Five of us had dinner at The Carlton last night and it was a wonderful dining experience. For appetizers we had: 1 jumbo lump crab cake, 1 beet salad, 1 lobster and crab gnocchi, and 2 house salads. The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake which I ordered, was meaty with crab and was very rich sitting atop of Julianne vegetables. The Dijon Cream and fresh herb sauce it came with was just delicious. The gnocchi was tender and mild which allowed the lobster and crab to predominate the flavor profile. It was served in a Spinach, Caramelized Onions and Tomato-Ketel One Cream base. Very tasty indeed.Salad eaters, house and beet, all said they were great as well. These were all very good size appetizers so you might save some for taking home if you plan on heavy entrees and tend to fill-up fast.With the appetizers we also finished off two lemon cream martinis, one sour apple martini and one Grey Goose on the rocks with a twist, and one Arnold Palmer (AP refills aplenty). All drinks were made well. The had a nice martini list, a pretty good wine by the glass list and a full wine list which comes out on an iPad. Pretty cool approach. I am not counting but they say they have over 500 wines on the list. Enough to match any taste or meal. Later for dinner we wanted some rich, creamy full mouth Chardonnay so the proprietor suggested Sonoma-Cutrer for us. This was delicious and great match with our food.Dinner entrees were hard to choose from the extensive menu which includes some great daily specials which they say usually change every day. Sticking with a theme, I went the seafood route all night and choose the Florida Grouper which was prepared oven roasted and was fresh Parmesan crusted and served with Lobster Pierogies, Spring Vegetables and Roast Garlic Butter. Oh my was this meal ever rich and tender. The Grouper was completely melt in your mouth fresh and tender, and I exaggerate not one bit. The Pierogies were moist, tender and full of lobster stuffing and it went so well with the Grouper. Boy this was a satisfying choice. Three people, were enticed by the 14 oz. medium to medium rare Prime Rib. They all came out looking absolutely beautiful. Jody who is the real Prime Rib  connoisseur said that his ranked up with the best of them. Jody has traveled and lived or visited may cities for extended stays.  He has lived in Las Vegas so he had the opportunity to eat a Lawry's Prime Rib several times. To which I can say when I ate there with him a time or two, and I thought it was the best I ever had. So that puts The Carlton up with the best prime rib places in our judgment.Linda went for the Ahi Tuna entrée, which she said was extremely fresh and tender with the fabulous Tuna flavor one seeks in the best sushi. But it doesn't come naked. It's preparation is fresh Wasabi-Panko crusted with the Ahi Tuna seared rare and served with Curry-Coconut Orzo, Asian Greens, Hearts of Palm-Julienne Carrots and Yuzu Butter. This was a beautiful and tasteful preparation. Had enough to bring home and it served as a special breakfast this morning.I have to say that everything was really outstanding at The Carlton. Topping it off with some personal service, Kevin Joyce, the owner stopped at our table to see if we were enjoying or meals.  Have to hand it to Kevin, his professional staff, and especially Executive Chef Mark Swomley who has been there for 16 years. The Carlton itself has been around for 27 years which I think is a real testament to its enduring quality and service. You can not go wrong here.

Days of the $3.99 Las Vegas buffets are gone.  Well I'm sure you can find one, but I'm also sure it'll give you a Kenyan colon.It's all about $16 sandwiches nowadays.  More precisely, the $16 pastrami on rye.After arriving to Las Vegas, the boys and I were famished.  We dropped off our bags in our room that had two....yes...two toilets in separate bathrooms. This is important when you are sharing a room with guys that are all experts in the art of synchronized bowel movements.  Then herded down to the casino floor.  After shoulder bumping all the sloppy drunk girls with runny mascara we made it to the promise land.The pastrami on rye.  Not overly salty.  Tender.  And more importantly, a genorous heap of sensual pastrami.   Just thinking of it makes me yearn for it.  I positioned it in my hands as to where I wouldn't bite off my fingers and devoured it ever so quietly hoping no one would see me.When I looked down upon my empty plate, I was left wondering where my pastrami on rye went. Had I lost myself in it entirely and lost all sense of reality that I was left wondering if it was fictional?I left and the thought of what had happened haunted me the whole night while I was splitting 8's and doubling down on 10's and 11's.  All the while having the surgically enhanced cocktail waitress bringing me vodka tonics. Only to have myself imagine her cleavage was actually a mound of Canter's Pastrami.  Hallelujah.

Review Text :
I was eating lunch here on a consistent basis for a few months until I moved. After a substantial hiatus, I decided to pay this old friend a visit. Upon entering the cafe, the owner immediatly recognized me and said, "I have something for you!" and ran into the back to fetch a sweater I had left here FOUR MONTHS EARLIER! Sure, it stunk like it had been deep fried, but I was pretty amazed that they a) remembered me, b) held onto an article of my clothing for so long. But I digress- the food here is fresh and consistently tasty, and (obviously) the couple that own and run the place are super friendly. They cook up the best falafel I've had in Vegas, these aren't the usual crusty balls of powdered chickpea and celery salt deep fried until they're but a memory of vegetable many understand to be falafel. They are fresh, bright green balls with bits of parsley and cilantro clearly visible when you bite into them. They also serve great Greek fries, shawarma that is neither dry nor greasy, and good homemade lentil stew. Ample indoor seating, limited outdoor seating. Pet friendly!I brought the BF for lunch...poor thing has been sick and needs some good,simple, healthy foods. We split:A falafel wrap- yummy. Fresh falafel, cucumbers, onions, lettuce, hummus, chili sauce. The falafel is fresh made and not some box mix.A Greek plate which has spanakopita, moussaka, gyro meat, tzatsiki, 2 dolmas, fetta cheese, half greek salad, pita bread. The spanakopita was wrapped individually in phyllo and not cut out of a casserole. I like theirs- it's not greasy like other places. The moussaka came as a surprise....most places it's so dry and taste like it sat around. This was saucy and had a nice balance of spices....I would actually order a whole portion here, which I have never done. I made little sandwiches with the gyro, pita, tomatoes and olive on the plate and tzatziki- all good. Dolmas here are great. I bought a box of baklava to take home. I like that they don't over pour honey on the layer of nuts since that usually makes it so hard to bite through. It's just right amounts of everything. Me loves. So glad I was able to come back...it's been a while since my first visit though I promised to be back! Better late than never, but the next visit should come sooner.This is what YELP is for and the Baladie cafe is for Yelpers!  I can really appreciate a small privately owned place.  I appreciate a place where the owners appreciate my business. It is a small place in a Vons plaza - but the Vons is closed.  I have been by here a million times but never even thought about going in here for lunch. It is a tiny place with 5 or 6 tables.  They have mediterranean food and greek food.  I had the Gyro plate with some fries.  The fries were seasoned and served with a flavorful dipping sauce.  The Gyro plate had all the fixins for a gyro but it was unassembled.  I liked putting it together.   All the ingredients were fresh and flavorful.This place offers a great value.  The food is quality eats... something you would expect in a finer establishment with higher prices.  So for a quick serve place and quick serve prices - you get great food, real plates, and great service!Since I live in the general area it was refreshing to find a mom and pop joint mixed in with all of the chain restaurants.(I have been staring at my computer debating whether I should do 4 or 5 stars...)Baladie Cafe is a diamond in the rough, a true winner in a neighborhood that generally suffers from a lack of great cuisine.  Thanks to Jade and my trusted Yelpers for finding this spot.  It's fairly close to my work, and I can't believe I have found it just recently.I have been twice so far, and each time has gotten better.  First time around I had the Greek Platter, which is a fun sampler of a few different Greek foods.  The pita bread can be separated into a pocket for stuffing your samples.  I enjoyed every bit of it!  The second visit I had the Shawerma wrap with added feta cheese and seasoned french fries, ordered spicy of course.  The wrap comes with a thicker pita bread, pre-wrapped with goodness.   It is basically like a gyro, but with hummus instead of Tzatziki sauce.  I have to say, the hummus is friggin killer here.  I much prefer it over the Tzatziki sauce.  In fact, if I were to find one thing that isn't five star about this place, it would be the Tzatziki sauce.  It is just a little bland to me.  The service is friendly and casual.  This family owned business aims to please.  When we went today with some coworkers, we brought our "meat and potatoes" coworker (basically he has the pallet of a 5 year old).  The owner heard us teasing him as we always do, and when he came to our table to ask if everything was good, he joked, "I'm asking him, not you!" He already knows I'm a huge fan, and his concern was to please even the pickiest eater!Baladie Cafe is exactly the kind of restaurant I use Yelp for. A locally owned place most would pass right over, but for the massive number of positive reviews. I was not disappointed by the food. One caveat before my review; I am not knowledgeable about Mediterranean food, so my review is based solely on taste, and nothing on authenticity.You can get pita wraps, kabobs, spanakopita, moussaka, and platters with a mix of food. Wanting to try a bit of everything, I went with the Greek Sampler. It came with:1) Half Greek salad - good flavor on the dressing, but don't expect many toppings.2) Spanakopita - Savory pastry with spinach, quite good3) Moussaka - An eggplant dish, I don't like eggplant but the meat & potatoes were flavorful4) Pita, Gyro meat, Tzatziki sauce - Best Gyro meat I've had, nice taste on the sauce5) Dolmas (2) - Rice & flavoring wrapped in Grape leaves - Soft rice, nice tasteThe highlight of the night had to be the pistachio baklava. Not too sweet, and not too dry. I ordered 2, and almost went back for more they were so good. I'm trying to decide how often I can go back before it gets to be weird.Once you've been once, you can call ahead for your order, but they have very quick service even when you walk in. I will definitely be going back soon to try something else.Baladie Café is what you get when one of the nicest families you will ever meet move to Las Vegas from Algeria and decide to open a Mediterranean place featuring classic dishes from Greece, Lebanon and Egypt prepared in an authentic style that oozes fresh, clean flavors!I was so happy to come by this place thanks to Yelp! I started with a gyro.  It was one of the more balanced gyros I have ever had.  It is not a carnivorous indulging as the typical American version, but what it lacks in quantity of meat it makes up for  again and again in flavor and...wait did I already say balance?...but that is the perfect word!  The perfect amount of fresh veggies, meat, and sauce!  Their gyros come on traditional Arabic flat bread rather than the pita many of us are used to...which allows for a more harmonious experience of ingredients.I also enjoyed their hummus.  I asked for it a little spicy and they added some olive oil soaked, chopped serrano peppers...too perfect for me!  I tried a friend's tabouli salad...it was on point as well.  They know their classics!  Finally, I asked about their falafel....just inquired.  The owner asked if I wanted to try one, had his wife make one fresh, and brought it out.  It was one of the better falafels I have had.  I would certainly order them in the future...especially in a wrap!I almost forgot about the unsweetened mint Ice tea!  Beautiful, traditional, fresh, bright, clean, and tasty.  (I don't normally do sweet teas though, fyi)The location leaves a little to be desired...It is not in a bad area or anything...just in an older strip mall...a little small and basic on the inside.  Perfect for lunch, not what I'm looking for if I'm going out for dinner...oh yeah, closed on Sundays, so fit it in your schedule Monday - Saturday.Well, After seeing this place on Yelp for 2 years, I finally made my way over. I always forget that there is another Greek place in the area, and I will never forget again.This place is absolutely delectable. We had the -Gyro wrap with the spicy sauce addedHerb Fries w/ some kind of herb dipping sauce that was so different but so yummy.AND THE BAKLAVA. The baklava was so good, so light and crispy with a perfect amount of honey.The ONLY thing I feel is lacking - I wish they would put a little more meat in the Gyros. The pita is thin, which I love. But there wasn't a flowing amount of meat, which is what most places do. So maybe I'll just order double meat next time.We walked in for lunch, and the couple that owns the place quickly greeted us and were very friendly. It's just the perfect little ma and pop place tucked away in this little corner. I can't wait to come back here again and it will be my go to place for Greek food in the NW corner of Vegas. Come here and support the small businesses!!I spent two years on a mission in Athens and a little in Thessaloniki.  I rarely find Greek food I really like.This is very good and it is a sweet little place.  little cafe.  Owners are fun with some Mediterranean personality.  Even in Greece, the food differs from shop to shop.  Excellent here.  Baklava to die for, Feta is  (soft and very delicious!).  Their fries with spices are EXCELLENT.  All was great!I would have to say this is one of my favorite Mediterranean/Greek restaurants. We've visited twice so far and both times have been exceptional. He remembered us like we were everyday regulars. Always friendly! Always fast! Always delicious!The hummus has got to be the best in town. I know when I start craving Greek food then we have to come here for the hummus. Great flavor and delicious warm pita bread. Everything we have had here was just fantastic. The gyros, the half chicken plate, the skewers, the salad... Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmmmm. Baklava available for your enjoyment, but I have yet to try it. The drool is dripping down my face right now... They have a great selection on the menu. I never know what I want next, but he is there to offer up suggestions and ask what I like. It's helpful when your an indecisive person (me). It's not the fanciest or most modern joint, but does it really matter when the food is outrageously amazing? No it doesn't. Get your butt down there and get your Greek on.I stopped in for lunch the week before last and enjoyed what I had, so came back a few days ago for lunch to try something else from their menu. I'm amazed that Baladie Café has been able to stay open with the through the changes of the economy as well the shopping center it's located in going through many businesses opening and closing. I remember when this shopping center first opened and what was originally located in the spot Baladie Café is in now. Other places have come and gone, but Baladie Café remains and has toughed it out the longest in this spot. I noticed the bagel bins (they were empty both times I visited) and couldn't help but wonder if they were still there (they are apart of the counter to the right of where you order) from the bagel shop that originated in the spot many years ago. Baladie Café is owned by a older couple who are genuinely friendly and were very willing to explain what some of the menu items were to me. Greek Salad ($3.49 added as side) - This was a tasty salad, but it wasn't like any Greek salad I'm used to. The lettuce mix was crisp and fresh however it was dressed a bit heavier than I prefer in what tasted like Italian dressing. There was just a single cucumber sliver and a single tomato and no olives!  The menu said it had cucumbers, tomatoes and Kalamata olives, so I was bummed by what I received. I don't actually like anything but the Greek Salad at "The Great Geek" over on Warm Springs Rd in Henderson, so anyone who's had that and then has this salad will notice and see the difference. Lamb and Beef Gyro ($5.50) - Don't expect your typical overstuffed gyro here, they look more like long burritos to me. I actually am not a fan of gyros that are so stuffed that they are ridiculous to eat, so I found the longer, skinnier ones here to be portioned better and easy to handle. The gyro was wrapped with foil at both ends and it was convenient to just pull off one piece of foil and the other piece held the bottom together making it easy to hold the gyro in my hand and eat it burrito style. The gyro had tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce. The gyro meat had really nice flavor. I didn't taste any cucumbers in the tzatziki sauce and it honestly just tasted like yogurt, but the way the whole gyro tasted together was really good. I had this on both of my visits and will definitely order it again. Lentil Soup ($3.99 for a cup) - I could see what appeared to be black pepper in the soup, but it lacked some flavor for me. To be fair, I haven't had this soup before trying it here, so I can't base it on anything other than to say I didn't personally care for the taste. Pistachio Baklava ($1.75 a piece) - This is the BEST I have ever had! I usually experience from other places in town that their baklava is too sticky, hard or just plain tough to eat. The baklava here is made from scratch with love by the owner herself and she should be proud! This baklava was sweet without being overly sweet and sticky and it was so wasn't hard at all. It tasted great and the perfect end to my meal! A box of 6 pieces is $10.Walnut Baklava ($1.75 a piece) - When I first opened the package and noticed the honey at the bottom, I thought maybe this one was going to be sticky and tough. It wasn't! It was sweeter than the pistachio I had previously, but it was very good. They have a breakfast menu and serve mint tea, Turkish and Greek coffee. You can eat inside or phone your order in. Baladie Café is open Monday through Friday from 8 am - 8 pm and is closed in Sunday.Two things. 1) Baladie Cafe has the best fries ever and; 2) the husband and wife duo that manage this local gem are some of the most friendly people you'll ever meet.I have loved Baladie's ever since I first ate there. A friend recommended this quaint eatery to us as the closest thing we could get to a German Doner Kabob in Las Vegas. After eating at Baladie's, my husband can confirm this to be true! What I love about Baladie's is that the food is incredibly consistent and more importantly, delicious! The owners are from Algeria and just radiate warmth. The wife cooks up the meals and the husband entertainingly takes orders. On almost every visit, I've witnessed the owners chatting it up with customers like old friends. Sometimes they give out hugs too! I get the gyro without any meat ($5.50) and a side of herb fries ($1.60). The gyro wrap is smallish in size but makes up for that in flavor. It's actually the perfect amount of food. I don't usually get excited about the cucumbers or tomatoes in gyros, but I do when I'm at Baladie's. Don't even get me started on those fries. I have to hold myself back from ordering two orders of the herb fries. The cafe is intimate and located in a pretty desolate shopping center on Lone Mountain and Decatur. The drinks are self-serve. Customers scoop up their own utensils and napkins, but the owners will always check up on you and ask if you enjoyed your meal. Worth a Return Visit?I cannot recommend Baladie Cafe enough, people! It's one of the best places to eat at in North Las Vegas.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #75I stopped in for lunch the other day and was really disappointed. The nice older couple who ran Baladie Café for years were no longer there and the girl behind the counter told me that there are new owners now and they were given the recipes previously used and were trying to make everything the same. My food tasted nothing like I experienced before at Baladie Café. The girl working I have to say was very polite and nice. I have no complaints with her service at all. Inside however was really dirty and had a funky smell. After I placed my order and sat down to wait for it, a guy walked in and after looking at the menu and asking questions about why the prices had gone up and mentioning that the dining area could use some cleaning he decided to walk out and not place an order. I began to feel nervous about my order, but just hoped for the best. Veggie Gyro ($6.99) - The pita didn't taste fresh and was sort of dry. Inside the veggies were pathetic! Before the gyros were long and skinny, but they still had a decent amount of fillings and this one was a joke! I have never seen such a flat gyro. I know I got a veggie and not meat gyro, but before they still stuffed it with plenty of fresh veggies. This time the cucumbers were shaved paper thin and I had only one of those thin cukes inside. The tomatoes were mushy and some of it was just thin pieces of tomato skin. I had to pay an extra .99 cents for feta cheese that was only put on half of the gyro and had a taste to it that wasn't right. I don't think a lot of what was used was fresh at all. The tzatziki sauce tasted like really bland yogurt or sour cream and it was a terrible, terrible, terrible pass for tzatziki sauce. After 2 bites I was done.Seasoned Fries ($1.99) - Yuck! They were so oily and the seasoning was just way too much. Gyros Platter ($9.99) - Lamb and beef, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, tzatziki sauce and 2 pitas. Well, that's what you are supposed yo get! We only got 1 pita (dry and not fresh), 2 of those thin cucumber shavings, tomato shavings, lettuce and tzatziki sauce. The tzatziki sauce was the same as on the gyro and tasted bland and like yogurt or sour cream. The veggies were sad looking and the gyro meat was way too salty. The meat was more like over seasoned beef jerky. Baklava ($2.25) - They should really stick to the old $1.75 a piece price tag because what I had this visit was rock hard and not fresh. A whole box now costs $12. I'm sad because I never had better baklava before than the baklava I had when the other owners were here. After seeing the inside so dirty and the poor of excuse of food they are putting out now here, I can't see returning.I came to this place because of the ratings And it doesn't add up, place is hot, service was slow 25 min waiting for my food, expensive for the amount and quality.Sorry but thats my experience

Japanese Ad featuring Matsui (baseball player) http://youtube.com/watch?v=hIaBeQcZdCMOK Y'all, so I'm not sure why the ratings for this place are so low. This is certainly not 100% equivalent to the ones in Japan, but I keep myself from reviewing sushi places in SF by comparing them to ones in Japan. So.... A lovely warm beef bowl (regular size) sets you back less then $5 here. That, plus a soda, and you're set for a meal and half, if not more. Side order options (not very OG): Macaroni Salad (odd, not an option in japan) Cheesecake Caramel FlanChocolate CakeFrom an excerpt from the Japan Times: "It was delicious," said Tadashi Ishigami, 23, one of the first to mark the return of the dish, downing a bowl at an outlet in Tokyo's Yurakucho district. "I don't care (about the safety of the beef) as long as I can eat it."You see, there was a momentary ban on US Beef (insert joke here) to Japan back in 2006, and GyuDon returned to its glory days in Fall of 2006. But I digress. Sure, they should add curry rice. Sure, they should be open 24 hours and have these orange 'noren'/curtains that welcome you thru the doors. But they don't, and that's okay. Gyu-don of my childhood, available in Rasu Begasu. But not in SF. (-_-) Oh, and yes, the dorktastic part of me spent about 10-15 minutes looking at the black and white photos of yoshinoya shops in the early 1900s. Whenever I drive past one of these.. the old commercial runs thru my head.. Nice to Know Ya, Yoshinoya!I think there's one in San Jose... road trip?Remember: Umai. Hayai. Yasui.(Yummy, Fast, Cheap) http://www.yoshinoya.com/In Japan: Kimchee Beef Bowls are also available. http://www.yoshinoya.com/shop/menu/index.htmlcheck it out.. there's a calorie content sectionShould you be so inclined: available in: The Philippines, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, NYC and thruout SoCal.I finally did it, for Tony T.  I walked to Yoshinoya and got a beef bowl (gyudon) to go.  For whatever reason, the faded building/sign always turned me off, so I expected it to be old and dirty inside.  I already can get cheap gyudon from Japan Creek or just make it at home, so I never saw a reason to come here, though I worked within walking distance for almost 6 years.I spotted Yoshinoya in Japan but never sought it out to eat at one.  The other day, I watched a show called "Fast Foods Gone Global" on Travel Channel, which usually chronicles US chains that infiltrate other countries and make special menus for each country's tastes.  However, this episode was international fast food companies' infiltration into the US, and whether or not menu items were changed for the American palate.Yoshinoya has clearly adjusted its menu to the American palate, but the gyudon is still what gyudon is always - fatty thinly sliced beef cooked with onions in a sauce made with typical Japanese ingredients and served on top of rice, with beni shoga (red pickled ginger) as an accompaniment. I ordered a regular beef bowl (just under $6 with tax, and added beni shoga.  I also sprinkled on some shichimi togarashi and though not traditional, some chopped green onion that was out for miso soup orderers (only because green onions are my favorite vegetable!)The menu otherwise has some odd things (I am not a fan of teriyaki type joints so I do not like the weird vegetables like zucchini in my bowls or stir fries), like vegetables, udon bowls, chicken and combo bowls, and grilled fish - I asked what type of fish and the lady pronounced something weird twice to me that started with an S, a name of a fish I certainly have never heard of in my life and have no idea how to spell...I did notice Yoshinoya now has ponzu sauce (not for the beef bowl but rather the fish).  I liked the to go bowl packaging and the meal stayed hot on my jaunt back to the office to eat.  I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the interior too.  Accepts credit cards for orders over $5.The beef & veggie plate is nostalgic for me...When I was going to OCC I lived off of this stuff. I would buy a large beef bowl & make three meals out of it because I was broke. Every time I have Yoshinoya it takes me back to that time & I think of how far I've come so it's not just about the food but it's also about the memories. This stuff has such a distinct taste & it hasn't changed in years which I love. It's cheap, filling & delicious. The beef is extra thin & I love the flavor! The veggies are a must for me because they are always perfectly cooked & I pour some soy sauce over everything & it doesn't get any better :)There's one location in town which sucks & I'm waiting for the day it comes to the west side :)Worth driving across town for this stuff? My answer is absolutely!

Yowga-ga-boing!Excellent variety of signature burger combinations.  In particular, the one I tried (Desert Heat) was a taste sensation.  You don't find too many places offering both Angus and Kobe.The buns were higher quality than your average burger stand fare.  The produce was nice and fresh.  Crisp lettuce, and the tomato was deep red, not that wilted yellow disc you sometimes get with the other guys.Their beer battered onion-rings were perfectly crunchy and great tasting.  The fries tasted great, although they could have been a little more crisp.Great selection of sodas (including Jones brand), energy drinks, and a unique variety of beers & wine coolers/malt beverages.Trendy and clean upbeat environment.  Friendly staff.  The hostess was a cutie.  The grill guys paid attention to our order (I actually received a medium-rare patty).  The manager even came out and greeted us.Maybe I was there on a good night, but you can bet I'll be back soon to try that seared Ahi burger.In-n-out is good, but not even close to this good.~Swoop

Review Text :
Don't give thanks here.It's been a while since I've posted, but for anyone who can't remember,  see my motto above. And I get even more pissed when it's expensive bad food! So imagine my mood when we left Quiessence yesterday having dropped $171 for 2, (including tax & tip), on a meal that  was certainly worse than what I could make at home.I had the Date & Beet Salad, the Turkey entree, and the Apple Crisp for dessert. Served family style were, greens, Sausage & Onion stuffing, Roasted Carrots & Parsnips, Mashed Potatoes, and a bread basket.I'll start from the beginning with the salad which was OK. Not what you'd expect for the price, but acceptable. The turkey was brined in an over salted liquid with something odd added. It was moist, but I still left slices on my plate the flavor was so odd.The stuffing had very little flavor at all & was dry. The sausage added nothing but meat so  that the vegetarians couldn't eat it. The mashed potatoes were also over salted. The carrots & parsnips were severely undercooked. Hard as rocks. Or maybe they were overcooked & dehydrated, since a few of them were mush. The greens were good. All of the side dishes were left over. There were 3 kinds of bread in the basket; a dry foccacia, corn bread, & a soaked, with oil or butter, corn bread. They all seemed like they were from the previous day, & someone had tried to save them.We all had the Apple Crisp with Cranberry Ice Cream for dessert. It was also OK.  The Crisp was good, but needed lemon juice to cut the sweetness. The ice cream was an Iron Chef moment.  Not a good one. I removed as much as I could & poured a little cream, supplied for the coffee, on my crisp. Oh, for some vanilla Hagen-Dazs!We were tired of counting pennies, and thought we'd splurge. We'd all been to Quiessence before, when there was a different chef. It's a lovely location, but not enough to make up for the food. On the day that I usually give thanks for the bounty of life,  I started planning Thanksgiving dinner for next year.My wife and I spent nearly $300 and were extremely disappointed with the food and the experience. I can't think of a time in a supposedly high-end restaurant when I just wasn't able to finish each course primarily due to the blandness and unoriginality  of the food. 1. The opener was a ceviche that featured a tough, metallic flavored scallop that made both of us wonder if we were going to end up in the ER (we are HUGE ceviche fans :(  2. The sausage entrée was so forgettable that I actually forgot to eat most of the links.3.  The small meatballs with gnocchi from a taste perspective rivaled some of the frozen selections from Trader Joes. Average and forgettable.4. Both desserts were chocolate and were good, but nothing special.5. We noticed that the hostess kept seating customers including ourselves in the back room near the bathroom (which smelled terribly and looked as though it was in need of a cleaning). The maître d' left most of the tables in the best part of the restaurant empty for the majority of the night. No comprendo.6. Our server was friendly, but seemed disinterested and on two occasions plates were slapped down on our tables with no verbal description (where is the passion and interest! This is part of the tasting menu experience!) 7. Timing of the food and wine flight was off. With the exception of the Justin port, the wine selection was average and not a good value.My wife couldn't stop talking about how poor the food was the entire ride home. Not a great way to celebrate our Valentines' Day.Bottom line - this is our second time at Quiesscence and definitely the last time. What an utter disappointment.As you can tell from my profile, I'm not one to write a bad review - if you don't have something nice to say...But I can't stop myself from sharing my experience at Quiessence - especially when considering the price.On our anniversary, I thought it would be great to take her to a high-end spot like Quiessence.  I looked at the reviews (first time social media has let me down), it looked legit, and I set it up without telling her.  I made a reservation, let them know it was our anniversary asking for a nice table and offering to pay a little more if there was something special they could do.  For our near $300, here's what "special" means:- A table by the door. I seriously can't believe they cram a table there, everyone who walked in was basically on our lap.- After taking our drink order, it took 20 minutes before our waiter returned, and with just one of the drinks.- We ordered, received our appetizers in ok time, and then waited another 40 minutes until our meals began coming out (we ordered special courses - big mistake)- Each dish came out somewhere between warm to cold, for sure sitting around-  Even if warm, the quality was not anywhere near the caliber of what a similarly priced meal at any other high-end establishment around town would be.- Tip was included in the bill at over 18%Seriously, unreal, when expressing our disappointment, we received a "sorry."  Even if it was an off night, there's just too much here to ignore. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!This review could easily have been a 5 Star review...easily...except for SALT.  Just about every dish was extremely over salted.  In fact, the waitress said that she gets that same complaint a lot.  I put this at the top of my review for two reasons...1. I hope the chef reads this and starts to understand that he needs to reduce the salt, and 2. so YOU will make sure to tell the waitress you don't want your food over salted.Otherwise...WOW what a great restaurant.  The location is on a farm that grows all the vegetables and most of the items you eat in the restaurant.  The atmosphere is cozy, romantic, wonderful.  The service is excellent, and the servers know their stuff!Your best bet is get the chefs menu with a wine pairing and see what shows up at the table.  There is no better way to eat dinner here.  The presentation was 5*, the variety and freshness of the food was awesome.I really loved the experience, and will be back.Huge waste of our time. I made a reservation and requested a romantic table for two. When we got there the hostess sat us next to a table of 4 ...who were extremely loud. I get that...they were all having fun. We asked to move to a table outside, but was told that they were all reserved.  This wasn't a very big place, but the outside area was very pretty and was lit by candlelight. We sat for maybe 5 min and the hostess came back and gave us a wine list and then....nothing. We waited and waited, hostess came back again and asked if we had questions about the wine list. I said I did, and she said she would try to answer but didn't know much about wine. Hmmmm, ok. Still no server. At that point, we then decided to leave.  Very disappointed for a couple of reasons...1. I would not think it would be so difficult to be acknowledged by a server, after all, they are there to take care of our dining accomadations.2. We were on vacation and this place was very out of the way.  We waisted part of our evening and when vacationing that is the last thing I want to do.3.  Hostess never said..."Is there a problem?"  She saw us leave, we walked right past her.

I can't believe I'm giving a fast food, chicken strip joint five stars!I feel...I feel...good about it. I mean, come on, for just a few cents over six bucks you get This box http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=orF-6gO8zteljlzAFq-OqgFilled with some of the best fried chicken strips (5 strips) I've ever had http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=4wdej6Xl7xL5BL8w3dsEbAPlus fries and Texas toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=K8h0AZmAa9S5SC93VmpVjQAnd Cole slaw and an amazing dipping sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=5OyWMqG6JdeX0AgfE8yNOwAnd this gigantic sweet tea http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=Vhnh9U2Q_Xh9N8aanZf6ZgIn all honesty, Raising Cane's does serve up some of the best tasting chicken strips I've ever had. And definitely the best I've ever had from a fast food joint. Every strip is fresh and prepared after they're ordered. They're super crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle but the best thing is there is zero grease on these strips. The fries were also nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle. The toast, slaw and sauce were all amazing too. Oh, and their sweet tea is perfect. Not overly sweet. Perfect. Prices are dirt cheap and service is fast and friendly. Majors thanks to Dru "DirtySmoke http://www.dirtysmokebbq.com/" C. for putting this place on my radar. You're right, Dru, it was amazing. Check out Raising Cane's for yourself next time you're in Vegas. Trust me, it's worth leaving the strip for.I LOVE CHICKEN FINGERS! I could probably eat them every day of the week! But sadly, that dream is not going to be reality anytime soon!Reading some of my other Vegas Yelp friend's reviews, I bookmarked this place in hopes I could talk Minh into going before we hit up the outlets, which by the way is in the same area as this place!Don't look for anything fancy here; it's just a good ol' drive thru fast food joint. Except when you walk in ::drum roll:: its clean smelling and clean looking! All the employees are actually happy to be working and even greet you! Since we were having a late lunch, we decided to share a meal and went with ordering:The Box Combo:Four Chicken Fingers Fries Coleslaw Cane's Sauce Texas Toast Regular DrinkThere is plenty of seating inside, we found a booth but wasn't 100% clean. Maybe we sat down too quick. An employee was walking by so I asked him if he would not mind cleaning out table. Instead of the rude yeah okay. He was nice about it and even said sorry that the tabletop was not totally clean. Our number was called and Minh went to go get our food. When he got back to the table, the box was huge. The smell was inviting and the taste was the best! The chicken tenders were lightly seasoned and juicy! I had a bite of the coleslaw and that was pretty darn good too! Texas toast was out of this world yummi (I paid dearly for it over the next couple of days since I cannot really eat bread anymore) but it was worth it! Light and buttery this toast was thick!The Cain sauce had an interesting taste; it was a unique and went well with the fries (which were not oily) and the chicken strips!Raising Cane's was built from a dream one guy had. When others turned him down for loan he didn't give up instead he hustled and built his dream on his own. Todd Graves story is amazing along with his dog who the business is named after! I'm hoping that they will bring this urber rad fast food joint to sunny California soon, otherwise this will be on my list of must have again before we go shopping!!!"Hey!"Don't listen to a word I say"Hey!"The screams all sound the same"Hey!""Though the truth may vary"this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore"--------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------It is a chain and the same food is offered here as everywhere else the company operates. We're not here to discuss the food ...Although, I must mention that the coleslaw is close to inedible. You may think the truth may vary on this account; however, you will be finding that you are sorely mistaken. Coleslaw's nasty.What are we here to talk about then if not the food? --------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------ServiceThe service at this Raising Cane's is exceptional for a fast food chain. They are usually so friendly, they might even inch out In-N-Out for friendliest service in this category. They have employees cleaning other patrons' messes (more on that later), bringing patrons their food, retrieving patrons' finished trays, et al. They are truly best in show (ahem, pun intended) when it comes to service to customer. Which leads to ...CustomersI have never met a bigger group of obnoxiously loud, rude, messy people. Not in an elementary school cafeteria will one run into such mayhem. They leave enormous messes on tables, under tables, on seats, under seats, et al. They are the loudest day and night, weekday and weekend. The first time I patronised this location, I imagined it was because teens from a nearby school come here to act like idiots. "Damn, these kids really need to get the fuck out of here" is what I thought. It was not the kids. It is epidemic. It does not matter what time of day I visit. This location consistently has a cockfighting ring aspect to the ambiance in terms of noise and messiness. The employees are running around trying to clean all the preposterous messes left behind; however, it is a losing battle. This location is a lost cause. --------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------I don't expect enough peace and quiet to be able to meditate at any fast food establishment. But, I also don't patronise a restaurant -- fast-food or otherwise -- to acquire a rare headache or feel the urge to stuff tissue in my ears so that the decibel levels can be mitigated. --------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------Pro Tip: Is it necessary to scream at the top of your lungs when your food buddy is sitting right next to you? Shut the fuck up ....--------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------Rating: Three-stars, "A-OK." (Start throwing some of these yokels out.)--------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------Postscript. First hand experiences ... first hand experiences ... I have to slip in more first hand experience accounts for the flaggers. I have walked through the front door of this Raising Cane's during business hours. I have ordered from the counter. I have sat down and eaten my food. (Check the check-ins, fool.)

Review Text :
With a little trepidation... I will leak my new favorite breakfast spot.  Mac's is a nice little neighborhood bar, nice selection of brews on tap, good food of a great variety and excellent staff.  Its location is what helps make it a standout, it is in one of the best strips in all of Phoenix.Book-ended by Tempe's best bookstore and Tempe's most in-touch record store, this is the perfect place to start or finish a weekend morning.  The thing about the breakfast here is that it has two of my favorite qualities:  good and cheap.  Not cheap ingredients, nope.  Apple cider bacon, pecan pancakes, heavy and delicious huevos.  All of their offerings center around 6 bucks.  In Tempe, which is notoriously over priced in the early morning offerings, that is very cheap breakfast.The light enters the room just right in the morning, casting amber hues around the room as you sip coffee, listen to pretty bad music and enjoy your hearty breakfast.  Take a stroll to Trader Joes, buy a few albums at Hoodlums and work up an appetite for Tott's (which is right across the street).About 2 weeks ago I moved into to an apartment complex that is 1/4 mile away from the intersection of Guadalupe and McClintock. At this intersection there is upwards of 10 different dinner choices, the majority of them chain restaurants or fast food. Being of the "shop local Tempe" mindset, I ventured to Macs Broiler & Tap, a mom and pop joint sandwiched between 2 of my favorite places in Tempe: Hoodlums Music and Changing Hands Bookstore. I figured since it was in such good company, I would give it a go. I walked in the door and walked to the (empty) hostess stand where a sign read "Please wait to be seated." Being a good drone, I did just that, I stood there looking for the hostess for a good 3 minutes, waiting to be seated. Finally a girl busing tables looks over at me, apparently confused over why I'm just standing there, and says "You know you can just sit where ever you want." So I go and grab a table, situate myself. And I wait. And I wait some more. About 10 minutes later a waitress comes over to me and tells me that she will be right with me. Five minutes later, she comes back and asks if I would like a menu. At this point, I've now been in the place for about 20 minutes. I wanted to say "Yes, that would be just dandy. I would like a menu so i can order some food, which is the reason why I've been waiting 20 minutes." I bite my tongue and just say "Yes, thank you."The waitress grabs a menu for me, doesn't stick around for me to ask for a drink, and walks away. She returns with a water 5 minutes later, putting it on the table as she walks by, not stopping to ask if I had any questions or want something other than water to drink. By now I've looked at the menu, figured out what I wanted, and wanted to order. I try flagging her down, finally catching her attention, only to get a curt "I'll be there in a moment." She meander's her way over, takes my order, and goes to walk away. I stop her and ask if I can get an iced tea with my meal and the look she gave me had to be akin the one she'd give someone who just demanded her 1st born child, a combination of confusion and incredulity and disbelief. A bit later, she walks by again, nearly drops my iced tea onto the table (she never stopped walking), and continues on her way without a word. Armed with my glass of water and my reluctantly given iced tea, I began the long wait for my order, the Chicken melt sandwich. Continuing what appears to be the M.O. of Mac's, I waited for my sandwich. And I waited. And I waited. Then, get this:  I waited some more. I waited for over 35 minutes for my food, and not once did my waitress come around to see if i needed more water (i did) or more iced tea (I didn't, but could have used a top off on the glass as it's free refills). Just when I was about to flag the waitress down to ask why they didn't pluck, slaughter, and carve up the chicken into the appropriate parts BEFORE I placed my order, a she walks out of the kitchen with a plate in hand and brings a plate to my table, puts it down and walks away barely saying a word. In front of me is my chicken sandwich. There was bread, chicken, bacon, cheese, and tomato's. Beautifully, they got my order correct. The cheese was melted, but kind of cold (as if it had been sitting there waiting for someone to bring it to my table), the bacon was very good. The chicken was a bit dry, but by this time, I was starving. All in all I was there for an hour before I got any food, and when I did finally get it, I was not about to voice a complaint and wait even longer. I understand that Mac's is not a fast food joint, nor was I expecting it to be. However, being "Joe, party of One" in a 1/4 full restaurant, I feel that I can expect to receive my food in WELL  under an hour. Hell, just by being by myself I should be in, fed, paid, and out in under an hour. The waitress never checked to see if the food was OK, never offered me refills on my water or tea, and basically pretended I didn't exist. For a local restaurant situated between two of Tempe's best Local businesses, I expected a lot more. Needless to say, I am sorely disappointed with my experience at Mac's, what with high expectations due to positive reviews on here and from people I know. I never got my waitresses name and was basically treated as a nuisance and not as a paying customer, from the minute I walked in and stood at the empty hostess booth looking like an idiot to the minute I walked out the front door.  Bottom line? I could have gone to Trader Joe's to buy the ingredients, gone home, cooked, ate, and cleaned up in the time I wasted over at Mac's. Will I be returning anytime soon? Probably not.There are a ton of things I like about Mac's:1. The BoozeMac's has a solid variety of beer (drafts, craft and imports), wines by the glass and bottle and specialty drinks. Right now they have a cute menu of Holiday Cocktails including Chocolate Mint Martini, Warm and Fuzzy, Raspberry Hot Chocolate, Irish Coffee, Nutty Irishman Coffee, Keoke Coffee and Hazelnut Martini. 2. The FoodMac's has a wide variety including breakfast, appetizers, lunch, dinner, and desserts.Pretty standard bar food and everything I've ever had was really good. For breakfast there is a pretty standard menu of eggs and such. They also feature a great selection of breakfast cocktails which are all super yum!Appetizers:ChimisChipsWingsSkinsShrimpsFried ZucchiniFor lunch/dinner there is a good variety:SaladsHot/Cold SandwichesBurgersPasta From the Grill:Steak RibsSeafoodFor dessert:Fudge CakeKey Lime PieBrownie Sundae3. The MusicMac's always have the Sirius on Classic Rewind which is pretty great to chill listening to classics. 4. The Hours9:30am - 10:30pm Daily5. The LocationMac's is at the SW corner of McClintock and Guadalupe. It's right by my house, so it's perfect! :)What I don't like about Mac's:1. The ServiceI've never ordered anything that didn't take forever to get, including the check. So, don't ever come in if you're in a hurry. Overall, I 4/5 highly recommend Mac's as a great place to chill and get a drink and some snacks.

Review Text :
Matt (of Matt's Big Breakfast) has opened this swanky-but-comfy bar/restaurant/tavern/ downtown. The building is a beautifully resurrected vintage house -- perfect!Cool place to hang out and relax. Grab a seat (if you can) in your room of choice. There's a giant communal table in the back and an amazingly wallpapered (you'll see) chamber up front. Terrific craft brews and a nice wine list. Haven't tried the food yet, but the menu features a comforting, upscale twist on the normal bar fare. Great reason to hit the downtown stretch on nights other than First Friday.Matt's (of Matt's Big Breakfast) new bar.  Located in a cozy vintage home, this is my new favorite bar.  Handpicked beer and wine selection make this an excellent destination for downtown snobs (not rippin, I tend to be one of those)  Best of all, Matt has jumped on the smoking ban before it even takes effect, this means you can enjoy your beer without having to breathe in all that nasty ass poison you smokers keep pumping into the air.  Seriously, Lesley and I went to a dinner party recently filled with smokers, in a non ventilated home.  Jesus, God, how do you people stand it?!?  Smoking is gross, The Roosevelt is cool.Why are places in Phoenix in buildings that look like abandoned houses?  I swear every time I go there I drive around in circles before I find what I'm looking for.  And they don't have signs.  Whats up with that? Anywho, we made our way over here for the Yelp event and I have to say that I enjoyed it.   Once inside I actually felt like I was back in Boston; slanting floors, doors that aren't quite even, nooks, crannies, crown molding.   Its dark for sure, I could barely read the specials on the board but whatever the $5 wine was, it was good.  Its an interesting hybrid of a lounge and bar which works when you have a diverse group of people.   Despite the fact that it was 100 degrees outside I ordered the tomato soup and grilled cheese.   It was fantastic. Do we get cold rainy days out here?  If we do,remind me to come back here for it.  The soup was a creamy tomato but very yummy.   My husband ordered the Dagwood sandwich, I'm not sure what was in it but it had a lot of meat.  He actually took half of it home! (But they really didn't give him a proper container for it, it was like a hot dog to go container so the sandwich barely fit and leaked in our backseat. Boooo.)   To say its out of the way for me is an understatement but if I was planning a night in Phoenix or heading to a game I would stop in for sure.It pains me to do this, but after recent experiences I feel it's necessary to comment on the Roosevelt.  I would have previously considered myself a loyal patron of the Roosevelt, but after tonight I am done for good.  Let me preface this story by saying that I arrived last night (a Thursday) JUST before a brutal storm hit.  A bunch of us were literally trapped in the Roosevelt as the storm went on outside.  The air conditioning cut off , but eventually the storm subsided and the power came back on.  At that point, I was somewhat happy that I was no longer trapped in a small, sweaty house, so I grabbed a refill and started talking to my friends.  As I was talking, I felt a tap on my shoulder, and I turned around to hear the owner telling me to "be quiet, we can't hear the music," referring to the exceedingly mediocre folk rock act that had started performing in the front area.  Now, I love live music, and I have no problem with giving the performers an appropriate place to play, but after sitting through a storm for an hour and sticking around for some drinks, I would expect to actually be allowed to speak.  Unfortunately, Matt clearly doesn't know a thing about good business or about treating his customers well.  I've been coming into his bar for a year and a half and the guy has never once had the courtesy to say hello to me.  All I've ever gotten from him is a "be quiet."   A guy who doesn't recognize his good customers doesn't deserve to have them at all, and unfortunately for Matt, he won't have this one anymore...I don't know why I even bother trying to go here. Every single time I walk in this place I end up walking right back out. I tried to go there with Mark J TWICE in December and both times we ended up walking out within 120 seconds. Lame!The Roosevelt is either too crowded, or there isn't any seating, or it's filled with hipster douche bags or the service eats a dick.My recent problems with this place include:- Inadequate seating- Huge waste of space/not laid out well- Staff consists of asshats mixed with a few very cool staffers. Most of the chicks who work here are cool, but I encountered several dick tard dudes.- Why is there a security gaurd/rent a cop here at all times? He is nice but it is too creepy for comfort. What is this? The Arizona Mills Mall?- The suckdom ruined my birthday- Mean people giving mean looks hamg out here a lotOn the flipside the beer selection is good and I ate here once a looooooooooooooong time ago and I think I thought it was good. I can't remember because it was so long ago. I'd love to eat here again but I can't seem to tolerate this place for more than a few minues before I stomp on off and out the front door.Do better Roosevelt.As confused as the seating is in this place, the decor, ambiance and product are spot on. Cozy furniture when you get a spot. Extremely delicious bar food. Choice selection of beers and wines. The Roosevelt is a charming place. Spending a hour here can renew your faith in Phx.LOVEI am certainly adding this place to my growing list of favorite downtown bars. The vibe was so spot on, I could probably come here 3 nights a week and not be mad about it. I love the seating, even though it makes absolutely no sense. Comfy couches and chairs big enough for Brad E. and I to share and fit both of our badonkadonks in.. trust me on that.. junk. in. the. trunk.  I ran into Joel L. here also, which is always a pleasure. Apparently the tomato soup and grilled cheese is absolutely phenomenal, and I am craving it more than anything in the entire world right now. The bartender boosted my ego about 63 notches by telling me what a lovely redhead I was, so thank you sir. You are the most wonderful person of the weekend. Their beer list is also killer and the outdoor seating area is big enough for a frat party.I honestly cant wait to come back here. If anyone, I mean, ANYONE is in the mood for The Roosevelt, call a bitch, I am so there.I know some people reaaalllllyyyyyy love The Roosevelt.  I *like* it.The atmosphere is great.  I love the wood throughout, especially in the front of the house.One big table????  This is a pretty popular spot.  There was a fairly large party at the big table and I was meeting at least 4 other people.  There was some space at the end, so we took a seat, and I was inwardly hoping they left soon.  There is definitely room for a small corner table or two in this back room.  Why aren't there any???The food was under the headline "Snacks" and I was a bit scared of that because I was starving and the prices weren't snack prices.  I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup.  Both were excellent.  They use gruyere and fontina cheeses.  The tomato soup tasted fresh and had small basil leaves in it.  It was filling enough for being a "snack".I'm not sure if anyone ordered it, but a bowl of potato chips and two different dips came out after we had eaten.  One of the dips was bleu cheese and DIVINE!The bathroom?  Blech.  It was very cold...not as in temperature, but it did not go with the rest of the place.  It felt institutional.  Plain, white walls with 8 nails in a row on one wall.  Kind of random, since the nails weren't far enough apart to hang anything on them.Service was ok, a bit confusing.  We had two different women serving us and one claimed "This is only my third shift".  Don't tell us that.  Make us think you know what you're doing.The Roosevelt is s-e-x-y, sexy. I can not believe it's taken me this long to write a review of a spot I tend to frequent but after spending, geeez, I dunno, maybe 4 hours here on Saturday night I was just smitten enough to sing full praises. Historic home turned bar, The Roosevelt is dark, romantic and the perfect place to spend hours drinking wine, (by the glass or bottle) or beer (from their fairly extensive beer menu) while getting to know that special someone... or, stop in for a nightcap after dinner or a night out downtown.The Roosevelt offers small plates that are all quite tasty, my favorite being the Bacon wrapped Dates. I love turning people on the wonderful world of dates, and bacon and cheese is the best way to do that. The setup, as mentioned in previous reviews, is awkward. But hey, this was a home that has been converted to a bar and you are sitting in one of the three bedrooms. I'm not really sure how else it could be done without knocking out walls and ruining some of the sexiness....don't do that...I'm a smitten kitten Roosevelt, dare I say, full of smit!I just want to let everyone know that this is not a restaurant. It's more like a bar with snacks. I found this place on yelp because people were raving about their grilled cheese sandwich and creamy tomato soup. They had drink specials this evening and a snack special. A grilled cheese with bacon $4. Since I don't eat shredded swine flesh, I was forced to buy the grilled cheese without the bacon paired with tomato soup ($8) because their policy states that no modification allowed. Not really impressed with the soup and the sandwich was just okay. They use Fontina and Gruyere cheeses on Pullman bread which was edible, but not the best. I guess I've had better though, but I was hungry so I ate it. I gave the soup to my friend 'cause it was too salty. As far as the bar, I didn't really dig it because it was too dark and too loud. They also played this jarring music which made it hard to have a conversation and enjoy the food. I would have given them a higher rating if it weren't for that silly policy and the dark room. It was very hard to eat in the dark.So my friend and I finished our drinks and went over to Bliss where we had a better time.Had 1 drink here once last fall with my business partner after a meeting downtown.  It looked cool from the outside and she had been there before and liked it.  I did not.  The concept is cool -- I love old houses and re-purposed edifices and was stoked to try it.  We walked in and it was kinda dead.  There was 1 group of 4 people in the front room chatting and I felt like we walked into their living room and interrupted a private conversation when we entered.  The bartender saw us walk in and walked out thru the back.  We saddled up to the bar. When she returned she didnt greet us or even acknowledge us and then proceded to throw atttitude when I asked what beers they had.  She couldn't recommend anything.  She poured a crappy beer for me (just dumped it into the glass -- my 3yo niece could give a better pour), and a weak drink for my partner and walked away again. The service blew. The whole experience blew.  Not again, my friend.I must be dreaming, 'cause this place is just too cool. Tucked in side an easy to miss house with a barely noticeable sign even during the day, find yourself sipping down a bottle of your favorite libation or have them pour you a locally brewed craft right out of their ice cold taps. Like many of the stops along Roosevelt in Downtown, The Roosevelt elevates the cool of the area by a factor of ten.After having one too many and falling into a happy stupor, I slipped back tipping myself off the edge of the seat. I must have gotten quite the knock on the head. Waking up dazed, confused, and aimlessly wandering about Roosevelt Row in downtown. That must have just been a weird dream I am awaking from. "How on earth did I arrive here?" and "why am I so hungry?" I wondered. Good thing the Roosevelt is just down the way, I decided to stop in for some of their tasty appetizers to squash this ravenous hunger.  Maybe I'll have their grilled cheese or tasty deviled eggs. mmmm.Time seemed to slip by faster than reality did. Getting up to leave, night turned into day in almost the blink of an eye, and it was a scorcher of a day. The temperature displayed on the electronic board down the street read 109, but my internal thermometer told me that surely it had to be at least 153."Here's my chance", I thought. "This unsuspecting Phoenician strolling my way is my ticket out of this hell." "Excuse me, do you have the time?" I asked interrupting him mid whistle. "I guess" was their response, and as they looked for their pocket watch, I pushed them over quickly grabbing their sun shading umbrella. That guy must have had a little vampire in him, because no sooner than the umbrella began shading me from the streaming rays of sun, did he burst into dust and was whisked away by the scorching winds. All that was left was a pile of dusty clothing and a pair of half scuffed shoes.Suddenly, the ground gave way underneath my feet, opening an endless chasm of despair. I fell into the dark abyss, only to find myself suddenly waking from this crazy dream and on the floor next to my bed. Maybe next weekend I'll go easy on the brew, or maybe I'll wake in a few minutes to the calming sound of ocean waves lapping against a sandy island beach somewhere. Only time will tell. ...Beerception

drunk at kona someone in our group shouts, "LET'S GO SING KARAOKE!!!!!!!!!" it was the best idea of the night, obviously. we called a bunch of karaoke bars and all had the lame response of only on sundays or thursdays. don't they know wednesday nights are where it's at?!?! we finally found this place. and they had karaoke. on wednesdays. they might have it every night. in fact, they should have it every night because that's the only reason to go to this bar. it is really skanky but a freaking blast. the patrons are unattractive but fun to sing with. and that's all that matters when you're trying to rock out to dixie chicks. good times.also, i don't think i'd ever eat here. i dont get the food vibe from this place. i've never had their food but just from hanging out in there i know i wouldn't touch their food. but that's just me i guess.

I come across this hotel many times when I drived by here and I see the food specials on the huge sign.This is my final meal in Las Vegas before heading back to the airport. So I decided to return to the Terrible Casino for their $9.99 specials .i.e. Full rack of Baby Back Pork Ribs.  The special is at this 24-hour diner called the Bougainvillea Cafe; located in the Mezzanie level (one floor above the casino-level). There are a ton of other specials too. But my target was definitely for the Baby Back Ribs specials. For $9.99, I get a full rack of ribs drenched in BBQ sauce, a corn on a cob, a side of mashed potatoes and a toasted sourdough bread. It's not Cattlemen's, Claim Jumper or any of the finer steakhouses version, but it's decent for the price. The rack's end has some dried and burnt pieces and the middle has some moist and juicy meat. The Mashed Potatoes were ok, but the corn on the cob has no comment from me (I didn't eat it).Baby Back ribs: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zWo2a6QPIuC-sSJURJ02Hw?select=YfTx7RS2XOIajziImauY_QMashed Potatoes: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zWo2a6QPIuC-sSJURJ02Hw?select=Ncrz_y20hwY2l4zmi6enUwMy meal was ok for the price. But if you want cheap eats, come here. I may give this diner a second chance and try something else.

Review Text :
NEVER FAILS...Every time I come to Vegas I always eat the Rio Seafood Buffet and I have NOT ONCE been disappointed.  Thank you for staying true to the food lovers =)The hot steaming Alaskan King Crab legs are thick and juicy and the Lobster tails are my fav.  They have a huge selection of Sushi and Sashimi =)I've gotten so good at crackin the crabs the people sitting next to me just stared at me in amazement and said, "Wow you're a pro at this!" which I replied, "I should be I've been coming here for over 5 yrs!"  Seriously I think I'd whoop anyone's ass in a crab leg eating contest.... I got it down.... crack the middle part, slide the meat out nice and long ('that's what she said' haha) and dip in butter and into my tummy all in one quick smooth motion!  OMG I am such a fatty!  hahaha  I love itHow do you give four women simultaneous (food) orgasms?First take them to Vegas.  Then take them to Rio and stick them in a long-ass line, make them watch the same loud, lame show twice (and considering that show starts every hour, that gives you an idea of exactly how long that long-ass line was), and force them to see the same freaking faces all around them as they get hungrier and hungrier and crankier and crankier.  Basically the equivalent of taking them to see the English Patient on a first date.When you have about 30 minutes to go, shake things up a bit by getting two of them hammered off one drink from the casino bar.  (After all, it doesn't take much to get them going if their stomachs are *that* empty. http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/wHN6nbeG3TPvQlEAq1jQKw/l)Get them *just* to the point where they're saying, "goddammit, this better be damn good!" (http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/xg4EfS0b8ZOaYD0xwiBL1w/l)...then let them loose.No foreplay, NO FILLER!!!!!!Get straight to the point and take these women to the CRAB LEGS.  We're not talking costco style, salty-yet-still-bland, cut up the side for easy access crab legs...we're talking succulent, taste-like-they-just-came-out-of-the-wild-Bering Sea amazing morsels of heaven.  Seriously, food has never given me such pure joy.  Pure, pure, unadulterated crustacean-induced happiness.My dearest Village Buffet, you were so memorable, almost 2 months later, I'm still trying to figure out how to quit you.I had never been so happy to get crabs.So happy that I ate 8 huge pieces of crab legs (the equivalent of 4 whole crabs).Ugh. I feel like a dirty whore.If you ENJOY this buffet you needa grow some tastebuds!!REALLY??

I ate seafood. I conquered 4 plates. Tummy full, mission accomplished. I've heard so much about this seafood buffet. On our last day in Vegas we decided to eat here and leave on a good note. We came early, it opens at 4pm...there was a line! It went by pretty quick...we paid our $40 and I was ready to feast on some seafood. You name it...they had it...lobster tails, cocktail shrimps, pasta and shrimp, dungeness crabs, snow crabs, oysters, clams, scallops all cooked in so many different styles.  Plus they had a pretty amazing dessert bar as well. Some of my favorites were the shrimp pasta, mac and cheese lobster and clam chowder soup. Oh and they also have a full bar in the middle, which drinks will cost extra. Here's all that I fit in my belly:Plate 1: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=JHYDJO2tNMjYB2fEXnuPegPlate 2: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=9JeXTsQi-KShdc60TDzt3QPlate 3: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=AmMOM91RYw_ALKAux1l0AAMy clam chowder (YUM): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=j_U5C3Ct-GO6MnVTHk8MugPlate 4: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=2G1cBejfRFBv6BUpviFChAThe buffet was massive and I didn't even try everything...I'll definitely be back when I need to overdose on cholesterol.On the fence about this place! Being a self-proclaimed seafood buffet, I expected a great variety of seafood. There were some, but not a whole lot. I'd say, it's comparable to the other buffets. Plus being a seafood buffet should mean good quality and tasting seafood. I'd say, not to par.Seafood to skip: raw oysters (not fresh; looked frozen and thawed), raw clams (sand), crab legs (mushy), lobster tails (non-existent), any cooked fish (overcooked and tough)Seafood to get: Cold mussels, cooked mussels, cooked clams, scallops, shrimp creoleThe seafood made up of less than 1/4 of the food available. Therefore, it was very misleading to be called a seafood buffet. But once I got past the whole seafood ordeal, the rest was enjoyable. The sashimi was pretty good for a buffet. And their meats and pasta were tasty as well. Best of all was their dessert area. I felt like a kid in a candy store! My eyes widened at all the trays of neatly placed desserts. And can someone please get me that gelato machine?!$38 for a seafood buffet didn't seem bad. But after the meal, that price felt a bit steep. 3.5 stars for food and price. +0.5 for our awesome server!UPDATE- ITS "LOBSTER" NOT LOBSTER!!!!!!Remember in my review I said I found a long leg? Yeah, it wasn't a deformed one and it bothered me. Yeah I know this was a review months ago but I HAD TO figure it out as little shit bothers me. I'm very sad to know they did the switcharoo on us and giving us the cheaper stuff. Yeah looked at lobster fishing laws and yeah, I was right about them not being able to harvest lobsters of a certain size so it got me delving further......and so did more research and the lobsters they serve here are NOT the usual "true"(american or spiny) lobster that we all are thinking of (they used to but not anymore). Look at the pale color and the fact that the flat shaped heads or legs are no where to be found which gives it away as a faux lobster or another suspicion is that it is flown in already "prepped" and possibly fresh frozen since the tails all had different consistencies- one okay one, one dry, on mushy, one chewy...wtf and then I stopped after that.  Its a SQUAT LOBSTER.....a Squat is also called a "langostino". It normally is used in very heavy "yum yum" sauced sushi rolls and as a base to make soups and minced meat seafood products and are rarely used in pure tail form as its flavor and consistency is not as great as it's cousins. I also asked a fisherman who said I was correct in my research. Just thought to put that FYI out there incase people were psyched about All you can eat American/Spiny Lobsters. It's kinda a lobster still, but miles different. It's like the difference between getting KRAB and real Crab.The Seafood buffet inside the Rio hotel is a popular one on the strip. (actually, it is not on the strip, but a block on the other side of Highway 15)It costs $39.95 per person. If the line is really long, you can pay $49.95, or ten dollars more, and get in the express VIP line and get in with little wait. This is what I did, because I was meeting some friends who were here 15 minutes before me because I was running late. (Note: The Las Vegas strip traffic is HORRIBLE on a weekend evening! You might move faster on the SF-Oakland Bay Bridge at 8am, or the I-405 past LAX at 5:30pm)The buffet has a huge selection to choose from, and of course a lot of it is seafood. Their are king crab legs, several types of fish in various styles, shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters, clam chowders (New England and Manhattan), sushi, sashimi, etc. Of course, there are offerings that are not seafood, so the meat lover can get something to fill his/her tummy.A lot os desserts or course, of all sorts. I would caution that you be careful with the shellfish,  as it is sitting under hot lights and if they don't move fast, well, you could get some uncomfortable gurgling deep in your gastro-intestinal tract.  The sushi seemed to move faster, so it seemed ok. Your waiter gets you drinks, and general they are good about refills, because they want their tips from you, so leave one for your server if they are giving you good service.**Summary**When this buffet first came out, I was willing to stand in line for an hour just to eat here. Now, even with the locals 25% off special, I doubt I'd ever come back. The lobster tails went from big and juicy to small and dry. Speaking of dry, that word could be used to describe most of the seafood. A lot of the pictures are a little old and show the buffet at its prime. If you're thinking about eating here, I'd suggest going in and seeing the selection for what it is now.**Price/Hours**       - Mon-Fri 4pm-10pm       - Sat & Sun 3:30pm-10pm       - $44.99 Without Total Rewards Card       - $39.99 With Total Rewards Card       - $33.74 Local With Total Rewards Card (25% off as with all restaurants at Rio)       - I believe each card can carry up to 7 guests       - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=N_a1su82sjnkeRg1dzDnyA**Notes**       - Lobster Tails - With the exception of the sterling brunch at Bally's, this is the only buffet I know that serves lobster tails.       - Before - When this place first opened the lobster tails looked like this: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=QHfhDsVRRPcvMzfGDCoBqg       - Now - Now the lobster tails look like this tiny thing between the clam strips and the scallops: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=AmMOM91RYw_ALKAux1l0AA       - Crab Legs - They have both hot and cold crab legs. They are definitely larger than the crab legs at the Carnival World Buffet. However, the hot crab legs were dry and the cold crab legs...well, are cold.       - Oysters - I grabbed two oysters and I could only eat one. They tasted like they'd gone bad.       - Crawfish - Dry and not fresh.       - Sashimi - They have salmon, white fish, and tuna. The only fresh seafood item I could find (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=T4iokj7Ei9oH2fJ1YpzUdA).       - Prime Rib - I actually never had this here, but it's there.       - Desserts - The desserts are really good. They have a spinning gelato wheel and some of the higher end desserts you'd expect like creme brule.**Recommendations**       - I wouldn't recommend this place at its current condition. If they bring back the quality they use to have, I'd easily pay $50. However, I doubt they will.So heres my take on this place.I've been wanting to eat here for a long time and finally got my chance in Feb when I did the buffet of Buffets. It's $45 per person and you can eat at 7 different buffets within 24hrs. $15 Extra per person if you want to eat here. Great deal if you have the stomach and metabolism. They had alot of fish in many ways from Baja, Italian, Mediterranean, Ect...It was all good but for the price of the buffet you would have thunk they could debone fish right. I don't know how many times I almost spit out the fish so I wouldnt choke or have to be rushed to the emergency room. thats probably the only complaint I had.They had tons of Crab legs, Shrimp and Mussels to choose from. Lox Galore too ;)The "Supposive" lobster tail they had was good but they sure were small, plus they even cut them in half. They more looked like these huge prawns i can get in San Felipe, Mexico. But I loaded up on them anyways. It was mixed with regular shrimp too.The sushi station was great. Tons of Tuna, Salmon and Halibut Sashimi ;) Can't forget the Kimchi.The Gelato Station was AWESOME!!! I could have gone back there for hours. It was all great tasting. If you like Creme Brulee, you have to try theres. Very good. There desserts are way better than alot of the hotels in Vegas.So overall I was pleased with my expierence but dont know if I would go out of my way to come back.The other evening, I felt like Bubba in the Forrest Gump movie, shrimp this and shrimp that, and with so many combinations to choose from, hot, cold, on ice, in a spicy broth, with rice, yada yada yada -- it was all glorious.  Of the 152 (or so) items, I may have tasted 37 of them (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-seafood-buffet-las-vegas?select=jrMXFC66ww1lDR1NsQnyMg#YkaPn9HxhtwF0nqv9uWZKA), and returned again for 5 items, and then again for 2 of my favorites, and again for the same 2 favs, and again for the same 2 favs, until I nearly busted.  Clearly, the best dish was the steamed mix of lobster tails (small 2-3" but who cares, grab 30 of'em) and butterflied large shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-seafood-buffet-las-vegas?select=jrMXFC66ww1lDR1NsQnyMg#ml546xqPEKewFaW1blGmow).  This beats setting out nets to catch on my own, or waking up at 4am to go fishing.  When the last shrimp rolled around for about 3 minutes before I could swallow it, I knew the feast was over for me -- I was clearly out of the contest.With varied stations of seafood (hot and cold), and alternatives (a small bit of Mexican, salads, sushi, and Mediterranean among others), a carving station, etc, Village Seafood Buffet is exactly as it states "seafood", and this is the kind of village I'd like to live in.  The rent is a bit high at $44.95 ($5 off with players card).  But c'mon, you know your a play'a...and it's your turn to take that position over, as I've died and gone to heaven.P.S.  For an extra $11.95, you can add AYCD wine or beer during your dining.PSS.  Don't forget to take the Lobster Mashed Potatoes...it's soooo good!This is my second favorite buffet at the Rio.  In fact, if it wasn't for the variety of seafood options that are not available at most buffets, including lobster, I would not eat here at all.  Reasons?  1) it is very expensive and there is always a really long wait.  2) you don't receive a locals 1/2 price like you do at Carnival World.  3) The food is often just mediocre.  I love lobster but the last time I ate here it was overcooked.  The time before that it was cold.  The vultures eating there are pigs and often spill the drawn butter or make a mess of the lobster area.  Also, often times you have to wait for more to come out.I will say that other than the lobster, the rest of the seafood usually tastes great but the bottom line is, if I am going to pay that much for buffet food, it better be darn good. Otherwise, I could just go to Joe's seafood or something similar and get my lobster prepared much better.My frugal meter died here!  I was with a group of people, and they told me to live a little.  Why the heck did I listen to them?  I was living quite well with my money in my frugal pockets!  Why, oh why did I stay and eat here?  I don't care if I did ride with them here!  I don't care if they are the only buffet with lobster, not worth the price.This pricey eating trough has a variety of eating genres for dinner.  There is an Asian section with sushi and other traditional dishes.  There is a Baja section with fajita this, tortilla that, nacho chips here, and nacho cheese there, to name a few items.  There is a Mediterranean section that has a variety of items, including hummus.  Of course you have to have your carving section with the turkey, ham and high end beef, cut by a chef to your liking.  There are truly many options to this buffet, but the price makes me ill just thinking about it!  Too much for even unlimited.  I realized too late that I was crazy.  For a few dollars more, I should have opted for the 24 hour, 6 buffet option.  This buffet is included in the list.  Had I purchased that, I could have eaten at this buffet at night, rested, ate at another buffet in the morning, did some afternoon activities, then ate at another buffet that afternoon, then rounded off my night with another buffet for hour number 23!  Run-on sentence, yes, but very logical still, frugal glee yes!  You live and you learn.  The food on the buffet is decent enough to do the meal deal.  I don't understand gelato, but there is multiple flavors of that, along with many types of desserts to round off your meal.Do you want to puke out of your mouth and ass at almost the same time?  Then definitely pay the exorbitant price to eat at best mediocre food at the Rio Casino Seafood Buffet!Perhaps I was asking for it because I went around 8:45 - the person at the front assured me that they will continue to bring out food until 9:30.  They did continue to bring out food, but the less popular dishes just sat there, and sat there.I don't understand why people come here.All you can eat lobster?  NOT FOUND.  I think I may have found it, but thought it was crawfish.All you can eat oysters?  NOT FRESH!  Avoid not fresh oyster at all costs.  They say oysters are an afrodisiac but there's nothing sexy in watching someone puke.All you can eat king crab legs?  NOT FOUND.  Seriously, where was this?  I only found snow crab legs.  No king crab found.All you can eat seafood?  Yes, but again not fresh.  I found the seafood was more fresh at the Bachannal buffet at Caesars, although the variety was not as good as here.  But why pay more to eat such crap food?  If you're here strictly for quantity or you're someone who likes to puke after eating a ton of food, I can kind of understand..Even if I didn't get sick, I would not suggest coming here.  Spend the extra to go to Bachannal at Caesars - it's so much better and has enough seafood options to keep you satisfied.  If you did the Buffet of Buffets promotion, it's definitely not worth the extra fee to eat here.So after I became ill, someone suggest that I contact customer service.  I sent them an email telling them that I got food poisoning from their buffet and they replied asking me to call some risk management team and they will open up an investigation.  I would have preferred if they just refunded the extra money I paid as part of their Buffet of Buffets deal.  But calling their number and speaking with them for a mere $10 is not worth the effort.  So Rio, you win.  Take my $10.  I hope my puke and crap somehow clog up your sewage pipes.This is one of the best buffets in Vegas. If your a seafood lover like my husband and I the price you pay is so worth it. They have crab legs, served steamed or cold, lobster tails, raw oysters, crawfish, clams, mussels .... The clam chowder is a must have and of course there's non seafood items too like the beef ribs which is so moist and it falls right off the bone. Here's a Tip: I do recommend stopping by the half price ticket counters that you see on the strip to save $11 at the buffet.For those of you who wants to see what kind of seafood is served at Village Seafood Buffet at Rio. I have recorded an extended steady tour of the whole buffet stations:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYl2MEs5bjIThe Village Seafood Buffet is located at the other end of the casino floor. The lines could get very long between 7 and 8pm. As for me, I got there around 7:30 on a Thursday evening and waited about 20 minutes. The price for dinner was $45, so about $15 more than Carnival World Buffet.There were a lot of seafood options to choose from as you can see from my video.To be honest, I really went there for the AYCE lobster, I was hugely disappointed that it was so freaking tiny (see video). They didn't serve Maine lobster instead they served Rock lobster. If you guys don't know, Rock lobsters come from the Pacific ocean and has no claws, whereas Maine Lobsters come from the East coast with claws. Anyways, I still ate a whole bunch of tiny-halved lobster tails to ensure that I got my money worth.They serve a lot of clams, mussels, and crawfish that are not served at Carnival World Buffet.Overall the food was good not great. I believe this is the only place in Vegas that serve AYCE lobster.Like I said before, to decide if you guys want to eat here, I have recorded a full steady tour of the Village Seafood Buffet for all of you guys to enjoy!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYl2MEs5bjII love coming to this buffet. At first, when my fiance suggested it, I thought it seemed a little pricey, particularly because there is a 4 plate limit. We only pay $30 because we're locals. To the tourists who got sucked into paying $50; dunno what to tell you other than, sucks to be you, I guess. When we got there the first time, there was no line, but in times since, we've waited maybe 15 minutes, at most, and I've waited that long at an Olive Garden before, so in the grand scheme of things, not that bad. You can get soda or water, or for an upcharge you can get bottomless wine or beer.  They boast of lobster tails, and they are quite nice, but to be fair, they are not standard sized lobster tails, they're mini, but still good. In regard to the people complaining of the lobster, I've never been there when they were "mushy" or "stale," and they refill the trays with new batches fairly often.   As for the other treats I enjoyed, they had an amazing salmon dish with a creamy cheese sauce, crab legs, oysters, sushi, shrimp, crab, and a slew of other items. The four plate max was more than enough, as I am uncomfortably full whenever we leave this place. My fiance and I are on a low carb diet so we come here to treat ourselves without getting out of control. I don't give it 5 stars because I still think it's a tad pricey, although we're locals and the food is good, I can get the same, or better quality fish for $25 at an all you can eat sushi restaurant. That being said, we go here about once a month.

Review Text :
I ventured again to the the downtown side of I17.  I have been interested in trying a Pei Wei for quite some time but I thought it would be the one at 67th and 101 for dinner rather than this one for lunch.  Miserable traffic, cramped parking, I drove right by the place.  But none of that is the restaurants fault.I got there at 1PM on a Friday figuring the lunch rush would be clearing.  As I walked up to the order desk I spotted 3 different 2 person tables to choose from.  By the time I got my order placed, no one in front of me, all three were being used and the only one open was next to one occupied by a one pretty woman just over 1/2 my age.  I left my number and went off to fill my iced tea glass and in that 2 minutes she was gone and the table was already cleared for the next guest.  Drat, scared off another one.:-(  Over the next 25 minutes that I was there the dining area did indeed clear out some but not as much as I expected.  Between the open kitchen, the music and all the talking I thought the noise level was pretty high.My meal took about 10 minutes to arrive which I think is about right.  I ordered the limited time offering of Thai mango chicken with white rice ($7.75) and an iced tea (soft drink $1.75).  It actually looked like the picture on the web site.  Slightly spicy on the hot side (about what I expected) but more syrupy on the sweet side than I would like.  Chains seem to like syrupy.  The servers were quick to bring dishes out without letting them sit and were keeping the tables cleaned off.Overall I think it is slightly nicer and slightly more expensive than Panda Express.  I wouldn't balk at going there again if that is what was suggested.  If in the right part of town I would prefer to go to Wok n Stix for about the same overall quality and price, and it is locally owned.I feel odd anytime I review a chain, but this particular location has set a pretty high bar for all other locations and they definitely deserve some props.I have eaten at this location dozens of times throughout the years and have zero complaints. Seriously, not one botched order, rude employee or unhappy dining experience.This past weekend I was partaking in a Rock Band marathon and we needed something in our bellies to keep us fueled up. It was about closing time but they had no problems making our dishes. Our food came out without any issues, piping hot and tasty, as usual. We were offered to-go cups in case we wanted one for the road and because we were the last people there, the extra chocolate chip cookies from the day went home with us, free of charge! Definitely a 5-star experience, every time!Definitely falls into the "what where they thinking?" category. Our  neighborhood Pei Wei - a block from our offices and a weekly favorite for 5 years, has changed to Pei Wei Asian Market - a sort of cheap food court concept, without the mall. Obviously this is a more inexpensive operation to run. Portions are a lot smaller, and about a dollar or two cheaper. Not all bad, but many favorites seem to be gone. Plastic has replaced the restaurant-ware, and not cool custom plastic, but basic restaurant supply take-away stock. No green PR there. The warm, PF-asian decor has been replaced by a basic black and industrial box with so much parking lot glare during lunch that it's hard to select your plastic utensils from the self-serve area. The restaurant is now noisy and the seemingly uncomfortable staff calling out order numbers adds to the din. Now in all fairness, we've tried the restaurant a few times since the reopen. The food was fine every time and the flavors good. Not where I'd go if I was hungry, but the value seemed good. Truly, if this was in the mall, it would likely do fine. Unfortunately it's not. Alas we mourn the loss of our local Pei Wei.

Review Text :
After hearing about this place for a while, I finally got a chance to check it out.  That was Wednesday.  This is Friday and I've been back twice since!! Japanese owned and run, great service - very friendly - but what I care about most is the food.  Here are some highlights from my last three days:- The sushi rice is delicious and very well done.  And the ratio of fish to rice on the nigiri is ideal as many places use too much rice.- Giant clam, still MOVING slightly and topped with a very thin slice of lemon with peel.  Perfect way to start the meal.- I am a devout O-Toro worshipper and they served me the best O-Toro (blue fin tuna belly) I've eaten east of Hawaii.  Melts in your mouth, no need to chew.- Ankimo (monkfish liver) was new for me and is now a new fav.  It's the foie gras of the sea.  Be sure to take a superbite by putting this in your mouth with some of the scallion, pickled daikon and kale at the same time.  Heavenly.- Halibut Fin, OMG, wow.  I've never had the fin before this is incredible.  - Aji (Spanish Mackarel) was delicious and not even slightly fishy.- The hamachi is excellent, top quality fresh fish.  And I appreciated the knife cuts used on top to further tenderize the already very tender fish.  Melts.- I loved, loved, loved the GT-R Roll (Tiger shrimp tempuraand spicy tuna topped with seared albacore, Jalapenos and a spicy aioli.  Garnished with spicy garlic ponzu.)   I don't usually go in for the gimmicky rolls but this spicy one was out of this world.  They finish it off with a BLOW TORCH giving the whole thing a slightly grilled taste.- The Ika ten (squid tempura) was perfectly cooked.  You can dip it in classic tempura sauce or even better: salt and squeeze of fresh lemon.- I saw them butcher the salmon that had just arrived and then they cut me off some of the fatty belly.  Wow.  As good as the best I've had.Good not great:  - I love uni (sea urchin) and this was quite above average but Sen of Japan is still the best I've had anywhere in the world.- Occasionally I've had ikura that doesn't even have the slightest hint of fishiness.  This was not one of them.  But it was good.- I thought the anago (sea water eel) was very good and the friend I was with was raving about it.  - I ordered the Chicken Gizzard (kind of teriyaki-ish) because one of the chefs was telling me that's what he gets when he comes here to drink.  It was awesome, but quite heavy and a bit oily.  Would be perfect while drinking but not as a dish in the middle of a meal of fresh fish!Abalone - Up there with the best I've had east of Hawaii.The miso soup is very good and they serve iced green tea which not all places do.  The prices are quite reasonable considering the high quality.  Also, if you have a special request to eat a certain fish they don't normally carry, just let them know in advance and they will order it if is available.  This is my new go-to sushi joint.  There are a couple other secrets on and off the menu that I'd rather not disclose so they can save them all for me!!!!!  This is 5 stars and I'm not a slut with my 5-star ratings.This place continues to be my at-least-weekly sushi spot.Two weeks ago, on a Tuesday, they shut down the restaurant for the day.  I have gotten to know the sushi chefs there, so when I asked them what happened, they told me that it was because they received a shipment of sub-par tuna that day.  Since so many customers order tuna on any given day (rolls, spicy tuna, etc), they decided it was best to just close for the day rather than try and salvage some of the bad tuna.That is the definition of integrity.  I don't know any other sushi restaurant in town that would sacrifice a day of revenue because of a situation like that.  Definitely not Sushi-Mon or any of the Korean run sushi restaurants in town - no way.  I think that speaks highly of the owner and the importance he puts on consistently serving only the highest quality fish.Other than that, I don't have much of an update.  I continue to order many of my favs I've written about in the past including GT-R roll, hamachi, aji, ika ten.  Lately, they have also been getting in some really fresh moi from Hawaii.  Also, since my last review I have been served some very good uni - as good as any I've had at other places.This place has some of the best sushi I've had in Vegas. I am a REALLY selective person when it comes to where I eat sushi. I only go for the good stuff!! It has to be FRESH and good quality. This place is doing it right!! Their cat's eye roll and kai's roll we sooooooo good. FRESH as anything. My friend also got some of their nigiri and it was perfection. Still- Absolutely some of the best sushi in Vegas. Very impressed!They lose one star because......My only issue was the service. Our server took FOREVER to come to the table and then after taking our orders she NEVER came back again. We had to flag down a random employee just to get the bill. So ridiculous.Conveniently located on S. Durango Dr., on your right hand side, after Twain Ave. in the Parkview Plaza. I got a tip off from a coworker that their Uni is the freshest here and she only dines here for it. So I got curious and my Mom loves Uni.. why not give this place a try.We were kindly greeted by our server, Wanda. Cheerful and direct, she let us know that HH just started and the specials for today. She's very informative and details of each dish was emphasized to the point where I could have envisioned it right before my very own eyes! Our appetite chose the Shima Aji - Striped Jack (specials), Premium Uni from Santa Barbara (specials), Shigoku Oysters (specials), Avocado Roll (HH), Yuzu Salmon (HH), and Yellowtail Jalapeno (HH).My loves:I admit.. all those specials we ordered were FRESH. It felt like we were at sea and they just caught it. Opened, cut it up, and served us ;) Shima Aji had a clean finish.. pure texture as in smooth and rich. If you've been looking for sashimi with no fishy odor/taste and ends with a sweet, calm note.. Shima Aji is the best for Summer! I would order this over and over again. Highly recommend this special while it's around. Premium Uni here could possibly seduce you in falling in love with Uni, itself. Obsessive kind of love. Beautiful presentation. The color of a sliced mango.. deep, deep orange. I get a kick out of the grainy texture that reminded me of a very dry tongue. Say Ahhh!!! Buttery, sweet, and fresh tasting. Surprisingly, it has a hint of floral. It came with a generous amount of 4 pieces of Uni per nigiri order. I was in Uni heaven!!! Layer after layer I was relishing each bite. Definitely order this or you're going to be missing out on something truly pleasurable to your taste buds. So good, sooooooooo GOOD. Yuzu Salmon presentation had bursting, vibrant colors that made the dish so enticing. Nicely sliced and pleasantly clean flavor.Unfortunately, the flash flood warning went off at the restaurant and my phone. So we had to scarf down on our last dishes of Avocado Roll and Yellowtail Jalapeno sashimi. Looking through the window from our comfy booth seating.. those clouds look mean.. destructive mean. I had to ask for the check pronto and told our server, Wanda.. my MINI can't survive any floods.. I have to get going.. and she goes.. then you better go. While the staff yells out thank you.. we took off like ghost rider. This place was packed during Happy Hour (HH) 5p-6p/10p-2a and love the fact that they played some great UFC/MMA fights while enjoying our meal here. My mom was oddly engaged in those matches. Getting my attention with.. Look! Look at this guy get kneed in the ribs!!! I was like what the heck he lost from that?! UFC/MMA sushi action! Naked Fish is as real as it gets for your Sushi needs! Clearly won my heart for Uni Nigiri!!!

Restaurant name  Le's Sandwiches & Cafe
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I finally am catching up with my reviews after making Le's a semi-regular lunch spot, thanks to Tony C's favorable recommendation.  By now, you have read all about the location, tucked away in what looks to be a dying mall in dire need of renovations where even the parking lot is scattered with weeds growing in between the cracks.Despite the rundown setting, Le's Sandwiches & Cafe serves up great sandwiches.  Fresh bread, good veggies and friendly service.  This is probably the most authentic Vietnamese food establishment I've seen in Charlotte.  I always go for the white ham and pate sandwich.  You can order the bread regular or "long" baguette style.  For those of you new to banh mi, the bread is light and crisp, you can choose your meat and all come with pickled daikon and carrot slices, cilantro and peppers - a surprising taste combination that is simply excellent.  (Take the peppers out unless you like really spicy food; they are hot.)The Vietnamese coffee here is just OK, a bit on the pricey side (I'm used to paying $1.50), a little too dark for me (I've had better), but I must urge you all to try this place.  I tried the Bubble Tea (Green Tea Latte with Boba) - well made, but the boba was a tad hard here and there.Still Le's is quite the find and is the only place I go to out here to fix my Banh Mi craving.  And now, I must footnote to say that if you are in So Cal, go to Banh Mi Che Cali for the best sandwich ever. But, at Le's you can just get a glimpse of what a great Vietnamese sandwich is like.If banh mi is done right, it is the indisputable king of food value.  Le's does it right.You can get a filling #6 (grilled pork) sandwich, on a baguette, topped with pickled carrot, radish, and cilantro, for $3.  THREE DOLLARS.  And it's delicious.If you call ahead and order a bunch of sandwiches (for all your friends/workmates/superbowl party platter), they will give you the option of packing the cold veggie toppings separately, so you can assemble them on your own and avoid the bread getting soggy from the veggie juice in transit.Add to that friendly and speedy service, and everybody's a winner.Top notch!Every time I drive around Sugar Creek and Tryon, I think it is time to try Le's Sandwiches and I never stop.  Today I was craving Middle Eastern food, as much as I wanted tabouli, I decided today was the day for bahn mi from Le's. Yes, today is the day!It is everything a foodie, eatee, adventure eater, tourist, you name it, it fills the void.  Off the beaten path- check, inexpensive -check, fresh ingredients -check, friendly service- check, in a shopping center that feels like it's abandoned - check.  A little sketchy, where you see all walks of life- check. A funnel cake vendor in the parking lot-check.  A group of car detailers in the parking lot- check.  A huge Asian market to stock the pantry -items that are a million dollars at Harris Teeter- check. Props to a simple menu, fresh ingedients, made with love and reasonably priced.  Le is the man.I'm so glad I finally went to Le's Sandwich Shop. While it's definitely not in the nicest area of town and the area looks pretty sketch-tastic, the sandwiches are absolutely worth the trip. I don't want to completely echo what all the other reviewers are saying but here's the low down:-Incredibly friendly owner-The sandwiches are $3 each and are damn delicious. -The baguettes are super fresh provide the perfect amount of toasty crisp -The #6 is delightful. Grilled pork, pickled veg, spicy jalapeno, bunches of cilantro, special sauce. Get one. Get two. Get three to go. It is the best bahn mi sammie I've had in a very long time. Even though Le's isn't much to look at, the sandwiches are unearthly good. If this place was closer to home, I'd probably set up a cot and live there.Yes!  Banh Mi  YES!  YEST!  FANTASTIC and this is my fourth meal today in 6 hours, so I'm not even a little hungry!Mr. Le asked me if I had ever been here and when I said no, he said get the #6.  He was correct.  An EXCELLENT choice!  This one is similar to a Banh Mi I have eaten in Union County.  The #6 is a Grilled Pork with lots of Cilantro, carrots, cucumbers, hot peppers, pickled Daikon on a fantastic Roll (I not not know how to spell Baguette).  As I requested: NO Butter!  NO Mayo!Totally Affordable!  Most of the Sandwiches are under $4.00 and they are plenty big unless you are a Wild Boar in Training like me.  I'm thinking about getting Mr. Le to make a Special Sandwich for me and I'll pay him more than he asks!  I know I'm crazy.I'm the only non-Asian person eating or even ordering here, so that is cool!  Some of the patrons asked me how I like it and told me to come back and get a different one each time!  I saw some more choices I bet I would love!First Note:  CASH ONLY!  So remember bring folding $ No Plastic, No Checks, No Monopoly $!No te: Hopefully you will not need a rest room - Le's does not have one and that is all you should know.  If you have to go I suggest you plan ahead and go right before you arrive.  READ C A R E F U L L Y   You do not want to visit the Mall rest rooms... It is probably not safe in any meaning of the word and in no way can I use the word clean because it does not apply!Last NOte:  Today was my first visit to Mr. Le's, though it was my second visit to this Mall - It has been three or four years since I have been here and it was not in good shape then - It has gone from sketchy to approaching scary.  Le's is nice and clean, the Mall he is located in is the opposite!  I recommend as always: beware of your surroundings, travel in a group, act confident (even if you are not) and if you are trained and certified this would be a time not to leave home without "it" (I'm not talkin' AMEX) Le's is Cash only.  I'm not talking about Cousin It either, though Cousin It may be some help here!Le's rocks.  Unfortunately, those rocks end up in the parking lot of the mall.  If I were to put much thought into it, calling this abomination a mall is a real stretch of the imagination, because the only thing that makes it a mall is that there is one big building with some smaller shops inside.But it is definitely worth braving that parking lot, because the place is worth the trip.  The proprietor of Le's actually started the perhaps even sketchier Thanh Huong on Central many years ago, but decided to move on, and now has this sandwich shop, focusing on what he loves: The banh mi.  Several places in Charlotte supposedly offer the simple sandwich, but when you go to order it, they are often out.They say it is because of the bread.  Interestingly, you can actually buy the bread here at Le's for a paltry $0.60 a loaf.  Regardless, do yourself a favor and order a couple extra.  One for the ride home, one for after you get home, whatever.  That way you do not have to take a few hundred miles off the undercarriage of your car by braving the parking lot when you crave another of those awesome sandwiches.And make sure you get one of the pressed sugar cane drinks too.  It complements the heat of the sandwich nicely, is something you cannot find anywhere else that I know about and is not nearly as sweet as you would think pressed sugar cane to taste.Wanna feel like you're taping your own episode of Anthony Bourdain's 'No Reservations' in Charlotte?  Let's rundown your checklist as we head over to Le's:1.  You, the pious foodie, makes a pilgrimage to a part of town not showcased in the city's tourism materials, where you will be greatly outnumbered by people you never knew inhabited said city speaking a language that you cannot begin to decipher.  CHECK.2.  In search of ethnic cuisine that is either hard to find or lacks authenticity at the more "main stream" food establishments.  CHECK.3.  In a place that, upon first encounter, has you thinking, "There's no way this can be sanitary!"  CHECK.4.  And, after throwing all caution aside, you dig in and find mastery in the most unlikeliest of places.  Nirvana ensues.  CHECK CHECK.That is a trip to Le's and if the above appeals to you at all (along with the Viet-French fusion that is the banh mi sandwich) this is a must for Charlotte adventurers.  No big menus, no table-side service, no inkling this place even exists until you walk thru the rundown bomb-shelter of a mall and stumble upon this bustling corner shop.  Blind trust is finally rewarded.Le's does one thing only and one thing well: the banh mi sandwich.  The freshest of French baguette- crisp on the outside, creamy smooth inside- kept warm till serving time.  The heat of fresh jalapeno and the fresh earthiness of cilantro.  Pickled vegetables layered in between.  Sounding good?   At less than $4.00 a piece, you'll likely find yourself wanting more than one,  but bring your Benjamin's, no plastic accepted here. As Anthony quips, "What can I say, I happen to be an aficionado of the dive bar."  Le's fits that bill and is proof that just because it's a dive does not mean it can't also be a little piece of heaven.Equal parts adventure, experience, culinary safari, near scrapes with overtly life-threatening conditions for any vehicle, and personality. Goodness gracious. I've loved Banh Mi for years, but Le's has sparked a fire-y passion in my little Vietnamese cuisine-loving heart. Made it in on a Sunday afternoon, it was packed, and we were amongst tons of regulars. It was a great. My being green around the gills was easy to spot all the way from the cratered parking lot. Follow instructions on every other review you'll read here. Asian Corner, walk down the (awesomely dirty and strongly loved) hallway, hang a right, and get ready for a sandwich worth it's weight in gold. Now, there are tons of options. I wanted to swing for a grand slam of "Wow! I've never even heard of that!" but decided not to vie with au originale. #6 on a long baguette, please. It was....so good it rendered me speechless and with a face full of fantastically balanced Banh Mi. The bread.....my dear, sweet....it was perfect. So crunchycrispy, soft interior, slight chew. What kind of delicious sorcery made this bread?!?! Just absolutely perfect. The veggie combo -- standard pickle-y carrots, onions, and jalapenos. The pork. I've been missing out on this the entire time I've lived in Charlotte until now. One bite and you'll be a believer. (I've been told to call an audible and add paté to the #6. Next time: Done.) Oh, and much like the aforementioned, suckers are like $3 a pop. I'm a believer. Addict. Cheerleader. Wondrously and deliriously complete now that I've experienced Le's. If you're reading this, Owner/Management/Sandwich Artist, please accept my humble Thank You for all that you do.This is one of my go-to spots. You literally can not go wrong with Le's. I have been here well-over a dozen times and have NEVER had a bad experience. I've even recruited several people who are now die-hard fans of Le's. If you are looking for a delicious banh mi then this is your place. The freshness of the ingredients and crunchy deliciousness of the bread are unmatched. I know that other places claim to have banh mis that are good but to me they just aren't as simple and delicious as what Le's offers. Let me also point out...Le's Sandwiches are a proven hangover cure in my opinion! All for less than $4!To be fair I can not comment on anything other than #6 (the grilled pork banh mi). Don't blame me though, I found what I liked and stuck with it! There are several sandwiches though to suit the pallet of any banh mi fan; I simply prefer the classic.One could not write a review about Le's Sandwiches without commenting on the ambience. Le's Sandwiches is certainly off the beaten path and is tucked away in the Asian Mall off of N Tryon which at times looks like it was abandoned in the late 70's. Don't let the scenery fool you though. Le's Sandwiches is impeccably clean and well-kept. After enjoying a sandwich at Le's be sure to check out one of the Asian markets in the same area. Great stuff and one of the cheapest places I've found Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce!This is what Yelp is all about. Never in a million a years would I have ever found this spot... or even attempted to go here without reading the reviews.I used to drive past this place all the time. I had no clue there were even businesses operating in this rundown shopping center. So I braved the parking lot, knocked the alignment out of my car probably 10 times. And it was all worth it.For the newbies, here are some important things to know:-You can't see Le's from the parking lot. You have to get out of your car and go inside the mall. Go past the Dollar Store at the second Asian Mall entrance. Walk through the hallway. It is on the right.-Cash only-They close at 6-Seriously, the parking lot looks like a serious of bombs went off in it. Be careful driving through it.As for the food, I knew right off the bat that I wanted the #6 grilled pork banh mi. With the prices so cheap and the fact that I survived the parking lot, I knew I wanted to order another one for later. While staring at the menu trying to decide, the super nice man behind the counter suggested the #8 BBQ pork. Oh man, delicious. The bread, the pickled veggies, the meat... both sandwiches were just fantastic. The #8 wins for me.Two giant sandwiches... just eight bucks. You can't beat that.Thank you Yelpers for introducing me to this small slice of Vietnamese sandwich heaven. Can't wait to go back and try the sugar cane juice!Wow...what an interesting experience. I knew the food had to be good if people are willing to traverse such treacherous terrain for a sandwich. I had to swerve around craters, I mean potholes, in the parking lot and then walk through what appeared to be an abandoned mall in a third world country to reach the restaurant.Once inside, I felt a sense of relief. The restaurant was clean and the staff were very friendly. I had the #6: a pork sandwich with pickled veggies and fresh cilantro for $3.75. OMG, what a great deal. The sandwich was simple, fresh and delicious for under four bucks. They must be making their money on sodas. My can of coke was $1. But I can't complain, the meal is the best value I've gotten for lunch in years. This place takes hole-in-the-wall to a whole new level and I love it! It's cash only and most people order take-out.  Add this place to your list. The food is fresh and fabulous.

I was supposed to meet my friend next door at Capriotti's Sandwich Shop.  When I arrived, he wanted Johnny Rocket's instead.  I had read all about Capriott's on Yelp, so I was excited to try it.  I begrudgingly agreed to eat at Johnny Rocket's, but it turned out to be a great meal and experience.The staff were super friendly at Johnny Rocket's.  Especially the girl with the big blue eyes.  She answered all of my many questions that I had because I hadn't been to Johnny Rocket's often.  She filled me on their new food items that I was totally unfamiliar with.  After talking to her, I decided on the Philly Cheesesteak with fries.  It was super tasty, and I was glad to have ordered it.  It turned out to be an unexpectedly excellent meal.It honestly felt weird to be on vacation at a place like Las Vegas with a million restaurants around and eating at Johnny Rockets.  However, I was glad that I did.  I had a great experience and would not mind coming here again the next time I am in the area.Our group got hungry so with the lack of planning, we decided to just go across the street to Johnny Rockets.FOOD - 1 Star: I ordered:- Chili Cheese Fries: These were ok. They were really heavy on the chili and the cheese was barely there. It would've been way better to actually have the cheese on the top instead of under the chili.- Sweet Potato Bacon Cheese Fries: I enjoyed the sweet potato fries myself, but the cheese... if you can call it that... was pretty disgusting. I don't know why they couldn't use real cheese. Instead they used some liquid cheese that you'd find at the movie theater and so it had this weird taste to it. The only thing that kind of saved it was the bacon, but even that was overpowered by the liquid cheese. This ruined my appetite and I had to eat around the cheese, which was almost impossible since it was all over the place.- Smoke House Single Burger: This was pretty good, but smaller than I thought it would be. Maybe I don't come here often enough, but the burger was small. The taste was spot on. You can't go wrong with a meat patty, cheese, onion rings, and bacon.SERVICE - 2 Stars: The staff was friendly, but literally only approached us to drop off the menus and to deliver food. No one checked on us at all during the meal. I need an extra fork and literally had to flag someone down to get it.ATMOSPHERE - 2 Stars: It's your typical Johnny Rocket's setup and my biggest issue with the place was the fact there was no soap in the restroom. I'm glad we had hand sanitizer with us, but that's just gross.RECOMMENDATION: Overall, I'd say you can skip this place. Go to Capriotti's or Joe's Pizza in the same shopping center instead. You'll get way better food for the money you're paying.Shut the front door batman! Damn this is one tasty burger! It is a bit pricy to be honest. The food is amazing! Fries are fresh, and molten hot! It is super cute in here too, like the diners my G parents would take me to when I was a kid. So yes I am a fan of Johnny Rockets.

Sauce has grown on me... particularly this location since this is the one I frequently end up at for a quick lunch or casual dinner spot near home.I typically order chopped salads at lunch.  The chopped turkey & feta salad is what I had today.  I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch... fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town.  I also like the spinach, pancetta & goat cheese and the veggie & aged parmesan salads.  My husband eats at Sauce often as well... he goes for a salad or sandwich.  Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto & mozzarella panini.  I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.  The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.  Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal... What I like about Sauce the most? Fast, friendly, and efficient service in a clean and casual environment.  The moderate pricing is also a big plus in my book... especially in this economy.I'm still a fan of Sauce and I'm not lowering any stars, but I will say that the changes they have made to the Caprese Salad are not so much to my liking. It used to be my favorite salad and I would crave it. However, I've now had the new version of the Caprese Salad and it's just not like it was. The mozzarella overtakes the salad and the croutons (while tasty) are too fatty for the salad. Mozzarella is definitely the most overpowering ingredient and there aren't a ton of tomatoes. It's still tastes ok, but it's not the same. So, I will continue to hope they bring the old one back!

Just got home from Opa and already writing a review... for a reason.  I don't appreciate the way I was treated this evening.  I came into Opa after purchasing a Groupon back in November.  After leaving a 12-hour day at work I had forgotten to print the Groupon, but of course I still pulled it up on my phone.  When the waiter came over to get the Groupon information he had another girl help him out... I handed the girl my Blackberry after pressing "Use Groupon" and the screen came up with a bar code and code written underneath.  The girl held my phone for a good minute and said "I don't know what happened, it just went back to the main screen."  My Groupon had been marked as used, which is what she intended to do... Then she told me she needed proof that it was marked as used this evening.  I went back to the "redeemed" Groupons and showed her, but of course there was no date next to it.  After explaining to her that she had hit marked as used and I had brought up the bar code for her she refused to take it, and walked behind the bar to make drinks for another table.  When I turned around and looked at her she was defensively bitching to the staff about me as if I had been rude, when all I was trying to do was show her the "redeemed" Groupons that I had.  I finally told them to forget it that we would pay full price and I would take it up with Groupon tomorrow to get my money back.  What a hassle after such a LONG day.  You'd think after all that they would at least comp us a dessert or glass of wine.    SO: 2 glasses of house wine, which were less than mediocre.. a "combination plate" which was also less than mediocre, and a plate of lamb and potatos... which was also less than mediocre.  I would not rave about one thing about this place, I didn't enjoy a second of it.  (Not to mention, all of these less than mediocre items cost us a total of $75... I wouldn't have paid $30 for this awful experience) On top of the less than mediocre food, the waitress that was bitching about me and my Groupon circled our table, wouldn't make eye contact with me or my boyfriend, and had an awful look on her face.  Because of the Groupon situation she didn't refill our water until after our plates had been cleared!   I felt as if I was being mistreated and accused of LYING and trying to use a Groupon twice.  I wouldn't even go back to this place if they offered me a free meal because of this stupid situation.  The dinner was uncomfortable for the entire hour we were there and it wasn't even good.  Then right before we got the bill this awkward belly dancer came to our table and danced for us... Not gonna lie, she was also less than mediocre. AWFUL. AWKWARD. UNCOMFORTABLE. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!Opa is always a great experience including this last recent 3rd visit for dinner with friends.Belly Dancer...Live music...Great food...Fun atmosphere...We ate a lot this visit as we had a party of 12 (6 couples) this time.What we ordered...Tzatziki- A creamy yogurt-cucumber-garlic spread flavored with lemon & pepper.Saganaki-"OPA's Famous Flaming Saganaki" baked kefalograviera cheese.Dolmades-Grape leaves stuffed with rice, ground meat & herbs.Calamari-Tender Squid Lightly breaded and pan fried served with zesty cocktail sauce.Horiatiki Village Salad-Tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, bell peppers, feta cheese & greek olives.Gyros Plate-Slices of beef & lamb seasoned with herbs and spices.Baklava-Greek dessert of honey,& nuts all blended together in delicious filo pastry layers.Bottle of red wine.Long island iced tea, nice and stiff!

Review Text :
I ma having a continued, ridiculous love affair with Bevier Cafe.  You see, I have a class from 11-12 in Bevier Hall, and the cafe itself is exactly one floor below my classroom.  Did I mention I get out at noon?  When lunch is served?  Yeah, you do the math.It's a damn good thing that B.C. is relatively cheap ($4.50 for a major entree, or sandwich), or I'd be broke and panhandling in front of the place at this rate.  The Food Service students run a fantastic local cafe that helps them get hands on experience and gets me lunch time eatin' on the cheap.  There's always a vegetable side, some mouthwatering dessert, and the space is cheery and pleasant if a bit utilitarian.  Bevier's well worth the visit.  That said, it's basically cafeteria style in that you pick up a tray, select your food options, add on bread, dessert, drinks, etc, then pay for your meal.  They'll give you a number, and a smiling food service student will bring you your food--often eerily promptly.  Now, my only request is that you don't crowd up the place when i come charging in all hungry like.  Cuz that's not cool.But go check out the cafe, with a fantastic array of food orders (and a daily changing menu!), you're bound to be satisfied.

Some of you will look at this review and wonder has she lost her mind giving 5 stars to a fast food faux asian restaurant?  No, I'm perfectly sane as I write this.  I have been to Pei Wei many times over the last year.  Is it authentic?  No.  Is it tasty?  Yes. Is it easy on the wallet?  Yes. Are there healthy options?  Yes. Does my daughter like it?  Yes! I have enjoyed many different dishes here.  Rice bowls, noodle bowls, kung pao, pad thai and everything has been good and I was satisfied. I have always had good service at this location too.  The staff is friendly and accomadating, even on a super busy night. I love that you can get brown rice too.  My daughter and I can eat here for under $20.  That's pretty good for a decent meal.  All these things combined make me want to give Pei Wei 5 stars.  But more than that, my daughter loves their Lo Mein and she will eat every last bite almost every time!  I know what I'm getting when I walk in and I know it will be good.  Authentic or not, I still love Pei Wei!

If you are a fan of pulled pork or mac n cheese that probably has 10,000 calories in it then this is the spot for you.....and me! OMG, I found this place years ago and have actually celebrated a birthday or two, here. It's absolutely charming in every way. TC's is a hole in the wall decorated like your grandma's house with family pictures, place mats and friendly faces. If you are lucky you just might get to meet TC while you are here! I always get the pulled pork because it never let's me down. It's tender, juicy and shredded to the perfect consistency. You are responsible for putting the amount of BBQ sauce you like on your meat. I also always get the mac n cheese that is to die for. Don't leave out the fried okra, ribs, grilled chicken salad, sweet potato fries, etc. You can wash it all down with sweet tea or Kool Aide. Dessert is not to be missed. At the top of that list is the banana pudding and glazed donut bread pudding. Yes, that just happened! Every single person I have brought to TC's has been back and brought their friends, too! They get the five stars because they are reasonably priced, delicious food, and most excellent service. I love this place!!!!!YOU AIN'T GOT SOUL IF YOU DON'T LIKE TC's!  This place is the real deal Soul kitchen.  I had a little of everything, and took to go what I couldn't finish -- and oh baby, that ain't no problem!I had the baby back ribs, beans, collard greens, mac & cheese (unreal!), and sweet potato pie.  Each was so very good, and at a very fair price.  Excellent service by super nice and friendly gals (special shout out to NicNic and Ducky!).It's a casual place in a mini-mall, but with cute and authentic southern decor.  For a west-coast guy, I no longer felt like I was in Vegas, or back in LA where I live -- this transported me...and I loved it.Oh yes, I'll be back, and I'm bringing ziplocs.Heard of this place through Groupon- they also have Yelp deals and other discount offers available, if you're thinking of going. But I'd like to dissuade you from doing so.For starters, service from the owner is dismal-stopped by last week to use my deal and he was arguing with another Groupon customer, loudly and unprofessionally. I wouldn't have gone back without my discount.The meat here is of such low quality, it's embarrassing. The pulled pork was so shredded that it nearly looked ground and the only flavor came from the sauce. Ribs were mediocre, and for a place named after their ribs this is unacceptable- low quality, not particularly meaty or flavorful, and a bit too charred.The brisket though. As a Texas girl, I know brisket about as well as I know my own grandmother. And I don't know what the hell they're serving here. Meat is not fresh and is cut so thinly that it appears to be prepackaged. Little to no flavor, this is not brisket. I was so, so disappointed.We left more than half of our food on our plates, paid, and left. Owner was half asleep in a booth at the back of the dining room and did not address us at all, despite being the only customers and clearly having an issue with their product.Don't go here- they don't care about their customers or their product. There's a reason they have a million discount deals up and NO customers. Barbecue sauce was tasty, but there's nothing here to put it on worth eating.I should have payed attention to all the warning signs and ran away.  In a strip mall strike one when it comes to bbq. No smoke smell whatsoever.  Strike 2. 1st plate came out fully sauced.  Strike 3. I should have been out of there.  But I had a Groupon.  SighOrdered 3 meat plate with ribs, rib tips and brisket. Came out all sauced and brisket chopped. This is a good way to hide bad bbq. I asked if the sliced brisket and they tried to to tell me it was.  Please sell this to someone who is clueless not someone who had reviewed 30 plus bbq restaurants from great to awful.Finally got my plate and was really unimpressed.  Everything was lackluster.  Rib tips sigh, ribs sigh and the pulled pork okay. It all needed the sauce.  Not good for a bbq place.  No smoke ring or Smokey flavor. I almost doubt there is a smoker on the premises.  Not sure outside of the sauce I would even call this bbq. The sides mac and cheese and baked beans were better than the meats but still not awesone. The one thing that earned this place a second star was the 1 dollar banana pudding. This is worth a stop just for dessert.  As I would never go here for any other reason.  The banana pudding itself earned this place the second star. I would not recommend stopping here of you like good bbq whatsoever.Items Ordered:Sliced Brisket, Pulled Pork, Spare Ribs, CornbreadMac n' CheeseSweet Potato FriesBiscuit"New Orleans" French Toast with Sliced BananasBanana PuddingRed Velvet CakePralineLocated near Norm's Eggs Café in a strip mall off South Durango and featuring "World Famous" ribs with awards in 2007 and 2010 for the city's best barbeque it was with tempered expectations that I entered TC's Rib Crib and although I will say the Motown soundtrack and service were quite pleasant as I watched the Buckeyes obliterate Kent State, little else of my experience was even remotely good - a small, buttery biscuit and a jumbo praline the lone exception.  Obviously the sort of place willing to cut corners as condiments include Aunt Jemima and 'honey' cut with glucose syrup and starch it was in a wide selection of meats, sides, and sweets that I invested and although costs were quite low for most items, so too was the quality - the ribs clearly parboiled without a note of smoke while thinly sliced brisket and pulled pork were nearly indistinguishable beneath artificially saccharine sauce.  Mostly ignoring bland elbow noodles from which I consumed only a few bites and fries that arrived almost at meal's end as well as the $4.50 French Toast was flat and flavorless even with the $1.50 banana and whipped cream upgrade...the latter not supplied as they were apparently 'out'...and moving on to dessert, suffice it to say that the boxed vanilla pudding with only a hint of banana beneath 'nilla wafers is not worth $5.99 and although the frosting on a tiny sliver of red velvet cake was tangy and smooth the cake was so dry it literally crumbled to fork pressure - the majority of it joining nearly half the rest of my order in a waste basket when servers were otherwise occupied so as not to offend.Literally the only patron present just past noon on a Saturday it is shocking to me that a business like TC's can sustain and as much as I try to support locals I cannot fathom a reason to return, particularly given a pricepoint higher than Rollin' Smoke despite quality on par with Famous Dave's.Home cooked BBQ...Maybe I shouldn't be writing this tonight because I'm in not the best of moods & sick but some of my taste buds still work. We had some serious highs here & some serious lows.This is a little place and feels very cozy which I always appreciate. The art & signs on the walls are a great touch. The staff is very nice & and the prices are ok. The meat was great, nice pulled pork and chicken which come in the house BBQ sauce which is sweet with a little kick (this I enjoyed). The baby back ribs were very moist but they were really fatty and I am not a big fan of my meat surrounded by fat. This may sound bad but it's true. The sides we chose were onion rings (fantastic), Mac & cheese (bland :( ), sweet potato fries (awesome) and baked beans (bland). I'm always looking for some bacon, onions or sausage bits in baked beans. The sweet teas were the serious low tonight because it was like drinking straight sugar. We had to ask for some non sweet teas to find our balance. The highest point tonight was the incredible lemon cake. Very homemade and moist, sweet, tart with perfect frosting. The last bite was very memorable so I'm thrilled about that! Overall it was good and as mentioned we love home cooked meals and this felt like one. I'm sick today so my taste buds are off but I can still taste bold flavors. I forgot to mention the cornbread. It was dry :( Some tweaks and this place can have it all.

Four stars for service rendered by Marketplace employee Rene, who helped answer questions regarding my food issues (allergies) and info regarding breakfast/brunch, lunch, and dinner options/times, and also provided gelato samples, including his favorite, Guiness gelato!  Mmm... guiness gelato...If you haven't already done so, do try the German chocolate cake, peanut butter cup, and, of course, the Guiness gelato flavors.  All gelatos are made in-house w/ all-natural ingredients, I'm told.  (I really need to double-check w/ the one who prepares them.)  3 scoops offer the best value ($4.50).  I also bought oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip  cookies ($1.50 each) from the bakery.  I'd skip on the oatmeal cookie as it didn't really taste like oatmeal at all, although the raisins were large and lent so much creamy sweetness to the cookie!  It did contain *, w/c I've an allergy to, so that may have turned me off of the cookie fast!  (1/22/09 update: I was so lethargic at work yesterday, and was literally tripping over my feet walking w/ people asking me if I'm alright all day, and I didn't know why.  I finally figured out why- it was my body's reaction to the * I'd consumed from the cookie!!  Geez!  Sometimes I really, really, really hate having these food allergies!)  OK, back to the review...The chocolate chip, however, was delightful!  Different kinds of chocolate chips in this one, and I loved both the gooey and crunchy textures this cookie provided. I got all excited when I read "cookie sandwich ($3)," on the menu, as I thought it meant an ice cream cookie sandwich, in w/c case the Guiness would've been perfect nestled in between two oatmeal cookies.  That is, before I found out that I didn't really care for the cookie, in w/c case, chocolate chip would be the best option, BUT "cookie sandwich" really denotes peanut butter slapped in between two cookies, and the marketplace was out of peanut butter at 4p, so no cookie sandwich for me.  No worries, since what I really wanted a gelato sandwich!  Ooh, boy, I was really jonesing for a Pot Belly ice cream sandwich then!!I'll definitely be back very soon to try other menu selections.  Patio dining sounds wonderful (I'm told there are couches out there!), but dining outside isn't really all that appealing to me since I do not enjoy breathing in tobacco smoke, and after seeing how dusty and insect-crusted the patio tables were on the marketplace side, I'd definitely be averse to the idea.Dined at Olive and Ivy last Friday night (very romantical date I might add). Our reservation was at 8:30pm, we arrived about 30 minutes early and they were able to seat us right away. It was cougar central in there so I held my date close because he's a few years my junior.... they were eying us like prize winning hogs, or a coupon for 1/2 price Restylane injections. It was insane. I mean people were noticeably discussing our arrival. These women were not even trying to hide the shit talking. So, mad props "geriatric mafia" at the bar. Don't hate!The wine alone is what warrants 3 stars. Two words: Arizona Stronghold. High five for the local support. As far as dinner goes, we ordered the Seared Scallops and Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin with side orders of Mascarpone Polenta and Roasted Mushrooms. My date and I happen to enjoy small plate dining and the server was nice enough to split everything up for us so we didn't have to feed each other. The food was...... get ready for it......... okay.Yes, just okay. The quality of the ingredients were phenomenal but flavor wise it just didn't deliver. Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything horrible to say but sorry, not having something bad to say just isn't good enough for a $170.00 dining experience. I will probably go back and give it another shot at some point. I'm really glad I went with my gut instinct and didn't order the Filet because I am a total fucking steak snob. I have a feeling this review would have read something completely different and dropped in rating. Maybe brunch?P.S. The chocolate martini was sex in a glass....... like actual sex..... in a glass. You figure it out.  :)I cannot believe I haven't reviewed Olive & Ivy yet... I've been numerous times for brunch, lunch, and dinner too!After True Food Kitchen, Olive & Ivy is my next favorite Sam Fox concept... they offer something for everyone no matter what time of day you stop by.  Grab a coffee, breakfast, or snack anytime from the marketplace or sit down to a more leisurely meal on the restaurant side.  They offer a delicious complimentary focaccia with pesto sauce during lunch and dinner... and I've had their Mediterranean greek salad with shrimp on multiple occasions for lunch.  I've also enjoyed a fantastic omelette at Sunday brunch - (yes - they will do egg whites) and fresh fish for dinner if I recall correctly too.  In addition, O&I offers a delicious flatbread selection (great for sharing) as well as a fantastic wine list.Olive & Ivy seems to always have some kind of crowd, so depending on the size of your group, you may want to call ahead.Tammar P and I had no problem getting a table when we met for a late lunch today.  We both went with the Greek salad (she with chicken and me with shrimp) and devoured it.  We declined the focaccia and dessert, so it was the perfect healthy yet filling lunch. I was glad we were on the same page with that!Estelle was our server and she was fabulous... she informed us that we ordered correctly today because during the month of April, when you purchase a Mediterranean Salad, O&I will donate 50% of the purchase to Waste Not (which delivers more than 5,000 lbs of food daily to a diverse group of agencies that feed the hungry, including schools, daycare centers, after-school programs, senior care facilities, transition homes and rehabilitation centers).  Sure makes me feel better about spending $20 per person on lunch!I'm sure I'll continue to rely on Olive & Ivy for many a fabulous meal ahead!Time for an update only because I was invited to a dinner party last night at O&I that was absolutely perfect!  We sat in their beautiful private room, and it almost felt like we were at someone's house in their dining room.  Joel was our waiter and took fantastic care of our group.  As usual the food was delicious!  Last night I had the scallop entree (with bacon, salsify & yellow corn purée) and a side of spinach.  Jared had the salmon (with roasted beets, fingerling potatoes & horseradish vinaigrette).  We were pleased with both, as well as the bread and pesto, antipasti plate, and hummus starters.I enjoyed a glass of Gewürztraminer while a variety of libations went down easy around the table as well including mojitos and beer.  After dinner, we moved the party outside and thankfully, the misters on the patio made this crazy AZ heat bearable!The evening flew by (a reflection of the fine group of peeps I was with), and as midnight approached, I noticed the bar and most of the restaurant were empty... the DJ was packing up and our party moved on as well.  In usual Gabi manner, I headed home to get some beauty sleep.Thanks again, O&I, for another wonderful meal!8/18Came to try Olive & Ivy's happy hour, w/ 50% apps and salads and select wines by the glass.  Didn't know which wine I wanted to have and had to ask if I could sample a few before ordering a glass.  Many servers in other restaurants and wine bars automatically offer samples before you buy, but not here.  Leaves a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended!) when I have to ask.  Settled on a Columbia Valley Riesling, $8, but $4 during HH.  ($8 bottles sold at Costco.) For apps, I had the Chopped Mediterranean salad (orig. $9) and the Antipasti of Prosciutto di Parma (orig. $14- prices on website aren't current).  The chopped salad was fantastic- loved the couscous and feta cheese!  For me, this was a meal by itself.  Had I known beforehand- I placed the two orders at the same time- how satisfied I'd be w/ this and my glass of wine, I'd not have ordered the antipasti platter, which, frankly, I didn't favor too much.  The platter consisted of Prosciutto di Parma, chorizo (Spanish sausage), two cheeses (a blue cheese from Rogue Creamery and a goat cheese, Midnight Moon), two kinds of olives, almonds, and house-made grissini (breadsticks; Whole Foods sells a few tasty varieties).  Of this platter items, I only liked the goat cheese.  (Whole Foods sells Midnight Moon!)  The blue cheese was VERY salty, and so were the chorizo pieces.  (I only like the cured meats pan-fried, when the excess fat can be drained off, and the meats acquire the crispiness I crave.)Should you want to try the antipasti platter yourself, be aware that Olive & Ivy's daily selections vary, and you may not have any say on which two you'll get.  I think it's great to stumble onto a great new cheese, but perhaps those with allergies, say penicillin, may not want to try a new blue cheese (as some blue cheese varieties are fermented with penicillin bacteria)...  It would be great if Olive & Ivy would give customers a chance to either "roll the dice" and not know beforehand, or offer them a chance to choose from a limited selection.While my buddy Mike Z. was in town, we hit a few high spots...by which I could mean that we were high when we hit them...so munchies:)But, no...my drug of choice is KetelOne or Bunnahabhain these days:)One of the high spots was the fabulous Scottsdale Waterfront and Olive and Ivy:)Of all the things that you can say about the Scottsdale Waterfront the most accurate is that it is, indeed, on the water:)I grew up in the northwest and then lived in San Francisco for many years...I've dined overlooking the Mighty Columbia, the Mighty Pacific, The Mighty Willamette.While traveling, I've managed to sup while overlooking the Mighty North Sea, the Mighty Atlantic and the Mighty Mississippi.I'm probably not a good one to ask about the waterfront appeal of the Mighty Arizona Canal:)Never the less, Olive and Ivy is a nice enough place:)It's another Fox Concept (don't you just love the branding and labeling of these kinds of things:)I suppose it would just be too darn simple to just say "Hey, look!...Sam Fox just opened a new place!:)...Yay!"...or something like that...no, it's a "concept"...and if you know me at all (and most of you don't) you know that restaurant nomenclature is nearly a complete mystery to me.Fox Concept is no exception (oh, I get the "Olive and Ivy"...it's sort of Mediterranean, with a what...California overbite?:)...is that a concept?I any event, The Beautiful Carin, Mike and I strolled over for cocktails and dinner, stayed for desert, sat out on the patio (which is very pleasant, BTW:)And we enjoyed ourselves!Well, why not...it was an enjoyable evening...pleasant atmosphere... the service was very good (I sometimes wonder if my reputation as a stupid good tipper is being spread around town...I seem to get great service even in places that don't really have a reputation for good service...I don't know...maybe it's just a coincidence:)At any rate...the concept was hoppin'!:-)Ton's of terrific people watching...people dining, people strolling along the Mighty Arizona Canal, people doing the hook up dance in the bar...dinner and a show...what a concept! :-)We each had a couple of marti's (oh, the joys of being able to walk to dinner!:)We started with a hummus something appetizer and antipasti...The Beautiful Carin and I split a perfectly serviceable Caesar salad and I had a nice risotto, while Carin ordered her standby...roasted chicken (I wish I could remember what Mikey ordered, but I was too busy with my marti's, chit chat and what not:)After dinner, desert seemed like a reasonable idea:)Mike and I each had a Porto, while we all shared something chocolate and another something kind of cinnamon and orange...It was all pretty good, not the best risotto, but good...actually, not the best anything, but still good...all pretty well executed (if not truly inspired)If Fox's Concept is separating me from my money on a fairly regular basis, then I guess it's a successful concept:)Like Minneapolis & St. Paul. Like Cagney & Lacey. Like Nip & Tuck. Olive & Ivy is beautiful and near some water, entertaining and lesbian friendly and full of people who've had plastic surgery. Great space. Fabulous patio. I know. I know. The canal. Ugh. Love it? Hate it? Hey, it's there people. Embrace it! Like the Brady's did cousin Oliver.  And embrace the Eggs Benedict, Egg Sandwich, Focacciao bread with pesto and CENTER CUT CINNAMON ROLLS! You heard me people! Center cut. No non glazed, hardened, corner piece. Service was outstanding. I noticed the patio filled up just after we arrived. Isn't that weird? Does that ever happen to you? You arrive somewhere. Nothing. Soon the place is buzzing and so are you? Anyway. I digress. We were thirsty fashionistas recovering after a night at Scottsdale Fashion Week...i.e. we were pickled and thirsty. Ice tea and water was a flowin' the entire meal. They saw it in our blood shot eyes I'm sure. Eggs Benedict was perfection and had a delightful surprise of basil on top! Rickie LOVED his egg sandwich with avocado...looked great...though he never offered me any...Hmmm..Olive & Ivy. Like Ebony & Ivory. Living together in perfect harmony. Side by side....ok ok ok you get the picture.I'm sad to say that my very first meal in Arizona was a bit of a letdown. Admittedly, the setting is pretty scenic, but I kind of felt like I was in a suburban "upscale" mall restaurant that was trying to be more chic and happening than it could ever hope to be. I went with a Cobb Salad, which should have been a simple choice but the leaves seemed a bit wilted and the entire serving just a tad bland, even after a hefty dosing of pepper on my part. Still, service was relatively fast and friendly, so if I worked nearby, I can see how this could be an alright spot to keep on one's lunch circuit. No doubt about it, the best thing going here is the waterfront.A stylish and delicious option for lunch! We were lucky enough to be able to take advantage of their patio, complete with a little fountain, on a beautiful sunny day, and the yummy food and lovely service added up to a great experience. At first glance this place strikes me as a bit corporate, but at the end of it I felt that they really provided a unique experience. Two highlights of the meal: the delicious pesto that comes out with their free foccacia bread, which must have a wheel of parmesan in each bowl, because it's so rich and wonderful. I also adored the asparagus, mushroom and white truffle oil flatbread, which I shared with the table and immediately wished I had gotten just for myself. I also had the chopped chicken salad, which I found to be disappointing. First of all, there was WAY too much dressing on it, so everything felt drenched and a little wilted. Also, I was initially really curious about the granola that comes in it but I actually didn't feel that it added very much to the flavor and found myself picking around it. I'd definitely suggest this place to anyone who wants some pretty classic salads, sandwiches and flatbreads with a little fancied-up twist!12/2/102.5 stars.Took my young cousin w/ me for happy hour and sat at the bar; This was her first time at O&I.  While I really like the look and the feel of the island layout of O&I's bar, I always feel like a fish out of water when I sit there.  (I've actually tried sitting there a few times when I've walked in solo, but always ended up moving to a table.  If it weren't for my cousin at my side, I probably would've moved to a table again, or, worse yet, walked out of the resto, which I've done before, too.)  Despite a few attempts at getting her to try a cocktail, she declined, and thus I proceeded to just order a glass of wine.  Why it's so hard to get a sampling of a couple of wines before settling on one to order here, I'll never know.  (Just a few nights ago, while at Beckett's Table, my server offered to have me try sips of the two wines I was having trouble choosing!)  Tsk, tsk, tsk!We decided to try the Italian Sausage flatbread and the hummus app.  The flatbread, w/ its tasty and spicy Italian sausage chunks, consisted of a crispy crust w/ vibrant red piquillo peppers and creamy goat cheese-- I'd order this again, even though peppers and I don't exactly get along.  The hummus was equally delightful, w/ house-made pita bread and a "petite Greek salad," which actually consisted of only sliced red grape tomatoes and chopped cucumbers (a no-no for me!) and a ton of feta on top.  Why the salad was piled ON TOP of the hummus, and not on the side, I don't know.  I suppose for the price of the app, I shouldn't expect more veggies used (a bit of lettuce, perhaps?), but it would've been nice to be able to pick the cukes out.  Served as it was, on top of the hummus, which looked like it was baked for a few minutes before getting the salad treatment, spooning the cukes off would've entailed major loss of delicious baked hummus goodness.  And we wouldn't have any of that!I really wished we could've stayed past 6p to check out the celebrity guest bartender, but we had other appointments to keep.  My cousin really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here, and I'd have given this review another 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that our bartender gave us such an attitude when I asked to sample the two wines first before ordering.  FYI, the happy hour menu changed, drastically reduced to only maybe 8 items or less, down from practically all of the apps and half of the flatbreads and a couple of salads that the old HH menu contained.  Recalling this, plus the wine and salad/hummus incidents, I may just have to say goodbye to O&I for a long, long time...Recently had lunch with friends here and ordered a Margherita Flatbread, $12.  The flatbread is really a Pizza....I don't know why restaurants name Pizza different things, just call it what it is!Anyway, the Pizza was very good.  It had a nice Garlicky kick to it and the Sauce was very light.....delish!I had an Iced Tea to wash it down and it was very refreshing....I must have drank 5 or 6 glasses.  The service was great too, nice place to grab some lunch.Return Factor - 90%I'm adding one more update to my review. As I've mentioned before, the Mediterranean Chicken Salad is my favorite salad on the menu but while dining with my Mom I learned a helpful tip that makes the salad even better. Yes it is possible to make it better! Instead of having the salad with the cold chicken, ask them to substitute it with the hot grilled chicken sliced on top. It changes the salad completely and makes it an even better meal!Dreading the long week and need a quick fix before the weekend hits?! Head down over to this behemoth of upscale delight that serves up a tasty Mediterranean menu that will keep your wallet and plastic cards happy .  If you are savvy with the Fox Concept brand, then you know exactly what I'm talking about--another masterpiece done up  by the creators of True Food Kitchen and Modern Steak.+ Happy Hour+ 4-6PM+ Lounge, the Main Bar, Patio (w/ Mist)If you roll up with a clan of say 6-8, try to grab lounge seating which is located in the Bar area, especially in the Summer! the Main Bar is swanky  and spacious.  Once fall hits, the Patio might be the most ideal to enjoy some nice weather.Ohh k, Let's talk food and drinks! the real reason why we even bother, right?+ Sangria: $5, white (lychee, blood orange, peach), red (blackberry, rasberry, strawberry, tempranillo) - decided this be my favorite one of the two, you can get a small sampling before you try, both are not too sweet just right, unfortunately no hard fruits in them but still satisfying+ Flatbreads: $8, there's 5 to choose from, I personally enjoyed the prosciutto crudo (crispy potato, asparagus & fried egg) and piccante (italian sausage & spicy salami), love EGG on my pizzas! spread it over like jelly on a toast!+ Bacon Wrapped Dates: italian sausage & piquillo pepper, you get the sweet and savory, wasn't as crispy but still pleasingI know some in the group ordered some Bruschetta but I did not get to try.  So can't comment much.What could I say about service? Attentive, friendly and eye candy.  Just saying, from the host to the bartenders to the servers.If you were not wow'd by the ultra posh dining and bar area, the bathroom will.  Might be the most stylized toilette I've ever tainted! Let's just say the bathroom stalls have wooden doors!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=IfEvXEYxoJJt5rg7h92FegWith little room to complain, Olive and Ivy sounds to me like a winner, winner chicken dinner to help you get through your slacker ways week! ;-pI can't rave enough about Olive & Ivy. At the recommendation from my broker, my mother and I went out to celebrate my move to Scottsdale. We walked up and were in awe of the high ceilings, the open floor plan, marketplace area, and really modern decor. We had made a reservation and headed out to the patio. The patio is sectioned off in to two sections: one as more of a lounge with big chairs and couches, while the other is more dining-appropriate. As we were seated the overhead lightbulb strands lit up along the waterfront, I was in absolute heaven. If I had been nervous about my move, this little setting put me completely at ease.      Our waiter (which I shall call the Lord of all Waiters) came to bring us water and ask if we wanted anything to drink, we had both decided on Sangria, and he encouraged us to get a pitcher--I always enjoy an enabler. While he brought back our pitcher and delicious, but not Too sweet Sangria, we ordered the Artichoke heart appetizer. He even had this split for us so we didn't have to portion the starter ourselves. The hand grated Parmesan, Artichoke hearts and arugula were outstanding. Both my mother and I had already started commenting on the greatness of the flavor combinations.       The Lord of Waiters stopped by frequently, asking about my trip, checking on our waters, refilling our Sangria as it got low, talking about Downtown Scottsdale....he really knew how to make us feel special. He then brought us house-made pesto and bread; I could've eaten the pesto as a meal in and of itself it was so fresh.        Finally, our entrees came out. My mother got the Sweet Potato Cannelloni while I opted to try the Sea Bass. As I ate my snow peas, sea bass and grapefruit combo in absolute contentment, I caught myself humming along to The Notorious B.I.G. this is when the greatest waiter of all time told us they have a DJ every night that spins great mixes (which I can attest to, I was constantly saying "I love this song!")     To top off our extravagant meal, we had a scoop of Vanilla Bean gelato to split. The Vanilla Bean was upfront, not overpowering but just right. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect meal (or waiter). I can't wait to start getting visitors so I can take them here and show this place off!We stopped in for lunch and I have to say...seriously impressed!  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table but I'm glad the wait didn't deter us from eating here. We just took a short stroll along the water area and by the time we came back, our table was ready. I LOVED the ambiance of this restaurant.  Very rustic decor, open kitchen, large dining and bar area and near the entrance; a section with bench seating with low coffee tables where patrons seemed to be enjoying cocktails and appetizers. I later discovered this was part of the bar. Very chic.  Even with high ceilings and openness of this restaurant, it was still very welcoming.  We were seated near the entrance to the outdoor patio so while we didn't sit outdoors, we felt like we were dining el fresco. This time of the year in Scottsdale is wonderful so we could not be any happier with where we were seated. I ordered a Bloody Mary extra spicy and a margherita pizza (err flatbread) for lunch. The cocktail was made PERFECTLY and had a nice little kick to it...just how I like it.  The margherita pizza was absolutely delicious as well. The crust was thin, light and had great flavor and the toppings just made it that much more irresistible.  I didn't think I would be able to finish the entire pizza but I somehow did. I just could not stop myself, it was that tasty.After complimenting our waitress (which I forgot her name (sorry!) on how great the service and food was, we discovered this is owned by the same company that manages True Food Kitchen, one of our favorite restaurants. We would come back here in a heartbeat....but since this is in Scottsdale and not in San Diego, it will be tough to get back here when we're craving you. So, can you please open an Olive & Ivy out here?Olive & Ivy sounds cool because in SD we have "Juniper & Ivy^ and it's a super cool spot, so we were hoping Olive & Ivy was super cool too... turned out the name wasn't lying!We couldn't decide were to go for brunch so I yelped "bloody mary" and O&I came up so being alcoholics we needed our morning fix...well by the time we woke up and came here it was noon. We were able to make resos through opentable and got seated really quickly. Upon being seated we were greeted by our server and ordered drinks- Bloody Mary & Gin Greyhound. Bloody Mary- good mix to it, it wasn't watery. Garnish was a bit bare, but my second one they stepped up the garnish game (olives, lemon & celery). I love BMs were  you can get a lot of garnishes. My friend hates gin, but he said that was one of the best grey hounds! You can't even taste the gin. They were pretty generous on the alcohol portion as we left with a great buzz. Now on to the food! The house bread that came with pesto dipping sauce made it all better. I love bread with good dipping sauce. Plus one for that! I couldn't decide if I wanted breakfast or lunch as now it's noonish and it's already really hot in Scottsdale. So my friend and I decided to order lunch portions and split it. We got the prosciutto flatbread and the lamb gyro. I'm glad we got both because O&I is mediterranean and it didn't disappoint. The highlight was the prosciutto crudo flatbread with an egg on top. They also had basil and rosemary potatoes on the flatbread. It was soo good and portions were generous. We were able to take half the flatbread back and ate it a few hours later and it still tasted good!*Side note: One of the bartenders looked like Manny Pacquiao,,,and we came on the fight weekend. We really wanted to go up to him and say "hey you're going to be late for your fight" but I'm sure he gets shit from everybody that weekend.

Out celebrating our friends 1 year wedding anniversary, I wanted a margarita. After checking out a few places we settled on this place. We stood forever at the hostess stand waiting to be seated. Finally a girl came over and took us to a table and gave us menus. Priced at $12.50 (regularly priced $17.50 when not on special) I ordered a strawberry "Margarita-by-the-Yard" and I couldn't taste any alcohol at all. Our friends couldn't taste any in theirs either, so we asked our server when she finally came back around if we could buy some shots to add to it. She said they are $1 per shot so I ordered 2 shots to add to mine. The margarita seemed like it was mostly ice and I just didn't care for it.I figured with salsa being in the name of this place that we would get the standard complimentary chips and salsa, but nope! Chips and salsa cost here! I decided to just order a "Mexican Pizza" priced at $7.95 to munch on. It was a flour tortilla that had a crunch to it with pinto beans, cheese, salsa and sour cream. The beans weren't very warm and tasted bland. Honestly the fresh avocado was the only good part about it. Maybe if their margaritas actually gave people a buzz the food would taste better! Our server wasn't great about checking on us and slow with bringing out our drinks and food. She carded us when we ordered the drinks, but then carded our friend 2 more times and he didn't even order but one drink that he was already carded for. She seemed a bit spacey. I didn't mind the prices at all, but wasn't satisfied with my drink, food or the service we recieved. I canThese guys have the best $4.95 breakfast around, I ate here every morning. Two eggs to order, choice of meat, kick ass hash brown and they even throw in a couple flour tortillas.

You can't beat the $3.99 steak and eggs after midnight, but I like going in the morning M-F btw 6-11am for their $6.99 steak and eggs special with pancakes because the service during those times are awesome!  I can't remember her name, but our server was one the best servers I've ever had...and I'm not just saying that because she was cute.  The party in my table came one after another so we all ordered separately.  Our server didn't mind at all coming a multitude of times to take orders and run the food.  She was the best!  The other servers during that time slot rock also.  As for the food, surprisingly the cut of the steak isn't that bad.  I only had to slice off a bit of fat strip on the end, but after that the steak was pretty good.  On the down side, this cafe doesn't have A1 steak sauce.  They have Lea & Perrins which is sweeter, kinda ketchupie, but it isn't A1.  Pancakes were delicious and plentiful.  So plentiful I shared half my stack with my little niece.  Can't wait to come back in Christmas time to take advantage of their $3.99 steak and eggs!Just terrible, even for a 24 hour cafe.  I came here because, well, just LOOK at these other reviews.  This place looks great, right?  Fellow yelpers, how could you fail me so miserably?!I made a special trip.  Not there to gamble, just to have breakfast.  I've had better food at nursing homes.The eggs Benedict was unrecognizable as such.  Is that megaplex nacho cheese?   I didn't even want to try it because it looked so hideous.  Like congealed latex.And the eggs were not even remotely poached.  More like hard boiled into some thing beyond a solid.  As in, like maybe something one would find on the surface Jupiter.  And the grits?  Well, I guess I should know better than to order grits in Las Vegas, but   these were somehow both watery and grainy at the same time.  I kept looking for the hidden camera, because surely I was being punked.Top it off with a bloody mary that was basically clamato juice and (a half shot?) vodka with a touch of tabasco.  ie. about the most uninspired version of a bloody mary I've ever had the displeasure of drinking.  I rarely send back food and then not give them the opportunity to try again.  But this place was clearly beyond all redemption.Another one of Vegas' hidden gems. This one is off the Strip inside the Tuscany Suites and Casino on East Flamingo Rd. It's just located around the corner from Ellis Island Hotel & Casino, another gem of a place for good and bargain eats. Marilyn's Cafe is open for 24 hours and they have a daily special from 4PM - 10PM ranging in price from $7.99 to $18.99. Check out their menu here: http://www.tuscanylv.com/d/tuscany/media/PDF/marilyn_menu/marilynmenu.pdfHowever...there's another special menu from midnight to 5AM. Yes, the special and staple that's ubiquitous of Vegas - The Steak & Eggs. How much? $4.99That's more than a bargain; that's a Willie Mays steal of 2nd base without a throw from the Catcher kind of steal. You get an 8 oz. of juicy, delicious steak and eggs cooked to order. These steaks ain't the cheap kind they serve in Reno for the same price. It's a good-sized piece of steak that's tender, meaty and flavorful. Don't expect a cheap steak for a cheap price, but it was pretty decent quality for the right price. They also have an All-You-Can-Eat pancake for $3.99 for their midnight special. I'd have to say that's a lot of carbs for me, but it's there should you get the munchies. And I have to add that service was impeccable. I forgot our server's name, but he was a nice gentleman that was well seasoned. By that I mean experience and class. Servers from other fine-dining establishments could learn a thing or two from him. He made us feel at home, comfortable and relaxed. So the next time your in Vegas and hungry and starvin' like a broke-ass college student, don't run to the border or any closest fast food joint on every corner. Get some quality instead and your stomach and wallet will thank me for it.While some Vegas hotel-casinos are known for their grandiose buffets, others are more known for their cheap, late-night steak & eggs specials. Marilyn's is an unassuming diner found within the Tuscany casino. Open 24 hours a day, this special only runs midnight to 6:00 am and is off menu. Looking back at reviews from a few years ago, the price of the steak & eggs special has been steadily increasing by about a dollar a year. It was $3.99 back in 2011-12, $4.99 in 2013, and now currently $5.99. Still, it's a cheap deal for a 6 oz. NY strip (see what they did there?), 2 eggs any style, hash browns, and toast (wheat, rye, or sourdough). Don't expect too much because the steak isn't like Lawry's across the street, but it'll do for late-night eats. The best tip I can offer is to order the steak one level rarer than what you usually get. I once received a well-done steak after ordering a medium-rare. My rare order last night came out a decent medium-rare.$5.99 steak and egg special!  We came here because it was cheaper than at Ellis Island haha (only by $1 though).  It was pretty great to finally try a midnight/late night steak and egg meal, and we are happy we came to this restaurant.The meal came with steak, eggs, hash browns, and buttery toast, with plenty of jam to go with it :D  It was definitely a great meal and a great deal!

Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2015 #10 - #365If you're looking to have a taste of tacky Vegas themed restaurant then JJ's is your best bet to have some Parisian eats.  Around breakfast time, the lines can be long but moves quickly. It's right across from the Le Village Buffet and offers fake outdoor patio seating. My favorite food to order besides the fruity danish and fruity desserts is the smoked salmon baguette. Having had the smoked salmon baguette just wants to wisp you away to Paris France. I wish other resorts like Treasure Island, Mirage, Luxor and Excalibur can follow what Paris still holds to its theme. I'm talking about restaurants that fit in with the hotel theme. But anyways, JJ's will always be my go to Parisian eatery at the Paris Hotel. I would like to also add that I am a huge fan of their fruit tarts, French eclairs and decadent chocolates.Stopped in for a quick lunch I chose the 8" Italian Sub toasted, the bread was incredibly fresh, crusty with just the perfect amount of chewiness. The toppings were absolutely fresh and the lady working the counter on the bakery side made one of the best subs I've had in a long time, I was only able to consume half of this hearty sandwich but struggled to leave the other half but hey I'm in Vegas and I'm not taking a doggie bag, unfortunately I should of but didn't wrap it up and offer it to one of the many homeless or panhandlers on the strip. My associate tried the pizza and said it was just alright I guess it's all about making the right choices, even the restaurants in Vegas is a gamble sometimes...

HOLD UP, WAIT A MINUTE....I promise I won't start rapping, but seriously peeps, I haven't reviewed this place?!  I feel like I'm doing myself and you all a disservice!It makes me very sad that this is only a 3 star place at the moment because I really truly love it!  Maybe it's the connection with my favorite Smiley Guy (Mr. Eat n' Park himself) or maybe it's the FABUlous brunch on Sundays, but I love it!Of course, you can't come to this place without ordering the Buffalo Chicken (or Lobster) Mac n' Cheese (unless you're there for brunch....ok...do it for brunch too!).  It's a plate of oohey gooey goodness touched by God himself I think!  I've had a couple other items worth mentioning, like the noodle salad and lamb chops.  But the Mac n' Cheese....blows it all away.Let's move on to my fav topic...BRUNCH!!  Probably at the top of my brunch list in the city.  Sometimes I purposely have to make myself stay away.  Why you ask?  Because I always want to head right in and order the Cheesecake Stuffed French Toast!  It's always topped with a seasonal fruit or sauce (like apples or gingerbread).  I've also had the Eggs Beni, which are fab in their own right, with fresh asparagus to top it off!  They have a really fantastic rooftop deck that I just visited for the first time.  My first thought is to think....how many people can fit up here...because it would be a great place for a party or event.  But it was a bit tinier than I thought it would be.  Great place to be downtown on a warm summer night though!  But the best part of this place...they always have, out of this world, freshly baked bread!  I've had a different bread for dinner and different scones and breads for brunch and they have NEVER disappointed.  This is thee best touch by far!  If they ever forget to bring it to you, REMIND THEM!!  Believe me, I have, no shame in that game!Service was excellent.  Waitress was top notch.  Able to answer questions.   Folded our napkins when someone went to see some friends or the bathroom.   Another helped with the great wine list.  Hard to get service like this.  The place was full, so surprised how excellent the service was. The caesar salad was one of the best I have had with fresh parmesan, anchovies fresh romaine.  The crab cakes were cooked perfectly and very tasty with a pistachio and apricot crumb.First off, let me say this.  I knew that this restaurant was owned by the same hospitality group that owns Eat-N-Park, but who knew that it would be such a departure?I come here mostly for lunch with my co-workers.  To be completely honest, I love this restaurant but I wouldn't make a special trip "dahntahn" for dinner because of the limited menu.  (My family and friends are generally picky eaters) However, what they prepare, they prepare well and I enjoy the food as well as the decor.Love, love, love their French Onion soup and Sweet Tea Smoked Wings!  I have had just those two items as a meal. (Melted cheese, bread and fat.  Not the most nutritious, but you only live once!)  I'm a wing and French Onion soup freak!You can't go wrong with the flat iron steak (Griglia) or the Crab & Zucchini cake.  If you're in the mood for a sammich, that Cracklin Shank Cuban or SPK Cheesesteak will make you hurt somebody trying to get to either one!Like I said, not a lot of choices like the traditional Eat-N-Park menu, but the food quality and ambience of the restaurant far exceeds the parent restaurant's usual fare.

yeah, . . . no.I've grown to expect a certain level of awesome when it comes to Hawaiian eats in Vegas, which shouldn't really be too unheard of, especially when considering how many folks from Hawaii actually reside here(Vegas is officially Hawaii's ninth island for goodness sake).And don't get me wrong, Vegas does have some amazing Hawaiian eateries.Ohana just doesn't happen to be one of them.Was it because it is a chain place?No, for whatever reason, I'm a little more forgiving about that kinda stuff out here.*Not to say Vegas lacks originality or anything but this town is home to a mini Statue of Liberty, Tour Eiffel, and one pyramid of Giza (complete with Sphinx).What was really disappointing (besides the food obviously) is the fact it is regarded so highly on Yelp and received some really super positive reviews.Chicken katsu, pork lau lau, bbq chicken, and garlic shrimp.  meh, okay, meh, and meh.Oh well, I guess you can't always have a winning hand.Aloha Ohana.

Yep, I signed up for Yelp specifically to review this place...My wife and I have 4 daughters, and we rarely get a chance to get out of the house. We called all over to reserve a table for restaurants participating in "Restaurant Week", and none of them were available for our time slot besides Captain Bill's. So we went, and it was easily the worst dining experience we've ever had in Madison, and we've both lived here for 20+ years...She went for the steak ordered medium rare, and it came to her completely raw on the inside. Trust me, I'm a cook, and I know the difference. This is NOT just an uninformed consumer who has no idea. I got a lobster tail that came with no butter, and tasted like the outside of crab shells smell. The best part of the meal was the clam chowder, which came in a coffee cup. The service was very unattentive and slow, even though it wasn't even busy. While I went to the rest room, my wife informed me that one of the young servers came out, put a plate down for a woman, then licked some food off his hand on the way back to the kitchen. I'm not being a jerk here, but this was bad. Especially for the restaurant week prices which was $25 per person and I'm very sure we would have been better off going anywhere else on the list. What I've heard from other people since I've told them about our experience is that "the fish frys are good".I'll never know.The Wife and I went to Captain Bill's with friends in late August. We had heard that the food would not impress us, but that the view of the lake would be worth trying the place. WRONG.Let me start with the view. The little bit of the lake that we could see was, well, pretty lame. It definitely was not an impressive view, so that reason for going was no longer valid.The food. Oh, the food. It was, quite literally, the worst food that The Wife and I have had in years. I ordered the shrimp scampi (since it's a seafood restaurant), only to be told that the pasta would count as one of my sides. WHAT? Shrimp scampi ALWAYS comes on pasta, but Captain Bill's nickle and dimed me on the pasta? Lame. Oh, and the pasta was so completely undercooked that I ended up only having 2 small bites before pushing it away in disgust. I mean, it wasn't even close to being cooked as much as "al dente."The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.We will never go back to Captain Bills, and I do not recommend that you do, either.

Review Text :
Very very poor management. We were there last year for the Suns playoff game and wait in line for a seat like the other 25 people. Some Yanni looking dousche and his fake as hell trailer trash barbie wanna be walked in asked for the manager, proceeded to yank his jock and get a table in less then 1 min. I walked right over to the same manager while he was schmoozing the Dousches and asked why they were so special. (nothing like bursting the ego of a semi-famous dousche) The manager was so embarrassed he escorted me off the floor and proceeded to tell me "they spend so much money here every year that they deserve preferred treatment" I walked out and told every other person who was waiting what had happened and out of 25 people at least 18 went somewhere else. I sure hope the VIP was worth the $500 they lost out on when we all walked. Not to mention the bad press and no repeat business.Save your money and eat a hot dog while watching the game.

Restaurant name  Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill

Review Text :
This was a fantastic dinner we had at this rest. that we stumbeled into  as we exited Ka Show at MGM! It was about 9 PM and we just walked in! Got seated in about 10 min ( no reservation) I had pork chop (xlnt) my husband had some kind of a steak ( he loved it ) we split a salad ( very good ) They even had Stella on tap !!! Service was efficient, pleasant and professional.Speciality cheeze cake for desert was awesome!Can't wait 2 go back!Las Vegas.  There are definitely a lot of notable food places in Las Vegas, but there are just as many bad ones and many of them (good or bad) are overpriced.  At the end of the day, I just want to go somewhere that has good service and serves okay food (that is reasonably priced and hasn't been sitting around for too long).  I think Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill fits the bill (at least at lunchtime).I had already had one lunch, but I was meeting up with friends and, well, the restaurant is not a park bench so I felt obligated to order something.  I went with the heirloom tomato salad that came with mozzarella, micro greens, pesto, basil aioli, red onion, and a vinaigrette.  The salad was very fresh.  I've had better mozzarella, but the plump heirloom tomatoes were good.  The salad may have been slightly over-garnished and it was a little too tart and powerful due to the vinaigrette and some very strong red onions.Service was very good.  The waiter was friendly, polite and attentive.  He also seemed very apt at judging the pace of the crowd, which is definitely a strong asset in Vegas since some groups want to get-it-and-go while other groups like to stay for a while and decompress.The space was fine (contemporary and not cluttered).  It felt like a fresh and clean cafe.  It was open to the casino (actually located in the center of the MGM Grand casino floor).  The casino was not that busy, but I wonder how nice it would be to eat at this place when the casino is busy because I imagine that the smoking nearby would be a problem (kind of like restaurants in some states that have non-smoking and smoking sections right next to each other).The portions were big enough.  In other cities, the prices would be a little high for the food being served.  But for Vegas, the prices seemed reasonable.I would say that Wolfgang Puck would top a lot of the generic 24-hour Vegas Strip casino cafes.  Wolfgang Puck is slightly more expensive than those at lunchtime, but they have enough variety on their menu where you can order some less expensive things if you are trying to keep to a tighter budget.  Because of that, Wolfgang Puck is an okay Las Vegas lunch option if you are looking for fresh and decent food (and not simply something to hold you over until your next meal).Wolfgang Puck was our first stop after arriving in Las Vegas. Hungry and tired from the long flight (just kidding it was only an hour) we needed to have lunch and a drink. We had our 21-year-old Grandaughter with us, and found it just weird to hear her order a drink- She was a baby just yesterday. She got carded and took great joy in showing her ID. The bartender spotted it immediately. He surprised her later with a fabulous dessert.I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, and I must say, they were right up there with some of the best. Mr. H enjoyed a scrupulous pulled pork sandwich. Our girl ordered a Pizza. It's true that the old Wolfgang knows his pizza. If this franchise were in Oakland I would start eating pizza.  Now, for baby girls dessert. On a very large plate, a slice of banana cream pie was placed next to a halved Bruleed banana. I believe that was the best banana I ever tasted. I mean really...who brulees a banana. "Nothing says dessert like a propane torch".Yes there was even a dollop of whipped cream. AND, on the plate, in chocolate, was a hand written Birthday wish. What a fabulous way to arrive in Las Vegas.Our experience was so great that we decided at that moment to have our Thanksgiving dinner there. It too was amazing. Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill is located in the MGM Grand. I Highly recommend it. It's not to fancy and not to casual. Great food and great service***Not as expensive or overpriced as the many celebrity chef restaurants in Las Vegas (though still pricey), Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is a decent spot that serves satisfying (though not great) food***Despite the many well-known restaurants (especially those backed by celebrity chefs) in Las Vegas, there are not many that are open for lunch.  That is what makes Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, which is located on the casino floor of the MGM hotel, so convenient.  I believe it is open all day and Wolfgang Puck utilizes better ingredients than a lot of its daytime sit-down competition.Despite its convenience, Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is just an okay restaurant (not a great one).  Most of the dishes are fine and taste good, but I have yet to have something here (in my 3 visits) that felt noticeably better than the food other good Vegas restaurants put out.Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill sits smack down in the middle of the casino.  It is pretty open to the casino with no big walls.  Maybe it was where we sat or that the casino was not that busy, but the smoke-filled casino did not feel that obtrusive here.  The decor has the look of a bright cafe with light yellow and golden brown colors and nice but casual tables and chairs.We started with the truffled (strong truffle flavor) potato chips, which were topped with a chunky and rich Maytag blue cheese sauce.  The housemade chips were flavorful and seasoned right but unevenly crisp--some were crisp and some were soft (some chips were made even softer / soggier due to the heavy coating of blue cheese).  Overall, it was an okay starter though you may want to steer clear if you are not a fan of blue cheese.We also shared the Chinois Chicken Salad, which was tossed with candied peanuts, crisp wontons and a Chinese mustard vinaigrette.  Overall, it was a flavorful and fresh salad with a good balance of ingredients, but it was not as good as the original Chinois Chicken Salad from Chinois on Main in Santa Monica.  The reason was that the salad was over dressed.  It kind of lost its crispness and it was overdressed in the vinaigrette (too soggy).For my entree, I had the BLT, which included maple glazed pork belly, arugula, vine ripe tomatoes, and avocado on buttered sourdough toast.  The pork belly was sweet and flavorful.  I thought it was going to be braised and soft (and then crispy on the outside); however, the pork belly here lacked that tender texture.  Instead, the pork belly's texture was more dense like thick bacon or lean spare ribs.  It was still good, but I would have preferred a thicker piece of braised (tender) pork belly over the spare rib-like texture here.The lettuce, tomato and avocado were all fine.  Like the potato chips, the sandwich was heavily dressed.  I was not a big fan of the sourdough.  The bread was okay, but it was over-buttered and slightly greasy.  The BLT came with a side of cold vegetable pasta salad, which was a standard cold pasta salad.I tried my friend's kabocha pumpkin tortellini with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts and parmesan.  I had a very similar pumpkin tortellini dish at Drago Ristorante in Santa Monica.  The pasta dish at Wolfgang Puck was flavorful and pretty good (probably the best thing we had here).  That being said, I liked Drago's version better because it was lighter, had a more subtle flavor and was less complicated.Service was very good.  The waiter Jeremy was a very nice guy.  He was pleasant and friendly as well as enthusiastic and passionate about the food.  Food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.Prices for lunch were okay.  There were several options here that were around $20 or less.  You would pay about the same at some of the Las Vegas cafes, but I imagine you are more likely to walk away satisfied if you spent your money here.Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill has convenient hours and puts out tasty (though not remarkable) food.  I've been here a few times and the restaurant has shown a lot of consistency in delivering (at the very least) decent food.  That is what makes Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill a decent and safe option for lunch in Las Vegas.  The MGM Grand hotel provides complimentary parking (both valet and self-parking via a parking structure).Sweet baby Jehovah. $7 to throw grilled chicken in a $14 salad? If I'd known I would've smuggled some of the stuff in my carry-on bag. I cut through the breast very carefully so as to not damage the freshwater pearl that must have been in there. I never found it.That was my first night in Vegas. It was a wake-up reminder that I wasn't in Austin anymore. But Wolfgang's is the only sit-down place open after 10:30pm in the MGM. This means 2 subsequent visits, each more stellar than the first. Both exercised my economic know-how.Visit 2: mussels with frittes. Yummmm. Huge serving, enough to share. But saying the word "share" is saying "charge me an extra $4.50 because I don't know what else to do with that money." Dumb. As the words were coming out of the boy's mouth, I knew we were toast. .. toast wedges came with the mussels... Hold on while I yummmm again.Visit 3: we were golden. Linguine with clams for him, spinach side for me. Also known as: we SHARE both of those, in fact combining them for a delicious dish. They should include spinach in the linguine by default; it's all too pale otherwise. At $6 a spinach side, it was a way better deal than getting charged for sharing. And that's how you work the system, kids. Don't let them take you down. You wont win Vegas - you wont take my house, my money or my honey from under me. I'm from Jersey.I came here Sunday August 4th for dinner.  I had the lasagna, 2 friends had the pizza and 2 others in my group did not eat.  It was an average meal.  Fast forward to 10 hours later, early Monday morning, I woke up to a churning stomach, went to the restroom where I proceeded to spew out red tomato sauce from BOTH ends.  It was a terrible morning.  Both of my friends who had pizza woke up and had considerable GI discomfort all morning.  They weren't as bad as me, but they were not enjoying life.  Essentially, our Monday drive home was miserable.  The two who did not eat were fine.  I called the restaurant Wednesday evening, after I felt better to let them know I had possibly gotten food poisoning from their restaurant.  The manager immediately doubted me -- blaming the sickness on too much drinking (absurd).   I had maybe 5 beers the entirety of Sunday.  So unless a server shoved a bottle up where the sun doesn't shine before serving me, I have a hard time blaming it on the beer.  Not to mention, I'm in my 30's...I went to college...I am fairly familiar with alcohol sickness and hangovers.  This was not that.I explained to the manager that there were 5 of us and we all ate at the same places all weekend, except for Sunday night, when only 3 of us ate...the same 3 that got sick.      The manager proceeded to proclaim that you get food poisoning 72 hours after ingestion.  I had to look that up...it's not true.  Why he would lie?  I have no idea.  He just really didn't seem to even being open to the notion that his restaurant got me sick.Regardless, I didn't call asking for anything...I only called to inform them of the events and how my friends and I narrowed it down to their establishment.  The manager asked for my contact info and told me their general manager would get back to me in 24 hours.  It has been 5 days.  Not expecting that phone call...and I'm not expecting to ever eat at a Wolfgang Puke establishment again.I went here with the family for dinner.  The first thin you might notice is that you're somewhat exposed to the public so it can get pretty loud - not a first date place if you want something more intimate and if talking/listening to your date is on your agenda.  We got truffled potato chips, mussels, salmon, bass, beignets and banoffee.Truffled Potato Chips:Homemade potato chips with blue cheese sauce drizzled with truffle oil, Served hot and crispy. I'm not a fan of blue cheese but I liked this because of the truffle oil. 5/5Steamed Black Mussels:Comes with grilled sourdough, chorizo, white wine, garlic and smoked paprika Bernaise. Very interesting twist to a boring bivalve. 4/5Barbecued Pacific Salmon:Served with caramelized white corn, peas, baby heirloom tomatoes,arugula and crispy onion rings on top. I don't like peas so I was busy sorting my peas from my corn.  The crispy onions saved the dish. 3/5Bass: Comes with baby artichokes, white beans in tomato-olive vinaigrette and Romesco sauce. This was more interesting than the salmon. 4/5Chocolate Beignets:Dusted with powdered sugar and omes with a caramel dipping sauce and vanilla ice cream. They look like chocolate cake doughnut holes but they're less dense. 3/5Banoffee:It has the consistency of a cheesecake. Not too sweet. I was very intrigued by this as I've always wanted to try banoffee pie. This is my first taste of it and I was not impressed. I'm hoping this is not the best version of said pie because if this is it then, forget it! 3/5During my last trip to Vegas on biz back on April I arrived after midnight and checked into the MGM Grand. After I dropped off my luggage in the room I ran down to play some blackjack for an hour or so. At that point I was ravenous and needed a bite to eat. This casino is huge but many spots to eat at were already closed for the night. I wandered over to Wolfgang Puck and it was still open. Open until 6 am so its a life saver when drunk and hangry! Pretty decent cheeseburger here. Big and filling. Fries are shoestring style and just ok. A few craft beers on tap about six or so such as Full Sail Amber.Plenty of seating surrounding the floor, and a nice bar area I sat at. The bartender on duty that night was attentive enough and got me my food and drink pretty quickly. Overall, no real complaints here, but a bit on the pricey side. It is in a casino after all. Not a bad spot to grab a meal, especially in the middle of the night when on a gambling bender.One of my favorites at the MGM Vegas.Usually come here with a big group of 12+ and the service is always impeccable and the food is always on point.  Last time I was there I tried:-Heirloom Tomato Salad - awesome (not much of a salad eater, but enjoyed this one) -Spicy Tuna Tartar - fresh and clean flavors-Calamari - a great choice as usual.  -Linguini with garlic, chili, and Grilled Shrimp - my favorite!  I get this every time.Also, their desserts are so delish!  I usually don't venture out of the chocolate zone, but I've experimented here, and my tummy has always been happy with my choices;  Beignets, Vanilla Crème Brule, and Apricot Crumble, all have been fantastico! A bit on the pricey side, but which nice restaurant isn't in Vegas.  At least you wont be disappointed by the food here.Slacking on these reviews,, but trying to get back into it :D. Decided to come here because we were staying at MGM and didn't want to go through the hassle of going to another hotel and rushing back to get ready to go out. I made the reservation day of at around 3 pm for 14 people and told them that we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday and they were able to accommodate.When we got to the restaurant, we were led to this little room near the wine rack. It was nice because there was a sliding door that separated us from everybody else, so we kind of got a private room. When we sat down and looked at the menu, it had "Happy Birthday Eric!" on the top. I was so surprised! 5 Stars for printing out new menus just for us :) Service was amazing. Always checked up on us and everybody who served us was very professional and friendly. The menu is not too extensive, but there was a good variety of food. I ordered the ribeye and the fried calamari. The fried calamari was light and delicious, but I've never had bad fried calamari. The ribeye was very good. Cooked perfectly medium rare. Came with potatoes and some veggies. The glaze was a little on the sweet side, but not too overbearing. I was also able to try the chicken breast and let me tell you, it was the juiciest chicken I have ever had. Probably would get this the next time we come here. The food did take a little while to come out, but I think it was cause they wanted to serve us all at the same time. All in all, food was good, service was amazing, and boy did they make us feel special. Last but not least, we had a party of 14 and they didn't even charge the 18% gratuity!! Our waiter told us that he was leaving it up to us, but of course we gave the 18% for the wonderful service we received. TAKEAWAYS: + service!!!We arrived at the MGM Grand late after a long travel day, we decided to eat here based on a few things, as I stated it was late, I didn't really feel like going outside the hotel and didn't really want to extend the day by a few more hours eating at one of the more exclusive restaurants inside the hotel. I've eaten at several of Wolfgang's Restaurants around the country and I rate them all the same "predictable" don't confuse this with anything negative these restaurants are just a safe choice but not outstanding for the prices in my opinion.We were very happy to see although they were quite busy we were seated immediately, after a few minutes our server arrived he was friendly enough and explained the specials and quickly got our drink ordersTHEN THE WAIT BEGAN!It was apparent that the kitchen was backed up for this hour of the evening but then again it's Vegas, our server did make it back to our table periodically to assure us our food would arrive at some point, then he returned and told us the burger I ordered was very popular and the grill could only accommodate just so many, then he returned  to tell us that no matter how long it takes the chef ( I was thinking short order cook) never rushed any orders to ensure each burger was handcrafted and magnificent. At this point I really didn't care and wish I had made a run to In N Out.After more than 45 minute from placing our order the kitchen delivered our meal the $17 burger was beautiful but slightly well done so I was slightly disappointed since I ordered it medium rare but it appeared to be "well crafted" I guess, this 1/2 pound of ground prime beef topped with fresh crisp lettuce, ripe tomatoes, pickles, onions and spicy mayo all stacked on a fresh pretzel bun had the making of something special but it was a little over-cooked. The server offered to fix it but it was much to late even though he said it would take only a few minutes I wondered how could this be the burger in front of me took almost an hour. The fries that accompanied the burger were delicious and served hot. Would I try them again I don't know there of lots of restaurants in Vegas so the three star are really related to the service mainly the kitchen service maybe it was a bad night at Pucks.Walked in on a late 1am Friday morning.  Basically hungry from our flight and just wanted to that White Castle craving to go away.  Luckily, there were plenty of tables open, so we were seated right away without reservation.  The dining area was set up nicely and clean.  Appearance was colorful,  modern, and quite unique.  We were served by Albert, and he was attentive from beginning to end.  Only that's about it.So, we started with the Truffled Potato Chips ($11) with a blue cheese sauce.  These were superb, but not anything to rave about.  I mean, I love truffle and I love blue cheese, but it couldn't keep my mind off those belly bombers.  I guess the chips and sauce really brought out the saltiness.  Meh, I knew I wanted the tuna tartare instead, oh well.  Now the Ceasar Salad ($13) was a winner, well kind of.  Fresh baby romaine leaves with the Ceasar salad dressing.  Though it tasted great, only I personally thought it was small for the price.  The croutons were big and tasteless as well.  Then there was the Half Jidori Chicken ($28) with vegtables, a potato puree, topped with rosemary au jus, and a side of kale salad.  Now, for $28 this better be the best chicken ever.  It was excellent, but not the best ever!  Full of flavor, but you had to mix it all together to drown the over-saltiness.  Because of these dishes, we ordered their cheapest bottle of white wine, the Nuschese Pinot Grigio ($32).  A suitable choice especially for the chicken and salad.  A surprisingly enjoyable wine.  Thanks again to Albert's recommendation, it made for a good compliment;  And we just killed that bottle!So, overall, I've gone to several Wolfgang Puck locations and this just confirms I'm not a fan of his style.  After spending a total of $103 for two people, I simply feel this place is overrated and overpriced.  This place already put me in the hole!We were a party of 14 that arrived without a reservation on a Monday night. They put us in a private room in the back which was absolutely perfect.  Right off the top, the kids menu was outstanding. It was reasonably priced ($6/entree) and all of the children were excited about the offerings (pizza, pasta, chicken etc).  Every single adult LOVED their meal.  I had a huge salad with fresh roasted chicken and a bowl of chicken noodle soup.  It was absolutely yummy!! The pasta dishes around me were equally as good (piggie me sampled most of them). And most importantly, the service was great. Let's face it, we weren't an easy group and they handled us wonderfully.  This is a solid choice for families or adults smack dab in the middle of the MGM casino  You did good, Wolfgang--our most memorable night out of a 7-night stay. Thank you!I didn't expect the restaurant to be smack dab in the MGM casino floor, but it was. You'd assume that the smell of smoke would overpower any glorious smell that came out of the Wolfgang kitchen, but to my surprise, I didn't smell any cigarette smoke at all.Came here with a MyVegas voucher, which was super easy to use (basically call the MyVegas number and they input it in the system, no need to tell your server about it). Ahi tuna tartare was really good. The black sea same wonton skins gave the dish a nice crunch and complimented the tartare. I'd order this again.The ricotta gnocchi was decent, as well as the linguine with clams. I did get a couple minor sandy clams which was a bit bummer. Some clams were also cooked perfectly, whereas others were pretty chewy. These dishes weren't bad, but I'd explore the menu a bit next time.The chocolate soufflé was to die for. Seriously heavenly and I'm not a huge chocolate fan. The lady at the table next to us was just staring at it and then finally asked if it was good. DUH! Definite recommendation.Our server was nice and staff were attentive. Great experience.Wolfgang Puck doesn't disappoint! And you can have access to his deliciousness up until 6 AM. Open all night long!It's past midnight and there's still a 30-minute wait, so we walk around to kill time. By the time we're seated, we're excited to see whether the hype is true. And it's definitely worth it for good food at this hour. So...what to order?FOOD:---------We started with the **Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers**, which was much larger than one would expect for an appetizer. 5 divine skewers! The meat was so tender it melted in my mouth, and the savory flavors burst forth. What a pleasant surprise! I'm a total carnivore, but the **Vegetable Pizza** really hit the spot. You can't go wrong with oven roasted tomatoes, basil pesto, mozzarella, and Nicoise olives. Sometimes pesto is a nice change.And finally, there's no way we could resist the **Three Cheese "Mac 'n Cheese" **. I thought the price was a little high at $12, but when that sucker showed itself I understood everything. Even the meaning of life. We were again pleasantly surprised by a fairly-sized portion that helped induce food comas all around.Although prices are higher than the super casual cafe around the corner, the quality of food at this hour is really quite impressive.SERVICE/AMBIANCE:---------------------------Crowd is mixed; you'll see people of all ages here. Most are stopping by after a long night in either casual or fancy attire, depending where they came from or where they're headed. So you'll see business suits, skimpy club attire, grungy gym clothes, and even hipsters. You should never be surprised in Vegas.My only issue is with the service. The hosts were polite, but our server took forever to take our order. We must have waited 15-20 minutes in our seats before ordering, and this is after we had already waited 30 minutes outside. He provided great recommendations and our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but he NEVER came back to check on us. When we wanted to pay our bill he was socializing with one of the other servers, so I had to go ask him for it. I'm sure the other staff there are not as negligent as he is. At least I hope not!TIP: Overall this place is great for late night and I definitely recommend it when you're staying at the MGM Grand.DATE TIP: Ohhh yeah, open til 6 AM. Perfect for your Vegas late night date night schedule!

Tortilla crusted, hand stuffed cheddar and bacon filled jalapeno shots dipped in a cilantro buttermilk sauce. Enough said. Picture this. Fried jalapenos sitting in a shot glass of buttermilk sauce. You take it out of the shot glass and bite into a fried jalapeno of gooey cheese that's oozing out. Along with the cheese, you taste bacon and southwest flavor. It's so good, you must have another and another and another...until all six have disappeared and you wish you had six more. This was my most recent experience at Spotted Donkey. They are called "Shooters" and you can order six or 12. After tasting them, I highly suggest going with the order of 12, that is, if you're hungry for fried happiness! This still stands as one of my most favorite restaurants in the Carefree area. I've been visiting since I was a teenager and it still has yet to disappoint. Everything here is delicious, especially the southwestern mac and cheese and the stuffed chile peppers. Really, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.Seafood enchiladas in North Scottsdale? Say yes and don't look back! The Enchilada de Mariscos here is comprised of seared shrimp, blue crab, cheddar and monterey jack cheeses, rice and orange pico. And, it's 100% delicious. Be sure to order the guacamole appetizer too. The chips are addicting. Maybe the reason why the location is so far from town is so that you have time to digest on the car ride home. With the 2014 Opentable Diner's Choice award, you can't go wrong.

Crap.Crap crap.Crap.Is that not sufficient?  Do you need more than that?  Okay: go there and order a reuben, and see what happens.  First, they'll ask you what type of bread you want.  On my reuben?  I'll take rye, because if it isn't rye then it's not a reuben.  Thank you.Then they will include lunch meat-style corned beef, which just pisses me off.  Because it doesn't taste delicious, it tastes like what you get from a cafeteria.  And then they have thick ass bread, which, in my opinion, is what you put on a sandwich when you don't want people to realize that what's in between the slices of bread sucks ass.Or, the nachos.  They use movie theater cheese (which is a one-star bonus for me, only reason they have 2 stars) but the chili is totally tasteless.  I don't get how people can cook something like chili and send it out to the world when it tastes like nothing.  Not bad, not good, just *nothing.*  Here's a tip: find something that tastes and heave it into the pot.  Just a thought.I hate myself for being convinced to go here over slices.  Because the place sucked a fat one.

Review Text :
Last weekend Rose took me to "Nove"  for Valentine's Day.  I know,  I'm a very lucky guy!! ;-)  I'm not really one for super trendy places that are over hyped and under deliver,  so I was a bit skeptical about eating at the Palms. But I have to say "Nove"  knocked one out of the park. We had a tremendous 5 star experience.  The food was incredible and the service was flawless.  A  few of the dishes were just outstanding.  We highly recommend the shrimp covered  with a lemon cream sauce, the grilled baby octopus, the seafood spaghetti and the chicken marsala.  Bottom line...Fantastic food with even better company. It doesn't get too much better.  Prego!I'm generally not a fan of shelling out for expensive Italian restaurants but this isn't your typical place.  It's certainly a 5 star experience if you combine the great view of the strip, service, atmosphere and the walk up to Moon and the Playboy Club afterwards.I've been able to sample a few of the dishes here and have enjoyed all of them.  The standout appetizers would be the baby octopus, raviolo and calamari.  I had the Sunday Gravy pasta the last time which included braciole, sausage, meatballs and pork gravy.  Heart attack on a plate!  It felt so wrong yet sooooo right.  The Nove spaghetti, pansotti (short ribs, brown butter, hazelnuts, spinach) and veal Nove were also very memorable from past visits.  The dessert menu is decent if you actually have room for it.  This would be a great place to take some first timers visiting LV since you could cover a lot they would want to see in one evening.  Just make sure to have dinner a bit later than usual so you can enjoy the festivities upstairs when you're full as a bull.It was Restaurant Week, and after tasting an inventive pasta dish that had a lasting impression on me, and meeting Chef de Cucina Geno Bernardo, at Dish 2011, I was at last dining in the flesh at Nove with Diane.  As soon as I left the elevator at the top of the Palms Playboy Tower, and saw the sleek furniture and breathtaking view of the Las Vegas valley from the wall to ceiling glass panes, I instantly knew that I liked this place.  Hard driving music with a nice modern vibe added to the upscale ambiance.  After various bread products, olive oil, salt, red spice, and requested butter were set before us, we were surprised by a generous assortment of amuse bouche prepared by Chef Bernardo.  Some vegetables and pesto were spread on toast tips, and two cute bent silver spoons had been loaded with heaping spoonfuls of a textured concoction that tasted like smashed pea beans and was cool to the tongue.    A platter of Salumi with savory housemade salami, ham, and great Ricotta Cheese was next, along with very tender Federal Hill Calamari (both rings and tentacles) enhanced by a very lemony Lemon Aioli made per our request.  Ravioli Risotto Bianco with pine nuts and fresh pesto was excellent, and so was a hot and meaty Ragu Bolognese with Rigatoni.Likable Chicken Parmiggiano--more tomatoey than cheesy--harbored a nice surprise: eggplant framing the dish around the edges.  Veal Scaloppini was fine, thinly pounded veal.  A rich side of Death by Potatoes with Marscarpone and Parmesan Cheese tasted like mashed potatoes with pancetta.  It was hot and very cheesy.For dessert, I enjoyed a great luscious Marscarpone Cheesecake with Raspberry Sauce, and Diane savored a very good homemade Tiramisu.  In the midst of our meal, an interesting diversion occurred.  The entire men's basketball team for St. Mary's College strode in and filed past me, to take their seats at a very long dining table overlooking the valley far below, for a scheduled team dinner.  They were in town for the Mountain West Conference's Basketball Championships held at the Thomas & Mack Center.Nove was very accommodating in both the front of the house and in the kitchen.  Our table was held for us after we were stuck behind a car wreck and a two-lane closure on I-15, and arrived 27 minutes after Diane reported the problem via cell phone.  And, besides specially preparing an aioli for us, the kitchen staff kept peppers out of the calamari, and removed chives from Death by Potatoes, also at our request.  Other than having to ask for Iced Tea twice before a glass of the tan beverage arrived, service was excellent.  Even Iced Tea refills came out flying for the duration of our meal, without request.Two unusual events occurred when I paid the bill.  I dropped down a "You've Been Yelped!" card with my cash payment, and the server picked it up, examined the card, and asked quizzically, "What is this?"  I explained that I was going to review the restaurant on Yelp.com, and in fact had already decided that I was going to award five stars out of five.  He then asked if we wanted to meet the chef.  Since Diane had never before met Chef Bernardo, I said, "Yes, if he is available.  But I have already decided to award the restaurant the highest rating."  I wanted to be clear that my review was already decided based on my dining experience and could not be influenced.  Our server told me to wait a minute while he checked, and a few moments later returned and directed Diane and me to follow him.  He led us right into the kitchen.  As soon as the doors closed, about ten smiling white-clad chefs and assistants facing us started clapping and catcalling to acknowledge our presence and give us a friendly greeting.  Then Chef Bernardo came over, and we shook hands.  As the kitchen staff went back to turning out a long procession of orders, Diane and I were given a full tour of the kitchen and even admitted to a refrigerated room.  Before we left we saw a door signed by Hollywood and Las Vegas celebrities.    But we were not through with surprises!  As soon as we left the kitchen, I was asked, "How would you like to see the Playboy Club?"  As a key holder in the late '60s, I said, "Sure!" and after a comp pass was filled out and handed to me, Diane and I were escorted to a private escalator that led to the Playboy Club one floor up.  There we had another nice view of the city, stayed for a short while amid cottontailed Playboy Bunnies and other patrons, and then descended the tower via elevator and soon returned to normal life.How often do you get to be a pastry chef for awhile at a nice restaurant? Well I was one tonight.   More on that later.We always overlook going to Nove because of its out of the way location so it was on our must try list and was it a good decision.We were brought iced teas quickly and they were refilled often during the night.  Then came bread service.  It was three kinds--cheese bread sticks, focaccia, and Italian bread.  We also got a dish with three potential bread toppings and for use during the meal--one container with olive oil, one with red pepper flakes, and one with grated cheese.One of the runners brought us an amuse-bouche--two small bruschetta with freshly chopped tomatoes.  A nice palate awakener for what was to come.For a starter, we order their salumi plate.  Our server, Alex, assured us it could be shared by two people.  The menu said that it was a selection of cured meats and red pizza.  Well, that sounded fine.  What came was almost a meal in itself.  Four kinds of cured meat, parmigiano cheese, and some fresh ricotta.  That wooden server was placed in front of us and then they placed a wood plate with red pizza.  Wow!  So much!  Cured meat platter:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#rfBs4_87H9DVi5r3o0E_9ARed Pizza:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#a_Kw4-9-qjX9ROujm1IhHgWe also had another three compartment dish with mustard, olives, and pickled vegetables.  This was really starting to add up in the stomach and we hadn't gotten to the main course.  Everything was excellent.  We had to let two small pieces of pizza go back with the dishes.For the main course, my wife got the Veal Nove which the menu describes as thinly sliced Scaloppine, Prosciutto, Arugula, and Lemon.  I tried a small piece and it was very, very good.  I ordered a special--lobster ravioli with a seafood sauce similar to lobster bisque.  It was superb!  There was a small amount of veal leftover and Alex and his crew quickly boxed it for bringing home.Now comes my pastry chef experience.  One of their desserts is Make Your Own Cannoli.  You get 5 small sized shells, a small, plastic pastry bag filled with the luscious cream that goes inside the cannoli, and a dish with nine compartments for dipping the ends of the cannoli.  The compartments had raspberry sauce, chocolate syrup, chocolate chips, coconut, butterscotch, toffee, pistachio, and chopped peanuts.  If you're counting and only got 8, it's because two of the wells had raspberry syrup.  Tubes and pastry bag:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#sq32kg1eMJezCQzW7W2dTgDipping dish:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#uKRzAlaK3OKmX0AXS_L4cALike my Yelp friends who work at Jean Philippe at Aria, I wielded that pastry bag like a surgeon uses his scalpel.  In no time whatsoever, I had completed my first cannoli with one side dipped in raspberry.Success:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#YFbqugc1i6Yt0wd4ibBihwMy wife, who hasn't been a fan of cannoli before tonight, ate three of them which left me with just two and I did all the work myself.  That's gratitude I'll tell you.  That dessert was fun and it's a clever menu item!Service was excellent!  Alex and crew were always there to help, removed dirty plates, chat a bit, and do everything as well as they could which was very good!The view, while not as good as Alizé, is not bad.  I had a view of the original Palms Tower and being a local, I was studying the streets to figure out where the things in the area I know were located.This was a very pleasant dinner!  I know I'll be back!  Oh, and I'll be calling Jean Philippe in the morning to check about pastry chef openings.It pains me to give Nove 2 stars. It use to be my go to for fancy Italian. My favorite place in Las Vegas. I would have given every experience before this one 5 stars. Now, I will never return. My first time here was for my boyfriends birthday a few years ago. Since then we had been back for a Chef's tasting with Chef Geno with 15 courses. A few of our favorite dishes included the risotto of the day, Nana's meatballs, chicken Marsala, and the death by potatoes. This was my first and only time dining here since the chef I had grown to love moved on to other ventures. I still had faith that Nove would be a great place without Chef Geno. The menu was almost the same. The crowd wasn't. The waiter even mentioned when we asked, that the new chef was "completely different". Not bad, just not the same. Well I think he was being polite. The exact same chicken Marsala dish looked the same but tasted totally different. The meatballs and potatoes were still decent. The gnocchi was too mushy. And the risotto, oh I wouldn't know as they offered it as the special, and then ran out. I waited 20 minutes and ate my entire appetizer before my drink arrived. And there was no new chef coming out to check on us, see how we liked the food, or introduce himself. This always happened in past times when Nove was not busy. Considering we were there late, and the Chef was in view- it could have happened. Maybe my expectations were set too high, but I have had totally different experiences in the past. All of them made me feel great about spending $150-300 for dinner for 2. Right now I am thankful I had a discount on my tickets from the Lisa Lampanelli show, because I would have been mad to pay full price last night. I really hope N9NE group and Nove figure out a way to put the pieces back together. Chef Geno, we miss you!!What a beautiful venue. I went here for my birthday dinner and it was incredible. We started at the bar and grabbed a couple drinks before getting to the table. We had to wait on a few more people to show up. We order some standard drinks to start the night. After waiting we were seating in a table with a view of the other tower. It was so beautiful. We had some cool big booty bushes. We started the meal with a champagne toast and then also order a bottle. They were clearing some inventory so we got a bottle for like $40. We started with the meatball appetizer and started to order our entrees. I started with a Caesar salad and also ordered the 8oz filet mignon. The Caesar salad came out with full romaine leafs which was different but cool. Everyone ordered something a little different. My coworker ordered the pennine alla vodka and it was yummy. I love vodka. I mean i love vodka sauces. :) During our meals we also ordered some drinks. There were jager shots, lemon drops, Moscow mules, and even the tiramisu cocktail. All the drinks were delicious and make to look exquisite. After some drink I was surprised by some yummy dessert. There was cheesecake and chocolates and just yumm in my mouth. I was really glad we got to enjoy Nove. The manager even stopped by the table and gave us his card. He was so nice and asked about the meal. It was a wonderful experience and I couldn't have ask for a better night.Find the hidden elevator entrance, shoot up to the 51st floor, step out and enjoy the view- floor to ceiling windows highlight a great nighttime view of the city, with the Strip to the far right. Walk into the dining room, and you're greeted by a sexy bar and a wall of candles, for a romantic ambiance perfect for date night.Came here for light bites at the bar- menu has a selection of 9 appetizers for $9, cocktails are $14. We ordered 5 apps and dessert, but left confident about returning for a full meal, particularly one with visiting guests who would appreciate the view.FILET SLIDER: Slider, singular, as in one, for $9. Very tasty with caramelized onions and bleu cheese, but definitely should come in a pair.CRAB AND LEMON BRUSCHETTA: Speaking of pairs, this dish came in an odd presentation with five tiny crostini. Considering most diners come in pairs, it would make more sense to make your apps more sharable. However, this was very tasty with a good amount of fresh crab and light citrus accents.FRIED ARTICHOKE: I did not care for this at all. The few fried chunks were served on a bed of shredded lettuce and accompanied by a "spicy" orange dipping sauce that didn't taste like much of anything. Pass.ARANCINI BALLS: Uh, hold the phone. These were delicious. Four plump balls with a thin crust of breading and a bit of sausage inside with the cheeses. This was a better version than the one I ordered at Giadas, that's for sure. ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS: Holy truffle oil, Batman. Generous portion of sprouts, properly roasted til crunchy outside but still tender. But drowning in truffle oil, and oddly interspersed with bits of blackened bacon? I don't know, it was easily the richest batch of Brussels sprouts I've ever had, but it somehow almost worked. Obviously steer clear if truffle oil is a turn off for you.STRAWBERRY CARPACCIO: Curious name, pretty presentation. Sliced strawberries drizzled with balsamic with a scoop of ice cream and a few sprinkles of granola? It's like a deconstructed parfait but with savory notes. I can't say I'd get it again necessarily, but it was a fun, fresh, and light end to our meal.Service was very attentive without being overbearing. The two bartenders who helped us were friendly, engaging, and humorous. I wouldn't come back for apps, but definitely plan to try their dinner menu. I did not like how the apps were served on one giant trough of a platter rather than on individual plates, which would have been classier and more appropriate for the location.

Review Text :
Hot. Cheesey. Fresh. No, I'm not talking about the guests at the opening gala to Phoenix fashion week. We're talking 'bout the cheesesteaks and chicken cheesesteaks we chowed down on after the event. I got  so hungry looking at those skinny models all night. I was this close to nibbling on one's boney thigh. The only thing better than eating these scrumptuous works of art, was having them delivered to the terrace at Hotel Indigo. Yes people. Delivered. Right to our drunken butts. On the terrace. At Hotel Indigo. And how fantastic it is that you choose Cheese Whiz, American or Provelone.? I'm all about the Whiz! How cool and funny and useful is that?During a night of Old Town drinking, a friend and I ducked out for a minute to grab something to eat around 1 AM.  I couldn't tell you where this place is or how I got there (aside from directing you to the map and address shown on the business page here), but coming here had to be destiny.  This sandwich made me complete.  I am afraid to try it sober, as my memories of this sandwich may be crushed.  I can only hope that the next time I am buzzed in Old Town, I can be directed to this establishment once again.I love PSC. Known colloquially as "SANDWHICH SHOP!!!" it's like an oasis in the drunken wasteland of 3 AM Old Town. PSC is open 24 hours, and any restaurant in Phoenix that is such gets an automatic 3 stars in my book, no matter how abysmal their service/food is.Luckily, the sandwiches here are great. And after a few dozen cocktails, they are absolute perfection. Not to say that this is purely "drunk food." It's probably not. I think PSC's food is legit, and I hope that they don't get pigeon-holed into that category, but I haven't ever really been here in the day so I'm not really sure how I would react to the place in the sunlight. But if you couldn't already tell from the previous reviews, this place gets rushed by the drunks when the surrounding bars close at 2. It can get PACKED in here. Claustrophobia-inducing, fire-code-violation packed in the insatiable lust for roast beef and provolone. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait, but biting into a piping hot, mastercrafted 9th Street (spinach, roasted peppers, and cheese) makes it all worth while. Yes it does. Highlight: PSC is the only place that provides an arena for the crowds of BS West, Saddle Ranch, and Axis/Radius to mingle together in intoxicated greasebomb love.Do you like people watching?  This is the absolute best spot to do it if- A. It's Friday or Saturday night B. Between 1am and 3am.You can't hide from the truth of the florescent lights.  Come see the hot mess you and your friends have made of yourselves after a night of fun.  It's okay, everyone else looks just as drunk and sweaty too.  The entertainment value of this place isn't the only reason I go.  I swear by the sobering effects of a chicken cheese steak hoagie with wiz, loud urban music, and the realization that you in fact are not as bad as the girl hunched over her sandwich desperately trying to find her mouth.  I love this place.  I wonder what it's like in the day time, but I don't want to ruin a good thing.Unreal experience... OK, it was after 2:30am, we are both hammered, we are both starving... we call a cab, cab stops right in front of The Philadelphia Sandwich Company on the way home, we stare, drool... look at the huge line and say "screw it"... (in harmony)Get home - several miles north... She takes the dog out for a pee... two folks come strolling by jabbering at high volume.... She askes them to quiet down jokingly, they apologise and give her an extra Philadelphia Sandwich Company Cheesesteak that they had just ordered and didn't need! Complete stangers gave her a PSC Cheesesteak right in front of our condo!!! (they were headed home to chow too).She walks in the door holding the cheesesteak and smiling - I crap my pants and realize that we should have went to the casino that night instead! What are the freaking odds of her walking out at just that moment??? And them having an "extra" sandwich????Mmmmmmm goooood sandwich - Saved me from a life threatening hangover too... WTF!!!Is there a better spot in Old Town for late night, drunk off your ass, gullet stuffing? I think not my friends! Any place where the serving staff can put up with the virtual bus load of people that come in here at 2am on a Friday or Saturday night, deserves 5 stars for that alone. Rae, who works behind the counter, is adorable and likes the witty banter. The sandwiches come out relatively quickly too. I always seem to fall back on the Bada Bing. Italian meats, lettuce, tomato, provolone, and balsamic. It's pretty close to perfect in my book. I hear the chicken cutlet is amazing as well. Sweet potato fries and fried macaroni and cheese should round out your ordering as well. The other perk is the people watching. You are sure to take home or be one of the stories of the night.Eating at places like this one confirms my suspicion that I'm spoiled living in San Francisco. Near where I live there is a place called Phat Philly that uses American Kobe beef and flies in Amoroso rolls for authenticity. Most of the other places in SF use Amoroso rolls as well. The bread they use at Philadelphia Sandwich Company comes nowhere close -- chewy, heavy and generally not good.The beef was whack. Again, way too chewy and not much flavor. There was no hot sauce to be found but I didn't ask for any. The fries were pretty bad and I threw most of them away. I feel a little guilty slamming this place so hard because the staffers were friendly but I call 'em like I see 'em.This is a great place to grab some food after a night out in Scottsdale! I was at an event at Martini Ranch last week, and some of my friends wanted to grab some food after. I still don't know the area that well, so I was happy when my friend Matt C exclaimed cheesesteak! when I asked where they wanted to go.I had a cheesesteak with american, onion, and the works. I was sober at that point, but I'd imagine if you're worried about an upset stomach you shouldn't get a sandwich with three different kinds of peppers on it. It was delicious, and I could only eat half.Service was quick and friendly, with the authentic touch of the guy in the kitchen yelling at people calling them jackasses. It's true the steak could be cut thinner, and the bread isn't the best, but this place fills the late night grub niche well.It was 10:30 pm on a Tue night and after a few drinks at a nearby bar, I was getting a little hungry....so I jumped on Yelp and looked for a nearby place to grab some grub.  I found this Sandwich shop and walked a couple of blocks to check it out.After looking at the menu for a minute, I decided that I wanted a Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich w/Whiz & Jalapenos.  After waiting a few minutes, they brought out my Sandwich.  The Sandwich had a ton of Whiz on it, which is great....but it was light on the Meat.  Usually, places put too much meat on their Steak Sandwiches...not here.  I know Jalapenos isn't part of a traditional Steak Sandwich....and my friends from Philly would've killed me for ordering it that way, but I couldn't help myself....I love to spice it up a bit!The Jalapenos were pretty spicy and added to the flavor in my opinion....good proportion of peppers.  The Steak was kind of bland and the bread was just ok.  I've had better Steak Sandwiches....but this did the job.Will I return?  Probably not.The time has come. I've been holding off on reviewing Philadelphia Sandwich Company for awhile, but it's my late night saving grace and deserves some yelp love. So here it goes. Dear Phildelphia Sandwich Company: My waistline hates you but my late night food cravings after let's say a Halloween block party at Gilligan's and limited hangover the next morning loves you. So therefore, waistline loses in this battle. Love Lindsey Here are some things that you should know about Philadelphia Sandwich Company1. 24 hours. This place is open 24 hours. Pretty spectacular for Scottsdale since I don't think many other food spots literally never close. Not that I can actually imagine eating a cheese steak at 6:30 AM but hey, you never know! 2. Be prepared for debauchery and a line if you go between the hours of 11 PM and 4 AM. Those coherent enough to remember it will have some top of the line people watching to amuse them and those in desperate need of food, Advil, water and sleep will be thanking this place in the morning. 3. The cheese steak sandwich itself is pretty darn tasty! Be warned that it's huge so I suggest sharing unless you've got the appetite. Another tip is to order turkey with cheese. That's pretty delish as well. Since I'm not from Philly nor can I accurately judge how a Philly cheese steak should taste, I will just say this. It hits the spot for a Nor Cal girl like me and while I've only ever eaten it late night (when will power runs away from me), I imagine this would be a tasty meal for anyone craving a little Philly love in their life. And before I go, part of me really wishes I knew about the yelper special (free fries with a sandwich) when I decided to have a little late night meal recently. Then again, I'm pretty sure the Philly Cheese steak was enough by itself.their quality suffers when the crowds come in at 1-2 a.m.\go in the afternoon for their $5.50--a good deal!new location 3 star quality food.

Review Text :
I typed Japanese and my zip code in to Yelp and came up with Korean.  So off I went.I am pretty sure there are several menu options.  I had a lunch menu which had none of the grill options on it and I think there is yet another menu for the sushi bar.  Directly behind me I could hear a grill being used and saw a couple of carts of food go past me to the table.  Would have been nice to see how all the food was used but I probably would have watched closely enough to intrude on their meal.I ordered a sliced beef lunch box ($8.95) and an iced tea ($1.25).  First up was a cloudy bowl of soup with green onions in it, pretty tasty.  After a while lunch arrived in a compartmented  tray.  Front and center was the beef, several gristly pieces.  Off to the near left were some pickled veggies and in the far left were, I think, 3 slices of California roll, a piece of apple, some sort of deep fried thingy and some ginger?  In the far right was sticky rice and in the very center was some Wasabi.  And in the near right was I think a couple of different kinds of bean sprouts, some sort of green leafy veggie and some sort of cake thing.  Even though I couldn't identify most of it I ate it all.  Obviously it didn't taste bad or I would have ignored some of it.The service was ok but not friendly like it was with the regulars.  I would have liked to ask some questions about what was on my plate but got the Big Box store lack of eye contact with every employee that walked past.  Oddly, when they brought my entree they did not take away my empty soup bowl.  I noticed they did that at all of the tables, only busing once.It looks like the back section of the dining room could be partially closed off for a group.It was an ok experience.  I think I would rather go with somebody who knew the foods better.Yes very good and lots of great little side dishes to mix in with your entree.  Kim Chee tofu stands out. for me.  Might be a little pricy her but don't come here to save your money. Im new to Korean food but this place seems to make people happy, sorry for all those hater reviews when you this famous that seems to attract bad attitudes.Hmm, well i don't think its a sushi house but people keep on rating this place like that is their specialty.  I would focus the attention to the home cooked Korean food it has to offer.  And when I ask my Korean Friends they seem to prefer Takamatsu.  I liked Scotts W's  review, unbiased and funny

I ordered Chen and Wok for take out on Saturday. I must say it was pretty darn good! I will give it an a-ok for now even a 3.5, but will return to try more dishes. I'm sure it will creep to 4 stars.What I ordered: Sweet and Sour Chicken- slightly dissapointed because there wasn't a lot of sweet and sour sauce on the chicken chunks. But overall pretty tasty.Vegetable Egg Foo Yung- yummy! The sauce that it came in wasn't just a plain brown gravy, it was an actual sauce with ginger and other seasonings that took it out of the boring realm.House Lo-Mein- That was pretty good. The noodles were a little soggy but still flavorful.House Fried Rice- I would suggest getting any of the other fried rice that they offer. I was hoping for a good mix of all the meats but only ended up with 2 shrimp out of the entire carton. Other than that, the rice was good! I actually really liked it.Egg Rolls- I love a well seasoned egg roll. I only ate one, but wished I had ordered a lot more or didn't have to share my other one. Oh well.. For about 30 dollars, I was able to feed 3 people HUGE plates of food and still had leftovers. I think Chen and Wok will be my new Chinese Takeout from now on!I recently ate here again. The food was delivered prior to the promised LONG wait, and it was HOT and fresh. I have now become a devout fan of this little Chinese takeout place! My dinner guest was equally as impressed with all of the food. I will say that I thought that the sweet and sour was a little dry, but everything else was delicious. We were impressed that they didn't shirk on the shrimp and the shrimp were large and delicious! Is it gourmet and to be served on white linen? No. It's Chinese takeout that you eat in your sweats in front of the TV.  Just wanted to show Chen and Wok some love with another star!Too often my enthusiasm for Chinese food detracts from my ability to say anything meaningful about the establishment. I order, get food, eat food, rant and rave about food, find out that nobody shares my opinion of said food, rinse, repeat.With nearly identical menus and service, I was having a hard time finding something interesting, meaningful, and most importantly funny to say about any of these places. It was starting to cramp my style, and I feared that Chinese food would prove to be the knight that slayed the mighty Jetta Dragon. I bet you all pegged me as the unicorn type, huh.Chen and Wok broke what could have been an otherwise endlessly repeating cycle of pointless reviews by being popular with people I knew and giving me something to criticize them for; their service.First let me start off this review by laying down the obligatory (though not undeserved) lip service.The food is pretty fucking fantastic. Ever since my coworkers and I discovered their menu at the bottom of our "take out menu" drawer, we've been eating that shit like it's going out of style.Normally just the sight of steamed rice makes me flail my arms and scream in tongue, but after that spicy kung pao or house chicken hits me and my stomach balloons with burn and gas, I'm grateful that I'm not being tempted with a side of lo mein. I usually keep a shamrock mmmmmmilk nearby whenever I order anything denoted on the menu as "spicy". Once I experimented with chocolate milk. Turns out chocolate milk and kung pao sauce get along like leather daddies and mountainbike enthusiasts; amicable yet jarringly indifferent. Look up any takeout menu from any other Chinese place, pick five random items. C&W has it, and its fucking DELICIOUS. The food is so good that it warrants the often mindfuckingly tedious task of dealing with the staff. For now, at least.I admit off the bat that I have a skewed perspective. In my group of co-workers I am the official "C&W ambassador."I can tell the difference between chow mein and lo mein so apparently that qualifies me to be a fucking interpreter of the culture.One day not too long ago the IT department managed to pull ourselves away from Japanese Bug Fights and Star Wars done entirely in Terminal long enough to decide that we were hungry, we wanted Chinese, and that although Jetta was in no mood to be yelled at over the phone, she was a bitch and deserved it anyway.I called in the order and was greeted by my friend Asian Lady With The Inappropriately Loud Voice, who after rushing me through my order and snapping at me when I tried to explain (for the fifth time now) where our office was located, would interrupt my giving of the credit card number by reciting numbers that in no shape, way, or form resembled the ones I gave her. You know, to keep me on my toes.One of the people on my order really wanted chow mein with his orange chicken. Chinese restaurants' legendary personal grudge with special orders and substitutions aside, I thought that if we just asked for some on the side and not substituted for their flavorless white rice, maybe they would take advantage of the opportunity to provide something resembling customer service and make a few extra bucks.We all know how this ends, right?The lady argues with me for a while, and then she argues with Clarice for a while, and eventually we compromise; we have to buy A WHOLE ENTREE of chicken chow mein so our friend can eat the noodles. Needles to say my credit card company LOVES C&W.Perhaps to punish me for my insolence, C Dubs sends an obnoxious and easily confused driver in a bad "I'm going to community college to learn how to be a game show host" suit in lieu of our modest and very smiley normal delivery guy. The driver refuses to park in the parking lot and instead drives in circles around the parking lot waiting for me to meet him. After I spend 6 minutes on the phone just begging him to park and wait for me, I spend another 10 waiting for him to finish his victory laps.After botching my name once or twice (how do you get "Liberty" out of "Jetta"? They're not even made by the same manufacturer!), he hands me two plastic bags which he has TIED together (am I supposed to slump it over my shoulder hobo style?) and drives off. Once inside, I find my entree to be so spicy it makes my nose run and my rice to be even colder and more flavorless than usual. Hell hath no fury like a Chinese place inconvenienced.All in all, Chen and Wok is still the Peoria-area Chinese takeout for me. But believe me when I say I've never been so happy and excited to see the Goodcents girl walking towards our office.

Restaurant name  Harley's Italian Bistro
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I'd really like to like this place more than I do.  Central Phoenix noticeably lacks Italian restaurants (if you're not counting Oregano's and pizza places), and Harley's Italian Bistro is in a great gentrifying stretch of 7th Ave (Melrose on 7th) to really impress as a neighborhood Italian joint, but it falls a bit short.I made my second venture here the other night for dinner.  It was a last minute sort of thing, so we lucked out that we were able to get a table anywhere on a Friday night.  I had a hunch that Harley's might be somewhat busy, but not terribly busy to the point of long waits.  We strolled up to find about 13 of 20 or so tables occupied.  But even if it was too busy, it wouldn't have been awkward since we could have passed the time at the homey and spacious bar in the back.  Lot of different types of diners reflective of the area.  Mostly older married couples and tables of gay singles, and a young family or two with kids. The food was OK.  We ordered the fried calamari with marinara to start and it was uneventful and uneven -- some of it too chewy.  I ordered the salcicce al penne and my friend ordered the spaghetti with meatballs - oh yes.  He only got two meatballs, btw.  My dish was alright.  I felt the sauce could have been a bit more flavorful and spicy.  My first visit was with a large party of 10, and I ordered the crusted chicken romano sandwich - very good, but a tad on the greasy side. The server was OK.  Very friendly, but he felt new and seemed awkward at times.  He forgot the parmesan cheese when he brought out our entrees and was diffcult to flag down to ask for the cheese.  So we sat there and stared at our food before we were able to dig in. I'll go back.  But if another Italian restaurant opens nearby, Harley's will have a run for their money.FYI, It's been open for about two years now , and was known as The Roman Table for many years before that.I've been here 2 times, once alone, and once on a boyfriend-totally-messed-up-so-ordering-the-most-expensive-dish-on-the-menu-is-a-must, and I didn't like anything either time. The food was mostly bland and average, and I commented on the tomato sauce having come straight out of the Sysco can and onto my pasta. The service was sluggish, and dare I say I felt the server was hating on us for being straight? This is probably the most off-putting part of our whole experience (this also has happened countless times at Fez, but I digress). Seriously. I think the decor's trying a little too hard to be something it most obviously is not (they should actually stick to being a neighborhood Italian joint, instead of the cheeseball fake plants and Italian "stuff" everywhere), but the oil and herbs combo at the beginning is a welcome touch and probably the only reason I'm going with 2 stars instead of 1.Doubtful I'll be back here alone or with boyfriend.Thank you Amy D. for reccomending Harley's so highly. The girl and I stepped out last night to get out of the house and have a bite and accidently drove by and decided to give it a try.We got Amy's favorite server Justin, who was awesome! (mind you I think knowing Amy D. gor us the VIP treatment) Friendly and attentive and great with advice on what to order. We started with some appetizer that I wish I could remember the name of. It was mozzeralla between white bread, which was then breaded and fired...essentially a breaded grilled cheese sandwhich with marinara over top. Oh my god it was amazing! We each ordered the Pollo Marsala, though I was worried as I am picky about my marsalla and am almost always disapointed when I order it. It was sweeter than I expected, which was incredibly OK. It was so wonderful I wish I had leftovers for lunch today but my willpower was weak and I ate it all including the fetuccini alfredo on the side which was equally flavorful and delish!All of the sauces were far from bland and far from generic. Justin informed us that they don't make the sauces in huge batches but fresh and to order. The prices are incredibly fair and left money in the account to give the generous tip that Justin deserved. We will be back much more often than we should I am sure. Justin also reccomended the desserts but there was simply no room in the tummy last night.I love, love love Harley's.  It was one of the first places I discovered when I moved here, and it remains a favorite.Things that I have had and loved:Fried calamariFried zucchini blossoms (they don't always have these)The calamari pasta dishGnochi with pestoFettucini alfredoChicken marsalaChicken picatta.That's everything I've had there, and every single one was delicious.  The picatta is my new favorite (I've been craving it since I was there last week).  I've taken numerous out of town people there, and they've all loved it too.The only reason I take the star away, is that the service seems to have gone downhill in the past 2 years since the ownership change.  The first time I went, the owner was a little old italian man, and he and his wife ran the place.  The walls were covered with his artwork, and he came around and spoke to everyone as they were eating.  He told us though that he had recently sold, and this night was his last there.The new owners kept the menu, and I believe they kept the same kitchen staff, as well as the waitstaff.  Over the past 2 years though, while the food stayed delicious, the service has become increasingly perfunctory.  Not bad, just not friendly.However, they're still polite and the food is still amazing, so you couldn't keep me away from this place for anything.  Prices are very good, and you can even get takeout (I confess to having binged on friend calamari, a bottle of wine and a girly movie on more than one Saturday night).Go!So this review is a little late in coming - The domestic atmosphere in my life has been a bit suffocating in these last couple days - Wednesday was a particularly stifling night, and for a mid-week change my boyfriend Nathan and I decided to go out to diner instead of just lounging around the house. After a long debate on where to go and the realization that it was almost 9:00 and bar food would soon become our only option, we stopped in the Melrose District outside a little Italian place called Harley's. Even on a Wednesday they were open until 10:00 - The bar, until 11:00 ... Huge sigh of relief.We were greeted warmly and seated in front of these huge windows that look over Copper Star Coffee and Revolver Records (reviews to follow). Warm fresh baked bread with cracked spices in olive oil for dipping started us off. We were talked in to the Mozzarella in Carrozza as an appetizer - This may very well be my boyfriends new food favorite ... It's a thick slice of mozzarella sandwiched between two pieces of bread and lightly fried ... that's right, a kick butt fried grilled cheese ... with home made marinara on top, not that ghetto crap in a can style of sauce. As an entre I had the Pollo Marsala and Fettuccine Alfredo, by far the best I have ever had. The marsala was slightly sweet, served over chicken that was cooked to perfection, and the alfredo was super light in taste and texture ... Not to mention the fact that our service was impeccable, drinks never ran dry and the bread basket was always refilled.I'd like to send a special thanks to our waiter Justin - He was a riot. He knew about everything on the menu, made perfect diner recommendations and was able to convince me and my boyfriend of at least three different lunches, diners and deserts that we plan on returning to try. He's a local artist with a fantastic sense of humor and a true talent for turning a not so hot evening into a night spent in laughter over little plates of heaven.If you stop by I recommend joining the email list so you can get the weekend update on dinner and drink specials - If you manage it, any leftovers will be boxed up for you, labeled clearly and double wrapped in cellophane for easy, spill proof transport to the fridge. Prices are super reasonable too - bigger portions and better food for the same price if not less than the chain style restaurants like, dare I say it, Olive Garden ... Also a portion of the proceeds this Thursday, the 24th, will be spent helping to raise money for the Food for Life charity. What could be better, fill your belly without empting your wallet and giving back to a good cause at the same time ... Dig it!A group of us went last night for Amanda B's sister's bday celebration. The bread was seriously Yumgasm inducing. The waiter was great he had no issues with the large party and making different checks for everyone he was very pleasant thats hard to find these days! Most people hate their jobs and it shows. I had the baked Ravioli it was delicous and my sister had the spaghetti w meat sauce it was a giant mountain of spaghetti plenty big enough for 2 I'd say! She enjoyed it as well. We will return!!What is better than Harley's in the flesh?Harleys day two!I normally hate leftovers, but let me tell you, the spaghetti marinara on day two was absolutely amazing!I have had the Emperor Salad, the marinara and the cheese ravioli. I also had a bite of the gnocchi once. All of the food is extremely flavorful with huge portions. I also think it is reasonably priced. They have a good wine selection; I especially enjoy the Chard. My favorite item is the tiramisu, though. Oh god is it good. Like a little slice of heaven right on the plate in front of you!My only complaint about the restaurant is that it is always really hot in there!  Service was good all times, but I did once have a server who was a tad sarcastic.Overall I really like Harley's and now I am craving some tiramisu!!!I hate to do this to you Harley's, especially considering how fond so many of my friends are of you, but give me a freakin' break!!Can you say overpriced? Can you say completely un-inventive menu? Yes I know that's a made up word, but it fits so deal with it. Can you say laughable wine list?? I can, HARLEY'S.I hate to be so harsh, but my Spaghetti Bolognese tasted like it came from Sbarro at the mall. The pasta was soggy, the sauce was flavorless, I was just completely unimpressed from start to finish. Listen, if you're going to make and serve low-grade knockoff Italian food, be my guest, but don't you dare charge higher-end prices! Don't even get my started on the $10 salad with dressing that so obviously came out of the bottle.In the business of full disclosure, my pasta dish was 800 times better the next day, but more likely as a result of me adding my own sauce to it before re-heating rather than it magically improving on its own.The only saving grace Harley's had for me was our server Justin. He was a doll. Attentive, courteous, and really f*cking hot. So, maybe I'm a little biased, whatever, sue me.I really wanted to like Harley's, I really really did, but sadly, I could not. Especially not with The Parlor opening just a couple of miles up the road.Harley's is my staple for a chill meal.  I enjoy coming here by myself, especially after a hectic day.  Well, I had had a hellacious week and after going to the SuTRA party tonight, with no dinner in my gut, I headed to Harley's around 8:30 for a bite to eat.I get their weekly email, which includes specials.  This week, they debuted new appetizers:  three different kinds of bruschetta.  I rarely get bruschetta because I am just not a huge bread person.  But, I saw "roasted garlic" and had to try it.  I've had just about everything on the menu here.I also ordered the calamari diavolo appetizer.  It's sauteed with HUGE hunks of garlic, served with their spicy red sauce - my favorite red sauce ever!  The bruschetta was ooey-gooey cheesy with a good portion of freshly chopped tomatoes on top.  Made me feel a little less guilty about the cheesy goodness.As always, Ed, the bartender, and my Justin made the evening!  It's such a comfortable place with friendly staff that I never stop raving about it.  Example: http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/what_are_you_eating/Recently I was talking to a friend about how much I enjoyed eating at Harley's Italian Bistro when the restaurant participated in Dining Out For Life. He looked at me blankly and then it finally clicked. "I totally forgot about that place!" he said.It seems that many people may have the same reaction because during several recent visits many tables sat empty, even on a Friday night. Let me just say, you're missing out.It's understandable that Harley's has been voted some of the Valley's best Italian food for several years in a row the food is delicious, comforting and affordable. The sauces are made in house, carrying on a tradition of from scratch recipes dating back from the Roman Table days, if you can remember that far back.Owners Lynn and Mike McGarry have recently updated the space with new artwork and fresh paint, but the friendliness of the staff is unchanged.The food is simple and uncomplicated. Roasted Garlic & Cream Cheese Bruschetta ($8) is bread, cheese, garlic, tomatoes and basil, then finished with a bit of olive oil. Nothing masked or hidden, the flavors of the creamed cheeses and garlic are tasty. I only wish that the tomatoes had been ripened a bit longer, as they weren't as tender as they could have been.Salsiccie Alla Vodka ($13) starts with farfalle pasta combined with sweet Italian sausage, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, onions that are tossed in a vodka gorgonzola cream sauce. This bowl left me reaching for more of the house made bread to pick up the remains of the sauce.When you visit Harley's Bistro's Web site you can sign up for e-mails about nightly specials. For instance, Thursday nights are getting to be known for Lasagna ($10), a thick slab of layered pasta sheets, sausage, cheese and ricotta all baked up hot and bubbly. If I had an Italian grandmother, I'd hope she'd cook just like this, comfort and joy.Available for dinner only Thursday through Sunday, Harley's also serves a mean Hand-Tossed Pizza (small $10/large $13). The crust comes out pale, but the chewy texture makes up for the lack of color. The many toppings include tender meatballs and juicy sausage, paired up with a choice of sauces, including one of my favorites, creamy alfredo. You can't go wrong here.Desserts include the usual suspects, such as Cannoli ($5), Tiramisu ($6.50) and Cheesecake ($5.50). After eating so much, we just shared a few selections of Berto's Ice Cream ($6.50) Pistachio Tartufo and Lemon Strawberry Sorbet. I wish that these had been served in a bowl rather than on a plate with chocolate syrup and whipped cream; some things are just better plain.Food this tasty should never be forgotten.I started my Saturday adventures early, as I knew I had a lot of ground to cover. On the agenda was my regular Saturday trip to the Phoenix Public Market, plus I knew I had to go BOTH the Indian Market at the Heard Museum AND the Melrose District/7th Ave Street Fair. Skipping my brunch meal at the PHX Market, I hoped to get something as I wandered the Indian Market. But oh my the lines were long. Tired and hungry I continued my journey via light rail and foot to 7th Ave and Indian School. After checking out the old cars a few shops and all the booths, I decided to do a sit down late lunch at Harley's. I had worked up quite the apatite. It was 3pm and I hadn't eaten all day. The bar was packed so I opted to be seated at a table near the entrance. My server was very kind and checked in on me frequently. Starting off with some sliced warm fresh bread and seasoned olive oil, I knew I was in for a treat. They were serving off of both the Lunch and Dinner menus. I couldn't decide, but I was given ample opportunity to and finally ordered the Fettuccine della Casa from the lunch menu. The dish also included the house garden salad. Now this took a while after ordering to show. Maybe it was because I was expecting the salad first followed by the pasta. But in this case they came out at the same time. The salad was nothin special but it was fresh and I was hungry. As I finished my salad it allowed my steamy pasta dish to cool to a civil temperature for consuming. This was a generous portion of sliced chicken breast in a tomato cream sauce with roasted red peppers and mushrooms served over fettuccine. After a generous sprinkling of crushed red pepper, it was much better than I expected. For a Lunch portion it was a generous serving. For $8 and change not including tip I had bread, salad and a wonderful pasta dish that I completely enjoyed. I will surely be back to enjoy soon.

Restaurant name  Sirrico's Pizza

Review Text :
Pizza by the slice open until 3:00 a.m. is the lure of Sirrico's Pizza in New York New York Hotel & Casino. Is the pizza good? Nope. Is it worth $5? Maybe. Will you be full? Probably.The line at 12:30 a.m. was about 15 minutes long. Basically, you pick  a slice or two from the pre-made pizzas and then it is reheated as you head to the register. The happiest customers seemed to be those getting whole pies to go.The pizza line also was the scene of one of the saddest things I saw in Vegas. A possibly homeless person right in front of me got a slice of pizza, discreetly folded it, stuffed it in his pocket, and headed for the door. It broke my heart and made me want to give him my slice, too.I got a slice of Jalapeno and Pepperoni. It put some quick carbs in my belly and let me get back out on the casino floor. Let Sirrico's Pizza do the same for you if you are just hungry.New York-New York and pizza go together like a horse and carriage. Sirrico's Pizza is the New York  pizzeria in New York - New York's Greenwich Village. A couple of Saturday's previous, this transplanted New Yorker would put Sirrico's to the test.   It was a busy Saturday night on the Las Vegas Strip. Walking from Fashion Show Mall towards Mandalay Bay, I was up to a light dinner. Secret Pizza was packed. So, I'd drop into New York -New York to finally try Sirrico's Pizza. I'd seen there sign advertising a slice of pizza with a beer for $7.77. However, I never saw the pizza up close. It did not look too appealing. Something about it sitting under the lights. The presentation of the food from the pizza to the pasta, reminded me more of Sbarraros than a legendary pizza parlor from New York. I opted out of pizza and ordered the meatball sub. When I ordered the meatball sub, the cook informed me that it would take five minutes. No sweat! I'd take in the detailed replica of Greenwich Village. I have always admired New York - New York's attention to the New York -New York motif from the steam coming out of a manhole cover to the balconies up above. Way above me, I'd overhear the careening Manhattan Express roller coaster. Down the cobblestone street, Billy Kraus belted out the classics in the Times Square Dueling Piano Bar. In a New York -New York moment time goes fast.  The meatball sub failed to put me in a New York state of mind. It just wasn't very good. Honestly, the meatball marinara at Subway is better. I appreciated that they spent five minutes making the meatball sub. The upshot is that the cheese was hot and delectable. However, I had a below average opinion of the meatballs, which they did give a generous amount of. As I stated earlier in this review, the majority of the food is sitting in trays under lights. This includes the meatballs. When he made my meatball sub, it appeared that he took the meatballs from the tray and reheated it. The outcome was a sub made up of warm and tasty cheese with uninspiring meatballs on ordinary tasting bread. By the time I finished the meatball sub, it was obvious that I will ride the Manhattan Express before ordering it again.  In conclusion, I understand  that New York-New York  and pizza go together like a horse and carriage. However, I believe that a world renown resort of New York -New York's stature needs a New York renown pizzaria.

Review Text :
One of those cheap live show ticket places was doing a great deal by combining dinner and a show.  They offered us a significant discount on a packaged night that included tickets for Ka and a 2-for-1 meal at Nob Hill (both at the MGM Grand).  Unfortunately, Nob Hill was booked up (as well as almost every other MGM Grand restaurant due to an Eagles concert) so we had to settle for their Studio Cafe.For dinner, they had a wide variety of choices, which is usually a bad sign.  Like most other casino cafes, the food was overpriced while the portions were big and filling.  We did not get anything to start except for the complimentary bread.  We also skipped dessert--mainly because they did not have much to offer.  I think they only had cupcakes for desserts.  I rarely see cupcakes on any restaurant menu (and definitely very rarely see it as the star attraction).I went with the grilled Wagyu Prime Rib.  I have had grilled prime rib before (I used to work at a restaurant that made it) and it seemed like a good option because it was both reasonably priced (compared to the other stuff) and would probably be at least okay.The prime rib was probably part-roasted and then thrown on a grill to heat up.  The prime rib was somewhat tender, but it was cooked closer to medium than medium rare.  I would imagine it would be difficult to get prime rib medium rare when you have to grill it.  Despite the Wagyu label, the quality of the meat was not that great.  The flavor wasn't great either.The sides included some mixed veggies as well as a loaded baked potato (cheese, sour cream, bacon, etc.).  The sides were pretty average.The place was pretty busy.  Service was okay.  The food came out quick.  There were definitely spots when the service was inattentive.  Getting and paying for the bill also took longer than it should have.I've visited the cafes at Bally's, Aria, Caesars, and now MGM Grand.  None of them were great experiences.  I've often had to dine at these cafes because the decision revolved around what was close and what was convenient.These cafes may be suitable for breakfast (though some of the breakfast reviews for Studio Cafe are pretty bad).  While I may give a Vegas cafe another shot for breakfast, I think I am going to avoid Vegas cafes for lunch and dinner moving forward.  They are just too overpriced for the below average food quality and typically lackluster service.

Review Text :
Upstairs in Chinatown Plaza is this seafood-centric spot, which shares it's space with Pho Vietnam. Considering seafood is their forte (allegedly), I expected a bit better. Menu options include fish, shellfish, crab, squid, shrimp, and even sea cucumber- basically everything that comes from the sea, plus options that don't (beef, chicken, pork).I had a killer craving for salt and pepper shrimp (labeled here as House Special Shrimp) and found them perfectly crispy, with tons of fried green onion and jalapeno, but the actual shrimp itself was less salty and less peppery than other, more flavorful versions I've had in town.We also got the sautéed spinach, add garlic, and found it to be tasty- comparable to the baby bok choy dish at Ichiza, except with spinach and a slightly less robust sauce. Dish was tasty but a bit gritty, as if it hadn't been adequately rinsed.Service was typical for Chinatown plaza- you order, you receive your food, and you have to hunt them down for anything else.

Review Text :
This was my first experience eating at an Indian restaurant.  It was a group dinner that was served family style and I had no idea what I was eating.  We didn't order off of menus, someone picked the dishes and we all sampled everything.  I wish I asked what the heck I was eating because it was awesome.....however, I was too caught up in the great conversation I was having with friends and my Wife took care of putting stuff on my plate to sample, so I didn't get the names of the dishes.The service was very good.  They made sure our plates were always full.  The only downside is that their credit card machine is old school and takes forever to close out a check.I know this is a useless review for 90% of the people out there, but for those who haven't tried Indian food, I recommend giving it a try.....I was pleasantly surprised and can't wait to go back and try more dishes....this time I'm taking notes.Return Factor - 90%Came here for some take out the other day and had the ol wtf?! moment when I got home. Here's why...The Cabana Salad with added chicken tikka ($10.50) was disturbingly poor. First off, for it to be even a $8 salad (w/o the chicken added) is insulting. It's similar to a side salad you get at McDonalds (yes, this exists). It even had shredded cheddar cheese on top. I'll repeat this. CHEDDAR CHEESE and chicken tikka. Together. WHY? To boot, the tomatoes were wilted, the chicken tikka was dryer than a popcorn fart and I would comment on the dressing but they forgot to give it to me. So, know this going in, they can't even make a salad right... and it costs over ten dollars.  The rest of the meal was a step up (how could it not be?) from the salad. The Chana Masala was average (a bit greasy) and the naan was baamb. My advice? Grab an order or two of naan and dip it in your fave sauces at home. Better yet, find a place that makes great naan and something else to dip it in. NEXT!Eh-ish. I will say this - most of their food was good, but in my opinion, it was very overpriced for a reason unknown to me. I think sometimes it's because it's closer to the strip?? We paid almost $200. That's a lot of money in my opinion. I have a hard time with it because I can get just as good Indian food in a 100% comparable location nearby.We came here on Friday night with some friends. We had 4 dishes, 2 appetizers and 5 drinks total. We had  -3 beers1 wine1 MartiniStuffed mushroom - Very weird for me. It was a very blunt taste of curry, yogurt and a uncooked mushroom that was breaded.Saag Paneer - Very goodShrimp Tikka Masala - Sauce was very tasty and rich. Lamb Rogan Josh - The sauce was okay. I felt they used a little too much curry and it over powered the dish with that and nutmeg.Chicken Mukhani - We actually don't think this was the right dish. It came out and the sauce didn't taste like it normally would for chicken mukhani. It was a bit thinner and not thick like butter chicken typically is. Lamb Vindaloo - good flavor, nice and tender meat. Overall - the service was not good. It took us over an hour to get all of our food. Mainly because the waiter was not coming around to ask if we were ready to order. It was not busy, maybe 5-6 tables total. On Friday nights at 7, it's packed at a lot of places. So, that could be a sign if they're not busy. Again, the food was good - not amazing for a pricier menu. The location and the building itself does not call for higher prices. Neither does the service.OFFSITE DELISHTypically food at the LVCC is just terrible and it's always the same boring food every day like pizza and burgers. So I was excited when I saw that Orgin India had a location inside the South Hall Las Vegas Convention Center. I discovered it during setup and could hardly wait for them to open up on Monday, during the first day of the show. What I really loved was the different menu for all 4 days. No food kiosk here does that kind of variety or even changes their menu like that. There were two options to order. For $13 you could get one meat choice & one veggie choice with rice, bread & sauces and for $16 you could add on two more items of meat & vegetable. On day one, I ordered the Chicken Makhani, Lamb Rogan Josh, Tadka Dal and mixed vegetables. I must say that everything was delicious. My favorite was the lamb because it was so tender. It melted in my mouth. I really loved the sauce from the Chicken and I mixed it in with all of my white rice. The lentils in the Tadka Dal were really good too. After finishing my delicious lunch I only knew one thing, that I could not wait to eat lunch here again tomorrow. On Day two, I ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Karahi, Dal Makhani and Gajjar Aloo. The spices were all amazing again. But I thought I wasn't going to get lunch here because the line went down the convention show floor. Obviously word had spread about the amazing food here. The secret was now out. I thought about getting out of line but decided to stay. I must admit the staff served everyone fast and I had my food in no time at all. I was so happy that it all worked out. Then on Day three, I ordered the Chicken Curry, Lamb Tikka Masala, Sag Aloo and Chana Masala. Everything was amazing and such deep flavors. The potatoes and spinach in the Sag Aloo wouldn't win any awards for looking beautiful but for taste that dish was a perfect 10. Again the lamb was very tender like it had been all of the previous days I had eaten here. I was sad on Day Four because I could not make it over here to eat. I just hope that Orgin India continues making food at the LVCC for future trade shows. I also was lucky enough to get to meet the owner Raja. He was a very nice man and I also told him thanks for delivering delicious convention food. He told me that he had another food cart in the central hall. Wow he is a busy man. I also praised his choice of making different food every day. Raja suggested I try his mango yogurt drink called Mango Lassi. It was both refreshing and yummy, in fact I could have had this drink for a full meal. On my walk back to my booth a few people asked me where I got the bright orange color drink. It was a real attention grabber. I must also talk about the yogurt on the side. It is so good with fresh cucumber, carrot and spices. It is probably the best yogurt I've ever had. I was also amazed at the fresh herbs and spices they used to make the food. On two different days I found real cinnamon sticks inside the chicken dishes. There is nothing like fresh ingredients and it really shows in the taste. So if you are lucky enough to be attending a show at the LVCC I would highly recommend that you find either one of their locations. It's not likely you find Indian food on the show floor of a convention center. I am happy to have found this place and to have met Raja. I wish him much success but I know he doesn't need it because he cares about his food and his customers. He is a very rich man in my book. I look forward to my next trade show in Vegas because I know where I'm eating my next lunch.Situated in an old but accessible part of Las Vegas east of The Strip, this restaurant is a short cab ride away from anywhere. Buffet was about twelve dollars plus drink, tax, and tip. Full bar available. Awkward entering the restaurant... the signage is good outside but when you enter it's like they have construction occurring in the foyer. Anyway, the interior is nicely appointed. They spent some money on chairs and tables for sure. The buffet was decently built up with my favorites: lamb curry, sag paneer, tandoori chicken, fresh-cut red onion, and mixed pickle (achaar). In fact, the food (especially the remarkable quality of the achaar) is worthy of recognition. The people running the restaurant seemed to have a skill at doing so: the waitress kept my water glass full and sat me within a decent amount of time, the six other personnel I  witnessed in various capacities seemed motivated, etc.Why is this review 2 stars? A) This restaurant has a documented history failing health inspections, resulting in immediate closure, andB) When I  went to the restroom... -My-Shoes-Stuck-To-The-Floor-. Let that ruminate for just a second while I  explain the baseboards in the restroom looked like they hadn't been wiped down in decades... And my shoes stuck to the floor. Shoes. Stuck. To the floor. Of the restroom.It's a pity I  won't be back, I think most people who don't care about American-style cleanliness will enjoy this frustrating experience of a restaurant. Not me. I removed my bookmark. I  have one check in, never to be two.The floor. Shoes. Stuck!  -Six- people working in this restaurant and !not one of them! Can figure out how to mop the #;;!!!##:#$ bathroom floor?!

I know this is a popular neighborhood stomping ground for some. And honestly I like the low key vibe, just chilling' kinda joints. Drinks here are affordable.  All in all not bad of a hangout.  It can get super loud when a band is playing (they should reconsider having just acoustic live music, or at least not a full drum set as an alternative to going deaf).So why 1 star?  Well, after witnessing a beat down delivered by an employee against a patron, I honestly don't have anything good to say about this place. (This said event took place before the new year FYI)After several bad press events last year (including a death), you would think someone would care about the reputation and image of the business.  All I know is while I was standing around near the bar, a loud commotion took place at the middle table (where the checker boards table top are). The door/bar back guy punched the guy who was sitting there in the face so hard, there were blood splattered across almost the length of that long table.  The wife was screaming. The rest of the bar male employees jumped on in and dragged this one guy out to the back. Gosh knows what happened to that man.  Wife was hysterical, and she kept being yelled at by the male employees while she repeatedly said stop beating him he didnt do anything.  WTH just happened?! Then it gets better.  The guy who did the face punching now storming back in and yelling at everyone on his way, including me and the people I was standing with, for standing around.  He yelled "this is not your f-king living room, get the f out of the way". Hmm... This is a bar, people stand around in a bar.  Am I the delusional one?  So I could only guessed that he punched someone because that someone was in his way, didn't move and might have mouthed back. My thing is, if you don't like dealing with people, especially intoxicated people, don't work at a bar.  There is ZERO reason why any employee should or need to punch anyone. Management, if you are reading, please don't hire people who have anger management issue. IT IS NOT OKAY, and ganging up on one person isn't okay either.  I go to bars to have fun and enjoy myself.  And I was quite scared and pissed off by that night event.   Maybe they can put up a sign "Come here at your own risk..."

Review Text :
Craving Korean, and not wanting to go near the Tofu Hut per my last visit http://www.yelp.com/biz/0w3BdEOxvwKTpypwbN5kiQ, it was a toss up between D.J.K. Korean BBQ or Mr. Tofu.  After checking out their small and simple menu at Mr. Tofu, we decided we liked the 'full' Korean experience that D.J.K. was offering.With no wait on the past Memorial Holiday for dinner, we were seated at  a booth right smack in the middle.  After perusing their extensive menu, we opted for their Dwaeji Galbi (Grilled Pork Ribs) at $22.95, the BF's favorite of Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap (Steamed rice with vegetables and beef to mix in the hot stone pot) at $14.95, and the Mul Naengmyeon (Buckwheat noodles with vegetables and meat in chilled broth) at $8.95 based on their picture.About nine different banchan was brought to us after our order went in.  It included cabbage kim chee, bean sprouts, salad, marinated octopus with pickled cucumbers, daikon, omelet, raw garlic, sliced jalapenos, broccoli and some kind of dipping paste.  The salad had a nice dressing to it, and was pretty good.  The octopus was pretty yummy as well.We soon discover they are out of Dwaeji Galbi, and ordered the Sanggalbi (Premium beef short ribs) at $26.95 instead.  The beef was good. It wasn't fabulous for the price we paid.  The Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap was average.  At first, the rice seemed a bit mushy.  But the stone pot that it came it really crisped up the rice very well.  (Apparently, this was the best the BF has ever had in terms of crispiness.)  The Mul Naengmyeon didn't quite look like the picture it was presented in.  It came with two slices of beef, one hard boiled egg, some veggies, and few pine nuts.  We asked the waitress about it before ordering and she was honest in her opinion, noting that although she enjoys it, it's a bit different for other people.  It's a cold noodle soup dish and I found it refreshing on a hot day.  They also give you vinegar and horseradishy mustard to mix it up with and this gives the broth the much needed quick.  Back in the city, I'm used to getting tea automatically.  But I guess here, you have to ask for it.  At least they don't charge for it though.I like how the tables are set up here.  At other Korean restaurants, they have to bring this container of hot coals to your table and it's pretty dangerous.  But here, they just turn it on with their gas stove.  And if you aren't going to cook the meat yourself, they simply put the cover on and it's flat like the rest of your table.  The BF was still eating when the cashier girl brought our check to the table.  She didn't even bother asking if we wanted dessert.  (They offer creme brulee, ice cream, etc.)  Asking if they had any shikhye and learning they did not, we were a bit disappointed.  (Had to visit the Asian supermarket next door to get some!)Service - we had the long-haired waitress.  There's this one short-haired waitress that was not so friendly.  When she initially asked us if we were ready to order, and we asked for another minute, she made a "Huff!" sound.  The BF and I looked at each other like, "WTF?!"  Thank goodness the smiley long-haired waitress ended up serving us the rest of the evening and she made up for the bad customer service of the other one.Side note: The restrooms have these gigantic square sinks.  Watch out for the first stall in the ladies' room 'cuz there's a huge puddle right in front and I think they might have a leakage problem per the previous yelper who mentioned the mess too.  Reverse happy hour is 11 pm to 7 am with local ID only and that means 20% off.(You can find pics of our dinner in the business profile above!)I think they are related to Ginseng BBQ on Las Vegas Boulevard.  Total bill with tax and tip: $65.50Total stars: 3.5If you are craving KBBQ in Las Vegas, this places is open 24/7!It is large and each table has the BBQ built in the table with a full hood over it. Most of the tables are actually booths large enough to fit 6 people. The service is friendly and attentive. I was checked on several times.I went with Bulgogi ($21.95) , which came on a heated platter after I was served a large plate of salad leaf greens with a vinegar chili dressing, and 6 side dishes including potato salad, seaweed salad, spicy daikon, kimchee, and Age tofu slices,  The bulgogi was well marinated and served with grilled green and yellow onions, with sesame seeds and a little oil. Bowl of white rice and an OB beer completed the picture.Dae Jang Keum is the name of a woman of 400 years ago who served the royal queen in Korea as a famous and inventive cook. It is also the name of the lead character in a Korean Soap Drama about the same woman. The restaurant decided to name itself after her.I may be Indian, but since coming to Vegas and befriending Koreans in my class, I have quickly become an avid fan of Korean bbq. I've been to a bunch of places in Chinatown, none of which I can remember their names...except for this one...and that's because it's my favorite!Unless you are a Korean foodie or Korean yourself, I would suggest going with Korean friends, so they can order for you and cook the meat for you at the table. Each table comes with it's own "stove" of sorts, and you cook the meat and veggies on it. I usually get chicken, which they will cook in the kitchen for me, because they will spice and sauce it up just the way I like it!You also get a bunch of appetizer dishes before your main course, this includes fish cakes (my personal fave), kimchi (spicy pickled veggies), seaweed, bean sprouts, etc etc. This place is also 24 hours, though I would never venture into Chinatown alone past 10 pm. :pIf it's your first time trying Korean bbq...go to this place!Mr. Tofu was closed for electrical issues and my family had already parked....so plan B we walked over here.  Everything was mediocre and disappointing with this restaurant.  This restaurant only has tables with the bbq grill in the center and parties of 7 are shoved into a little booth with a chair at the end.  They seriously need more table space if they are going to put out banchan and food items.  Due to the fact that the table was so crowded, a glass of water was knocked over.  The waiter...stood there and didn't offer assistance, no towel or additional napkins.  The box with the chopsticks was emtpy, we asked for chopsticks.  We had to ask a few times before chopsticks were brought over.  At one point we asked for additional napkins, and the waiter told us they were available on top of the counter and we could help ourselves!!!  Excuse me?! What did they hire you for? This last encounter with the waiter pretty much sums up the customer service at this place.  Onto the food, the banchan consists of kim chee, pickled cucumbers and radishes, bean sprounts, mashed potato, and broccoli.  Probably the lamest combo of banchan and the least tasty version I've ever seen.  I've had food court Korean with better banchan selection.  I was craving cold buckwheat noodles, since I was introduced to it at Soyo the week before.  However, this place obliterated my craving probably forever.  The noodles are thinner than the first version I had and clumpy.  The beef broth tasted like MSG water....it was altogether a horrible dish.  The galbi was overly sweet and didn't have a nice char on the outside.  The bimbimbap was just average.  The seafood pancake also was mushy and didn't have the crispy exterior that some places can achieve.  The sundubu is definitely not as good as Mr. Tofu....there's a reason why people pick this place as plan B.  Although Mr. Tofu has a much more limited menu, the prices for basic items like tofu soup, noodles, bimbimbap are probably $5 less over at Mr. Tofu.   For me this place will be plan Z...i.e I probably will never eat here again.First and last visit here! High prices, tiny portions, skimpy on banchan... I can't even. We were most of the way through our meal when I asked my mom if she'd try the kimchi and she said no cause it looked sour, and I agreed saying it looked soggy and wouldn't try it... well,  she tried it and made the most awesome NOPE face. Oh and, apparently I'm not to be acknowledged being half Korean and not being fluent in the language. Thank goodness mom is here to help me out and represent the table. We just got the check and my green tea was $5.. what? The most I've seen is $2 and that's if it's not included. Usually some kind of barley or green or black tea is available by default. But the rice was $2, just random. The menu, dude the menu was $38 for kalbi and japchae was at $21. Mind blown.  The nangmyun was "okay," the la kalbi was bland and I kept finding bone spurs, very poorly cut meat. Dae Jang Keum is the name of a very famous female doctor and chef in the Joseon Dynasty (some Korean history for you!). I think this place is trying to bank on its name and location (Chinatown near the strip) but the food portions and quality are low and the menu made me laugh.. out loud. The server was in the corner either picking her teeth or biting her nails and we didn't see her much bit after what I saw I'm okay with that. There are more people working in here than there are customers. Maybe it's a tourist trap, I'd rather drive further to better, and there's a lot better all around here. And yes,  I am writing this on my phone in a booth in the restaurant.

Review Text :
From the marketing literature.....Acclaimed Chef Michael Mina breaks new ground with the debut of STRIPSTEAK at Mandalay Bay, his first steakhouse. With its classic menu, inviting bar scene and sophisticated atmosphere, STRIPSTEAK plays host to guests looking for the perfect filet in a modern alternative to the traditional steakhouse setting. As with Mina's other restaurants, STRIPSTEAK uses only the highest quality ingredients - corn-fed, all-natural meat; line-caught seafood and fresh, seasonal produce. While first-rate components are essential, it is Mina's creative approach to cooking that has made his name.STRIPSTEAK features a menu rife with imaginative interpretations of classic steakhouse favorites using state-of-the-art kitchen equipment. STRIPSTEAK offers three kinds of beef, Certified Angus Beef, American Kobe and 'A5' Japanese Kobe, and is home to two wood-burning grills and six circulating, slow-poaching chambers. The signature slow-poaching method enhances flavor and tenderness by heating the meat for several hours at a low temperature, while the mesquite-stoked grills infuse every cut with a subtle smokiness.***With that said, this place is devilishly good.  The modern decor coupled with a menu that will send your taste buds dancing earns this place the coveted 5th star.  While enjoying my meal, my friends, and the talent on display in walks....da da dum Andre Agassi.  Wow!He was very lively, his presence filled the room.  He was engaging with the many guests requesting pics.  I was too befuddled to reach for my camera.  Don't ask me why something about being so close to a multiple Grand Slam Champion.  Turns out he is a part owner in this latest iteration of Michael Minna's restaurants.  Go, enjoy and keep your eyes peeled you never know who you might catch a glimpse of.One more notch to add to my quest of trying every single Michael Mina restaurant!  Yessss!! (Fist pump)Great, great food.  Does not disappoint.  The duck fat fries are a must, people.  Also, the burratta salad was fresh and delicious, and my boyfriend's rib cap steak was incredible.  He said that it was one of the BEST steaks he's ever had in his entire life.  Coming from a 32 year old extreme carnivore, that's pretty substantial.  Also, my lamb chops were scrumptious as well.In addition, the bill ended up not being ridiculously high as we anticipated.  I'd say Strip Steak rivals N9NE in terms of the type of ambiance and crowd they are attempting to attract.  Go to Strip Steak for a quieter, romantic and more upscale meal.  This delicious, satisfying meal was exactly what I needed after almost killing myself with alcohol poisoning a couple nights before.  I'll be back.Great steaks.  This is one of the top steakhouses in Vegas and one of only a handful that serves true Kobe beef from Japan.Been here five times in the past two years.  The restaurant has been consistently good although expensive.  Be prepared to spend $250/person for this culinary adventure.The ambiance is a little strange.  It is trendy (like all other Mandalay Bay restaurants), they miss the mark with their LOUD music aimed at the 30 something crowd.  I'm that age so I did not mind YELLING to my fellow diners but common, the place was filled with 50 something year old business people.Service was excellent.  This restaurant has an excellent sommelier and a wine list to match his expertise.  Be sure to let your price range be known ahead of making selections.  On a recent visit, we spent over $1,300 for two bottles of wine.WARNING - Do not fill up on the excellent appetizers or you will not enjoy your steak.You are given some duck fat fries and a variety of dipping sauces.  The truffle is to die for.  On to the appetizers, do not pass up the foir gras sliders.   They are incredible.Steaks are what this place is about.  Just skip the common steaks and go right for the Japanese Kobe.  You can get prime steaks back at home.  These steaks seem small (6 - 8 oz) but they are so rich that the small portion size will fill you up.  Do not be put off by the high prices ($180+) for the steak.  Splurge and enjoy.   Be sure not to have the steak beyond medium rare or it becomes a regular piece of meat.Sides are good but again, who can eat that much.  Just enjoy your steak.There is no reason you should have a bad steak in Las Vegas. Michael Mina is making that statement with bold creativity and solid food. I'm a big of fan of anywhere that puts decent thought into the overall layout of the place, decor, sitting, and most importantly the menu. I can't help myself but feel cool walking around in stripsteak. It's like technology, and fashion meets comfort food I wish my mom could compete with stripsteak food around the holidays. I've been here 3 times so far and def see stripsteak becoming a regular place I go with big groups of people before we head out for a crazy night at the club.Start with an extra order of duck fat fries if you are with more than 2 people because they are ammmmmmmmazingly delic. will disappear in a matter of minutes. Along side TRUFFLE SAUCE AND HERB KETCHUP. That alone is my dreams coming true.The flat iron, the flat iron, the flat iron! And A5 filet!For sides I enjoyed the lobster mash and sour cream and onion mash. The jalapeno creamed corn. Wasn't too into the truffled mac-n-cheese even though I love truffles, this wasn't seasoned right and not enough going on in my mouth. It needed a crunch or something,My 700th review goes toward a night of decadent eating!Parties of four are really one of the best ways to experience a menu.  With drinks in hand, we took our seats at a table by the floor-to-ceiling glass walls separating us from the outside world.* Trio of Duck Fat fries with dipping sauces of barbecue, truffle aioli, and ketchup - This complimentary dish was the first to arrive, and yes, they are very delicious and decadent, and oh so good and fatty.  A great way to start any meal!* Potato Focaccia - More complimentary stuff to get your palate going, although I found to be just okay, the Husband enjoyed it more. * Maine Lobster "bacon-wrapped fritters" ($17) - Skewered lobster with bacon wrapped around, and then deep-fried.  A refreshing dipping sauce to cut the fat!* Roasted Beets "burrata, walnut oil" ($15) - The fresh Italian cheese, greens, and beets had the three men at my table fighting over the last bits.* Filet Tartare "american kobe filet, classic garnish, grilled pocket bread" ($21) - Beautifully presented with the rare beef and a raw quail egg resting on top.  Garnishments of mustard, cracked pepper, red onions and the like surrounded it before the waiter artfully mixed it all together and presented it in chilled glass.  So tastefully good, you don't need or want the bread.  * Shabu Shabu "american kobe beef, mushroom consomme" ($24) - A pot of hot broth took center stage as enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef arrived.  A quick swish and a dip of sauce and into your mouth it goes.* Angus Beef Cap ($46) - We all ordered this off-menu cut of beef.  I initially wanted it rare, but was dissuaded to have it medium rare instead.  Cutting into my beef, it was more medium and I was saddened.  A quick glance around the table, and I realized my piece was definitely more cooked than most.  Lucky for me, the Husband was willing to switch his piece with mine.  (That act alone makes him a keeper!)  Once I cut into my newly acquired beef, I was enjoying my medium rare slice with everyone else.  * Mac & Cheese "truffled" ($12) - Yes, it's all that and a bag of chips.  So creamy and good, and not just a hint of the truffle, but it's all over! So yum!  Worth ordering on its own.* Scalloped Potatoes "caramelized onion & goat cheese" ($12) - The onions give this dish a sweetness that complements the goat cheese and potatoes.  * Potato Puree Trio "lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish" ($14) - My personal fave over the other potato dish.  With so many variations of mashed potatoes, how can one not like them.  Very smooth, creamy, and just something you want to eat all to yourself.* Creamed Corn "jalapeno" - I guess we needed some kind of vegetable to offset our meal.  A slight bit of heat from the pepper and it's more creamy goodness.* Beignets "Chocolate Pot de Creme, Macallan 18 Year Butterscotch Pudding, Madagascar Vanilla Creme Brulee" - Take a spoon to the crème brulee and forget the beignets, just hog the pot to yourself.  Dipping wise, I liked the chocolate over the butterscotch in this case.* Coconut Candy Bar "Caramel Ice Cream, Toasted Almonds" ($12) - A very fancy candy bar that's super sweet, and perfect for sharing.* Cucumber Martini - Surprisingly better than other cucumber martinis out there, good enough that everyone at my table was having one because they are that good.* Cherry Caiprihana - The Husband enjoyed this signature drink of theirs as well, and the cherry adds a unique taste to the caiprihana.The service at Strip Steak was probably among the best.  There's a team waiting on you, and they work as a team - with not just clearing dishes, but bringing your orders in and chatting it up with you.  One of the more personal and better customer service experiences I've had in awhile.  Michael Mina obviously knows what he's doing with his food and his staff.  It's no wonder there's a cult following of his restaurants.  They also have restrooms within the restaurant, which is a nice touch. (Most restaurants in the casinos don't have their own restrooms, so you're forced to walk through the casino to use it.)  But there can be a line, which is the downfall of it.My suggestion is to gather a few friends, and only a few, and share a wonderful meal with them all.  With a party of five or more, it's harder to share the appetizers and sides.  You'll share an intimate culinary adventure with them!4.5 starsO-M-G!!  It was just like how it was in the scene from "I Love You Man" where Peter just proposed to his fiance and she is sooo excited that she calls all of her friends to spread the good news of their engagement.  Only, my similar experience occurred when I took my first bite of their complimentary seasoned fries with their special sauces did I realize that it was the beginning of a good thing.  I was impressed that they have manged to perfect french fries with garlic seasoning, bbq seasoning, and regular fries with a crispy outside and a soft center. But, it wasn't the fries that had me calling and texting all of my friends and family.  It was when I took the first bite of their special Bone-in 14 oz Filet Mignon that was the taste of perfection.  It was this moment that I realized every filet mignon that I've ever had was a lie because they never gave me the sensation of knowing that I might have just taken a bite out of the best tasting steak.... EVER!!  Our waitress, Rachel, informed us that it was rare for them to have bone-in filet mignon as their specials.  She recommended it over their American Wagyu and 30oz Porterhouse!!!  Granted that I have never paid $57 for a piece of meat a la carte, but I daresay that it was worth every penny of it!! mMmMm, it was soooo good!!  I can't even describe into words how amazing this steak was, and I am a steak-lover!!  Every new bite of this steak was a surprise because I couldn't believe how amazing it was, and it was a constant reminder of the flavorful amazing taste with each and every bite until the last piece.  I was a bit disheartened when my steak was near completion, since that meant that I didn't have anymore left... despite how full I was.  Its like reading a really good book and not wanting to reach the last pages because one knew that it would over after those pages.  You didn't want to reach the end of the book since it was soo good, one just wants to keep reading it.... just like how I wanted to keep eating.  It was THAT good!!!  Five stars all the way!!!  The BF had their prix-fix $45 clam chowder, prime ribs with three sides, and their amazing chocolate beignets!!  The chocolate beignets  (French Donuts) were amazing, but still did not compare to my steak!!   I will definitely need to start saving money just so that I can eat here every time that I am in Vegas!!  I gotta start a Steak Fund!!  Hence the reason that I was calling and texting everyone about the amazingness of this steak, I hope they can submit their donations to me soon. =wink=I was very excited to have dinner here.  The Better Half & I have been wanting to give it a try for a while.  We had several friends visiting this weekend and decided to have a group dinner here.There were 11 of us in the group.  Before dinner, we gathered at the bar to have a pre-dinner drink.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  He took several pictures of the group at our request and was patient as we gave him 5 different cameras to take pictures with.  The whole time he cracked jokes and told us he would take as many pictures as we wanted....+1 in my book for the service.Originally, we had a reservation for 15 people but 4 didn't make it, so the hostess had to rearrange the table.  The hostess came to get us 10 minutes after our original reservation time....not bad for a last minute change like that.We were seated and our server immediately asked me if we wanted the wine list and who were the wine drinkers in the group.  I gave her the headcount and instructed her to keep our wine glasses full until I said stop.  She obliged and went to get the wine.  I ordered a Malbec from Argentina, it was nice and earthy with hints of blackberry & pepper....perfect! +1 for the wine.The server made several recommendations for the group and we placed our order.  As a complimentary appetizer, they brought out a tray of 3 different flavors of French Fries.  From what I could tell the flavors were BBQ, Plain, and Garlic & Herbs....served with 3 dipping sauces....BBQ, Horseradish, Ketchup.  They were good, the Garlic & Herbs was the best of the 3.When the food came out, it was presented beautifully on the plates and cooked exactly how we all ordered it.....that's rare for a group this large.  Normally there is one or two that has to send it back because it wasn't cooked right, but not tonight!  I had the 10 oz Filet and ordered it Medium Well.....it was tender and the knife sliced through it like butter.  It had a nice juicy flavor with a smokey & peppery finish.....a great pairing for the Malbec...nom nom nom!  +1 on the Steaks.  I took a few pics of the Steaks for foodie viewing pleasure.For a side dish, I ordered the Truffled Mac 'n Cheese....again, great pairing for the entree....I highly recommend it.  The Asparagus was good too.Nobody had any room for dessert, so I can't comment on that.  Overall, the dinner was a big hit with everyone.Will I return?  You bet your Steaks I will!!There's a few ways you can look at a restaurant but a review should include all the different perspectives.  Quality of food:  The food here is good.  Not great (4star) not amazing (5 star) just good.  The steaks were cooked perfectly how you ask and they have a pretty decent rub on them.  They are aged and tender as one would expect from any big name steak house.  They gave us a complimentary selection of pommes frittes which were delectable and the truffled mac and cheese was tasty.  However, not a single one of these items mentioned above was better than a 3.5 star rating.  You could argue that my palate cannot discern the difference between the beefs, but I would like to at least think I can tell the difference between a grain fed cow and one that is massaged by the japanese from kobe.  It also could just be that I've had so many steakhouse steaks that an aged piece of prime beef with a generic rub of salt/pepper just is old hat to me.  Service: The service is very good.  As expected from any high end vegas restaurant, they were very attentive and always served you with a smile.  I was amused with the sommelier we saw opening a bottle of wine.  You see, our table was right next to the small station where they open all the bottles of wine.  One table ordered one with a synthetic wine cork.  I know from experience those things are a B*^%@ to open.  It was comforting to know that a man who drinks and dispenses wine for a living also has problems with said cork.Ambiance: Dimly lit, contemporary decor, open kitchen with the meat locker right next to it.  The restaurant is a great place for a date.  Price: This is where I felt they fall WAY short.  We walked out of there for about 70 to 80 per person.  This included a steak and a side.  The lady got a sirloin steak and i got the ribeye.  If you've been out, you know that the sirloin is the cheaper of the few cuts.  That's why I was surprised that the total bill was pushing over 150.  Dont' get me wrong, the strip steak was great.  The ribeye was good.  But in all honesty, I'd rather go to Ruth's Chris or Flemmings where they have something unique.  The broiled steak with butter.  Quality of the meat MIGHT not be as good but it doesn't fall too far away from that at Stripsteak.After going to Michael Mina's in Bellagio and coming here. I was excited at first but disappointed after leaving.It was good.. but not GREAT. They offered two complimentary appetizers to begin with:1. 3 small selections of pommes frites: paprika, truffle, and duck fat each accompanied with their own dipping sauce.my favorite has got to be the truffle pommes frites. 2. garlic / cheese / rosemary flatbread.As expected the price was high. But for what I've ordered: a 12oz skirt steak, medium-rare. I expected to have better presentation. Not just a slab of beef on a white plate with a half sliced baby carrot and small roasted onion as the side. I guess i was expecting a little more show for the price i'm paying.My steak was cooked perfectly and it was juicy (well it BETTER be for the price i'm paying). But it was nothing special. I don't know - it's hard to explain.. I mean i enjoyed my steak, but it was not memorable.I ordered a side of truffle mac & cheese. I enjoyed it a lot. It definitely has the truffle and cheese - i dont mind eating the whole thing by myself.My friend ordered a seared ahi tuna steak.. which was not good at all. the tuna did not have any fresh tuna taste (not saying it was not fresh.. but a good tuna has a fresh taste).. this one here was kinda bland. like a fake watered down tuna taste (dunno if that even make sense, but that's how i'd describe it). I know i know, why would u even order fish at a steakhouse, right? but hey, i still think that if you're going to charge people that price, at least make it LOOK good, even if it doesn't taste good. The presentation for each dish was kinda boring.The Skinny: a step up on the regular steakhouse, this place delivers some good eats with finesse and occasional missteps - don't order the duck fat fries because it comes as a sizable amuse bouche (4) Service: our waiter/servers were great but there are major issues with the hostess stand (3) Value: considering the plethora of deals on Restaurant.com, this place can be a good value if you order right (4).My hubby was hankering to take me here for a while and we finally got a chance to try the menu at Stripsteak.After passing by multiple restaurants with hostesses soliciting our business, we were taken aback by the inefficient hostess. By our seating time, there was least 3-4  group of guests gathered around the hostess desk. She basically ignored the diners and the wait staff  who lined to find out how to seat us. She also didn't tell us about ongoing promotions at the restaurant: ie, the 3-course prix fixe menu for $55, or that they are currently having a half-priced happy hour lounge menu from 4-7pm. Plus, they don't offer  you their prix fixe menu unless you specifically ask for it... even when you're seated at the table. For this reason, despite the stellar service at our table, the service gets 3 stars.Michael Mina is known for preparing a dish in three different ways. So obviously our amuse bouche consisted of Bay-seasoned, garlic herb, truffled duck fat fries served with accompanying truffle aioli, ketchup and mustard/bay-seasoned sauce. The fries had a lovely crispness that retained its texture even when it cooled off. The sauces were lovely especially the truffle aioli. I considered drinking the remaining dregs of it on the bottom but decided I still needed to save my appetite for food we'd ordered. The soups were solid but nothing special. The vidalia onion soup accentuated the sweetness of onion but the croutons really lack that nice crunch. The seafood chowder was  good - the broth was a little on the milder side which allowed for the diner to get the full flavour of the crab when eaten.The foie gras sliders had the right flavour however the bun was definitely overly large considering the serving of foie on the inside. The plating would have been infinitely improved with having the bun on the side.By far the standout was our bone-in rib-eye. It's rare to see me shovel down an entire steak the size of a catcher's mitt all on my own but there was not a scrap of meat left on that plate. Yes, it is that good. The carmelized crust on the meat was so wonderful, the inside so tender and well-seasoned ... it's hard to find steak that well-prepared. It was lovely that they provided a small tasting of three sides along with the rib-eye. The peas were okay - a little on the mealier side of things. The truffled mac 'n cheese is always great - perfect consistency, texture and flavour. Unfortunately, the creamed spinach had a rather bitter unpleasant undertone.The hubby's grilled chicken (they don't fry a serving of chicken unless two people order) was a very large portion. Half a grilled chicken - a lovely crispy skin, tender and moist on the inside - on top of their wonderful mac 'n cheese. Who wouldn't like this?We topped off our very filling meal with a root beer float and warm chocolate chip cookies. We loved the fact that the ice cream was so cold, it turned our creamy root beer into a nice slush. The chocolate chip cookies were a delight - not too sweet,cool enough to have a mild crust on the outside with melting chocolate on the inside.Overall, we had a wonderful meal for a very reasonable price due to the Restaurant.com certificate. We ordered one prix fixe meals ($55 + $10 supplement for the steak) plus two starters (foie gras $22; onion soup: $17) and one entree (chicken $30). Subtract the $50 Restaurant.com certificate (we got at bargain basement prices), the meal ended up being $118.97 (including tax and 18% tip) which is reasonable considering the quantity and quality of the cuisine. Definitely a solid four star review.My husband and I were staying at Mandalay Bay when my sister in law offered to babysit. (For those of you who know me, or have kids, you know this was a magical moment). I got on my Open Table app and made a reservation for 2. Luckily, I also had a $50 restaurant.com certificate. We were sat in a lounge type area, very low couches which were slightly uncomfortable, that is until the wine arrived. A server brought us the duck fat fries trio with three different sauces, "compliments of the Chef". They were very good, but I wasn't about to waste stomach space on fries. We both had a couple and then focused on wine and our romantic night out. Mr. R ordered the 8 oz American Kobe Rib Cap, I ordered the King Salmon, we also shared the truffled Mac & Cheese. All three dishes were prepared perfectly. I highly recommend the Mac & Cheese. The staff was both helpful and kind, they never rushed us or were over bearing. Our restaurant.com certificate ended up taking care of tip and tax, which is better than nothing, but I think I will be on the look out for $100 certificate next time. On our way out, the server brought us a small bag of caramel popcorn drizzled in dark chocolate. If we ever are blessed with a babysitter again, we will happily return.There are three things that are a must for any Vegas trip... 1) Hot sweaty dance floor action 2) Titties at the Rhino 3) A big fat juicy piece of meat from StripsteakAs far as the steaks go, my personal recommendation would be to get the 18 ounce dry aged bone-in ribeye ($52).  Its fatty, flavorful, and absolutely satisfying, but If that's not enough for you, Stripsteak also offers a much larger 30oz Porterhouse ($69). And for those who want a little slice of heaven you can opt for the 12 oz gold label kobe steak for a whopping $85.  Might as well right...And we all know that no steak dinner is complete without a few sides.  My faves include teh the scalloped potatoes and the truffled mac and cheese.  I would say that one side per person is about right, but keep in mind that they do send over complimentary duck fat fries to get the juices flowing while you wait for you steak.If you're in a rush and want your steak pronto let them know you have to catch a show and they'll throw that sucker on the grill and have it ready for you in no time. Oh and before you head over to Mandalay make sure to hit up restaurant.com for a $50 gift certificate.  Below I have also included some eating instructions for you.As soon as your steak arrives please take the following steps to ensure maximum satisfaction.  1. cut your steak one bite at a time 2. do not stop eating until you have finished you entire steak (fat included)3. once you finish your steak begin to eat the steak off of your dining companions plates.4. If they resist stab them in the neck with your knife then proceed to eat their steak as they bleed out.Two and a half years and another dozen visits since my initial review, StripSteak remains one of the top new American steakhouses in Vegas.For starters, do not pass up the foie sliders.  This signature dish is topped with a tangy pineapple chutney and sweet onion jus that perfectly balance the richness of the foie.  Incredible.  The Kobe beef carpaccio, finished with south east Asian flavors is delicious.  Different from most, the coconut and Thai chili focuses the flavor of the raw beef and brings out its natural sweetness.  The duck confit spring rolls and Maine lobster fritters are also worth a try.Sadly, A5 grades of beef are no longer offered.  The most flavorful of their current steaks is the American Kobe rib cap.  Sublime beef flavor.  Heady umame from the wood burning grill.  Great texture.  Add a side of roasted marrow bones and you're in beef heaven.   (I promise I don't eat liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti). Non-beef mains?  Who knows.  You don't go to a steakhouse to eat chicken or fish.Desert?  No room.The wine list is outstanding, with a lot of gems from around the world.  Vegas resort pricing except for more expensive bottles where the markup is low.  Very Important:  The typical guest at this hip steakhouse has a lot of, how to put it,  disposable income.  The sommeliers try not to insult guest by asking how much they want to spend but rather make recommendations based on the caliber of the first bottle selected.  Save yourself the grief, Speak clearly and tell them what you want to spend.  Its not fun to be presented with an unexpected four figure wine tab.Service remains excellent.Highly RecommendedI recently realized that I've had excellent experiences at every Michael Mina restaurant I've been to.  Seablue, Nobhill, American Fish etc.  They're all at least 4 stars and sometimes more.  This past trip to Stripsteak was 4.5 stars.  I have been here at least 5 times and I always bring a $50 restaurant.com coupon.  This isn't a top 3 steakhouse in Vegas but $50 off from $100 makes it a terrific value for a really solid steak.  We've recently been ordering the $72 porterhouse which is a monster cut that can easily be split 2 ways and even 3 if you get an appetizer or an extra side.  They'll bring it out to you in a pan already carved up if you want a la Peter Luger style and that's what we do.  I also love all the meaty goodness on the bone itself.  To me, kobe beef is basically that really tender, juicy part by the bone all blown up into a regular sized piece of steak.  My wife loves the filet so I eat the majority of the sirloin side which is just fine with me.  We like it rare.The sides are $14 each so 2 of those gets me to a $100 exact.  The spinach souffle is the absolute must freakin have side dish.  I don't think there's any other restaurant doing the souffle quite like this.  The server brings it to the table piping hot, punctures the top of it and pours cream into it.  One of my favorite sides ever.  I am over creamed spinach!  We're through!We went with the mushrooms cooked in bacon for our second side since we already loaded up on starch from those awesome complimentary fries they bring to the table.  Forget bread, forget appetizers, you've got french fries!  I never make it to dessert anyways.        But the kicker this evening was when it came to box the steak.  We had asked the server to box up the 2 leftover pieces along with the bone itself.  The general manager was assisting the servers and busing tables.  She accidentally threw out the leftovers not hearing the server ask her to box it up.  I didn't make that big of a beef (ha) about it but she proposed the chef to cook us another WHOLE porterhouse and box it up for us!  I was stunned.  Talk about going above and beyond!  Who are we to say no to another $72 steak?  Wow.  This was an all around great experience and I look forward to the next time.Another wonderful meal in Vegas! We came here to celebrate my stepmom's birthday and everything was fantastic! Our waiter was awesome, the drinks were superb, the food was top notch, and the ambiance was great! No complaints about Stripsteak at all.For cocktails I highly recommend the Cucumber Martini and the Moscow Mule. Both of those drinks were phenomenal. Their drink menu is an iPad with a really cool interface that allows you to easily browse all their drinks.We were served complimentary fries upon our arrival, since there were five of us, they brought two servings of them. All the fries are cooked in duck fat and seasoned differently, I know for sure one was truffle, but I don't recall the others. The dipping sauces were great, one was truffle, one was mustard, and the other I don't remember, but everything was delish.I split the lobster bisque with my stepmom, so they gave each of us a small bowl. My favorite lobster bisque was at Craftsteak, but they can move over, because my new favorite is at Stripsteak. Love, love, loved this bisque! I ordered the grilled diver scallops, which were delicious and reasonable. Four large scallops for under $40 is a pretty good deal, especially in Vegas. They are mesquite grilled and they were wonderful. I sampled everybody else's food, all of it was amazing!Halibut - Also mesquite grilled, light touch of lemon. Perfect.King Crab Legs - Served with drawn butter and lemon, and they removed the shells for my sister in law, very nice of them!Dry Aged Bone-In Ribeye - Only one person ordered steak at the steakhouse, lol, but it was one of the best ribeye's I have ever tasted. I would get that if I come again.American Wagyu Burger - Awesome burger with a really good mustard flavor to it.For sides we shared the Truffled Mac & Cheese with Peas, Potato Gratin with Gouda Sauce, and the Creamed Corn with Jalapeno. All amazing. The portions appeared to be pretty small, but they were actually perfect considering all the other food we had, we ended up leaving some of the sides behind.For dessert with ordered the Beignets with the trio of sauces. We were given six light, airy, hot beignets with a very scotchy butterscotch sauce, a creme brulee sauce, and a chocolate pudding sauce. Mmmmm, I would come back to this restaurant just to get dessert again!Dinner was $600 after tip, for five people, lots of cocktails, entrees, sides and dessert. Pricey, but about what to expect when you come to a nice steakhouse in Vegas. I hope to dine here again someday!I have been to as many Michael Mina steak restaurants as possible after falling in love with Bourbon Steak in DC. I mean they give you French fries instead of bread- what's not to like? That being said I would say my experience at the Vegas restaurant was slightly worse than in DC or SF but I am a Niles Crane-esque nitpicker so don't let that deter you. Also, Stripsteak is in the Mandalay Bay which makes it a bit easier to get a table/reservation on the weekends as its not nearly as popular a hotel as it once was (something that also lends to the Border Grill brunch). There are like 3 negative reviews where the people say " I can make food better than this"- I'm not sure if they all climbed out of the same clown car together but if they can actually make better food they are in the wrong industry. The SteakI always get a bone in ribeye when I first go to a steak place as a basis of comparison with other restaurants. The ribeye here is a bit smaller than usual (18 oz vs usual 22 or more) and I actually think the meat was a little tastier. The steak had been trimmed a little more than I would like (fat= flavor) but it didn't seem to have negatively affected the steak. The curst was nice and salty- good. Medium rare was a deep red-good. The price (59$) is pretty average for Vegas steak joints on the strip. My dining companion got the Waygu  vs Waygu entree and that was fantastic- probably what I will get the next time I go (although bacon rapped veal is pretty enticing as well) The SidesSome people, after eating 2 lbs of French fries, might think "You know what; I probably don't need another potato side". We call those people losers. The reason these underhumans won't be dining with me is because Stripsteak has a little something called the Potato Puree Trio- much like the fires it delivers 3 different kinds of potato including one that is pureed with lobster. Perhaps I am a philistine but the lobster potatoes were actually freaking awesome. I know it probably shouldn't be done, I know it's probably not the choicest lobster bits but jesus... it is good. The mac and cheese- I also always get this when available my first time at a steak place and this one did not disappoint. It was quite "crusty" with lots of bits on top which I like. The mac itself was perhaps a little dry but I would rather that than have it swimming. Broccolini- had a very nice amount of garlic flavor which made this usually inedible weed actually taste pretty good.***StripSteak is a typical Michael Mina restaurant that provides safe and consistently good cuisine, which is a plus in Las Vegas given the mediocre and overpriced food that you will often find here (even at acclaimed restaurants)***There is definitely a comforting consistency with Michael Mina restaurants regardless of the location. You are likely to have at least a satisfying dinner at a Michael Mina restaurant because his cuisine focuses on quality ingredients and tried and true flavor combinations. Michael Mina restaurants though do not veer much from his style so I am rarely surprised by his food. Michael Mina in San Francisco is his best restaurant; that restaurant definitely has a few real high points though its food would not compete with San Francisco's best high-end cuisine. I remember finding Michael Mina in Las Vegas being good but nothing memorable. Their menu has changed quite a bit over the years and seasonality seems to be playing a larger role so maybe I need to give them another shot. StripSteak in Mandalay Bay is a Michael Mina steakhouse. It has all the trademarks of a Michael Mina restaurant with Asian influences throughout the menu and a variety of high quality beef available to order. Like Michael Mina's Arcadia in San Jose, StripSteak starts you off with a complimentary trio of fries and sauces. Fries with different seasonings like truffle oil as well as different sauces like curry ketchup and mustard aioli. The fries were hot, crispy and definitely addictive. I tried two of their beef cuts. The best was the Wagyu rib cap. This beef was very rich, juicy and tender. It did not match the best rib cap I've had, which was at Splendido in Toronto. That Canadian restaurant not only delivered an exceptionally rich and juicy meat but also an incredible bark that was crispy and smoky. Still, this was the kind of beef course many would love because it was as flavorful as it was juicy and tender. The other steak was disappointing. It was a Prime bone-in ribeye. The steak was too thin so there was not that great contrast between a nice sear and a thick and juicy center. While it was by no means a bad steak, it would definitely not be in the same category of excellent thick ribeyes you can get at a high-end steakhouse like Mastro's. The steak was garnished with complimentary bone marrow. I also added grilled foie gras, which was fine but too pricey.For sides, I had the pork belly fried rice that was mixed with carrots and peas. The fried rice was quite spicy, which definitely differentiated it from a lot of fried rice dishes I've had. I enjoyed the heat though I am not sure if this is the best pairing for simply prepared and seasoned steaks. I also tried the asparagus with yuzu butter. The asparagus was thin and tender and not too bitter. The butter sauce was not too heavy and provided a good citrus element to the asparagus. For dessert, I had the beignets with three sauces. The beignets were fairly good. They were light and pillowy though not as airy as the best beignets I've had at restaurants like Village Pub and Spruce in the Bay Area as well as what I used to enjoy at the now closed Hatfield's in Los Angeles. The sauces were not sauces as much as they were mini desserts. There was a very good creme brûlée with rich and thick vanilla custard and a crispy caramelized sugar top. There was also a salted caramel pot de creme that was sweet and salty as well as very thick. The last sauce was a butterscotch pudding. The pudding was creamy and the bitter burn was definitely noticeable. Service was good--friendly and polite. It is a loud and frenetic restaurant so it is no surprise that the service might have been a little less attentive and personable as some other high-end restaurants I've tried. Prices are high, but it is Las Vegas. I think StripSteak is within the same price range as other high-end and celebrity chef backed restaurants in Las Vegas. As mentioned, StripSteak is a loud restaurant. It is dark, contemporary and definitely energetic. I did like how while the restaurant was very close to the casino, a lot of the seating was very deep into the restaurant so guests are not bothered by the cigarette smoke that engulfs a lot of Las Vegas. I did find the chairs, which had low backs, to be slightly too uncomfortable for a long dinner. StripSteak is a perfectly fine Las Vegas steakhouse. I think StripSteak really separates itself from other steakhouses I've been to across the country with its sides. The sides here are more interesting and taste fresher than typical steakhouse fare.  The rib cap was very good while the ribeye was disappointing. If you are a big steak fan, I would recommend Carnevino, which delivers thicker and more memorable beef, but StripSteak seems to offer excellent choices from starter to entree to dessert, which is a rarity in Las Vegas.Like most casinos on The Strip, parking at Mandalay Bay is free.Ooooooooh LORD! This place is going straight to the top of my PorkBelly Paradise list. Seriously though, I would come back JUST for that succulent, perfectly flavored, slightly crunchy yet still juicy and amazingly divine  P O R K   B E L L Y.  Honestly I can't talk about much else right now, because I'm drooling all over my keyboard while I dream about it. How am I going to tell all the other Yelpers about the entire experience? I can't. TOO BAD! You'll just have to hear me go on and on and on... and on and on and on... about the pork belly. Okaaaaay fiiiiiine, I suppose I should help people figure out if they should dine here blah and try some steak or maybe blah eat some other dishes or wine dessert blah. I'll try to move on, I swear. Here goes nothing!FOOD:---------To be honest, not much else stood out during this meal other than my soulmate (aka PB). Everything else was slightly underwhelming. Surprisingly, the complimentary **Duck Fat Fries** were pretty bomb, and the second best thing we ate here. Very light and crispy and goes well with any of the trio of sauces.Second up was our appetizer, none other than the incredible! super edible! pork belly--its proper name being **Instant Bacon** ($22). See opening paragraph for my full assessment of this dish.Since this is a STEAK place, we figured we'd better order one. The **10 oz Prime Flat Iron** ($48) did not live up to expectations and was definitely not worth the cost. Even thought it was done medium, the meat was dry and lacked flavor. Super disappointing.For side dishes--often the best part of any meal--we got the **Potato Gratin** ($17) which came with gouda and the **Creamed Spinach** ($14) topped with bacon streusel. Both were decent but neither really met my side dish hopes and dreams. However, they did make the steak easier to eat!The **Vanilla Cheesecake** with strawberries and shantilly cream was the chef's special for the night. It was simply perfection. Thank you to executive pastry chef Monica Delgadillo for helping us end the night on the right note.AMBIANCE/SERVICE:---------------------------The storefront is super impressive with full glass panels and brightly lit signs indicating your dinner destination. Even the reception desk outside is lit up, so there's no question where you start your journey. The attire here is mixed, some in cocktail dresses and others in casual/business casual attire.From the hosts to the servers to the bussers, everyone was extremely pleasant. Our server was particularly helpful, especially since he's the one who alerted me to.... PORK BELLY!!!! aka Instant Bacon. I will be forever grateful. TIP: I would return here for (at least) three  --3-- Instant Bacons and the pastry's special dessert for the night.DATE TIP: You can test out someone new when you LOSE IT over the Instant Bacon.Cow done right.Yet another 2.5 years from my previous review.  Yet another dozen visits in that time.  StripSteak continues to evolve and prove its dominance as one of Vegas' top steakhouses.This is a steakhouse so starting with the steaks.  Japanese A5 is back.  Although the brand is not specified, one slice into the heavily marbled beef (if ordered simply seared and raw on the inside) showcases its classic, deeply marbled, gentle beefy flavor, and melting sweet fat.  As good as it gets and at $35/oz, well worth it.  Tip:  Do not order more than 6oz.  The richness will fill you up very fast.Up next, the American Mishima wagyu.  Running A3 - A4 quality, these steaks are tender with a more pronounced beef flavor.  The fat is nowhere near as sweet as the A5 but still plenty good.  Opt for the rib cap if available.  It has the deepest beef flavor and is by far the most delicious.An Australian wagyu offered as a tomahawk is very good.  To be shared (even if the bartender tries to tell you you can eat it by yourself - eyes bigger than stomach - epic fail).  A step down in tenderness but if beefy flavor is what you want, good balance.Finally the angus beef.  If you love American style beefy flavors, it's ahrd to pass on the UDSA prime flat iron.  A true butchers cut.  Packs mineral, beefy flavors.  Good chew and nicely integrated fat.All steaks (except the A5) have a very good sear, cooked to temp, with a very even core.Sauces and toppings if you must; foie gras butter is liquid crack.  Talk about richness with the distinct livery flavor of the foie.  Pairs beautifully with the bitterness from the wood burning grill.  Note:  do not add this to the Japanese A5 unless you want a heart attack.Sides are meant to be shared.  Do not pass on the truffle mac and cheese, baked potato with bacon marmalade, or bone marrow topped with a matsutake chimichurri (the tiny bits of matsutake add an unmistakable umame finish).Bouncing back to starters, three true standouts, the Mina classic foie with roasted pineapple, brioche, coconut milk and macadamia nuts, the braised oxtail French Onion soup, and the steakhouse staple, classic wagyu filet tartare.  All taste as good as they read.Service is practiced and polished.  Very knowledgable.  Steakhouse friendly.The wine program remains strong though somewhat lacking in vintage depth.  Many great choices.  Vegas resort pricing.Raising the bar once again for the top tier steakhouses in Vegas.

Review Text :
So a co-worker took us to this place.  I barely know this co-worker, which is to say that I have no idea if she's a culinary idiot or if she's worth listening to.  I have issues leaving my comfort zone.Well we ordered the Kew Something appetizer, which is basically pork wontons.  As in, seven pork molecules in a wonton with some sweet and sour on the side.  Tasty, but not the sort of thing that I'd pay $6 for.  One star deduction.But I had Kao Pad (which is a little disturbing sounding) but it is essentially fried rice.  With onions and tomatoes and egg and scallions.  She asked if I wanted it spicy.  I did.  She looked at me like I was a fool, as if I couldn't hang.  I can.I don't generally love fried rice with spice, but I do like rhyming.  So I tried it, and it was amazing.  Really probably the best fried rice I've had in years.  Next time I'd try beef instead of pork but no complaints--for $8 you get a ton of it and it is sensational.The spice is pretty hot.  I got hot, which is not as hot as Thai Spicy, but still spicy for sure.  I was fine with it, because that's just how I roll, but Dallas G's head was sweating profusely, creating quite a look.  Kind of like a shabby chic, with sweat.Anyway.  I have yet to try anything else but what I had was delish.  And unlike my suspect co-worker, you can trust me.I just had to update my review to five stars because this place is THAT good. Seriously.We now have a new weekly meet up called #ThaiTuesday (or the occasional #ThaiThursday) and I cannot imagine living a week without this delicious treat. In fact, this week I had it Tuesday and Friday. Plus I will be back Monday and then again next Thursday. I guess you could say I am addicted.This is the first restaurant I have been a "regular" at.. and I love that they know my exact order. Although I am having a splendid love affair with the yellow curry (medium-hot) today I also got the Kao Pad with Tofu... its my new obsession!The Buddhas delight appetizer is amazing too. Deep fried tofu wedges with a spicy sweet peanut sauce. MMM MmmMMM.Do yourself a favor and compliment your meal with a pot of jasmine hot tea too!When my office moved from its other location, I thought that was the end of my Thai food for lunch, since the place I used to go to is now on the other side of town, but a friend told me about Yupha's right up the street from, so I thought it was time to go investigate! Grabbed a couple of coworker/friends and off we went!We arrived little after 12; we were a party of 3 and were seated right away. After I sat down, I looked around and thought this is a really cute place, I like how its set up and how the lights hang and the art on the walls, and how tables are divided by bamboo, I liked the place just by site now.Now I was looking at the lunch menu, soo many choices to pick from, I had been craving Pad Thai forever, so for this trip that's what I ordered, the Pad Thai lunch special, and some Thai Tea. With the lunch special it came with soup and salad, and the soup and salad are all you can eat, wow that's cool, because the lunch special price was like $7.99, that's a bangin good deal!The salad was good, but what made it great was the spicy peanut sauce they have for the dressing, OHHHH MMMYYY GAWD!! That stuff is amazing, I think next time I'll have less salad and more sauce , I know, that's bad, but it's that good, and the soup, that's great tasting soup, it's a vegetable soup, but extremely clear broth, so tasty! Glad I gave it a try, because I'm not really a soup person.Ok when I ordered my lunch, the waitress asked what spicy level would I want it, I was thinking of playing it safe since this was my 1st time there and I was unsure, and she told they have different levels, no spice, mild, medium, hot, Thai Hot, Double Hot and Triple Hot, and I thought to myself, if they have a double hot & Triple hot, then Im going to start at Thai Hot and that's what I did baby!  It was packing heat, but I think next time I will give the Double or Triple hot a try! The dish was perfect!! The entire lunch was very delish!I look forward to making this a regular lunch time spot for me and to trying their entire lunch menu to find me a favorite! I think next I'll try there Red Curry!Bad service leaves a bad after taste, and I won't be coming back for more. First time I ate here I loved it. The Pad Thai was yummy, the ambiance was nice, and it was perfectly placed next to Tempe Cinemas making a great go to for a date night...or so I thought. Second visit was about 30 minutes prior to closing. In most restaurants that's not a huge deal, but here it means they will ask you for your order before even getting to look at the menu, remind you every ten minutes that they're closing soon, and pretty much stare you down until you're uncomfortable enough that you can no longer enjoy your meal, ensuring that you don't leave a single minute past closing. Fine, they don't like to work late. Noted. Fast forward a few months for a stop in at lunch. Doors locked. Seems we're 15 min. early this time. No big deal, we'll wait. As we wait we see the same woman who was so rude before. The same woman who is always there. She clearly sees us but doesn't open the door...not until exactly 11:01 that is. You would think she would open the door we were standing at, but nope. First she opened the door on the opposite end, then stopped to answer the phone, then merely unlocked the door we're standing in front of and walked away as if nobody was standing there. Not a smile, not a hello, not a thanks for waiting. Nothing. I thought maybe she recognized us from before and this was an isolated incident but I've now read other reviews stating the same. Perhaps all the positive feedback has gone to her head to the point that good service has become irrelevant? Maybe it's just as simple as her not wanting to work a minute extra? I dunno. What I do know is that part of what makes a dining experience worthwhile (at least for me) is the service. Food with attitude doesn't taste nearly as good, and I'll gladly go to one of the other ten Thai restaurants in the area the next time I get a craving.Came here for lunch the other day and have to say I was a bit dissapointed to what I expected to find.It was just 1:00 and they were not all that busy at all. Service was very slow, but, there did not seem to be a reason for that. I ordered and a salad bar or soup comes with the lunch. I chose the soup that you get yourself, it was not that good.But, before I did that ,I had gone in to the bathroom to wash my hands. It was not very clean.Soup was plain, and the lunch was good. But, the staff all sat down to have their lunch  as well. Which meant they were not attentive to the customers. There was about 5 tables in there. But, why not wait until your luch service is over. THey close for lunch at 2:30.I just found that to be in poor taste to sit down to eat,in the middle of your lunch service while you are still waiting on people.Not too impressed with this place any more.Every time we go see a movie at the Pollack Theaters, we always leave plenty of time beforehand for a dinner at Yupha's. We love our Thai food and Yupha's is one of my two favorite Thai places in the valley (the other being Thai Spices in Mekong). I always get Pad Thai every time I go to Thai restaurants...I really wish I could try more things but I can never stray from Pad Thai! Arrrgh. Anyways, I love the Pad Thai here but one unfortunate thing is the heat fluctuates each time we come.The first time, I got hot and oooo-weeee my bowel movements hurt the next day! I ordered a step lower on the heat scale the next time, and I barely even felt a singe of heat. So it's kind of hit or miss if the level of heat is there that I want, but regardless the rest of the taste of the dish is the same and it's great. My husband thankfully changes up his order each time we go so I can try more of their dishes. Everything he's ordered has been good. The ambience and timeliness of the food is also a plus -- we don't have to panic about not making our movie on time because we're usually in and out in 40minutes tops. Yupha's will always be a staple of our movie date nights.Man, do I regret not trying Yupha's sooner! Dude and I have lived almost walking distance from here for nearly two years and we finally stopped in last weekend. Yupha's is super deceptive if you judge it from the outside only. I was expecting a Chinese take out (think Hot Wok Mr Cook) type of place, but WOW! Very beautiful, aesthetically pleasing decor. Given how many people were in on a Saturday night, it wasn't overly loud like I was anticipating. Just the right ambiance for a date night. We were seated immediately, and once we had a chance to check out the menu, our server came by to take our order. We ordered the almost obligatory Thai Iced Tea, Drunken Noodles with Beef and Red Curry with Chicken - Both Thai Hot. The Thai Iced Tea wasn't anything spectacular. Red Curry was the perfect balance of meat and vegetables. They did not skimp on the chicken and it was cooked just right. I really enjoyed the Drunken Noodles. Also very generous with the steak and vegetables. The noodles weren't dried up like the last Thai place we went to. I will say though with the spice levels, we'll go double or triple Thai Hot as single Thai Hot was more on the higher side of medium for our spice tastes. Both dishes were more than enough for two people and we had leftovers to take home.Overall, friendly service, fresh, delicious food, in the neighborhood ... Will definitely be back when a craving for Thai strikes!I was craving Tom Kha Gai today and Mr. Dubs had been scoping this place out for months.  What better time than to do a little take-out to go with my Ghost Adventures marathon?  So I went to call in my order and the nicest lady picked up.  After a few questions, I placed my order of: The Sampler, Massaman in Pineapple Boat with Scallops, Pad King Sod with Calamari, a bowl of Tom Kha Gai, and a bowl of Seafood Soup.  Here's the breakdown:- Sampler ($12):  You get two Thai rolls, two golden curry pastries, six buddha's delight, and six kew krob.  The Thai rolls are your standard little spring rolls with nothing too remarkable, the buddha's delight is your typical fried tofu, the kew krob had an interesting medley of ground chicken and spices, but my favorite were the curry pastries.  Puff pastry with curry chicken, onion, and carrots?  Yes please!  I think I would skip on the sampler if I come back and just order the curry pastries.  - Massaman in Pineapple Boat ($16 + $3 for scallops):  Advertised on their site as a Mother's Day weekend special, I decided to order this because I love massaman curry and the added pineapples intrigued me.  While I think the $3 up-charge for like four scallops (cut in half) was a bit much, I enjoyed this dish!  The pineapple really adds a brightness to the otherwise heavy dish.  They even threw in the pineapple boat... which ended up getting tossed after I kept spilling curry all over the place.  - Pad King Sod with Calamari ($13):  Squid stir-fry with ginger, onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers in its simplest form.  I was hoping for a balanced dish but all I got was an overwhelming garlic flavor.  I love garlic but whoa!  It was a bit much.- Tom Kha Gai & Seafood Soup ($4 & $6):  The Tom Kha Gai here is delicious!  It might've been the blinding craving for coconut milk soup but this stuff hit the spot.  It was silky and coats the mouth!  The chicken was a bit dry but what can you do about white meat chicken really?  The Seafood Soup was mainly eaten by Mr. Dubs.  It tasted of your standard hot & sour soup with lots of lime.  The seafood soup was definitely not my favorite.The decor was lovely and I almost wished I dined-in instead of carried out.  The service was friendly but for $61, I was hoping for a little more.  The portions are a bit small and they're pretty stingy on the seafood but the flavors for most of the dishes were great.On a whim went here for dinner. Sits in the Pollack Tempe plaza close to the cinemas, comic store, etc. the restaurant is decorated with large Thai art like the huge floating market painting and huge faces of the Buddha and notes of bamboo dividers between some tables and the entrance walk-in. Smells of the food resonated from the nose to my tummy. So much to choose from: March specials and regular menu items. I had to try the Drunken Noodles and the Panang Curry which are my Go-to dishes. Drunken noodles: Mild. Chicken. Onions. Bell peppers. Tomato. Napa cabbage. Thai basil. Flat noodles. Sweet. Savory. $10.50Panang Curry. Medium. Chicken. String beans. Red bell peppers. Lime leaves. Coconut milk. One small bowl of rice. Sweet n savory.  $12Fried Banana with ice cream. $7.50Small bowl of rice: $1.50. Disappointingly a little overpriced especially since the Panang curry came with only one small bowl to begin with. I personally think the Panang curry should have at least come with 2 small bowl worth of rice. The rest of the curry liquid needs the rice to complement the dish. I originally wanted the March special dessert: mango and blueberry stuffed crepe for $5.99 but unfortunately they were out!! Waitress and staff were smiley, polite and helpful!

Restaurant name  Sardine

Review Text :
Effortlessly melding French class with a healthy dose of rustic charm, this trendy French-American bistro manages to delight the palates and unfailing expectations of culinary enthusiasts plate by plate. Whether in search of decadent brunch offerings or more savory dinner entrees, Sardine is sure to impress any quality food seeking individual with its menu of locally sourced and Parisian-influenced dishes. Inconspicuously situated along Madison's Lake Monona in the city's Machinery Row district, Sardine undoubtedly heightens the bar and earns its place among the best of Madison's food scene. The inner portion of the restaurant is inherently unassuming in character and in most part relies on natural wood elements that carry throughout the space, while of course taking advantage of the views offered by Sardine's lakeside locale. A defining feature of the restaurant's ambience is the large wooden beams that traverse the length of the ceiling and contribute a sense of continuity in spite of the assorted half-walls and brick facades that serve to apportion the dining area into various subdivisions. The amalgam of earthiness and a refined touch of class invariably deems the interior space a rustic warehouse of sorts, making Sardine the perfect backdrop for an innately distinct dining experience. A sheer glance at the ingenious menu will enthuse the senses and riddle the mind to such an extent that skimming each listed entrée will most likely result in an unprecedented level of indecision and self-doubt. To illustrate, a main source of Sardine's rising popularity lies with the glorious execution of its weekend brunch. Now, the institution of "brunch" in itself presents quite the conundrum in that it forces diners to face the weighty decision of sweet or savory, and, more explicitly, breakfast or lunch. Then add to this the fact that Sardine's brunch menu consists of nothing but exceptionally delicious offerings and the former indecision subsequently escalates. And yet, this initial "struggle", so to speak, with regards to the menu, is singular in nature, for straight upon that first bite of whatsoever dish is chosen, the earlier hesitation and reservations in settling on a meal are conclusively unfounded and without warrant. Rather, each selection is sure to defy preconceived notions as to the flavors of the various meals due to the level of mastery with which each item is prepared. Omelettes are artfully crafted with flavor variations ranging from the more simplistic to the increasingly indulgent. Fines herbes and gruyere cheese...spinach, roasted cherry tomatoes, goat cheese and bacon...arugula, brie cheese, crimini mushrooms and scallions...all of which effectively define decadence. Also flaunted on Sardine's brunch menu include such dishes as a warm duck confit salad, as well as steamed mussels, Norwegian salmon, and the ever-popular croque monsieur sandwich of bayonne ham and gruyere cheese. These savory selections are brilliantly supplemented with a few sugary concoctions that manage to find their way onto the same menu in a welcome fashion. One such dish is the buckwheat Belgian waffle that is served with a whipped cinnamon orange butter, sliced banana, and pure maple syrup, absolutely shining as a collective with its refreshing citrus notes and satisfying sweetness. As a whole, Sardine executes on all levels. Enticing its patrons with a delicious array of French-inspired classics that satisfy both palate-wise and visually, compelling all who frequent Sardine to feel graced with the pleasure of having dined at one of Madison's top bistros.Sardine is just splendid.  My husband's mother and boyfriend came from across the pond and we decided to celebrate here tonight.  We shared a bottle of wine, had great conversation and slowly filled our bellies with some wonderful French food.  I ordered the salmon with lentils, sautéed spinach, portobello mushrooms, tomatoes, and beurre blanc.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  My husband ordered the evening special of duck confit with cabbage and glazed carrots.  The glazed carrots with this dish will go down as one of the best things I've ever eaten... I felt bad but I stole most of them from him.  Dessert was gorgeous...I had a hazelnut ganache with caramel and it was sinfully delicious.  My mother in law ordered a plum cake with the best roasted almond ice cream.  Our server was fun and made our meal even better....I cannot wait to go back for brunch...and happy hour...and dinner.Full disclosure: I cannot write an objective review of Sardine. My wife and I loved Sardine when it opened. Loved the food, loved the "philosophy," loved the service. Loved everything.We loved it so much we had our wedding reception there four years past.Sardine is still tops on my list. No where else quite feels like home so much as this wonderful Bistro on Lake Monona.I'm not sure what is better--the service, the food or the atmosphere. Whether you are at Sardine for brunch, dinner or a special event, you cannot go wrong. Quintessentially Madison, the French bistro food is neither overpriced nor overly chi-chi.Tonight I attended my six or seventh Sardine Family dinner. Always multiple courses paired with wonderful wine and/or beer, these are terrific opportunities to see just what the kitchen is capable of. $40 tonight provided more snacks (cheese, chicken liver pate, kale flatbread, salumi, etc.) that necessary, a lovely duck confit and bread salad, "steamship of pork," an absurd cakey cut of grits (amazingly rich), and a delicious meringue dessert with maple ice cream all paired with Wisconsin craft beers. I love you Sardine and I will miss you immeasurably.

Talk about the ultimate chinese torture: arriving with the crowds at 6pm with a party of 10 on one of the busiest weekends of the year: automatic 90 minute wait.   Freezing outside (unnaturally so) for Phoenix, and the door opening every 3 seconds with people sqeezing in/out.  Family wants to stay because of course every other place on any sort of main strip is going to be the same wait.  Finally sit: waiter looks 13 and wet behind the ears, seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown (running frantically, cursing under his breath), stops by after 10 minutes to let us know "I will help you later, Im busy," meanwhile the kids have already eaten at Krispy Creame across the street or else they would be pissing all over the table, no room to even get out of your table except to go all the way to the back of the place since its packed so tight with people.  3 hours later, finishing up, no time or room for desert with mega-sized fried portions, escaping back out in the cold to go home and feel ill.  Is this worth the 300$ bill?  Is this what we call entertainment and family time?  At least the orange peel chicken was excellent, but after starving that long anything would taste like fried manna.Two words:  Painfully MediocreImagine your favorite and/or average Chinese food delivery place.Now divide the flavor in half.Now multiply the price by 3.Perfect, now find a place that isn't PF Chang's to eat tonight.Seriously though, you are paying for mediocre food in a "trendy" environment.  Trendy is another way of saying "long wait" and "stupid employees".  The Olive Garden : Italian food :: PF Chang's : Chinese food analogy doesn't even work here.  And I make fun of Olive Garden ALL the time.If you are really determined to get mediocre Chinese food, find a Pei Wei.  It's owned by the same family and is the same food but for less.  And if you're looking for a Pei Wei in Tempe, AZ, just go to Tott's Asian Diner.  It's in the same strip mall and it's way way better.Literally...the worst dining experience of my life. So much went wrong (I will TRY to keep it short).I made a reservation for 8pm, 8 people on a Saturday. I called at 5pm, giving ample notice. Walk in at 7:58 (2 minutes early) and the table isn't ready. No bother, we wait outside, chit chat but happen to notice a very sparsely occupied patio, which we could have sat at. 20 minutes later. No table. Finally at 8:40 we sit down. What use are reservations? But this isn't the worst part...We sit and wait for another 10 minutes and are approached by a frantic server: Can I get you drinks? Sure. We order an excess. (You're about to get tipped well if you can make this happen tonight).  Waiting on the drinks...my throat is getting parched...where are the drinks? We get them another 20 minutes later (It's already 9pm folks...an hour after I was supposed to have my table). Here comes Mr. Frantic again - Brings 2 drinks...we're missing some.  He apologizes and confesses he forgot to ring in the other.. Ya kidding me? Finally drops it off. Cool... But the fun doesn't stop there. My friend orders an appetizer. Expresses she wants THIS to be her entree...to be brought out with everyone else's. It does not happen. He just stares at the table, his mouth agape. Say something. Fix this. Send the Manager over. Do something.Next up? I don't eat meat...I am served meat. Cool. Frantic Server Dude is now blaming someone else for this transgression and has the Manager come over to drop off my meager  portion of food. The MANAGER says nothing. Not "Sorry, not how are you this evening? Apologies n such." Just drops it off, and forces a smile. What are we doing wrong here as patrons? Am I on freaking Candid Camera?! (what happened to that show anyway...)Ugh...At this point we all just want to shovel food down our throats and get the hell out. We do the 2 for $40 deal. Where's the dessert we ordered? Blame the Cooks Magoo has his back turned to our table, and is chatting away with his friends. This is not a joke. We sit...and sit...and sit...Ya think he would have turned around at some point to, I don't know: Check on his customers who are going to be tipping him.  Finally my friend taps him on the shoulder and asks if he can box up the dessert so we can just take it with us.I open my leftovers today and not everything's in there. I hate this place. Hate. Slow...yet the servers run around like chickens with their heads cut off. The food isn't great, that's IF they can get your order right in the first place. It's pointless getting a reservation. OH and IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY.  They knew this! Their home office should really make a secret shop and see what's happening at the Mill Ave location.Ya suck.  Don't eat here. I know it's Mill...but save yourself the 2 hour shit show I experienced.OK I will start with the good parts of this place. The Hostess was sweet. She even helped us with the Validation of the parking.The Lettuce wraps were good. That is where it ends.I can honestly say, we will never come here again for any reason. Nor would I ever encourage anyone to eat here.What has happened to P.F. Chang's???  I mean honestly!We were greeted by the hostess who put us at a nice table by the window.After sitting down I could see the table was dirty. There was grease all over it and I had a dirty plate in my area.When Kinnesy came to tell us she would be helping us out tonight. I asked if we could get the table wiped down and I showed her the grease all over it.She did come back and wipe it down,then disappeared, in her place came over a male server, who then told us he would be taking care of us instead.He seemed good at first. He told us about a few things on the menu. I got hot Tea and my friend got Ice Tea, they had Mango and regular. He ordered regular.About an hour later he had to ask for another Ice Tea, he got it but, it was Mango.We got the 2 for $40.00, which does not include your drinks.It came with soup. Somewhere after we received the lettuce wraps things went downhill.We never got any appetizer plates. We had to ask for them.That is OK because, things like that can happen.Then another server brought us out our main dishes. 2 meals one bowl of white rice. We had both ordered Brown rice. Again no Dinner plates.We had to ask for those as well.We never even got any water to drink.I have to say in all the time we sat there waiting for everything, I really noticed how dirty the floor was.  They would just wipe the floors down and paper ,rice, food, everything right on to the floor.They were not even busy here, there were 11 tables occupied ours being one of them. There were 5 servers.We waited and Waited, and waited for the dessert to come out. I really wanted it to go at this point we had been there for 1 and half hours. I was so ready to go.It was a simple meal that took forever.The hostess had to go to find the waiter to tell him we wanted our check. I could see him in the doorway of the Kitchen eating.Just give us our dessert and check and we will be out of here like 25 min ago.The dessert were Wontons that had been micro waved. They were hard and the mixture inside was bubbling. Gross!We waited so long that we finally just left the $$$ on the Table and left.I have to say it was my very worst dining experience.PF Changs is an A-OK Americanized chain Chinese restaurant...Maybe I should just refer to it as PF Chain?  No matter how I refer to it, I have no problem going to PF Changs - especially when I'm with a group of people that cannot decide where to go.  PF Changs to the rescue - there is something on the menu for everyone... vegetarians, meat eaters, boring bland food fans, seafood lovers, spicy enthusiasts, etc... they offer white rice, brown rice, noodles, and I suppose no-carb dishes if you eliminate all of the above.  I actually ordered PF Changs to-go recently and despite the fact that they did not include utensils of any sort in their packaging, the eggplant dish I ordered and the steamed shrimp and veggies with brown rice really hit the spot.  If you're going to eat at a chain, PF Changs is not a bad option... while it's never my first choice of restaurants to dine at, you can't go wrong at PF Changs either... just don't expect anything too authentic and you'll be fine.

Review Text :
Anyone who's ever read my reviews will be able to tell you that I love a good steak, live for cheese, adore a good wine and enjoy a nice, stiff cocktail from time to time. That being the case, Alan Albert's falls into Stephy play quite nicely.It's got the feel of an old school steakhouse and I don't know about you, but when I go to Vegas, I like to explore the history and at least dabble in the feelings of the days of old there. Sure all of the modern hoorahrah is great, but that place has history and at Alan Albert's you still feel a bit of it.The waiters are dressed as steakhouse waiters should be, in nice white jackets and know their meats. They also have great sense of humors, since I imagine living in Vegas you'd have to. On one of my trips here last year. we got an old Irish man who rapped us the specials since clearly we exuded the 50-cent vibe, what? Yeah, it was random, but this is what I love about the place.The food is awesome. Steaks are of course their signature dish, but the seafood fare is fantastic as well. Lobstas baby! And if you go, ask if they have the lobster bisque. Sometime they do, sometimes they don't, but G-D Damn is that some good stuff! Use the bread to clean the plate, mmmm mmmmm! Also, like any old school steakhouse, the sides are a la carte, so make sure to try the creamed spinach(if this spinach thing ever let's up) and definitely get the asparagus as their hollandaise sauce kicks the ass!Wine list is also pretty good, but the martoonis are fantastic and they know how to do a dirrty one without tasting like you are stuck in an over-saturated "olive" garden.So go check it out. Not cheap, but definitely a nice meal in a cool place with great service and no one will say "You're money" here. Also, it is kind of hidden. If you are taking a cab, the cab driver should know, but just know that it is on Las Vegas Blvd but kind of towards the back between two buildings. You'll see :) Enjoy!

Restaurant name  Sassi
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
In the spirit of Josh D.'s post, I will argue that Sassi does NOT have the best gourmet Italian food west of the Atlantic.  In fact, I wasn't impressed with the food here at all.  We had the chef's tasting menu for $59 per person and the wine pairings for $39.Cocktails - I had the apple/ginger fizz which was not at all fizzy, too sweet and had mint leaves that had browned in it.  The bar snacks course was decent.  A selection of bruschettas and some olives.  Not bad, but not stellar.Appetizers - We were brought a large plate of assorted appetizers.  Grilled beets, caramelized fennel, spicy calamari, broccoli rabe, and some other things that were quite forgettable apparently.  This plate, though impressive in appearance, was an all around failure.  My group consisted of some very adventurous eaters, and this didn't cut it even for them.  The tastes just didn't meld, and it just felt "off."Salad - The salad seemed like it was nothing more than bagged lettuce with some sliced carrots and radishes in dressing.  VERY disappointing.Pasta - Probably the highlight of the night.  The pasta was so perfectly cooked, it was heavenly.  It was served with Lima beans, greens, bread crumbs & Parmesan in some light olive oil.  I have to mention, however, that my plate had a million Lima beans and no greens.  My mom's plate, however, had all greens, barely any Lima beans.  What's up with that?Main course - I was given the seared Ahi, my husband the lamb sausage and my mom the halibut in bag.  The ahi was barely seared and cold, the lamb sausage was completely dry and over cooked and when my mom opened her bag, it stunk up the entire, albeit beautiful, dining room with fish smell.  I'm sorry, that's just not acceptable.We got a special assortment of deserts, which was nice, and they were probably our favorite part of the night.Oh and from the room we were seated in, you could hear the chef screaming bloody murder at his staff now and again.  That's all well and fine if you're Gordon Ramsay and your patron's know what they're in for, but we came for an intimate, elegant dinner... please shut up.Anyway, I only give this restaurant 3 stars because of how amazingly beautiful it is.  So while I won't say to never come here, in my opinion, you'd be much better served to stop in for some "bar snacks" and wine than having a full meal.5 stars for the ambiance and setting, 3.5 stars for the food.  So 4 stars.The setting is unbelievable and incredibly romantic.  Picture nooks and crannies, warm fire places and fire pits, a great patio, waterfalls....its fantastic.  They have heaters outside and will also provide blankets for you if you would like one.  (I declined, its not that cold yet but others were partaking in them!)  We were seated at a table that was under a bright light and while they weren't able to turn the light down they did move us to another table that was much more romantic and intimate. Our server suggested a great pinot grigio which was a great way to start the meal.  The breads in the bread basket were quite good, including a blueberry nut bread and focaccia with cheese.  We started with the calamari, which was stuffed with salmon, and was quite good.  A new twist on an old favorite.  For our primi we ordered the gnocchi in mushroom ragu which was good, but not the best gnocchi I've ever had.  I do wish they were a little larger but the portion size for a primi course was good.  For our secondi I chose the lamb three ways (chop, shredded, sausage) which was good but not anything that blew me away.  The shredded lamb was the best of the three.  The chop could have been more flavorful and the sausage tasted like generic sausage.  My husband chose the veal which was a little tough.  We did order a side of butternut squash with honey and walnuts which I absolutely loved, but my husband did not.   We finished the meal with tea and coffee (unremarkable) and a pear tart that was large and tasty.  I wish it was drizzled with caramel sauce, that would have really set it off.  All in all the food was good, I wouldn't say incredible and I certainly wouldn't say the best.  It was solid.After dinner we stopped into the bar on our way out for another drink and the bar area was lovely.  Very cozy and homey.  I would definitely return to the bar for some drinks on a cool evening.Waaaaaaaah! And Grrrrrrrrrrr!I'd leave it at that, but I think you need to hear just why I am so pained. Honey and I decided to go all out for a biggie New Year's dinner extravaganza. It had been a while since we got all gussied and spent the big bucks. We were due for some eye-rolling, table-thomping deliciousness. Perusing the short list of our local faves, we both spied the prix-fixe at Sassi and did a little dance. Limited menus at a swank venue usually equate to exceptional dishes, well worth the limitedness of it all. We wanted them to BRING IT. We deserved it!We arrived just a few minutes late (even got a car/driver so as to be sated AND safe), and were immediately seated. The restaurant was not crowded, we liked our table and saddled up. As is always the case, a pre-dinner cocktail was ordered while perusing the menu. A few minutes later our martinis arrived, poured at the table and we were left to make our New Year's toast. Enter click glasses, raising to lips........screeeeech! "Excuse me, miss? Sorry, you were given the wrong drink." No big deal. It happens.We ordered our courses with delight and within minutes the appetizer course appeared. This was a trio of selected appetizers, all tasty and complementary. Our empty plates were quickly whisked away, along with our silverware, and whallah, a second plate of the same appetizers appeared. Er, um, we just had this course. No big deal. It happens. Minutes go by and here comes the appropriate second course. The plates were delivered and we all-to-late realized our silverware was not replaced. A few minutes of trying to discreetly flag someone down and then on to the eating. Salmon - yum, Sausage, pretty yum. Neither as noteworthy as expected, but so far so good. Next was the highly anticipated lobster gnocchi course. We didn't bother to order two different entrees, we both wanted this to ourselves. Oooooh here it comes! "Be careful these plates are hot." Oh. Wait. This is wrong. These are the selections for the next course. WHERE IS MY LOBSTER GNOCCHI? Hot plates removed. Hmmmm. Starting to waver between angry and sad. Lobster Gnocchi arrives. Nothing a little lobster can't fix, right?  Well, wrong. Overcooked, tough shards of lobster...but worse, the gnocchi (black) was so overpowered with anise that we could barely get it down. It was one of the most terrible dishes I have had in ages. We were destroyed. And we eat everything. Oh goodie. Here come the hot plates we were served 10 minutes ago. Now it's been a good 20+ minutes under the warmer. Another warning for "extremely hot plates". I'm not sure there is ever a time for appreciating this, save for a cast-iron skillet, or ooey gooey Mexican fare that actually tastes better when all fired up. Well, it cooled a bit considering we had to wait yet again for someone to return with silverware. My sea bass was fine. It wasn't great. The plate didn't offer much for texture. Rice with sauteed spinach and fish. Mush and mush. Honey's veal was terrible. Tasteless, overcooked discs of mystery meat positioned next to the most horrific attempt at truffled potato gratin (the main reason he ordered the dish) we have ever been served. By this time we just wanted out. The service, the food, the whole night was throwing us into a funk that was so undeserved for the price and the holiday. Dessert was *shockingly* unspectacular. Two unfinished plates (and I have a mouth full of sweet teeth) were proof that the meal didn't even end well. So over $400 later, the joke was on us. We were so distraught we decided to call the car early and just go home. In bed by 11:45 instead of ringing in the New Year at the bar at Sassi. Enough said. A year ago Sassi's butternut squash ravioli haunted me. Now I wake up in cold sweats dreaming I have to endure New Year's Eve all over again.5/22/13Placed my reservation through OpenTable a few days beforehand.  I arrived around 45 minutes earlier than my other table mates, so I used some of the time to check with the kitchen to see if the selections I'd wanted to try off of the RW menu would be allergen-free (for me).  It seemed like I would have some trouble with the dessert menu (I'd wanted the cannoli, but that was ruled out), but after conferring with the kitchen, the hostess said that the gelati and sorbetti were safe.  This initially anticlimactic for me, but boy, was I in for a surprise!  As I was making my way through the courtyard (boy, this property was HUGE) looking for the source of people conversing and laughing, I decided I'd let my friends know I was waiting for them, but they snuck up on me and was at my side before I finished clicking "send."  Turns out the large group of people ahead of us was part of a wedding reception, so we quickly tried to find our way to the host's stand somewhere inside the cavernous restaurant.  My friends asked me if this was a resort, and I told them that I only knew it to be a restaurant.  (On our way to our table, I posed the question to the host, to which he replied that Sassi was only a restaurant, albeit one that also held many banquets.)  We were the first ones seated at one of the rooms that had patio dining overlooking gorgeous views, including Pinnacle Peak.  We each were handed wine and dinner menus, but only one RW menu, so I asked for another.  Since I knew I was going to order the panna cotta app and the tagliatelle as my main, I decided to go with a glass of Arneis ($13).  My two friends ordered glasses of Barbaresco ($17 each).  I enjoyed my glass of white-- vanilla-scented, not too dry, and I loved the apricot and pear notes.  (I need to locate a bottle, or two, to have some at home.)  This glass held well through the app and main, as well as dessert, but I'm getting ahead of myself...  My table mates decided they'd try the other apps and entrees featured on the RW menu, so that we may all get to sample everyone's plates.The Parmigiano and roasted garlic panna cotta app was lovely! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=5gIYqKU2DqAaD7cihhacxQ#5gIYqKU2DqAaD7cihhacxQ  I've had panna cotta before, so I'd expected something much lighter, more gelatinous; This was akin to a cheese spread- dense, creamy, yet slightly crumbly.  While I loved the garlicky crostino, I found it heavily dressed.  A lighter hand with the parmigiano would've sufficed.  Still, I enjoyed the app immensely!  The house made tagliatelle, with artichoke pesto and fava beans, dusted with pecorino cheese, was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever tasted! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=rim0X5ASqEnkKycpVFFLyQ#rim0X5ASqEnkKycpVFFLyQ  Exquisite in its presentation, temperature wasn't too hot, buttery, and yes, rich, but not too much so that I couldn't finish it.  In fact, I exercised restraint, only so that I could also enjoy the chocolate and vanilla gelati and apricot sorbetto for dessert (choice of three scoops). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=ndq8cYqhNck6u0vPP3I10Q#ndq8cYqhNck6u0vPP3I10Q  My fave was the apricot-- tasted so fresh and crisp; AMAZING apricot flavor!  The gelati felt too heavy in comparison, and quite frankly, a tad boring.  My three scoops of dessert at my next visit to Sassi will definitely be all sorbetti!These are what my friends ordered:Sicilian Eggplant Cakes- currants, pine nuts, tomato sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=aGQ1AwONWhUfk_jYf2EMPA#aGQ1AwONWhUfk_jYf2EMPA Wood grilled gamberoni- shrimp, cannellini bean, salsa verde http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=677LodS4kNmQGhKKzfS6zQ#677LodS4kNmQGhKKzfS6zQ Cannoli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=M-JKlnyXUcE07PUbMw3BNg#M-JKlnyXUcE07PUbMw3BNgFarro salad- goat cheese, mint, red onion, cucumber, pistachio, and red wine vinaigrette http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=5SnOMLIBQhSq1oWkAKxZVQ#5SnOMLIBQhSq1oWkAKxZVQ  (Tried this, in spite of pistachio allergy and liked it a lot!  Would've had more, but I spotted cukes in there, too.)Beef short rib- red wine-braised, porcini, citrus herb gremolata http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=4R8m8Iti3apMfmDsG73Icg#4R8m8Iti3apMfmDsG73Icg Semifreddo, with fresh berries and balsamic vinegar http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=fI2Sl74-spyxAnG27V2Wnw#fI2Sl74-spyxAnG27V2Wnw  (Tried the semifreddo only and found it creamy, yet muted in flavor.  The chill factor was also not very pronounced.  I really preferred my dessert!)If you decide to go, you MUST get the Wood grilled octopus!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=xbSzBL18HlU4r6nwDrKx4Q#xbSzBL18HlU4r6nwDrKx4Q  It's the best octopus preparation I've ever experienced!I'll be back!

Maybe it was the fact that my team (Wisconsin Badgers) was killing San Diego State...maybe it was the fact that Angry Ale's was pretty open & not filled with drunkies mid-Saturday afternoon....maybe it was the tasty sweet potato fries....or maybe it was my husband's low key company but I really liked Angry Ale's. I went in with modest expectations - I wanted some good bar food, a table and a chance to watch the game. Overall - Angry Ale's delivered. Now, don't get me wrong - it's a sports bar with a menu. It's not a place to bring children or expect gourmet cuisine. It's not the nicest sports bar I've ever been to, but it's certainly not the diviest. The bathrooms were clean, the waitress (Lindsay) was nice and attentive and the food was pretty good!I ordered the Baby Burger w/cheese - A 4 ounce patty with cheddar, lettuce, tomato on a toasted bun. I choose sweet potato fries as my side. The juicy burger was just enough to satisfy me and I adored the toasted bun. The fries were a total winner - nicely cut sweet potato fries with cinnamon sugar dusted over the top. NOM.Prices were affordable for food and drinks and TVs were plentiful. I'll definitely come back to Angry Ale's to watch another game - as long as it's not super crowded!

Met a couple of colleagues for lunch the other day and saw @Matt S review that mentioned a Pastrami Melt....so I went for it with Fries.  I wasn't paying, so I didn't get the price....I think it was around $7.95.The Sandwich came out pretty fast.  It tasted pretty good, but the Bread was greasy!  I understand it's a melt, so it should be kind of like a Grilled Cheese Sandwich.....but it was much more oily than that.  The Fries were excellent and the service was very good as usual.This place gets packed for lunch, especially during the weekdays, so get there before Noon if you don't want to wait.Return Factor - 75%Have you ever been set up on a bad blind date? One where your friend swears that the other person is attractive and that you'll have a ton in common, only to find out that said date is slightly overweight, balding and into LARPing? That's how I feel about Table 34. Very few dining experiences have elicited such a negative response in my book.Probably the most offensive thing about this restaurant is the uninspired menu and ridiculous prices for the food on it. I was told that this would be strip-quality meals, only half the price. Granted, many of the food on the strip is expensive, but the Table 34 prices aren't much different. $25 for meatloaf? $30 for trout? I don't pay that much for dinner in the Bay Area, that's for sure.To top it off, the food isn't very good. Not sure why I ordered it, but the shrimp pasta I ordered tasted like something you'd get in a cafeteria, just some limp angel hair pasta with shrimp and heavy red sauce. Seriously, a home economics class could have made something just like it. My Mom's sole was slightly better and my brother really enjoyed his ribs, so not all was lost.The two stars are for the service. Our waiter was extremely nice, especially when our entrees didn't come out at the same time. There was a small snafu in the kitchen and he didn't want the food that was ready to go cold. Very thoughtful and honest.Bottom line: there are better, more affordable places to eat in Vegas. Table 34 is an overpriced Applebee's with less flair.Since I work in the area, I have had this place on my radar for ages, but never got around to going for lunch until recently for a team lunch. The place is really, roomier than I expected and very airy and light. The service was extremely attentive and friendly. I started with a green iced tea and some of their complimentary bread with butter. They have a pretty extensive lunch menu but I decided on the linguini with chicken, spinach and tomatoes in garlic sauce. The pasta was very fresh, I was loving that and the portion was incredibly generous. I ended up having plenty to take home with me for a second lunch the next day. We rounded out our meal with several desserts to share around the table. We had creme brulee, chocolate peanut butter torte, lime tart and lemon cheesecake. They were all delightful, but my favorites were the lemon cheesecake and lime tart which were really light and delicate with just the right amount of tartness. Since I work in the area, I see myself coming here again really soon. It's a little on the expensive side but it's nice for a splurge every once in a while.I've been wanting to try this place for a while since all of the pictures looked pretty good and the ratings seemed pretty high so I finally got to try them about a week and a half ago and they were just eh for food and for service.Everyone eating inside at the time were all in business attire, probably from all the offices in the same complex and I feel that since we were in more casual attire, our server didn't treat us the same. He was very inattentive and spacey. I ordered the Scottish Salmon for $18.50 and my boyfriend got the Wild Mushroom Pizza for I believe $12.95. The foodrunner brought out the salmon and pizza together however the pizza they brought out was something with a bunch of pepperoni on it and when we told him we didn't order that, he kind of just held it there and said "Well would you like this one instead?" Lmao! I've never had that happen before. Pretty funny and we were like no...my boyfriend isn't eating meat today...and so he took it back and asked me if I still wanted my salmon. Well ya, the salmon was what I ordered lol. The server then stopped by and quickly said "Sorry, put it in wrong" and quickly walked away. Uhhh okay no problem I guess?? lol I was almost done with my salmon when they finally brought out the pizza. Now onto flavor. The salmon was a nice portion but very under-seasoned and wasn't memorable at all. Very bland. I had to put quite a bit of salt on it. The pizza had a good flavor but the crust was pretty soggy.Our server then walked by and dropped off the check without saying anything. What a weird experience. Overall we probably won't be coming back since there's a lot more options down the street on Eastern and on Las Vegas Blvd.Where did this place come from? Snuggled up to the 215 and Warm Springs, Table 34 has a slightly elevated menu that offers everything from Buffalo Fried Shrimp with Creamy Cole Slaw to a massive Grilled Rack of Pork with Chipotle Potato Puree, Asparagus & Hard Cider Glaze. Literally you're sloppy unemployed best friend and your uptight foodie buddy would both love this place. I came here to drop off some toys for the "Toys for Tater Tots" promo and I was immensely surprised at the happy hour menu offerings. I felt like I literally ordered everything; Duck Carnitas Tacos, Buffalo Fried Shrimp, Kobe Beef Sliders with Caramelized Onions and Swiss Cheese, Macaroni & Cheese with Peas & Pancetta, and of course the Sweet Potato Tater Tots with Honey Mustard. Everything was very good, honestly I didn't have a bad dish, the shrimp was on point; spicy and the pieces were huge. The sliders were delicious, super juicy and the onions weren't overpowering, and the mac and cheese was, "food bonerirffic". My only complaint was that there wasn't enough, give me more!The Duck Carnitas were delicious, tender and the perfect bite sized morsels for the non-sharing person. Sweet potato tots, I these fried, sweet carby treasures are paired perfect with a honey mustard for that nice bite at the end. The service was attentive and kept the table clear as each order came and went. I will say this place does have an older crowd. I mean, I'm no spring chicken, but I was the probably the youngest person here by at least 12 years. Is this a bad thing? Nope, now I have a solid spot to take my mom for those weekly dinner outings.

Review Text :
Read my last review on this place before you read this, then compare. Once again like in years past, the workers were having some kind of altercation with each other when I got there after midnight. Like usual the host lady had her back turned and pretended she couldn't see us waiting. She and the other host lady have been doing this for over 2 years. This time I asked the server why that lady always ignores us. He actually explained that she does in fact ignore guests intentionally and that she is just a very jaded and angry worker. I'm one of those guys who write detailed assessments of food, for example I might say: "The quality and attention the chef put into perfecting the filet to a juicy medium-rare was impressive and well represented the integrity of this restaurant". But really, the only thing I can say about Grand Cafe is that the "FOOD TASTED LIKE SHIT"If it's not bad enough that the clientele here are usually extremely drunk and shouting disgusting and stupid things, the food takes about 30-40 minutes to come out so you have to sit there the whole time and endure that shit. And most the time, the customers leave after about 20 minutes. I recommend not coming here anymore, even if you are at Santa Fe Station. Read my review of the Fatburger here at Santa Fe....I would still rather endure the service over there than eat at Grand Cafe. There are so many local 24 hour gaming bars around town that serve exceptional food and have great service and low prices. Just go there instead.Items Selected:Blueberry MuffinStrawberry DonutButtermilk Pancakes with Strawberries and Whipped CreamChicken and WafflesDouble Chocolate CookieChocolate BrownieIntrigued by not only the concept of 'locals' casinos, but more so by the early morning activity at such places, and twice impressed by the quality of the pancakes and pastries at Station Casinos Grand Café it was amidst Las Vegans and visitors that breakfast was enjoyed within the confines of Santa Fe Station and similar to its Strip adjacent brother and Red Rock location in Summerlin the breakfast fare was once again far superior to several more pricey competitors while the baked also proved by-and-large impressive shortly after emerging from the oven just after 6:30am.Lengthy but narrow, with a sort of 'patio' overlooking the gaming floor adjacent to the well stocked pastry case, it was on the right side of the restaurant with a view of the television showing Sportscenter that I asked to be sat and greeted by a friendly Hispanic man just about to go off-shift water was quickly filled and a pair of pastries delivered, my order of entrees transferred to a middle-aged Caucasian fellow who seemed to take a minute to get his bearings at the beginning of his day.Beginning with a simple donut, the $1.25 ring resembling those at Dunkin but not quite as soft in crumb, it seemed to me that while the baked goods were indeed fresh that this fried one might have been a bit old and moving on to the Blueberry Muffin a far better bite was found, the base quite buttery even before adding a little bit more while the top was speckled with pearls of sugar giving the whole thing a light crackle as several fresh berries burst in each bite.Eventually flagging down my original server for a water refill, even though I'm rather sure he was off the clock, it was not long before entrees arrived from the fellow who seemed to have finally woken up and setting aside "faple," as in fake maple, syrup in favor of the good stuff the pancakes again proved light and fluffy with light topping of whipped cream and fresh strawberries while the waffle, too, was quite admirable with a good crunch and soft center, the crisply fried breast of chicken perhaps a little more greasy than some would prefer, but at the same time a whole lot better in its hand-battered herbal flavor than the previously-frozen fingers served at 24/7 spots elsewhere.Sated and happy, but also intrigued by a few novelties within the case of cupcakes and croissants, it was with two items boxed and bagged that I settled the tab and taking my leave to less smoky environs than the casino itself it was with coffee in hand that I partook in two chocolate concoctions that again proved quite pleasant, the rich double chocolate chip cookie with slivers of almonds rich and almost 'brownie-like' while the actual brownie was more like a slab of sheet cake with slick chocolate ganache and patriotic sprinkles that may not exactly justified the $4.50 tab, but would have been absolutely excellent warmed up beneath some ice cream as offered amongst the menu's desserts.

I really give it 2.5 stars. We went here my sisters b-day. I was extremely under impressed. We got alot of stuff and it was either so so or real bad. Calamari= the grossest shit Ive ever had. It was like the consistency of a cold stiff mozzarella cheese stick and it had that shape too. it wasn't cut into ring it was big thick sticks. The batter was like microwaved seeming because it had 100% no crisp, or flavor. I would be shocked if it wasn't prebattered and frozen. GrossTuna tar tar= it was just minced raw tuna but they didn't add any like flavored oil or citrus on it. It was just completely unseasoned. The fish had no flavor which is good but it was very plain. Seared tuna= the sauce was good the noodles I likes, tuna was ok. This dish alone I would give 3.5I would never come back here, the food was bad and just really blah. Especially for a place that specializes in fish.Wildfish delivered on an extremely happy 'happy hour' tonight to this girl...The Wildfish chopped salad may be a new favorite - it has huge chilled fresh shrimp, heart of palm, tomato, avocado, bleu cheese, and walnuts - a light meal in itself!  Add a few of the .75 cent oysters, a glass of wine, a side of veggies or a bite of crabcake + some attentive service, and you're in for a real treat!I'm not sure why I'm not more of a frequent Wildfish visitor... I look forward to another visit soon.  Happy hour is the way to go!I attended a Yelp Elite event here and I was completely wowed by the seafood.  Having lived and spent time in various places on the water I have diminished expectations for seafood now that I live in the desert.  Fear not!I will be back here on the oysters alone!  Much less the jumbo shrimp, fresh tuna and crab cakes.  The last time I was this impressed with crab cakes I could smell the Atlantic.The last time I had such good oysters I could smell the Pacific."I will remember these shrimp for the rest of my life."  This is what my mom said after tasting the bacon-wrapped shrimp at Wildfish.I knew I had to come back for a full meal after swooning over the amazing appetizers at the Yelp Elite event.  So, when my mom came out to visit I had the perfect opportunity to prove that great seafood can be found in the desert.  Wildfish did not disappoint.After consulting with our (super awesome) waiter Christian, we started off with two appetizers - the crabcake and the bacon-wrapped shrimp with goat cheese.  Both were just as fantastic as I remembered.  The crabcake is large and perfect for sharing and is served with a light remoulade sauce.  The shrimp come three to a plate, complimented with a small stack of light onion rings.  My mom really knows that I love her, as I declined her (feeble and halfhearted) offers to split the third shrimp with me!The parade of deliciousness continued with the entrees - Roasted Sea Bass and Snapper Filet with Johah Crab.  Both were served with delicate sauces that enhanced, not overpowered, the flavor of the fish.  We shared a side of steamed asparagus with hollandaise.  All sides are served family-style and the portions are large but can be ordered in half sizes that are perfect for two.5 star staff, 5 star food.  Overall it was a great experience in every way.Review # 100 and I saved it for Wildfish, how cool is that?So Friday night, after taking my friend, who was here from DC,  to Scottsdale Fashion Square so she could see what this mall was all about, we decided to head over to Wildfish. I mean I was just their a few weeks ago and I remembered just how yummy the food was at the event so I just had to go back.The place was packed! I mean it was Friday night so I didn't expect anything less but wow. We had two choices, to either wait 45 mins for a table or grab a table near the bar. We choose the latter as the you still received the full menu at the bar as well.We were greeted pretty quickly and our waitress, Deanna took great care of us. Hats off to you Deanna! You rocked girl.My friend started off with a raspberry mojito I believe (I am not sure but I think that is what it was), Lobster Bisque and Snapper with Crab, the crab fried rice to share and some steamed asparagus. All I wanted was the calamari  so I ordered that as my main course. I know lame but that is all I had a taste for as I was saving room for dessert too.So her drink, some warm fresh bread, and the lobster bisque came pretty quickly.  After that we are not sure what happened. One of the waiters (who by the way remembered me from the yelp event) came over to see how our meal was and we told him that we hadn't eaten yet. No sooner did we say that did our meal finally arrive. We were not upset by the delay at all as we were catching up on old times but it was a pretty long wait. However the manager Mario came over to apologize about the delay and offered to by us dessert. How cool was that. Deanna also came over to apologize as well for not checking on us sooner. The meal was so good. My friend enjoyed hers and I chowed down on all that yummy calamari. It was a huge plate that was sitting on top vegetables, red chiles and some yummy but spicy cashews. I also had some of that crab fried rice which was also very good. Lots of crab and lots of mushrooms. Yummy.  To save room for dessert we ate as much as we could but then requested to pack up the rest so that we could enjoy the grand finale.OMG! The desserts are sinful. My friend ordered the upside pineapple cake made with fresh whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream, and I had the chocolate godiva cake that was served warm with vanilla bean ice cream. Good lawd those desserts were good. If you don't want anything else from this restaurant. which shame on you for not trying the delicious food, at least go for dessert. Yum, yum, yum.All in all it was a great time. Thank you again to Deanna and huge extra special thank you to Mario for generously buying us dessert. I will definitely be back again soon.On behalf of all those practicing Catholics in search of cuisine options for meatless Fridays during lent, I thank you Wildfish for making it pretty darn easy! It's long overdue but I finally paid a visit to Wildfish last night. In the height of spring training madness and the thousands of additional desert guests presiding over our restaurants, I was happily pleased when I found out that Wildfish takes reservations! It was about 4:00 PM when I called and they had one time available; 8:00 PM. Sold! So at 8:00 PM sharp, we made our way to Wildfish. It was jam packed and lively with locals and tourists all enjoying some of the freshest seafood around. This place is called Wildfish, so you'd expect wild fish to be served....right? Well, you're in luck because they stay true to their name! The server informed us that they pick out the fish fresh off the docks and fly it in fresh on a daily basis. Nothing is frozen and everything is wild (not farm raised). The menu has pretty much every item in seafood format you can imagine: everything from Lobster tacos to crab stuffed shrimp. The menu is so detailed and everything sounds so good, it was actually really hard to make a decision! But, I went with the Lobster bisque to start and had Lobster tacos for my entree. We then ordered asparagus and seafood rice for the table to share. The second we sat down, they brought out thick and fresh bread and the type of bread you expect when you go to a seafood restaurant. They kept the drinks freshly refilled. The Lobster bisque came out in a hot metal kettle and when they placed the bowl in front of us, it was at that moment that they poured it in. This is an impressive way to serve bisque because it keeps it from getting cold from the time it goes from the kitchen to the table. The Lobster tacos were delicious and there was a good amount of Lobster in there. The tacos came with corn pico de gallo and fresh avocados with a tasty sauce included. The asparagus was a fresh veggie addition and the rice added the perfect twist to the meal. As I sat there enjoying my fresh fish, I almost felt like an ocean was just outside our doors (wishful thinking; I know). Before I go, I must mention dessert! Each dessert takes 20 minutes to prepare and we couldn't say no so we opted for the chocolate souffle. Delicious. Delectable. Devilish. That's all. So now that I have had the chance to finally try the seafood restaurant in my backyard, I come to the conclusion that you can in fact get quality and delicious seafood in the desert -- and in a great atmosphere too!

03/06/10I rarely find myself in this part of Phoenix, so when I knew I was going to be in the area, I had two places in mind for a late lunch.  I was hoping to dine at Bobby Q, but I found the prices a bit too steep to dine alone, so I headed here.Found the menu uninteresting that day, perhaps bec. I was looking forward to good bbq fare, but I finally settled on the basics- hummus and falafel.  For those who care, the falafel were fried in soybean oil.  (Most places I've inquired at use corn, and sometimes peanut, oil.)  The platter looked very appetizing, but don't be fooled!  The hummus was very bland, and the falafel pieces weren't that great, either.  I had to ask for lemon to get some flavor out of the falafel, and the hummus' saving grace was that it lent the falafel some lubrication.  The pita bread was probably the best thing out of the whole meal, and that's not saying much.Afterwards, I checked out the bakery next door for some expensive baklava.  I chose three varieties, and I found them all too heavy on soggy phyllo and lacking in honey.  $13 for terrible baklava and $7 (or more) on less than mediocre hummus and falafel made for such a disappointing adventure that day.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Not even to anyone that didn't like me.  (But then again, I'd never do that, anyway.)

Review Text :
Since I've been to Napoli and have had Pizza from the city, I couldn't wait to give this place a try.  I've heard so much about it, it was time for me to visit.My son and I came here after a couple of hours at the Pinball Hall of Fame.  We browsed the menu and decided on getting a Diavola Pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.) and a Settebello Pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Roasted Fennel Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.)  We planned to split each Pizza in half and share it so we can taste both.When the Pizza arrived, I was pleased to see that it was very similar to the Pizza I had in Napoli.  The first Pizza out was the Settebello.  When I bit into the first slice, I could immediately taste the Fennel Sausage and Mushrooms.....it was sooo good!  The crust is thin and slightly burnt on the bottom, just how I like it.  The ratio of Cheese to Sauce was perfect.  This was a good Pizza Pie.The second Pizza to arrive was the Diavola.  When I took the first bite, the Finnochiona & Red Bell Peppers were the first flavors I could taste....yum!  It too was slightly burnt on the crust.  Another great Pizza Pie.The service was good as we were only 1 of 3 tables in the entire restaurant.  We were there around 4 pm on a Sunday....I hope it was just the time of day that was the cause of the slow business.  I don't want to see this place close down.Will I return?  If I'm ever on this side of Egypt, I will.When I crave for pizza, I Crave for Pizza!! At first, I was thinking delivery from one of the chain pizzas or a mom & pop spot in my  area. I wanted to try somewhere new and I didn't want Chicago or NY style pizza (not that I don't like these types).. I thought Sammy's woodfired, CPK.. but they served the usual americanized pies and I've been there and done that as well. So, after doing some research here on Yelp, I found this place and it was Exactly what I was looking for!I ordered 2 PIzzas1. Settebello: crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven roasted fennel sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, extra virgin olive oil- I had to order this since they named it after the restaurant! Besides, the toppings sounded more than satisfying. It was Absolutely Divine! Everything from the dough, sauce and toppings were of high quality and was created with such harmony! Pine nuts.. Yeah, they were a nice touch. The only thing is that most of the toppings were placed towards the center and one of the slices didn't have much cheese on it.2. Carbonara: crushed tomatoes, pancetta, egg, fresh mozzarella, basil, parmegiano-reggiano, extra virgin olive oil- I loved the simplicity of the toppings and the addition of an egg. Now, it may not sound like much was put into this pie but they didn't have to put much at all. Due to their superb ingredients/toppings, a little went a long way! I engulfed this 'individual' sized dish in record time! Dessert:Tiramisu: Silky smooth! One of the creamiest and masterly balanced flavors that was subtle yet soooo luscious!! * Not only are Most of their ingredients imported from Italy, Even their Freakin' Oven is Italian!! You won't find a conveyor belt or deck oven here! * Just a note, they do not have Pepperoni!Authentic, Gourmet Pizza with High Standard ingredients and True Italian baking! This place was a Real Treat!! But the sametime not a place I would often go to fulfill my pizza cravings.. I won't be filled with 1 pizza alone as their toppings were lacking but not because they were cheap but because that's their style and thats the proper way of serving their type of pizza. Not to take anything away from this fabulous place but I may just be accustomed more towards the mainstream pies!First and foremost, this place is so adorable. Super New York vibe. If you call 24 hours ahead they will make you a gluten free crust. This I found very interesting. Because the dough is made from scratch and it has to rise over night, can we say FRESH! so awesome. Since we didnt call ahead we decided to just stick with a salad. I had the Insalata Grande. Only 8 dollars it consisted of Mixed Greens, Fresh Tomatoes, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Pine Nuts, Cracked Pepper, Shaved Parmigiano, and tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette. I also had an espresso martini. WOW i could drink 10 of them. and made with illy coffee? yes please! Ill def be returning here, and next time ill call ahead for a gluten free pizza :)This place has some of the best brick oven pizza I've ever eaten in my life. Whatever they're doing, it's done right. Ordered the focaccia and it was delicious. Nice and warm and salty with a dip of olive oil, sea salt and oregano - perfection! It's a nice opener for the rest of the carbs you'll be consuming here.I've also had the insalata grande and it was nice and filling for a salad. Love the pine nuts and shaved Parmesan, so delicious and fresh.The topper here, though, is the pizza. Using a precise method this pizza is cooked right. Nice burnt edges, crispy and gooey. I had to eat my quattro formaggi with a fork! So delicious. I dislike Gorgonzola immensely, but it was a really subtle flavor here, luckily (as I didn't notice it was one of the four cheeses). I've also had the gelato and it was divine, the taste was comparable to the gallons I ate in Rome!This place is close to my house so I have to cover my eyes when I see it or I'll eat here all the time!  The only, only thing I dislike about this place is that, while the employees are super nice and give great service, they have this REALLY annoying habit of correcting pronunciation. I, for one, think that's horrible customer service when it's so obvious what someone is trying to order. Correcting someone is just condescending to me. Change that one little, tiny thing and this place would be absolutely divine perfection!Grab your fork and knife.  No slices here.  True Napolitano pizza in Vegas (or as close as you're gonna get without a trip to Italy).So it's a small chain of restaurants, all good.  Quality ingredients atop a perfectly blistered, chewy, well seasoned crust served by a proud and friendly staff.  Win!  This is the real deal.  They even follow the the standards laid down by the Italian government that define such trivial things as the basic ingredients of the crust, its thickness, and the cooking temperature.The Margherita DOC is excellent.  The standard to judge all Napolitano pizza by, a simple base of crushed, ripe, acidic tomatoes, fresh milky Mozzarella, fresh basil, and a splash of EVOO.  Near perfect.  The diavola with its fennel flavored, gently aged finnochiona, sweet roasted peppers, garlic and mozzarella equally good.  Too simple?  The pizza Capricciosa with its aged, porky porsciutto, oil poached artichoke hearts mushrooms olives basil all atop the same sweet, acidic tomato pure topped with fresh mozzarella, outstanding without being overloaded with toppings.The only weakness, the namesake Settebello.  The sausage lacked the aged, umame flavor so characteristic in Italian cured meats.  A minor point considering.Very inexpensive for the quality.Now if they would just move the tables much closer, encourage chatting it up with your neighbors, get some disposable paper table coverings and serve an abundance of wine....Well, the hype is true!  And, Rod U. most recently, and many others before him, speak the truth.  Settebello serves great pizza.  Not just great Neapolitan pizza--great pizza, period!  Diane and I attended LJ's UYE here the end of last month, and I--a New York style Dom DeMarco's, Secret Pizza, and Biaggio's champion, and not one typically enamored by Neapolitan style pizza--was suitably impressed.  This is not your typical Pepperoni and sliced Mushrooms Pizza establishment.  But no matter!  The other fine Italian meats served here, Roasted Mushrooms, and outstanding Toasted Pine Nuts are just as satisfying.  As remarked by others, the ingredients imported from Italy are top of the line.  I loved the great flavorful slice of Italian ham Kevin P. was kind enough to extend me from his tantalizing order of Antipasto Misto.  And, the Soppressata I added to my Settebello was as spicy as my server said it would be.  My mouth was on fire!  And the spice lingered there, but in a pleasant, reminiscent sort of way.  My only complaint is that a 12-inch pizza is not enough for me--especially when the crust is relatively thin.  Settebello's pizza crust is not of the crisp cracker variety commonly found throughout Italy, but it is surely thinner than typical New York style pizza.  Yet my pizza was still hot and saucy, and I liked everything about it: the dough, Crushed Tomatoes that tasted like mild and wet Tomato Sauce, tangy Pancetta, relatively mild Wood Oven Sausage, in addition to the Roasted Mushrooms, Soppressata, and Toasted Pine nuts that delivered a nice crunch to a bite.  Only next time I might opt to add a milder Italian meat.  And I will likely order two pizzas for myself, and take half of one home after I have devoured the rest.  I know Diane will not object, because she may very well do the same.  When it comes to pizza, we do not mess around.  For dinner we usually order a large or extra large pizza apiece, eat as much as we can, and take the remainder home for at least lunch and sometimes also dinner the next day.  The only requirement is that the pizza must be superior in flavor, texture, and ingredients.  And, Settebello delivers on all counts!  The dough comes out of the super-hot oven with a little char for Neapolitan authenticity, but no char taste.  Diane, who is fussy about pizza (and most other foodstuffs) very much liked her Emilia Pizza, with ham, Mozzarella, and EVOO, even though she was skeptical going in.  To open, while awaiting the firing and presentation of my pizza, I also ordered an Insalata, and found the Radicchio to be somewhat bitter, but that is the nature of this beast.  Fresh mixed greens and a very good light Balsamic Vinaigrette overpowered the bitterness in any event, and the salad portion was quite generous.  Service was efficient and helpful.  The companionship of fellow Yelpers was enjoyable, and of course the food was great!  It was a fine and memorable UYE.And, I plan to be back often to introduce other pizza aficionados with whom I am well acquainted, to the magical tastes that regularly emerge from the wood burning oven of Settebello.Quite possibly the best pizza my mouth has ever tasted.I ended up coming to Settebello for lunch to celebrate a friend's birthday. The restaurant is located in the District. When you first walk into the restaurant you will be greeted by a friendly hostess and walked to your table. The decor consists of dark wood and granite which makes you instantly feel that you are in a high end pizzeria. Service wise, they seemed to be short on staff when we came in. Our server seemed to also be the bartender for the day shift, but I can see that she was trying to show us as much attention as possible. I also brought a cake from a bakery prior to meeting at Settebello and asked the server to put it in the back until we were done with our meal. I ordered the Vico, which blew my mind. I wouldn't call myself a pizza enthusiast but I know what good pizza tastes like. The pizza isn't loaded down with oil and has no tomato sauce which makes it very light. The pizza consisted of yummy sausage, fennel, mozzarella and mascarpone (no tomatoes). It was frickin delicious. I'm obsessed with the crust, which was  thin but not tastless and chewy in the middle.Highly recommended.Overall it was great experience. If you're anywhere near the Henderson area, you must try this place out."peet-suh" / "peetsa" / "peedtza" / "pittsa"However you say it, this is one of the best of its kind throughout the valley!!  Situated at The District in Green Valley Ranch, this location is quite big with plenty of seating either the inside dining room or the outdoor patio that can accommodate even a fairly large group.  There's also a nice bar setup with flat screen TVs, making the restaurant a great place to watch any sporting event.Being Napoletana, the pizza is cooked for about a minute in a wood-burning oven.  This isn't your typical NY style pizza where it can be picked up and folded in half.  Instead, the use of cutleries is advised while eating this pizza since the crust is thin and soft which doesn't hold up especially if you stock up on toppings.Out of multiple visits, everything I've had from this place so far has been really good.  I usually like to start with Panzanella or Involtini di Prosciutto.  As far as their pizzas, I prefer the ones with crushed tomatoes: classic Margherita (mozzarella, basil, Parmigiano Regiano), the Carbonara (pancetta, egg, mozzarella) and the Settebello (pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil).  Fresh ingredients, bold flavors and great topping combinations.  I normally have the 12 inch pizza to myself which doesn't leave any room for dessert.  If you can, however, go for their dessert pizza (sliced bananas, drizzle of Nutella and dusted with powdered sugar).Overall, Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana is definitely one of the best pizza joints in Las Vegas.  Delicious food, pleasant ambiance and excellent service.  I will definitely be coming back.Wow 665 Reviews? I'll make this quick. I've driven past this past numerous times and finally decided to pop in for a few drinks and a slice of Bolognese pizza, which my friend highly recommended. First off the service here is off the charts, right when you walk-in you're greeted and shown a seat. Water is dropped on the table and within a few minutes a server is greeting you and asking for drink orders while giving menu recommendations.We ordered the Bolognese pizza, baked Gnocchi, and the Insalata. The salad was perfect for two and had mixed greens, balsamic vinaigrette, cracked pepper, shaved parmigiano. A very refreshing salad and a great green break with all the carbs I was about ingest. The baked Gnocchi was ridiculous. Piping hot straight out the oven, covered in melted cheese and house marinara. I don't think I've ever had Gnocchi with marinara before, always just covered in pesto or white sauce. A must pre-meal snack while you're scanning the menu.Bolognese Pizza. Just think pizza with a slow simmered meat sauce marinara and light addition of cheese all on some incredibly flavorful soft crust. Marone! This pizza here alone is worth the trip to come back and check out the rest of the menu!

It's true : Having grown up in California, I love me some In-N-Out!It's definitely over hyped, but the food is consistently delicious. They do the best job of lettuce wrapping burgers around, make that animal style with my fries done extra crispy. They pay and treat their employees much better than their industry counterparts, which explains the fabulous customer service. Haha, give me a break, it's almost non existent ... At least at this location recently. Seeing as this In-N-Out is by my office, it's convenient and I used to come here often when I was a young, dumb fool that thought it was OK to go out for lunch daily. I never remember having problems with my food or the employees. Dropped in here last Sunday to grab a #2 to go: Animal Style, Protein Style, Extra Crispy Fries.Kayla the cashier was beyond rude and made it visibly known that taking my or anyone else's order was a complete inconvenience to her. I asked twice to make sure she noted Protein Style. Dirty looks and a yes. Practically threw my card and receipt back at me. When I looked at my receipt, I saw it wasn't listed. Kevin calls me up to grab my order, and I asked if this was done Protein Style. He said no but would happily remedy this. Usually Four stars for the food. Four stars for Kevin, ZERO stars for Kayla. I don't come here very much, but I will likely stick to the In-N-Out on Chandler and Price from here on out when I decide to indulge.Sorry for the two star rating, In-N-Out, but maybe you should consider removing this superbrat from a customer facing position or not hiring these types all together.I've been an In-N-Out Burger fan for over 20 yrs.  Since my first bite into an In-N-Out Burger at their Camarillo location when I was in High School, I've been hooked.Now that I'm well into my 30's, my visits to In-N-Out have dwindled to only a few times a year.....I can't seem to burn the calories like I use to, so visiting one is a huge treat for me.  Last night was one of those nights.I ordered a Double Double & a Cheeseburger & Fries.  Of course, they came out prepared just like I remember them.....Sloppy, Drippy, and Nom-ilicous!  I am talking about the Burgers....ok?  The Fries are my fav's too.....you can always tell that they were just cut moments before I walked into the door.  I love it!This location is the closest to my house, but for some reason I've never eaten here.  The drive thru was a madhouse of course, but there was no line inside....bonus!  I love watching them prepare the food as I wait....It amazes me that they can crank out so many burgers and fries so efficiently and consistently.....one of the major reasons why I come back.Will I return?  That's a stupid question.....of course!After shopping nearby... this In-N-Out Burger really hits the spot. Parking lot can be a hassle however once you get in you are golden. Just gotta brave the wait for me 3x3 because the drive thru is usually very long. I'm never bothered by the line at In-N-Out Burger because it's expected. I change up my burger each time depending on my mood. Sometimes I get animal style or sliced raw onions they have many options for such a limited menu. You just can't go wrong with In-N-Out Burger. They actually remember to give you place mats at this location too.Before the plane even touches down on the West Coast I begin to feel that old familiar craving and visions of animal style cheeseburgers and neopolitan milkshakes begin dancing in my head.Arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday was no exception; I demanded to be chauffeured to In-N-Out immediately after fetching my luggage. As I sunk my teeth into this perfect cheeseburger I couldn't help thinking that all was right with the world.Ah In-N-Out Burger, my own little burger heaven that I miss so dearly from the cold East coast.I had to go to In-N-Out Burger as my final meal in Vegas. I got into my cab and told him "The closest In-N-Out Burger to the airport please." His reaction was less than enthusiastic but I am the customer and I get what I want (within reason of course). I walked in with suitcase and carry-on in arm, went straight up to the cashier and ordered my college favorite:Cheeseburger Animal Style WITH whole grilled onions, fries and a chocolate milkshake.(Which is about... what, probably one million calories? To quote almost every rapper out there, "I don't give a ____!")I don't care how long I've lived in NYC for, I still love my In-N-Out so much. The fries are just so fresh. Onions grilled and caramelized. Animal sauce dripping everywhere. Shake so thick that it's really hard to suck out through my straw.... uh hem. All of this quality I can taste and it only came out to $6.38... TAKE THAT SHAKE SHACK.Fifteen minutes of foodgasms later and I was ready to leave for the airport. Till next time In-N-Out, I love you and miss you already.----------------------------------------------------------------------My personal side story:If you are a visiting out of towner, do not do what I did. I honestly thought I was going to miss my flight because I had a cab drop me off here so I could enjoy my burger in peace. Unbeknownst to me that unlike NYC, Vegas cabs are not allowed to be hailed on the side of the road... So here I  am waiting at an In-N-Out for a cab that I called in because I could not for the life of me get any of the cabs driving by to pull over on this random road.15 minutes passes... nothing.I call the cab company and they said they have NO record of my request so I resubmit it.Then another 15 minutes...Then another 30 minutes...At this point I have been waiting for a cab for an hour, my flight is in an hour and I am freaking the f*** out!!!Luckily one man dropping off someone else earlier saw me and actually came back to get me. Thank you taxi man!!! Ironically enough my flight ended up being delayed TWO HOURS because of the one thunderstorm that happens once a summer in Vegas... so everything was fine.So there, that was my full In-N-Out Burger story from Vegas. Enjoy.

Review Text :
Wildflower is better than Panera but still not my first choice for lunch.  It's on the same level as Paradise Bakery - maybe a tad nicer since they bring your food to you at your table.  Bread is fresh and homemade soups are decent as are the sandwiches.I've had the turkey and brie sandwich, the sweet potato sandwich, the grilled veggie salad, and perhaps a hummus plate awhile back.  Today I went with the "Wildflower Two" - my choice of two of the following: 1/2 sandwich, 1/2 salad, and/or soup.  I went with a 1/2 Turkey Brie sandwich and the split pea soup.  I kind of wished that I changed the bread on the sandwich as the herb bread just didn't quite do it for me, and I should have probably asked if the split pea soup had ham in it when I ordered (it did).I'll go to Wildflower on someone else's suggestion, but I will not be suggesting it anytime - that's how I ended up there today (my friend Laura's suggestion).  It's fine for what it is - a fast casual chain concept with decent food and fair prices (around $8 for lunch on average).  Again, not my first choice, but I'm ok eating at Wildflower every now and again.  There you have it!PS - I hope that the construction next door to this location is over soon - it's not fun listening to pounding noises over lunch with a friend.Bumping up Wildflower to 4 stars from three...Since my last review, I've been back twice - both times I experienced wonderful customer service and new menu items that I thoroughly enjoyed.  I highly recommend both the berry yogurt parfait and the chopped salad.  I believe that it's all about ordering the right thing off the menu, and I found my 'right thing' in the chopped salad... It reminds me of the Cowboy Ciao salad - only it's $8... That's right - I said $8 for a salad with grilled Atlantic salmon, arugula, Israeli couscous, feta, red peppers, dried sweet corn, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds.  It looks like a piece of art when It's served; and then they come toss it up with a Pesto Vinaigrette tableside for you if you'd like.  What a treat!  I hope this becomes a standard menu item in the future.I've also been back to Paradise Bakery and can no longer compare the two... Wildflower blows Paradise away in my eyes.  I will for sure return to this or one of the other seven Valley WBC locations again for an affordable, fresh, delicious meal real soon.  I may even recommend it!****Free WiFi and delicious Iced Tea are additional perks as well as the mighty fine looking selection of breads and baked goods!This is the place for me.  As someone who struggles with the demons of greasy and heavy fast food this menu has several light, flavorful, vibrant, and healthy options.  The flavor, execution, prices, and customer service easily exceed those offered by its predecessor, Paradise Bakery.Wildflower has earned my regular patronage and allegiance and here are the primary reasons why.- Reasonably priced and incredibly tasty menu.  Great dishes such as butternut squash ravoili, salmon alfredo, veggie sandwich.  - Perfect place to help mitigate my guilt when I feel like I've eaten too many burritos or burgers.- Free Wifi.- Great breakfast menu. (Yogurt Berry Parfait is in a parfait class all its own)- Very accommodating staff.  They aim to please and it shows in their appearance, demeanor, and efforts to accommodate any special requests you might have.4/7/10Have I mentioned how I love the cranberry scones at Wildflower Bread Co.??  They're very moist and studded with gorgeous dried cranberries... My favorite part to eat, being a crunchy food-lover, is the super-flaky, caramelized crust!  The only reason I don't rate w/ 5 stars is because the last time I bought a few from this location, the crust flavor tasted "off," as if another lipid was used to cook them with, or that the butter used was slightly rancid.  They definitely did not taste as fresh as the others I've purchased here before.Wildflower continues to please my palate and I have recently become an even bigger fan of their breakfast. From fresh baked bagels to eggs sandwiches on their fresh baked bread, if I need a big breakfast I know exactly where to go to get one that's delicious, potentially nutritious and most importantly, speedy!

Review Text :
Getting off early means one thing - HAPPY HOUR!!  And that doesn't happen very often, so I love to take advantage of the cheap eats and atmosphere that happens during these brief few hours.We arrived around 5 pm and waited a good while to score a table on the patio.  We thought we were in luck when a group of ladies said they were leaving once their friend returned from the restroom.  Well, she must have fell in because it was a good 15 minutes before they did finally leave.  At this point, our total wait time was 45 minutes long.We were hungry and got our hands on a menu quick!  All food was $5 and under!  With our party of three, we got started on a few items:* Atlantic Roll "Baked salmon with motoyaki sauce and cucumbers, topped with tempura flakes and eel sauce" ($3) - Our waiter said it was his favorite and I'm not usually one for cooked fish in my rolls, but I still said okay.  It was good, not exceptional though.  Came in eight pieces, which is great for sharing!* Spicy Tuna Roll "Chopped tuna mixed with spicy motoyaki and cucumbers" ($3) - Again, pretty basic and decent and 8 pieces too.* Kona Calamari "Served with a spicy aioli dipping sauce" ($4.50) - A pretty generous order, great for sharing.* Sweet & Spicy Shrimp "Lightly battered shrimp tossed in a sweet and spicy chili sauce, served on a bed of a daikon" ($4.50) - Pretty tasty and surprisingly generous in this order.* Chicken Satay "With cabbage slaw and sweet hoisin dipping sauce" ($4.50) - Came with four skewers, and a nice slaw to get your veggies from.  A bit dry on the chicken, but enjoyed by others.* Avocado Egg Roll "Sun-dried tomatoes and red onions, with a honey-cilantro dipping sauce" ($4.50) - Two egg rolls cut in half, and tasty too.* Kahuna Sliders "A trio of beef sliders seasoned with onions and thyme, topped with Swiss and cheddar cheese" ($4.50) - The Husband enjoyed these so much that he requested another order.  They were pretty good, cooked at medium rare as requested and yummy little things.  The meat was pretty moist and the melted cheese on top made them perfect as a few bites.  They also came with thinly sliced fried onions strings.* Edamame ($3) - Soybeans that were lightly salted throughout the beans, not just on top.We didn't even get a chance to try any of their pizzas at $5 each since we ordered so much.Service was surprisingly good during happy hour.  Christian was attentive, even when the other staff brought our food out, he was quick to come over to make sure it was all okay and everything was in order.  He checked on us often for more drinks and food and we never had to look for him during our entire time there.  Once we got our order in, food came out in timely manner and we were quite pleased.  (Sometimes it seems service gets a bit slack during happy hour, when the pace should be more upbeat.  And it was definitely moving around here.)Happy hours are Mondays through Fridays: 3 to 7 pmReverse happy hours are Mondays through Thursdays: 9 pm to 11 pmFridays and Saturdays: 10 pm to 12 amHH is only available in the lounge and patio areas and seats are self-service.  So it can definitely feel like there are hounds on you when you're hanging out there because people are definitely waiting for tables here.They have discounted drink specials during happy hour too, just be sure to ask.  We took advantage of their $6.50 Sake Bombs and $3 Ladies Margaritas.  (They weren't skimping on the alcohol in my margarita, I could taste and feel that stuff right away!)You can easily understand why this happy hour is busy.  And there are some guests who stay there all evening long, it makes for interesting people watching!Side note: Restrooms are in the back left hand corner.  Don't go to the right side corner because you'll end up in the kitchen.It has been over 1 year since I've been to Kona Grill.  A lot has changed on their menu, which is a good thing.  The Better Half and I were regulars here for many years but got tired of the same old menu and stopped coming last year.  I met a friend here for lunch this past Friday and was glad to see new menu items.Since it was Friday, we decided to sit at a table at the bar.  Friday afternoons are happening at Kona Grill, so it was great for people watching.They have a special "Pairing Menu" where you can order any 2 items for $8.50.....what a deal!  The Sandwiches on the menu are 1/2 Sandwiches, so keep that in mind.  I went for the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich and the Avocado Chicken Wrap.  To wash it down I ordered a Stella Artois.The food came out fast and our waitress was very attentive.  My Wrap & Sandwich didn't come with Fries, which was a good thing....I'm trying to cut back on Fries.  The flavor of the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich was amazing!  Full of flavor....and the Bread was delicious.  The proportion of veggies in the sandwich was good too....no single flavor overwhelmed the Sandwich.  The Wrap was just as good.  The Avocado and Chicken were distributed evenly in the Wrap......I hate it when stuff in a Wrap is bunched together so you only taste a single flavor.  That wasn't the case here.....very good.  As a big eater, I was left wanting more though.....but it was probably good for my diet, ha!My friend and I put away several beers before we called it a day.  Overall, I was pleased with the food, service, and menu selection.Will I return?  You bet, I want to try more of the new menu items.Kona Kona Kona! A Summerlin hotspot located in Boca Park, but im not sure why im telling you this since everyone and their mom has been here! They have the best happy hour. I usually partake in the 4$ Margarita or 7$ sake bombs. Food wise its just as good! from sushi, avacado egg rolls, to flat breads they have something pretty much for anyone. Only one downfall.. their usually so busy its hard to get a table or spot at the bar so get there early!Happy Hour all day Sunday?! Well, don't mind if I do!!HH is only valid at the bar and also at the patio. It is pretty spacious. The place was pretty busy and we were still able to find a seat outside. It was a nice, cool day so being outside wasn't torturous. Started off with White Sake Sangria ($6.50) which was the best sake infused sangria I have ever had. I've had a few sake sangrias before where the sake overpowered the drink but this one was the perfect blend. Also got a Margarita on the rocks ($4.75).For foods:Cheeseburger Sliders ($6)- I thought were pretty tasteful. Got it as medium which was cooked perfect. One thing that was different was they put cucumbers instead of pickles which I loved because I loath pickles! Good amount for the price.Avocado Egg Rolls-(half off about $5)- I am a avocado lover so this was heaven in my mouth. It came with a honey cilantro dipping sauce. yum!Shrimp & Chicken Wraps- ($6)- Lots of flavors in your mouth. i really liked it. The portion was just right. The right amount of lettuce and comes with a cucumber salad which was pretty delish.Philly Roll (half off about $3)- Sushi wasn't too good. The ratio of rice was pretty off. Not enough fish in it. If you want to eat sushi, I suggest to go somewhere else for it.Service was good. Natalie came by and checked on us at the right times. Food came out in a reasonable time. Our table was a little sticky but other than that I will probably be back again.

My half-Filipino-ness loves deep-fried pork goodness from this place such as crispy pata and sisig.  Last Friday, my big sis was craving for some sisig.  I've been to Cafe Moda before and have experienced how loud this place gets at night so I suggested we call in a to-go order.  After trying to talk my sister out of eating here, we ended up eating at the bar since the tables were blocked off for a kid's birthay party (yeah, a kid's birthday party on a Friday night).  As predicted, the place was obnoxiously loud.  The dj had a thick Filipino accent and was saying stuff like "happy bird day (happy birthday with a Filipino accent)...you guys wanna dance IN the dance PLOR?"    *CRINGE!!!*The food couldn't come soon enough!  Then the dj started urging people to do karaoke!  OH HELL NO!  The server/bar tender was too busy trying to flirt with every guy there and flipping her hair.  This place is stright up tacky! If I didn't love my sister, I wouldn't have eaten here.  But I'm sure she learned her lesson: call for a to-go order!But then again, their sisig is the best!  The crispy pata is excellent here too.Came here to verify that the sisig was as good as everybody claimed it to be. I gotta say that they were spot on. Me and the wifey came on a Thursday night at about 9:15. First thing I noticed as we walked in was the blaring music they were playing and people that were dancing ballroom style. For a second I thought we went in through the wrong door because outside it wasn't marked clearly. Once we were greeted by the hostess and was led to our table, we weren't too sure if we should eat there or take our food to go. Since we really didn't want to wait til we got home to eat, we decided to tolerate the club style ambiance and ordered it for there. Im kind of glad we stayed because what happened next was really something you cant forget.We ordered Pork Sisig and Tokwat Baboy. As we were waiting for our order, we were watching all the peeps that were on the dance floor do their thing. Now I wasn't sure if this was a typical Thursday night because upon looking further, we noticed the crowd was a mix of young and old folks. The DJ was playing a mix of fast moving songs from the 60's to today. Didn't matter what he played, everybody on the dance floor did their thing. What really caught my eye was when they played "Gangnam Style". I kid you not I swear I saw at least 2 old ladies that could have been my grandma doing the dance like they were Psy themselves! Wow. Dinner and a show!So we finally get our food. If you refer to my pics, these two dishes alone could have fed at least 4 people so we knew we were gonna have leftovers for the next day which wasn't a bad thing. Of course we had steamed rice to go along with it so if you think we were gonna eat it just by itself than you are so wrong.Service was mediocre. Our server came by every so often to check up on us but it seemed like forever in between those times.The food itself was definitely worth it just going there. Only thing is, I think its a bit pricey. The Sisig was 13 bucks and the Tokwat Baboy was 11 bucks. At some other Filipino places, it was definitely cheaper.So in my opinion, if you don't mind the loud, blaring music and the out of tune karaoke singers, then eating here should be ok for you. Otherwise, call ahead and get your food to go.

There's just something funny about a white guy and his latin boyfriend noshing on soul food in the desert. But what's not funny is how dee lish the food is here at Lil Mama's. And how fun just to say lil. Perhaps the two t's and the e at the end put them over on their sign budget. But I like it. Lil Thomas likes it. The enormous serving of fried chicken was crisp and succulent. Yes, I said succulent. How many of you have used that word today? Side of red beans and rice were faboo. Five stars to the mac and cheese and collard greens. The smothered chops were not my fave and I would try another main dish. Perhaps the catfish? Huge tumblers of sweet tea to chase down this caloric feast hit the spot. The space is sparce with vintage looking African American art. I noticed a performace space near the front window. The ham in me wanted to jump up there and do the Steve Martin front porch dance from The Jerk.

I wanted this restaurant experience to be better than it was. The idea of a hip, New York-style, off-strip steakhouse in downtown Las Vegas is very appealing, but sadly 3xGeorge falls short.Service was good. The steaks were good (although one of them was overcooked and sent back)...but I don't want "good", I want "great", dammit!The biggest problem is that "Hogs and Heifers" is right next door, and there are a bunch of fat, tattooed yahoos revving their bikes loudly throughout the night with no consideration for, or awareness of, anyone else in the vicinity. Not that I blame 3xGeorge for that, but it doesn't help the overall dining experience.Seriously, I am stunned at why there are so many good reviews about this place. I'll start by saying that I would normally give a place a second try if it wasn't the best experience.. as there re many factors as to what can go wrong on any night of service.. but this was so far less than mediocre that I don't have any desire to go back. From the start when my group of 4 walked in at 8pm, the bar was packed, but the booths were nearly empty as we took a stroll to look around. We did not get seated right away, but we were early. The server didn't approach our table for nearly 10 minutes after we sat, and was in the vicinity at least 4 times... Finally,  she arrived and after ordering 3 martinis, that all came in completely different fashion than ordered.. and taking 15 minutes to get that sorted out.. it was at least 25 minutes before the server returned again. She was a mess.. and it didn't get better. I had the wedge salad which was just fine, and my friends all had the Soup of the day - Jambalaya... which isn't soup.. and actually was 'gumbo' by my account.. and was actually very good. A friend had a caesar that he said tasted stale. It tasted overly fishy to me and unbalanced. (We had it taken away which is how he ended up with the gumbo, jambalaya, soup thing)For the main course we ordered 3 steaks and a seafood pasta dish. The  steaks were very poor quality. I mean the ribeye was $32 .. and while that isn't the most expensive price for a steak of that sort, its a pretty hefty price tag for a garbage piece of meat.  It was ALL fat.. not marbled evenly and not very good grain to the meat at all.. just trash. I literally had 3 bites. Were it not for the martini and the 2 glasses of wine, I may have cared more.. but I was sharing with my friend and she switched with me for the seafood pasta. Every, single scallop.. we counted 6 .. was sandy.. which to my knowledge means unwashed or from a can.. and unwashed. The sauce was meant to be some form of scampi I thought, but it was watery and thin and just not that good. Any of these complaints were not registered because the server never came back to check on us.Ok, longest story short.. the server didn't return to the table until the check was dropped. The bussers basically took care of us until that point. Not only was the caesar salad on the check, but she added an 18% gratuity to the bill.  Is this standard practice for sub par service and food? She was no where to be found, and my companions decided to leave it since we  would not be returning. 'I would not consider going to this place ever again unless something drastic happened, like it changed ownership. Honestly it was bad.This review is based on two visits to Triple George Grill.  Overall, I found this restaurant/bar haunt on the edge of downtown to be an excellent provider of comfort food.  But there were ups and downs.The first occasion followed an enjoyable Las Vegas Yelp Book Club meeting, as I dined with a few fellow Yelpers, including our Community Manager, Misti Y.  We began with very good warm sourdough bread, followed by a nice complimentary relish tray which contained green and black olives, hot red and green peppers, gerkins, and carrot sticks.  On the second occasion I had to ask for a relish tray, but it then quickly arrived. Slightly peppery Calamari was very good dipped in either a mild Marinara Sauce or an excellent Lemon Butter Sauce that was presented on request without extra charge.Excellent baked French Onion Soup was both hot and cheesy.  The Cheese was Swiss, and the crouton bread that broke down quickly in the hot broth.  Only a little patience is required to allow the crouton time to melt.  On the first visit, soup was followed by a very good Caesar Salad with Parmesan splinters and tasty clusters of toasted Romano Cheese.  On the second, an equally fine George's Chopped Salad was served.  This dish featured Iceberg Lettuce, tomatoes, green onion, bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, and ample avocado chunks all tossed in a flavorful Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing.Both entrees I ordered were delicious.  One was Bacon-Wrapped Meatloaf and mashed potatoes, served with excellent Brown Gravy, mushrooms, green beans, carrots, and onions.  To my surprise, I liked this dish even better than I did the Pancetta Wrapped Meatloaf with Mushroom Gravy I had recently enjoyed at Postrio, and later praised.On the second outing, I was presented with a gigantic bowl topped by a thin sheet of crust beneath which lay the other ingredients of an excellent Chicken Pot Pie.  The crust and filling were not connected, but all it took to do so was to break the crust into pieces with a large spoon provided.  Inside the bowl were numerous chunks of white chicken meat, peas, carrots, pearl onions, tender potato chunks, and pieces of Button Mushrooms, all merged with a garlicky Cream Sauce that tasted good but was too peppery to me.  The crust was buttery and no different than a very good doughy top clinging to a traditionally prepared Chicken Pot Pie.  The result was successful, just like the independent-component and memorable Lobster Pot Pie I enjoyed at Michael Mina's Stonehill Tavern inside the St. Regis Hotel in Dana Point, California.  Unfortunately, Diane ordered Chicken Parmesan with specially requested Alfredo Sauce, which was graciously supplied.  But, while the portion of Chicken Parmesan and linguini was immense, the sauce was really thin and insipid.  Hopefully, this was but an infrequent aberration.An excellent homemade and gigantic Chocolate Chip Cookie covered by a scoop of ordered Vanilla Ice Cream was the highlight of the second meal, even better than B.J.'s Pizookie, which I also happen to like.Service on both occasions was friendly and very attentive.  It needed to be, because on the initial encounter, clumsy me overturned my straw-topped glass and spilled the entire contents of an almost fully filled Iced Tea right onto the lap of my Yelp friend Mamie P.  She brushed off this accident very well but I knew that it must have felt like an icy-cold assault, and felt badly about it.  When notified, the restaurant staff immediately charged into action, swiftly cleaning up the mess and providing new napkins, Iced Tea, and a new bread loaf, which also took a light hit from flying brown liquid drops.  The restaurant has a dark woodsy look, and reminded me of San Francisco's Tadich Grill where I liked to dine when I had been able to scrounge up enough money to do so while attending law school in the city.  Papers littered the floor of the men's restroom on one visit to Triple George, but after I alerted my server about this, within one hour the messy restroom had been cleaned up.  I greatly enjoyed both dinners, and intend to return soon to try the Country Fried Steak.4-1/2 stars!The blackened swordfish of the day was cooked perfectly but the chef drowned it in pepper, which was unfortunate because otherwise this fish would have been delicious. The squash soup (also a special of the day) tasted like it came from a can. The service here is very good but the food just doesn't add up.I am so disappointed with my experience this past Saturday night. I made a reservation for a girl's night with my sister and some friends. I had heard amazing things about the food so we thought we'd get dressed up and give it a try.We called on our way to let the staff know we were running a few minutes behind, and were about 5 people less than we anticipated. They were fabulous and made sure we didn't lose our spot in the process. Kudos to the ladies up front. They were great.When we were seated we immediately got to looking over our menu. I have a dairy allergy so I had planned ahead and read the menu online. On the website they offer a vegan menu, so I happily chose the ravioli in advance, as a dish I don't normally get to eat. When our waiter (Cameron) arrived we were all prepared with our choices, and even ordered an appetizer. I ordered the ravioli, even though the vegan menu wasn't presented to us. Someone ordered a steak, and one of our friends ordered the chicken alfredo, with an addition of shrimp as well.  As the waiter took each of our orders, he asked if we wanted a house or ceasar salad. We were excited for our food. About 10 minutes later I received my salad, bread and then a (very unprofessional) tap on the shoulder.  The waiter was there to let me know that the vegan ravioli are not available. But they had a meatless chicken marsala, a meatless chicken bruscetta and a meatless burger. I let him know that I am allergic to dairy, but I do eat meat, so I'd rather see the regular menu, if possible. He kind of just stared at me like I had a few extra heads, and then moved to grab me the menu. When he returned, he hovered while I made my selection. I explained I would like the lemon herb chicken, but I would need it made with oil, and not butter, if that's how it's made. Again the waiter looked at me like I was crazy, so I added, "Please tell the kitchen staff I have a dairy allergy, no worries". And again he stared. And he said "Well you can't have mashed potatoes, no can you." (You see the menu doesn't tell you what the sides are, only that they are pared by a chef). So I told him no, to which he replied "So veggies and pilaf then??". And I said that was fine.Then we waited. More than 45 minutes came and went. No appetizer, no water refills, no checking on us, nothing. Our food arrived and our friend's dish did not have both chicken and shrimp. It had just shrimp. So we explained to the expeditor the issues, and that we never received out appetizer. We explained that we weren't mad, just wanted to make sure that these items were not on our final bill. The expeditor said he'd let our waiter know. A few moments later the waiter showed up with a manager and they apologized for the mix ups, though the waiter did not seem very sincere. We finished our meals and our plates were cleared pretty quickly. The waiter came back and seemed much more sincere. He admitted that he had just plain forgot to input our appetizer. He handed us a desert menu and let us know we could pick one desert on the house. We excitedly started looking over the menu........15 minutes later, we had to flag over the waiter for our check. We let him know, while the offer was nice, we now had to go, so we did not want our free dessert. He insisted that we take it to go. We explained that we could not trust that we would get it quickly, and thus, only wanted our check. A few minutes later the check was dropped on our table. And to my absolutely disappointment, I found our salads for a fee on our check. The waiter never explained that we were paying for salads. We each ordered our entrees and then the waiter asked "House salad or ceasar?" We were led to believe that was part of our meal. So we flagged down a manager. We explained the situation and he stated "The salads have a price on the menu", in a condescending tone. Salads have a price everywhere. That way if that's all you want to eat, you can order that. Such crap. So he stated if we wanted, he'd take the salads off, and walked away. And then, from behind our booth, he handed our check back and said "HERE". And upon inspection, our of the salads remained. We paid it. But only because we'd had enough.We didn't tip. We don't even feel bad about it.Finally stumbled on in and honestly, I enjoyed it!Sat at the bar, which is INCREDIBLY LONG, in order to enjoy the 4-7 p.m. happy hour.Seriously, the bar fills the entire room.  But, I digress...Ordered the $5 calamari happy hour special, $5 "American Mule" and wedge salad.First of all, the calamari is a great deal.  You get it in a big 'ole cone with two dipping sauces.  One is cocktail, the other tasted like something tartar-y, but better.  The breading was perfect, not too heavy, well spiced, and crispy.  The portion was really generous too for a $5 special.  I would totally order this again.The wedge salad, also good, was a good find.  I generally order a wedge wherever and whenever I can find it.  But, I have to agree with other reviewers, no bacon is WEIRD.  I feel like Triple George Grill is intentionally messing with everyone when they present a lovely wedge but NO bacon.  Shenanigans.The "American Mule" was tasty but not strong at all.  I appreciated that it was served in the traditional copper mug but I'd order a regular price drink next time in order to actually get some alcohol.Overall, good service, good food, world's longest bar, all good.Walking in I fell in love with the atmosphere. It was really relaxing, but never again will I order from a prix fixe menu. My husband and I had a reservation for Valentines Day and decided to go with the special menu they were offering for $99 a couple. Items ordered:-Bisque of Love (lobster meat)-Be Mine Cocktail (shrimp cocktail) -Bow N Arrow (twin stuffed lobster tail w/mashed potatoes/asparagus) -Fall in Love Duo (lava cake/ice cream/chocolate covered strawberries)All of the food had good flavor but I was not a fan of the mashed potatoes. They were a bit too runny for my liking, they didn't taste fresh, and kind of tasted like instant mashed potatoes. The lobster was on the tough side. I really had to get in there with my steak knife, at one point I thought it was going to fly across the room because I was being so aggressive trying to cut into it. The dessert was amazing but by the time we received it, the ice cream on top of the lava cake was already melting and had formed a pool of ice cream on the plate. I did not get full off of the dishes we ordered. We went someplace else to eat afterwards. Price vs. amount of food was not justifiable. I should have stuck to the regular menu. We could have had a better, cheaper meal.. Our server Brenda was really nice. My husband ordered the beef tartare without knowing what it was, shame on him. He refused to eat it when it was brought out and Brenda was kind enough to switch it out for the shrimp cocktail, she was very attentive and friendly throughout the entire meal. I will be back again because I really want to try the pot roast, but until then they get 3 stars from me because of our very friendly server and great atmosphere.How have I never seen this place on Yelp?  I've always done searches in the area and it's never come up on my feed.  What a damn tragedy that I've been missing out on this here joint for 6 years. Enjoyed this place last night before heading down to lend an ear to Rise Against. Awesome.  Really awesome food.  Service was okay.  They were busy but the waiter was super nice. We had - Their sourdough bread with their pepper flake olive oil.  I am the biggest sucker for some good bread.  I would eat it by itself for dinner if it was healthy for me.  So damn good. Blue cheese wedge - not as big as the waiter had claimed but the dressing was very tasty. Lamb chops - cooked more rare than medium rare. Which was perfect regardless because it was perfect.  From the flavor to the mashed potatoes; some of the best lamb I've had. Seafood fettuccine - a little spice and the scallops were OH so delightful.  The sauce was super buttery and thick. So beware, but it was full of flavor. Come here if you haven't been to this place.  And hopefully it shows up on people's feed.  Worth every penny.  And they play sports for you crazy sports fanatics.

This buffet is located at South Point which is a bit further from the strip but we were here for the rodeo competition and were hungry so to the buffet we headed.For $15 we went in for lunch...which included mimosas. They had normal buffet food...but it wasn't great quality. I still ate 3 plates:Plate 1: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=fsbBhNLTpOun8rUazxefNAPlate 2: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=3sTWwO4oZ9xzTrzigk9ADgPlate 3: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=AlXdm4Rww07ObBjUKh3odQI ate because I was hungry...but when your in Vegas, the city of buffets, there are better buffets to venture!We stopped here on a whim for dinner, not even looking at the Yelp reviews in advance. I would definitely have been scared off, if I had looked so that's probably a good thing. My fella is a sucker for buffets so I decided to be a good girlfriend. There was no line and we noticed that they offer a discount with a rewards club so we made sure to get one before we went. The prices weren't great, but we decided to still give it a shot. We were seated quickly and the server was very friendly and brought our drinks. The line was pretty well stocked. They had a lot of variety, which I was little surprised by. It was a basic buffet, but unlike some of the more expensive buffets in town, they had a lot of things to choose from and it was better than expected. They have themed nights so that's fun. Definitely a better experience than expected. Not the best food or buffet in town, but a solid choice if you're at South Point.As far as buffet goes, it's okay. Price was so so. You get a discount if you have a players club card. (Only the card member, not your whole party gets the discount, which sucks when you're with a bunch of kids)They had a variety of cuisines (Seafood, BBQ, Chinese, Mexican, But nothing stood out. Service was very efficient and friendly. I can't say I would recommend this place. There are other options you might want to explore before coming here.

Review Text :
So, my dad took me here today and billed it as an "upscale Houston's."  I think not.This place is a total Houston's rip-off.  Seriously, the decor is the same, the smell when you walk in is the same, the servers' outfits, the menu, the drinks, the silverware - I guess you see the point.So I ask the server, "are you affiliated with Houston's?" He goes off on a story about how the WCG is an original concept and much better than Houston's - yada yada, save it for someone who isn't an aficionado of the Houston's persuasion.If you are going to say all of that, and clearly be a rip-off of my *favorite* restaurant, then you had better live up to the name.  And frankly, they don't.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad with mango and avocado (surprisingly, Houston's has the EXACT SAME SALAD - only better).   It was good, as I was jonesing for some tuna - but I could have done without the heavy sesame crust and the drenching with dressing.  My dad has the rotisserie chicken, and was so disappointed that they ended up taking it off of the bill (it was cold and dry).  We both had fresh-squeezed Arnold Palmer's - and they had ooky sugar-coated rims.  No thanks.The french fries were excellent, yay french fries.  Oh, and surprisingly, you can get them with mustard-honey dressing, just like at Houston's - though again, it wasn't as good.You know, it is probably a 3-star restaurant, but I was so put-off by the whole "we aren't Houston's and that restaurant sucks" attitude - when they are so clearly trying to be Houston's, that I will not ever be back.  If I want Houston's I will get the real thing, and it will taste better.Plus, I think the name is super lame.  The service was fine, the place is fine - but just go get the real thing, it is worth the wait.**UPDATE**I upped my star rating to 3 because the GM contacted me and explained a bunch about the restaurant.  I really appreciate such personalized customer service - he certainly didn't have to be so nice.  So, I will try WCG again and hopefully pull the rating up another star!  I still think the name is funny . . .** ANOTHER UPDATE **I was harassed by a fellow "reviewer" of the WCG who was clearly affiliated with the restaurant.  This "reviewer" has no other reviews and is a bit fishy.  I do not appreciate being contacted to argue about the experience I had and this type of activity destroys the integrity of Yelp.  I will not be returning to WCG and neither will anyone I know in AZ (they will all be hearing this story!).  Plus, we like Houston's better, anyway, so this will not be a loss!Yes, it may be a chain (there are locations in Vegas and Chicago too), but WCG is a special restaurant... with top notch service, awesome food & drinks, fun atmosphere, and moderate prices, I have to give 5 stars.  I almost don't want to give 5 stars, just because they're a chain, but after my experience there tonight, I feel they deserve an all-star rating!I arrived first (as usual) and put our name in (party of 4)... it was prime time (7:30 on a Friday night), so I expected a wait.  (They don't take reservations during dinner; only lunch).  I was given a beeper thing, and no more than 5 minutes later, it vibrated.  The rest of my party was not even there yet!  The hostess sat me anyways - there was a great table available in the bar area.  Alicia was our server and approached me within minutes of sitting down to take my drink order.  I also ordered the artichoke appetizer for the table.  The rest of my party arrived and Alicia was back to take their drink orders. share the specials, answer questions, etc...3 of us ordered the crab cake entree (2 with a side of broccoli and 1 with a side of honey roasted carrots) - and my dad had the halibut with fries... everything was delicious!  The crab cakes are not breaded at all; they melt in your mouth!  The broccoli is steamed just right and sprinkled with parmesan and some special seasoning that makes it taste great.  The carrots are sweet like candy.  I didn't have any, but the fries that came with the fish looked good too!In the past, I've also had the Four Cheese Spinach & Artichoke Dip (served with warm tortilla chips and salsa), the Rotisserie Chicken Tortilla Soup, and several salads... I've always been impressed with the quality, taste, and serving sizes too!I didn't tonight, but if you can - save room for dessert!  The desserts are actually listed at the top of the menu, so they stand-out - for good reason!  They are all phenomenal!  My favorites are the White Chocolate Brownie, the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie with Graham Cracker Crust, and the apple pie a la mode!Yes, the menu is similar to Houston's; yes, the bar is a replica of Ocean Club... but, the service and quality of WCG make this place unique and worth every bit of the 5 star rating I'm giving them!EDIT: Service on a Friday night was not quite as great... I'll keep their 5 star review, but i'm rounding up now from a 4.5.  We'll see what happens next visit!Is it wrong to update a review a lot?! I went in and decided to try a new item other than my usual rotisserie chicken , which did I mention was like the most delicious thing ever?For some reason I just wanted like a sandwich. I wouldn't think of them for a sammy(my girlfriend hates when I call them that) I got the club BUT it isn't like other clubs. They actually rotisserie up the turkey themselves so it isn't shitty processed nitrate grossness. it was moistest, non gamey, turkey ,the most crisp bacon,awesome cheddar and peppered tomatoes so damn good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got it with no mustard or mayo and a side of BBQ.  The mustard I got on the side too. mayo is gross. But the BBQ I think they make, it is kinda fruity like cherries or something perfect to dip every other bite in. The have crappy fries so dont get them as a side the mashed potatoes are very good and they added a speck of nutmeg and have a fresh thin jus from the chicken. They are really good and normally i would never order mashed potato's. The cous cous is pretty good it has a cilantro yogurt sauce and raisins and pistachios. very pleasant ;)I did try to get a burger once and I took it back, never get a burger. If the burger was good they would get 5 starsWe went on Saturday night and this place was packed. Luckily I had made reservations beforehand. The bar area is pretty cool, but it and the dining area were so loud. We sat on the patio, which is covered and has fans and misters so we could actually hear each other talk. We tried the date night special. It included 1 appetizer, 2 salads, 2 entrees and a dessert to share for $58. The AZ rolls were a pretty tasty appetizer, even though I had to pick the corn out of it. I enjoyed my WCG Bacon Blue Cheese salad. It would have been a lot better had they used spinach instead of mixed greens. The Caesar came with some nice big shavings of parm. Yummy. We both decided on the Parmesan Fillet for our main. The parm was a little overwhelming. We both pushed most of it aside, but the meat was very tender. My mashed potatoes started off yummy, but got pretty hard toward the end of the meal. We split the White Chocolate Brownie for dessert and it was pretty good, but we were so full we didn't finish. Service was slow. We were here for almost 2 hours, but our waiter was very friendly. Everyone I know really likes this place so I think we may come back and give it another chance.I have to lawyer up a little early in my review this time...http://tinyurl.com/4julqgDo you miss the simple, twisted genius of Warren Zevon, too?At any rate, to fully disclose,  I know the owner of WCG personally and businessally...You'll just have to trust me when I tell you that this didn't shade my review...in fact quite the opposite...I have been sitting on this for a while...trying to figure out how write this without sounding like a shill!Then I thought, "Well, Donald, everyone is still entitled to my own opinion" so here we go!WCG is one of my favorite places in the Greater Phoenix Area for a number of reasons:* The menu is so varied, creative and well executed...everything from the Mesquite Grilled Artichokes to the Roasted Chicken to the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad and my favorite, the Maytag Burger (more about that in a minute) is well prepared and delicious* The service has always been first rate (and I have to say that I expected that when the server is aware that I am friends with Bobby, but there are ton of people there that don't know me from Tyler Florence and we still get great service!)* Extraordinary care in the preparation of the food, from the grinding of the beef for my burger to the grilling of the artichokes and the construction of the puff pastry crust Apple Pie for desert...they pay incredible attention to detail* The atmosphere and ambience remind me (and not by accident) of one of my Northern California favorites, the Rutherford Grill...all cherry tones, leather and soft lighting...it always puts me in a great mood and compels me to eat more than I shouldToday was no different...The Beautiful Carin and I stopped in for a lunch meeting to discuss our business, our branding, goal setting for the company (is world domination within 48 months too lofty a goal?) and what not (I set foot in this Northern California inspired place and I start to sound like Ah-nold again and so forth).For my lunch, I had one of the best burgers in town...the Maytag Burger...they grind the meat on the premises, daily, fresh...no kidding!For the "Maytag" portion of this earthly delight, they bake and crumble the bacon into the Maytag Bleu Cheese (notice my fancy French spelling there...merci') and form it into a disk of cheese and bacon that they drop onto the burger a few seconds before it's done and voila'...the best bacon/bleu cheese burger around...bacon and cheese in every bite...genius!Carin has her favorites, too...the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad is one, as is the Spit Roasted Chicken and some of the best Crab Cakes you'll find west of Baltimore.I smile every time I walk into WCG...I smile even more (and I usually burp a little, too) when I walk out after another great meal!But don't take my word for it (another disclaimer to end my review on the right note)...go see for yourself...and try the Apple Pie...you'll be happy you did (and quite possibly burping in delight, as well).After my initial visit long ago, I re-discovered WCG with my Partner in Culinary Crime this summer.  Since then, I think we have tried a little bit of everything - lunch, happy hour, dinner, the Date Night Menu and on one occasion just dessert.  Yes, it is that good.I update my review specifically to share three outstanding items on their menu that I would be happy to enjoy again and again:Filet Mignon Cobb Salad - large enough for sharing, it is a very pretty presentation with orderly rows of marinanted filet, mushrooms, blue cheese, crutons, bacon, tomato, avocodo and egg all atop field greens in a red zinfandel vinaigrette.  I prefer it without the egg or avocado, but hey, I'm picky!Silky Chocolate Soufflé Cake - A warm chocolate soufflé cake topped with with créme Anglaise and whipped cream.  Decadent and delicious - I doubt I could ever get tired of this.  Life is short, eat dessert first!and my new favorite:Maytag Burger - WCG grinds all their meat in-house, and this juicy delight is just right!  Each bite is infused with Iowa blue cheese and applewood smoked bacon, and these flavors enhance rather than overpower the beef.  Mmmm... Beef!WCG now accepts reservations (recommended, it can get crowded) -  which are easily accessible from Yelp!  Reserve, go, eat and be merry!!four star average?Why?This place is a chain restaurant with a silly name - the family made me eat here and I will tell you this - the only thing four star here are the sexy tall young fit waiters.... everything else is weak and salty...At least they serve bourbon - but seriously the cocktail menu was silly and the preparation by the untrained bartenders was obvious - silly rolls with honey butter oh that's cute -the food was applebees meets outback  - one of those taste of the world menus - my dad was silly enough to order the prime rib - it looked like a swanson frozen dinner - poor dad - IT IS CALLED WHITE CHOCOLATE GRILL - what does that mean - oh it means we are silly and have duped people into thinking we are a trendy restaurant.So sad - seriously the service is lovely and attentive the food is better prepared and home with more flavor and less salt - i guess the real french fries - the string kind were yummy but I needed to up my BP meds.oh and a funny decor thing - they use rolled up, stacked utensils in napkins as sorta sculptural decor around the restaurant - sorta weird

Review Text :
I had a blast at Skeptical Chymist last night... Thanks again to the yelpers that came out for trivia - Although 'Team Yelp Yourself' didn't win any major prizes, we sure had fun!  I love the atmosphere at SC - so laid back and the staff is friendly as can be!  I wasn't sure I'd be able to find a light bite to eat (I was expecting heavy Irish bar food), but I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed my house salad with salmon. I sampled the curry fries from Kelly B and dare I say they were the best I've had?!  I would go back just for those!  Delicious!  Both items went well with the Strongbow apple cider too. Thanks again, Jolene (my waitress) for your recommendations!I look forward to checking out live music at Skeptical Chymist another time soon... or perhaps returning once I brush up on my trivia knowledge.  Either way, I'll be back for sure!Sundays are a good day to do, well, a whole lot of nothing.  After a successful day of avoiding anything useful or constructive, a friend and I decided to stop by for some Irish-style refreshments.  Located in what seems to be the World's Largest Strip Mall With Confusing Parking Lot, this is a very low-key enjoyable place.  It was not at all crowded on this particular afternoon, and as an added bonus, pints were Sunday bargain-priced at $3!  I tried my first ever Dirty Pear (Guinness on top of Ace Pear Cider) - dangerously good.  I wonder if it can be counted as a serving of fruit...You can't have an Irish bar without fish & chips, and theirs is pretty good - a large slab of lightly-battered fish which was more than enough for sharing, served with a stack of crisp french fries.  While I prefer thick-cut steak fries, these skinny ones were consumed with no problem whatsoever!  Thank you, Skeptical Chymist, for assisting me in my quest for non-productivity.I had the distinct pleasure of making the acquaintance of the King of our fair city earlier this week. At his behest, we met up at The Skeptical Chymist.At first glance, I was nervous that the venue would be incredibly small. It's tucked away in the corner of a shopping center, between a sandwich shop and a Rubio's. The storefront is immensely wide, but for some reason, it didn't appear that it would be very spacious inside.To say that I was wrong would be putting it lightly. When I walked up to the "Please Seat Yourself" sign where a hostess might stand during peak hours, I was immediately lost. There was a vast section in the center of the bar that was teeming with people there to enjoy the amazing happy hour specials (from 4:00 pm - 7:00 pm). I had to actually walk around to the right side of this group (through a small seated dining section) to reach the bar.I only had a moment to gaze at the bar while waiting for Scott D. to arrive. In that time, I noticed several different beers with which I am, sadly, not yet familiar. Though, after the night I enjoyed, I'm sure we will not be strangers for very long.When Scott D. arrived, we ordered a nice stout beer (I'm ashamed to say that I was too nervous to pay attention to the name of the ale). Scott said that it's a good idea to "start from the left, and work your way to the right" of the beers on tap. On this night, we never made it past the first tap.We picked up our ales, and headed to the outdoor patio (another pleasant surprise).  The patio was surrounded by misters, which I'm sure, offer great relief during the blistering summer months. There was a television in the corner of the patio that was airing the Thursday night NFL game. There was a walk up bar that connected to the bar in the main room. At first, it appeared that we got lost in the mix, as it took a while before a waiter came around to see how we were doing. But, once they realized their mistake, they were exceptionally quick to rectify the situation. Our server, whose name escapes me, was incredibly courteous and apologetic for the delay. He asked if we were interested in appetizers...which, after the strong ale, we absolutely were!Scott recommended the "Pulled Pork Sliders". Perhaps it was the beer, perhaps it was the situation. But the sliders were great! They come four to a plate (perfect for sharing). And since it was happy hour, we got them at half price ($5.00).As the night progressed, there was another round of the same beer. That, subsequently, led to another appetizer. For this round, Scott suggested the Chicken Tenders. Being happy hour, we only paid $4.50 for this dish. Just like before, this dish comes with four chicken tenders, making for another easy mathematical conclusion as to which way the dish should be split. I know they were chicken, but the manner in which these tenders are fried, they reminded me more of fried fish. Whatever the case may be, they were scrumptious.Cue the third round of beers, again from the same tap. (Now I HAVE to return, just so I can figure out what this beer is called!) We sat, we drank, we ate, and we were merry. We ended up chatting for more than three hours over drinks and bar fare. So, if you were paying attention, you know that we each had three stout ales and two delicious appetizers during our little pow wow. By the time the tab came, I had completely forgotten that we had been drinking and dining on Happy Hour prices. The damage was an astounding $40.00...including a generous tip! As we exited the bar (three plus hours later), it dawned on me that there was a stage upon which live music acts performed! This place is WAY bigger than I had originally though!  And did I mention the "Library"? I fear I may have said too much already...perhaps when I return, I'll venture into the rest of the nooks and crannies of this local gem!That wraps it up for my 50th review. I know, to some, 50 reviews isn't an impressive milestone. But, to me, this one was special. And, after all, everybody has to start somewhere!I hope you enjoy both the review and the venue!I'm going to give Skeptical Chymist 2 stars to average out my recent 4 star visit and my 2 recent 2 star ones.I really want to like Skeptical. They have everything I like:  Their food is very good and well priced. They have excellent specials and a huge and thoughtful craft beer menu. Plus, it's just a cool, local one of a kind place.What's the problem?  Hostility.It's a coin toss as to how you'll be treated.  I've been there probably 10 times.  One time it's great, and next time you're treated like an unwelcome intruder.Last night was the latter.  The waitress clearly did not want to be there.  She conveyed agitation from the first moment she approached our table.  She mumbled, slouched and shuffled.  We expressed an interest in the Red Hook Beers on special.  She gestured toward a poster on the wall, clearly intending that we get up, go read the poster and not trouble her by asking her to verbalize what Red Hook beers they have.  She left, we walked over to read the poster and ordered our selections.  "We're out of all Red Hook beers" she then informs us.  She impatiently demands our "plan B" beer selection.  My wife was reading the beer menu.  The waitress asks me what beer I want.  I said " I'm waiting my turn to see the list" She let out a sigh of contempt and just walked away.Monday is $5 Cheeseburgers, which is a fantastic deal.  My son ordered one.As I ordered mine, she barked over me as I spoke:"I'll have to charge you for the water"What? "I'm going to charge you for water"  Why are you going to charge for a glass of water? "Because you have to order a drink for that deal and he (gesturing toward my son) only has water."What a very charming diplomat you are, miss. He'll have a Coke, thank you so much for asking.The food was good but again the waitress just had this impatient "I hate everyone" attitude the whole time.  Later we asked "Can we order more beer before happy hour ends?  She just says "Yes" and keeps walking.  We looked at the board, read the menu and carefully select which beers we wanted.  She shows up with 2 glasses of what we had ordered at first.  I said "What are these?"  "Your beers"  "We didn't order our second beers yet""These are what you ordered before""We didn't want those again, we wanted something different""Oh" ...and left them anyway, sighed (again) and walked away. End of discussion.No "sorry"No "What did you want?" No anything,  just "Oh" as in "I will put that on my list of things about which I do not care"Interestingly, she disappeared 3/4 of the way though the service and someone else took over.Expect good food, and a theoretically good beer selection but do not expect good service because this is not the first time the level-of-service-coin toss landed tails up..

Review Text :
Let me exalt your praises, Mucho Gusto. Don't blush darling. Our love will not remain in the shadows! Do you remember the time that you almost tried to set my boyfriend on fire? You put on an amazing little impromptu firework show when your misters got into a fight with that pesky string of lights, but you were kind enough to quell our fear and try to erase that memory with free alcohol, you wily little minx. You needn't delete him from the equation. We're usually game for a three way with you, Mistress Gusto.That was right when the two happiest hours in my otherwise hellacious day were coming to an end. You do know that between the hours of four and six, your warm embrace and sweet nectar are all I need to forget about the dramarama of the office. The memories of your hibiscus, tamarind and mango margaritas, frosty Dos XXs and generous glasses of sauvignon blanc bring a smile to my face, especially with a three dollar price tag.And you're always very gracious when I graze freely on the chips and salsa when I'm feeling frugal. I don't know what combination of chili and spices you sprinkle on your toasty little delights, but they're positively divine. Although they can't even hold a candle to your tasty salsa.To help keep me from acting like a lush, which would greatly embarrass me in your presence, you offer half price appetizers during happy hour. That guacamole of yours with the pomegranate seeds has a zesty twist, while your gigantic Mexican pizza and mountainous machaca nacho plate have lured large groups of my friends to your patio and bar on many an occasion. Sharing is caring, and you're trying to teach the world to be a better place, one shrimp cocktail at a time. When I'm feeling like a nice lunch or dinner instead of our usual rendezvous, your pozole always brings me happiness, with snow white hominy afloat in a sea of green and lots of tortillas to sop up that goodness. Your Colorado Stew is likewise as delectable, as are the Mexican street tacos. I especially dig how you let me mix and match three tacos, so I can add a red chili pork taco and fried fish taco into the mix!Your cute little bistro setting with the beaded lamps and cushy bench seating made a delightful setting for a first date, while your exemplary menu, service and specials has had me coming back ever since. It's a good thing I'm not the jealous type, because I want to share you with all of Tempe.My new favorite Mexican place in Tempe. Love their tacos. Their menu only lists them individually, but feel free to mix and match. I usually go with one camarone and one pescado. The shrimp are small, but there are lots of 'em. And the chunks of fried fish are bigger than the taco itself. Portions are generous - I'd have to skip breakfast to be able to finish more than two. Service is friendly and efficient - easy to get in and out during your lunch hour. Also a great spot for happy hour.

Restaurant name  Garcia's Las Avenidas

Review Text :
I am a second generation Garcia's Las Avenidas patron, as my folks frequented the little taco stand down the street that started the whole thing. I swear instead of a pacifier, my mom put a Garcia's shredded beef taco in my mouth, and its been love ever since.This is hands down one of my favorite places to get Mexican food and I love that the family has stuck to their roots even as the neighborhood has changed drastically over the years. The staff is friendly and consistent (in other words - go often - and you get treated like family).I would offer up suggestions for the best menu items, but truthfully I LOVE IT ALL.  Everything is made fresh on-site so quality has never been a question. One thing I would add to Kristin's review is that if you are looking for a deal, the prices at the Take Out center are about 1$ cheaper per item. The only down side is that you can't order Margaritas to go, so if you want one, drink it down while you are waiting for your order to come up.Since I live about 10 minutes from the location, I usually hop in my car, hit my speed dial to order, and depending on whether or not there are a lot of cars in the drive thru line, cruise right on in to grab my food and go.  Portions are pretty large, so if you are ordering a two item combo or one of their dinners, plan on leftovers. But where else can you get two meals with chips & salsa for around 10 to 12 bucks??Oh and did I mention the Fried Ice Cream? Messy as all get out, but OMG is it good!!!When I was a teenager I worked at Garcia's Metrocenter. As a lowly busboy at the chain restaurant I learned about how restaurants work. The job also offered me up some amazing Mexican food and all the chips and salsa I could eat. In the years I worked there, those never got old.Back then, the operations were still watched over by the Garcia family, who had sold the name and concept to a large corporation. Today, the chain serves pretty much some of the most mediocre Mexican food around and many of their stores have closed.However, the Garcia family wasn't dumb; they kept the best for themselves. The Original Garcia's Las Avenidas in Phoenix is still owned and operated by the Garcia family, as it has been for more than 50 years, and is not connected to the chain. Many of the dishes you remember eating as a kid can still be found and enjoyed here.From the outside, the building has lush landscaping and a separate building for takeout orders. The interior is reminiscent of an old Spanish home with low slung ceilings and lots of woodwork. The main dining room is cavernous, like walking into a Mexican courtyard, bright and inviting.Once seated, guests are greeted with a bowl of hot tortilla chips and a cruet of mild chunky tomato salsa. It took me right back to my busboy years. If you prefer more spice, ask for hot sauce, which they will provide upon request. I enjoy mixing the two sauces for a tasty hybrid.To take advantage of the salsas, a Cheese Quesadilla ($5.50) is a must. I always ask for a side of lettuce and chopped tomatoes so I can adorn each crispy slice, then pour on some salsa.The menu hasn't changed much over the years, which is a good thing. It's nice to know that you can always order your favorite dish, like my all-time Garcia's favorite the Pollo Fundido ($9.95). They take stewed chicken meat, then wrap it in a flour tortilla and fry it until it's light and crunchy. It's topped with smooth jalapeño cream cheese and slices of cheddar cheese then placed under a broiler until the cheeses are melted and bubbly. Served with rice and beans, each creamy bite is sure to please.The Combination Appetizer ($9.25) offers hearty miniature-sized versions of Mexican classics. This plate includes miniature beef tacos, beef flautas, beef chimichangas, green corn tamale and refried beans. Give this plate a good dousing of salsa and it'll be hard to stop eating. Aside from the mini chimichangas, the cheesy green corn tamale really hits the spot with hints of sweetness.If you can avoid eating the crunch flour tortilla shell, the Taco Salad ($7) loaded with seasoned ground beef, might be a healthier choice.Desserts stick to the classics, such as Flan ($4.50) and Sopapillas ($4.25). My favorite is Deep Fried Ice Cream ($4.75), a ball of hard frozen vanilla ice cream covered in honey and cornflakes then quickly fried so the outside is slightly caramelized and crackled.While I'll probably never go back to busing tables, the idea of all-you-can eat chips and salsa sure makes it tempting.

Mlife Black gave us a free room at The Mirage and a free meal here.  So who are we to turn down some free food?  Mr. W. and I just so happened to take my parents to Vegas for them to be tourists like good children one weekend and this offer pretty much just fell into our laps.  So let's eat some meat!!!After having the best Brazilian BBQ in Vegas, I was hoping for a similar experience.  "Disappointment" seemed to be on the menu.  While the hostesses were rude and the waitress was no where to be seen majority of the time, the lovely servers with their sticks of grilled meats were always out and about between tables.  They kindly gave us these red-and-green colored things to let them know when they can bother us with more meat and when to give us a break.  They seemed pretty oblivious to this though and just kept wandering by.  I really don't mind since they're really just showing off all they had to offer and there was a pretty good variety but everything was so ridiculously dry.  Bite after bite of beyond-well-done meats were piled onto our plates and something within the first ten bites made my stomach churn.  "Where's the bathroom?" I had asked politely to a snooty waitress.  "We have none here.  You have to go to the casino floor."  How friggin convenient.  Why WOULD a restaurant need a bathroom after all?  It's either that or that female dog lied.  That... female dog...!None of us were impressed and I'm glad the meal was free because I wouldn't pay to dine here.  It's such a pity because the ambiance is actually quite nice and it's right across from the Revolution Lounge and next to the elevators.  Oh well.

Imagine this: you are very hungry, having a difficult time deciding what to eat, figure it out, turns into a craving, get there, you are turned away = frustrated and put out. My husband and I decided to go to DragonFly since we had not been there in a while. One of the things that we liked about the place was that they closed at 10pm. We got there and walked in by 9:40pm (knowing that we'd arrived in the past later than that and still received good service). We were turned away!Not a good customer service decision. DragonFly staff, I realize you want to go home, but if you advertise that you stay open until 10pm, stay open until 10pm.Honestly a 2.5, but I am going with a two based on the service and smells I endured during my visit.Upon arriving on New Year's Day, around 11:30, there was only one other table dining in the restaurant. Immediately I noticed a strange smell, almost urine smell, which was very discouraging. I was seated and noticed the booth seats were torn, and didn't even up to the table. With that said, I decided to give it a chance and chose to order the shrimp with mixed vegetables lunch combo with a spring roll and fried rice, with a cup of wonton soup. I was brought egg drop soup, which tasted horrible, so after 10 minutes of trying to flag down my waiter, who was on his cell phone in the back of the restaurant, I expressed that I received the wrong soup. He brought the wonton soup, which was just okay, but before I even had a chance to enjoy it my lunch was delivered. The spring roll was not cooked, very doughy and bland. As for the shrimp with vegetables, very good and a nice lunch portion. The fried rice was decent, but was basically brown rice fried, one one sliver of egg and one carrot, a little disappointing. And, the most upsetting part was my waiter was MIA the entire time, and when he did stop by he smelled of smoke. I get employees need breaks, but it is not too attractive when they smell like a smoke stack, especially when handling food.Honestly, not sure I will arrive anytime soon.

Review Text :
1/2 & 1/2 does not equal 2 at Nicantoni's Pizza.We were looking for a local pizza place that had a larger menu with such things as Chicken Parm.  I went on Yelp and found Nicantoni's reasonably close.  I saw that Aileen had reviewed it favorably so that carried some credibility.We went and ate at the restaurant.  They have a funky atmosphere and friendly staff.  Working so far.We shared a pie and my wife ordered the chicken parm.  It looked good and came with a nice side of spaghetti.  The pizza was tasty with a nice thin crust.  It was slightly soggy in the middle but in fairness we had lots of toppings.  I appreciate that they charge appropriately for toppings.  So if you order 1/2 onion and the other 1/2 mushroom it counts as 1 topping not 2 as many pizza places charge.They also carry limited beer and wine which is another plus.

This place was horrible. The customer service was below average. We order AYCE and the waitress was telling the table not to order to much at a time cause it would take 20-30 minutes to get our food, but yet she said we only have an hour to eat. How can you offer AYCE and then limit the amount off food. Later in the evening we asked where the rest of our orders are and the sushi chef decide to start lying and yelling, saying that we never ordered anymore only to come back a few minutes later (mind you after they gave us dessert) and said he found the slip with our orders, but this was too late. Worst part of the whole thing is that I come to find out the next day that my friends got sick with what was most likely food poisoning. This was a major waste of money and I regret giving it a try.

Review Text :
I just want to start this review out by saying if you think wearing heels to the Sandbar is a good idea, you are f'ing retarded.. And yet, I see the same hoes wearing the same hoe-y heels and complaining that they cant walk and that the sand in between their toes is disgusting. God people are irritating. I don't love this place. In fact, I don't even really like this place. I feel like everyone who goes there has a giant stick up their ass, stares at you like you have 10 goddamn heads and the dudes.. don't even get me started on the dudes. Lets just say douche to the bag. But pluralized. 500 times.I once cut my foot open on an enormous shard of glass that was peeking out of the sand because I was dumb enough to think it was a good idea to empty my shoe out and step on the ground. Don't do this. Don't even take your shoe off ever. Also, don't get in that water. I swear a layer of syphilis was floating on the top of it last time I was there. I think a decent rake job on their pseudo beach is a must after every shift.. and perhaps some chlorine, or better yet...  bleach. Seriously, think about it.The one cool thing that ever happened at the Sandbar in the handful of times i've been forced to come here was that a dude bought 100 beers. He bought ONE HUNDRED BEERS and passed them out to whoever was close. I think I walked away with 3, and who the hell doesn't love free beer. Other than that, this place is enormous and confusing and dirty and there are random shards of glass and STD's floating around everywhere. Sorry dudes, im just, not a fan.

Review Text :
Love their Pizzas, The Avocado pizza and the mushroom party are my fave! Love the Caesar salad , yummy California rolls, love the grocery side too.Downside is no waiter service until after 4pm!  You also can't order pizza during the week until after 4pm!  Parking is a nightmare and they are always very busy. My biggest complaint would be when my family and I had went there to celebrate mothers day (not on actual mothers day) one year and they did not want us to move a couple of tables together, they expected us to all sit at separate tables...WTF.....I mean they really put up a fight over this  BUT, Of course I was not having that, and moved them anyway....I've noticed since then they have welded the tables to the ground and you CANNOT move them, so if you are going with more than 4 people it really sucks!I do Love the food so I will suffer serving myself and having to put up with the mobs on the weekend to enjoy a pizza for lunch.I had to take away a star because it's really inconvenient to go there even if the food is divine.Woah talk about confusing, starting with the entrance - we walked in through the back door, right through the kitchen.. still not sure if that was actually an acceptable thing to do. Nobody said anything if it wasn't. Then what? Looked around for a hostess, didn't see one - were we supposed to seat ourselves or get in line? Which line? The big one going out the door? The coffee station? The pastry station? Did we have to go to each one for something different? Would have asked somebody if there had been anyone to ask. Like I said, confusing. Won't be that way for you, of course, because I'm going to lay it all out for you...Ok, so there ain't really all that much to lay out.. It's pretty simple, actually. Split up, that's my advice - one of yous grab a table - there aren't many when they're busy - and somebody else get in line - doesn't matter which one. We ordered everything we needed from the coffee station. Apparently that's a secret, because the other one was going out the door, like I said.The food - we shared the french pancakes, these super thin little slices of Heaven, and the tofu "chorizo" burrito. Rockin' good breakfast. Very tasty, and a nice change of pace. Beware: the orange juice is freshly squeezed and jam packed with pulp. Cool if that's your thing, not so much if it ain't.And in retrospect, all that confusion - was all kind of part of the charm of the place. Weird, huh?Well finally! Just over a year ago Gabi invited me to lunch at LGO, then we switched and went somewhere else and that is the last time I have been on the verge of going there. Not that EVERYONE didn't recommend it. When people hear where I live they assume I'm making daily trips to LGO, which I now know, I should have been! Dottsy and I hit up LGO on Wednesday night, meeting at 7:30. Of course the place was packed, not to mention the absurd parking lot (thank god I rode my bike!), but the LGO gods smiled on me and I found two seats at the chef's table almost immediately. I took in the menu as I waited for Dottsy (late as always, but I forgive you), though honestly there's not a lot to take in as the options are few and very straightforward. Then I stared at other people's food and got really excited. So excited that it took me forever to figure out what I wanted to eat (Shrimp Ceviche, Pizzeria Chop Salad, Mushroom Party Pizza or Veg-o-rama pizza were the final four). Dottsy bought us some time by telling the server he was both 'GORGEOUS!' and had 'BEAUTIFUL EYES.' Way to take one for the team Dottsy. I went for the Pizzeria Chop Salad and the Butternut Squash Soup to start.  My soup was decent, but really, I need to stop ordering things I make really well at home because I'm never wowed. Anyway, the salad was yummy and I'd asked for no raisins and our server even came by to make sure it was raisin-free (it was, and btw he really was beautiful).  Dottsy's pizza looked great and I got to sample a slice and immediately wanted a whole pie to myself. I guess it's all the more reason to head back to LGO and work through the rest of the menu!Lemon zest?  On a pizza?  Yeah, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it.  I decided to put my faith in LGO to create a wonderful pizza experience.  And that they did!  My final verdict; the Avocado Pizza is heavenly!  The creamy avocado, sweet tomatoes, summery basil, bright lemon zest, and add in the salty prosciutto and you have yourself a pretty tasty pizza.  The best part is that you don't see that kind of pizza on the menu everywhere you go. The even better part is the sourdough crust!!  So delicious!  All of their pizza creations sound amazing.  I can't wait to try them all!  A few more tries and I easily see a fifth star in their future.It did take us a few minutes to figure out the lunch flow of the place.  - Order your food on the grocery side, - find your own table on the pizzeria side, - wait for your sandwich on the grocery side,- listen for your pizza on the pizzeria side,- ask for more ice at the coffee stand,- fill your ice tea at the table at the doorway between the two- go back to the grocery side to pick your dessert from the case (trust me, you do not want to skip this step!)In addition to the wonderful pizza and the lunch with great friends, LGO also provided a bright spot in my day by putting one of my favorite (hard-to-find) red wines right by the cashier for $10 less than I usually get it at AJ's.  Score!!How is it possible that I haven't reviewed my love; LGO? Well, better late than never and that's definitely the case with this. I'm not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said, but LGO is a classic gem in Phoenix. It's nestled among quaint houses full of character and as you walk in, you'll most likely see several beach cruisers parked along the building, waiting for their owners who take a morning bike ride to grab a bite to eat. I visit LGO when I want to pretend that I'm in California or on the ocean, or in Europe or even if I want to forget that it's 100+ degrees outside. I visit LGO when I need to do work but want to get out of my normal routine. I can grab some food and set up shop at one of the several tables or booths, or even outside. Plus, I don't need to worry about my battery dying here, for they have several power outlets so I can keep my computer's juices flowing for hours. The scene here is crazy, cool, relaxing and fun all at the same time. I'll see every type of Phoenician here and they all blend and vibe with each other like it's no big deal. The music is going, the kitchen is hustling with orders, people are chatting with old and new friends and the smell of freshly baked goods and coffee fill the air. The food here is delicious. Where to even start? Well for starters, I'll touch upon the breakfast. If I'm feeling fatty and in a hurry, I'll opt for one of their delicious muffins. If I'm feeling healthy and in a hurry, I'll go for the yogurt, granola and fruit. And...if I'm feeling fatty and lazy, I'll order one of their delicious hot meals and sit there and enjoy it. Lunchtime is my favorite and it most likely has something to do with their food. I adore the tuna melt but I only order it on calorie-counting free days. I also like the tuna salad, and turkey stack sandwich. Anything on their menu is amazing. Now moving on to dinner. Yes friends, they serve the famous Chelsea's hamburger here, so I can fulfill my cravings without having to fight the Chelsea's crowds. Their pizza is for champions and delectable. The pizza kitchen doesn't open until four and goes until late hours in the night. It's a perfect spot for a casual yet tasty meal. I will leave with a couple additional tidbits of fun facts. They sell the reusable plastic glasses that are trending up the city these days. While it's pricey on the front end ($12+), you can then fill it with coffee (even iced) or tea for I want to say just a dollar or two which isn't bad! Craving LGO but can't find a space or better yet, too lazy to get out and walk in like I am half the time? Luckily the lazy fairies are watching over us for LGO offers some excellent curbside pick-up. I will call on my way there, drive in, park, they come right out, I give them my card, they grab the food, I pay, and I'm on my way. It's seamless and I love it... just like I love LGO as a whole. I wish they opened one walking distance to me.The buzz on the street is their pizza will blow your stinky socks off your feet! Well, not exactly in those words, but in that promising context!If you know me like the back of your hand, you would already know what I look for! The crust! For one, I am a carboholic!  Whether that be bread, donuts, or rice, I cherish that food group immensely.I firmly believe the most critical bite in a pizza is going to be your first one! It will make or break your love for it! Why? Because its the closest you will get to freshness since the time it popped out of the oven! Bam! Love at first bite! Just the sight and smell caused some drool-age! It had the right amount of crispness and thinness.  The bottom crust had a slight charcoal, the way one should always like it! And the middle layer still soft enough for some bending and flexibility!Crust Test: Pass. During my most recent visit, the amigos and I decided on the "Gladiator." Yup! I guess it was indeed the most manly pizza you could get here. Glorious meat! The schreiner's sausage and pepperoni were cooked very nicely!  The cheese and sauce were no match for the meat! They played more of a subtle role but still contributed to a wonderful pizza experience.Sauce and Toppings Test: Pass.With all that said, I want to clearly say, this is not what I call a true Italian pizza.  As great as it was its hard for me to put it on the same level as some well-known places like Pizzeria Bianco, which will always be my numero uno.The major difference is in the sourdough crust.  To me, this is what defined their pizza. The one trait that separates them from the Italian style is how it is NOT bubbly with that brick-oven charcoal quality.  Instead, its more simple yet quite tasty.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ?select=Q0kUcPJhdZlueuitX154VQBesides everything said thus far, I want to give credit to their excellent service.  The host did a good job in booking our table and notifying my group when our time was near. Our server maintained a playful, enthusiastic attitude from the moment we sat to the time we finished our last dessert bite! Speaking of dessert, I happily decided that their Red Velvet Cake be my new go-to! The frosting and cake was not too sweet, just to my liking! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ?select=bCRxfhgIbOSC-eRUgD3M_gThe moral of the story, do not come here if you are seeking a true Italian experience.  Do come here, if you desire a wonderfully tasting pizza in a friendly, cool, upbeat atmosphere!***** This place has always been AMAZING and close to my heart!!! Everything from their food, the service and the ambiance!! It is always relaxing to come in to La Grande Orange both the grocery store and or pizzeria. It has a very nice uniqueness to it as well as a very tasteful satisfaction.      As for our meal my boyfriend and I had their amazingly minty Cesar salad to start, then their exquisite ceviche and to end the MUST, The Rocket Man pizza!! lets not forget their fruity sangria!! VERY YUMMY!!! Oh and yes everything was GREAT!!! :)    Honestly, last night was my best visit so far, we got to sample their complimentary wine tasting and this to us was a perfect touch for our night!!!    La Grande Orange is simply as best as AZ gets, so experience it yourself and thank me later!!! :)Everyone loves LGO. Well, almost everyone. I see a few one and two star nuts in the mix.  It's one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix too, but I have to say, the pizza is more like 3 stars. It is good, but not great. Just not a big fan of their crust. Now, the burgers, decor, service and people watching are all awesome. Plus it is attached to the LGO grocery store which is great.Last night I had their green chili burger for the first time and thought it was great. The beef was delicious and cooked to order, the roasted green chili tasted great, and even though it is borderline sacrilege, when at LGO, you gotta go with one of their massive English Muffins instead of a bun. I think it could be even better with melted American cheese, but the shredded cheddar is a nice alternative to the slice. The side of fries were awesome and they give you more than enough.After dinner I suggest you go over to the grocery store area and try one of the delectable desserts. I'm a fan of the Tammie Coe Ooey Gooey cupcakes myself. Parking's a bitch, but you can understand why. It's a great place. Check 'em out. You'll probably like it a lot.On Saturday I want to punch people in the face when here.  Mediocre food, overhyped, overpriced, no parking, bad service, and waaaaaaaaay too many people to enjoy yourself. Once upon a time you may have been worth it but with so many solid offerings in Phoenix these days your entitled attitude is not warranted.No it's cool, I'll clear off the table that you just walked by four times with nothing in your hands.  What's that?  Oh I shouldn't do that?  I should just stand here and look at the table full of dishes until you walk by a 6th time?  Ok.  Hey, one more thing. Kiss my ass.As far a pizza goes I have to say that LGO's pizza is just okay. I love, love, and I mean love pizza. I would eat it every day. Cold for breakfast even. But the pies I have had here definitely left something to be desired. I love the toppings and the interesting flavours but I am sill waiting for that wow factor that makes me want to have this pizza again and again. (** I do love that they will halve the specialty pizzas for you with no qualm. You can try two pies in one visit.)There are a few pies on my "need to try that" list. So I will be back. Plus I really want to try the burgers and the wings. I'd say at the least two more trips in the near future, of my own will. Maybe more if someone else chooses to invite. I love the chandelier in the dining area and the TV over the long bar. This place has a nice rustic feel in with the concrete bar top and the rich dark wood tables. A few larger tables for a bigger party but most of the tables seat four. Or two if you're by the window. If you do not like crowds or tight spots this is not the place for you. You order your pizza on the grocery side and there are always a ton of people in this itty bitty space. The menus are near the register when they should be near the doors. But there is usually a kind staff member to ask if you need one. All in all... It is something I say you should try once. Especially if you love toying new places and love you some pizzas.8/11/11Arrived early to meet a friend for happy hour.  While I waited, I ordered a Dark 'n Stormy, which was made with Gosling's rum and ginger beer and was very satisfying. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=3I1MDsYqvtcSvZ1mEAdm3A#3I1MDsYqvtcSvZ1mEAdm3A  I recall having to nurse it, when what I really wanted to do was order another one.  We eventually ordered a pizza to share, the Fallen Angel, which consisted of local Schreiner's sausage, roasted yellow peppers, shaved fennel, and "premium cheese and red sauce." http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=mnnAJU87MV0Skbk9d5xPVA#mnnAJU87MV0Skbk9d5xPVA  Very, very good!  Great thin crust, although IMO the red sauce made for a soggy pizza.  Guess we also ordered chicken wings, although I don't remember the experience, so I most likely didn't have any.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=pwqkdvk8VnOBNmWaDH-uow#pwqkdvk8VnOBNmWaDH-uowhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=XvbD54Sj8m2i6qSa2MxCuA#XvbD54Sj8m2i6qSa2MxCuAI haven't returned, but that's because there's so many restaurants to try in this valley we live in!  I must go back before the end of the year...So, my only question for La Grande Orange Pizzeria is...can I please live here?  Seriously, this place is GREAT!  There really is no formal division between the pizzeria and grocery parts of the store, so I'm going to talk about both.  Grocery-wise, the place carries a broad mix of classic candies, wines, cookbooks, tchotchkes that rotate seasonally (I've picked up some great holiday items here in years past), and grocery staples; they also have a cafe that serves up oatmeal, eggs (friends rave about the Commuter Sandwich), salads, sandwiches, and sushi rolls.  Word to the wise - bring some extra napkins because their bakery will make you drool!  Order up front at the counter, pick a seat, and then keep your ears perked for when they call your name.  Friendly staff, cool ambience - I always find myself Shazam-ing the music here!  ;)         As far as the pizza is concerned, the crust is insane!  It almost reminds me of really good sourdough bread, toasted and crispy, not too thin and not too thick.  All the ingredients are fresh and the pizza permutations creative.  They serve up your pie on a slab of wood - nice presentation!  Sadly, I am a creature of habit - once I find something that's to my liking, I latch on and order it every time I return for the rest of my life :/ At this particular establishment, these personal faves would be the Rocket Man Pizza (spicy red fresno chilies, broccolini, roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes) and the Classic Chocolate Pudding - wow, just wow!  I make my poor husband drive all the way across town to come here - he always grumbles but in the end, admits that the place IS pretty delicious.  The only negative - and it definitely a BIG negative - is the parking situation.  La Grande Orange has the tinsiest micro parking lot known to man.  On a good day if the parking lot gods are smiling down on you, you just might find an open 20 minute parking spot (I haven't been impressed that they actually enforce the time restrictions).  But, if you go on their website under the 'Secret Parking' link (shhhh!), you will find a diagram depicting other parking options that are slightly farther away.So yeah, come check out La Grande Orange for some great pizza, brunch, baked goods, groceries...the list goes on.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix!

Review Text :
Wow! I have finally been able to visit Ocean Club and it was well worth it. For starters, I got there just in time to snag a parking spot right out front (Thank you parking fairies). The hostess immediately sat us even though our entire party had not arrived yet ( double score as most places won't do that) Our server's name was Darian, and at first I thought he was in a bad mood because he appeared not happy with me when I asked for a black napkin instead of blurting out my drink order first. However I had him laughing and joking with me by the end of the night and realized whatever was gone on earlier in the evening had nothing to do with me :) Score one for Darian :) Drinks - Pomegranate Martini - Good lord it was good and pricey. But you pretty much do get two drinks in one and I was practically trying to break the shaker trying to get every last drop. (Darian even showed me a few tricks to make sure I got every last drop thank you!) Appetizers - we ordered the seafood tower and it had lobster, crab, shrimp and oysters. Plus we had a side of steamed mussels. I was in seafood heaven. Everything was so good. I practically ate all of the steamed mussels myself. Heck it was a meal in itself lol. Main course - Chilean Sea Bass. Could anything be any more flakier and melt in your mouth good? Cooked to perfection and it was HUGE! Sides - we had the gorgonzola mac and cheese, sauteed spinach, and my all time favorite roasted brussel sprouts. Those that know me know I love me some brussel sprouts, so needless to say, that side was all mine. OMG! Roasted to perfection and oh so good. I actually ate more brussel sprouts then the sea bass. (What can you say I love Brussel sprouts) Dessert - There is always room for dessert and I ordered the warm butter cake. It was like sweet cornbread with fresh berries, ice cream and fresh whip cream on the side. Luckily I was sharing that with two other people because it was huge. A great way to top off the night. Oh by the way, another friend ordered the layer cake. Let's just say that was the biggest slice of cake I have ever seen in one serving. It could have easily fed a family of 4-6 lol. WOWZA! Very nice place and I am sure when I will be back again one day. But until then, I will remember how lovely the evening was by eating all the yummy leftovers :)Ocean Club used to be my go-to spot for girls night out and dates with out-of-town visitors... Sure, it's expensive, but I've never had a bad meal (or drink) there.  But, I took an unintentional hiatus from Ocean Club when I got married and had a baby, and what do you know, at least two years have passed... So when it was time to choose a restaurant to celebrate my mom's birthday dinner this past Saturday, Ocean Club it was, and once again, I was reminded how fabulous it is!  While I used to sit in the bar (where there is great people watching including plenty of "hired help," awesome bartenders, and live music), we had the baby with us and a party of five, so we were seated in a back corner... this was totally fine by the way.  They had a highchair for the baby and everything!  Tyler was our waiter and he was great... the rest of the staff was extremely attentive as well.  My husband, mom, and I went with dirty martinis, and my dad and brother went the bloody mary route.  We were all pleased with the drinks - as mentioned in other reviews, they are indeed pricey, but you get two drinks in one!Bread bowl - this is worth mentioning as they always have a nice selection of breads and crackers including my favorite: pretzel bread... yum!Appetizers at our table included two types of oysters, a lobster sushi roll, salads, and calamari.  Hint: ask to split their salads - they are still a decent size when split.  I love their "Ocean Club House salad" - It could possibly be a meal in itself as it has crisp lettuce, fresh shrimp, egg, blue cheese, tomato, and onion.  The other apps were delicious too.For my entree, I split the Chilean Sea Bass with my husband... I'm a huge sea bass fan and this is up with there with some of the best I've had.  Again, splitting it is great as even a half serving is plenty once you add family style sides, etc...  My parents went with lobster tail and brother had a bone-in ribeye.  We chose the roasted brussel sprouts and signature lobster mashed potatoes (both cooked perfectly and oh so delicious as well).  Note that it's very difficult to choose just a few sides as there are so many to choose from and they are all delicious.  The sweet potato fries, onion rings, creamed spinach, and steamed broccoli are other faves that I've had in the past.  As if any of us weren't full enough, Tyler brought out a huge slice of chocolate cake for the birthday girl, served with fresh whipped cream.  Mmmmm.... and once we licked that plate clean, we also ordered their signature butter cake, which came with more fresh whipped cream.  OMG - that butter cake is incredible!We all went home full and happy and will definitely return for more special occasions.  Thanks to my dad for picking up the bill!For my 1600th review, I chose the 3rd and final restaurant in the Scottsdale/Phoenix Mastro's trilogy.  I've dined at the other 2 restaurants and this was the last one....I am now complete! :)What more can I say about this place?  Outstanding service and food!  Wifey and I dined with 2 colleagues from out of town.  They'd never dined at a Mastro's before, so we decided to go all out and give this location a try.  Here's what we ordered during this visit:Beef Carpacciohttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=0A3PEoUl8nKmlvj8EF5-oQ#0A3PEoUl8nKmlvj8EF5-oQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=Ixj6faa-nc0dTkGppacixw#Ixj6faa-nc0dTkGppacixwShrimp Cocktailhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=3AR60YF7zUfUTlMkpHYINw#3AR60YF7zUfUTlMkpHYINw12 oz Bone-in Filethttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=QVxssj3cmGN4HCaFUaGUUg#QVxssj3cmGN4HCaFUaGUUgLobster Tailhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=7Au-elHq0sjklrUCFmc9Rw#7Au-elHq0sjklrUCFmc9RwSwordfishhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=NSB9arDBjuxvveTXfEw9yA#NSB9arDBjuxvveTXfEw9yAGorgonzola Mac 'n Cheesehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=LqVgNLZiYkTlHyI4l27kMg#LqVgNLZiYkTlHyI4l27kMgButtercakehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=fxt_7zzR_OwjQGnVuODPzw#fxt_7zzR_OwjQGnVuODPzwKey Lime Piehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=Rf66dP2sU3DFvFST48WwfA#Rf66dP2sU3DFvFST48WwfAWhipped Creamhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=V4XXNRsCPC481hDNixC9hg#V4XXNRsCPC481hDNixC9hgChocolate Cakehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=tNoj-p2RTdwGIyDk-0sDtw#tNoj-p2RTdwGIyDk-0sDtwI had the Bone-in Filet and the Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese....these are my favorite Mastro dishes.  I sampled the Carpaccio, which was phenomenal....it's soo tender and full of flavor.  For Dessert, we all shared 1,000,000 calories worth of dishes (Buttercake, Key Lime Pie, Chocolate Cake, Whipped Cream)....but it's all good when you're dining in a top notch restaurant with great people.I forgot to mention that we put away 2 bottles of Wine during dinner and a nice glass of Port at the end of dinner.  A perfect way to end an evening.Tip - Don't forget that Mastro's is not cheap.  It's a fine dining joint....expect to pay for it.Return Factor - 100%Standing on a rooftop, I shout "I absolutely love Mastro's Ocean Club!"  It's my absolute favorite place to dine when visiting Scottsdale.  I've been 4 times, for business and for pleasure (even though this makes it one of the same, 100% pleasure).The bar is beautiful, reminds me of an Absolute ad of color and things stacked atop of another magnificently, hence that's why I used ABSOLUTE so much.  I can go on and on about Mastro's, the seafood is terrific, and they even have wonderful steaks.  I have heard about the ship to shore to restaurant process, and it's nothing short of phenomenal. But what I really want to focus your attention on two things, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, and incredible, awe inspiring, Seafood Tower.  Focus, FOCUS!First, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes: creamy, lobstery, and the most perfect mashed potatoes you can imagine (I think they are buttery, too).  They will leave in a state of bliss.  They go perfect with anything you order, seafood and meat dish.  I absolutely adore this.Second, and without a doubt, the most outstanding thing on the menu, the Seafood Tower.  I've had it small (3-4 items), and I've it large (7-8 items), but I get it each and every time I go to MOC.  They clear the table, fast before your eyes.  Then, they bring out the monstrosity, a tower, 2/3/4 tiers depending on how much is ordered for how many, and the thing is smoking.  Literally.  Served on dry ice (and regular), it's a feast for king.  You have your choice from snow crab claws, crab legs, blue crab, oysters on the half shell, lobster cocktails, jumbo shrimp, lobster tails, among others.  Each and every selection is the freshest thing you can have.  I love it.  I would make sweet love to it!  It's pricey, but worthy of making credit card payments.It's a chain, I know, but the food and service has always been outstanding.

Restaurant name  Havana Grill

Review Text :
Off the freeway and near the theater is Havana Grill, a Cuban-style restaurant that offers free salsa lessons on Sundays and live music on Friday and Saturday nights.The BF and I went there for dinner last night and I think it's fair to say, this was my first Cuban experience.  Of all the Cuban-style milkshakes ($4.95) to try, the guanabana was recommended and it was a fabulous choice!  It was sweet, not overly milky, and a nice finish to my dinner.  The BF tried their version of the  Caipirinha (Cachaca, a Brazilian Rum, simple syrup and limes) $7.95.  Some buttered press-grilled bread was placed before us in a basket as we perused the menu.  For our aperitivo (appetizer), we tried their Mini Sandwich Cubano $6.95.  It's a smaller version of their Cuban sandwich and it's made with tender roasted pulled pork, sliced ham, cheese, dill pickles and mustard on Cuban bread.  It's then press-grilled and served with mariquitas (fried thin green plaintains) or french fries.  It also comes with a garlic lime dipping sauce.  Don't be foolish and get french fries now, go for the plaintains for sure!  Thus far, our experience at Havana Grill was garnishing a 4 star and I was excited about our entrees.  The BF had their Boliche Mechado ($14.95), which is slow-cooked roasted eye of the beef round, stuffed with chorizo (Spanish sausage).  It's served with white rice, black or red beans, or moros.  He had them with moros.  The dish was luke-warm and lacked flavor.  If anything, it had an odd plastic wrap aftertaste that didn't fare well.  Same with the moros.  The BF ended up dousing the whole thing with hot sauce.  (I should mention that the waiter commented that this was his favorite dish, so I can only imagine his horror when we covered the whole thing with hot sauce!)I tried their version of the Lechon Asado ($14.95), which is leg of pork that is slowly oven-roasted and marinated in a mix of lemon, garlic, lime, orange juice and spices.  There are also onions that are mixed into this dish.  I had this with white rice and red beans.  Although my pork was also luke-warm, it was tender and not dry at all.  It had a lot more flavor that the other dish, although my red beans need some kick as well.Overall, we were more impressed with our Cuban sandwich than our entrees.  Service was okay.  The waiter did come by often to ask how our meal was, but we did have to request that our water glasses be refilled.  Although they didn't advertise that there was live music on a Wednesday night, apparently there was a group practicing that evening.  It might be too loud to carry on a regular conversation when music is being played.  But then again, we figure we might come back to try out their free salsa lessons and grab some other apertivos instead of doing dinner.  Salsa anyone?Sidenote: "The Las Vegas Weekly" offers a BOGO free entree coupon (up to $15.00).

This is the place you go inside the luxurious Venetian Hotel on the Las Vegas strip when you are:1. Broke after losing all of your money gambling2. Don't want to spend $50/person for lunch in a finer Venetian Restaurant3. Want a sandwich that costs less than $104. In a hurry5. Want a snack before you get into your car in the parking lot6. Is the last money you will lay down in Sin City before you leave7. All of the aboveThe Rialto Deli is inside the Food Court on the main floor of the Venetian Hotel, near the escalators going up to the parking lots.So it makes sense that you stop here for a cheap bite before you leave Sin City.You know, all of those beautiful luxury hotels, like the Venetian, with all of their Glitz, Glam, and Amenities weren't built off the "Winnings" of the visiting gamblers. Nope. To support that type of Luxury found on the Strip, you need a lot of losers willing to give it up, over and over again.

Happy hour here I come! How can you not love 2 for 1 drinks and fattening bar food?!I enjoy the pretzel with spicy cheese sauce as my food du jour. Don't expect haute cuisine, it's just a fun place to meet up with your friends after work to drink and chat. The food isn't amazing, but you're probably just here for the drinks. Stick to pub grub. Wings and queso dip are some good options too.Keep your expectations low and have fun!Dive bar to beat all dive bars!  This place needs to move closer to my house!!!  On our way to drop off some family at the airport we were a little early so we decided to stop in for a drink of 2.  It was happy hour and ALL drinks are buy one get one.  No matter what the drink is!  Considering I drink Grey Goose or Kettle I was a little surprised.  All drinks we ordered tasted great and they did not skimp on the booze.  Not to much and not to little.Great vibe serving up mexican food and great tasting drinks.  Our total bill for a total of 12 drinks in total was $54.  Where in Las Vegas can you get drinks this cheap??  Service was great.  She was pleasant and very friendly.This is a UNLV bar so it's near and dear to my heart!  We will be back, rest assured!

Review Text :
Ok, for those of you that want a short review, "the story is short":Superior Food. Superior Service. erm....UNIQUE Atmosphere. Make reservations. Give Mikey at the door some playful attitude. Tip appropriately.There, move on to the next review if you aren't into my typical prose.It's 7:15pm on Friday Night. I was motivated to go to Capo's for only one reason: a Yelper (Judith B.) wrote a bad review and the owner Nico S. responded with zeal...on Yelp...within 24 hours of each other.  So, I went to check it out myself! And there I was, 7:15pm, ringing the Speak-Easy doorbell and mixing it up with Mikey The Doorman (his card says Mikey "The Bull"), trying to get in.  Hey, it's an OLD TIME SPEAK EASY. Don't forget about the UNIQUE atmosphere, here!  Ok, all playfulness aside, the truth of the matter is I got the very last seat in the house...at the bar...right in front of the kitchen staff and the bartenders...and I had a wonderful experience! I got to see EVERYTHING being cooked. I even saw some of the back-staff at work. There are SIX cooks all working a feverish, aerobic pace to keep the food moving toward the customer. These people are MIRACULOUS at what they do. I watched the bar-staff work with equal zeal, so much so that they took the time to make friends with me because they noticed I noticed them so much. What does it say that a Bartender (Melissa) with 5 years experience takes the FRAKKING TIME to shake hands with some random customer? Wow. And John the bar-back REMEMBERED my name. AND JUSTIN the other guy behind the bar...between the three of them my water glass was NEVER empty.Ok, anyway, there are probably twenty people working at this restuarant, and each and every one of them are busting their hiney's to make every customer happy. Every Breath of Every Minute that I was there. That counts for 5 and a HALF stars to me. I'm not talking about the "I'm busy I'm busy I'm busy" attitude, I'm talking about the "Every Customer Is My Number One Most Important Customer Every Second" kind of attitude. Wow. Props, Nico.Let's pretend the service wasn't fantastic for a moment.  It was, but let's pretend, just for a moment.  Because I was curious, I ordered the Veal Piccata, pasta fagioli (say foo-ZHOOOL!), and spaghetti with red sauce (Yes, RED Sauce). Yes, I lived in Europe for 8 years. Yes, I know my way around a traditional Italian restaurant a 'la Europa, AND the American version thereof. Yes, I thought the Veal Piccata was great! Cooked TO PERFECTION in my opinion, NOT OVERCOOKED as Judith says. My particular dinner was so tasty I couldn't get over the tenderness of the perfectly-cooked veal...and the wonderful caper sauce it was bathed in. Heck, just that alone is worth five stars to me.  Yet, I digress a little too far.The veal was perfect.  The pasta in the red sauce was FANTASTIC. Yes, FANTASTIC. The pasta was cooked, in my opinion, exactly Al Dente. Jimmy at Chianti Cafe would probably have been jealous had we been dining together tonight, and given half the opportunity, I'd like to bring Jimmy and a lady friend of his with my girlfriend and compare his cooking to Nico's one day!Oh, and then the wine. House Cabernet that tasted like it wasn't the "house" brand. Heck, I could savor the chocolate overtones battling the plum on my tongue all night long it was that good. And the wine list had a large selection of wines I recognize from my own collection at one time or other (I happen to have collected over two hundred bottles of primarily sparkling and red wines from Napa and Sonoma counties once upon a time). Sterling Vineyards featured among them.Oh, and the cappucino after dinner was really, really good.Oh, and the bread throughout the dinner was so scrumptuous!Oh, and the port after-dinner drink was luscious and velvety!Oh, and Kansas led Mich State by two most of the time I was there! LOL!Ok, so by and large, I compare this restaurant to Chianti Cafe in Summerlin and rate them equally, favoring Chianti Cafe because it is a bit more conducive to seducing my girlfriend sans loud groups of tourists. But Nico deserves 5 stars, because he DELIVERS 5 stars.And as Dennis Miller says "That's just my opinion, I could be wrong!"Capo's is a place concerned with the experience. When you walk in the front door, you enter in a little vestibule area with no windows, no doorknobs (that work), and a camera in the corner. A little screen slides open and the guy asks you what you want, kinda like a speakeasy. When you enter the actual restaurant, it's very dark (so dark, in fact, that the menus have little flashlights attached to them) but decorated well. I went there with a group of people. We were supposed to meet at 8:00, but not everyone showed up until about 8:45. To kill time, the few of us who were there decided to wait at the bar. After a few drinks, the bartender let us know that appetizers at the bar were half off. Sounded like a good deal, so I ordered the calamari, which was $14.99. The bill was non-transferable, so when enough of our party showed up to be seated, we asked to close out our tab. This was the first shady part:Bartender: That'll be $10.82Me: I thought the calamari was $14.99?Bartender: It is.Me: Didn't you tell us appetizers were half off?Bartender: Well the calamari is $10.Me: (Puzzled look)Bartender: Ok fine. Umm...just give me $8.We sit down at the table and look over the menu. Everything is typical Italian, but I really got sticker shock when I saw the prices. Entree prices averaged around $24, which wouldn't be that crazy for a fine dining venue, but this really didn't strike me as such a place. Anyhow, the calamari had really taken the edge off, so my girlfriend and I decided to split an entree. We ordered the veal parmigiana, which was $28.99. When we ordered our food, it was just after 9:00. When we got our food, it was just before 10:00. Granted there were 10 people in our group, but we were the only people in the place, literally. I don't know what they were doing, but I can't remember the last time my food took that long, even in crowded restaurants. I don't think I would have normally gotten so irritated, but I had gotten up at 3:30 for work that morning and had to wake up at 6:00 the next morning, so I had been antsy to get home and go to sleep.When finally get our food, I ask for a separate check. I admit, I had forgotten to ask for it up front, but all the other restaurants I've been to in this town dodn't have problems splitting the check up post-meal, so I didn't think they would either.Me: Excuse me, I need to leave soon. Could I pay for my meal now?Waitress: I'm sorry, but we can't split the bill after it's been created.Me: Oh, OK. Well could you please charge the amount of my meal to my card and apply it towards the bill? (I hold my credit card out)Waitress: We can only take two cards per bill, so only one other card can be used.Me: OK, well I know the rest of the people have cash, so I'm alright with this.Waitress: Fine. Let me figure out what your total is.--about 5 minutes pass--Waitress: You're total is $36.xx.Me: $36.xx?? What was the gratuity? I thought the veal was $28.99?Waitress: You two split the meal. There's a $4 split charge.Me: You didn't tell us about that when we ordered.Waitress: It's on the menu. Here, see? (She was right. The $4 split charge was indicated, but it was on the back page underneath the desserts. Since we hadn't gotten to desserts yet, we hadn't looked at the back page.)Me: OK, you're right, but why didn't you tell us about this when we ordered?Waitress: It's on the menu, so we don't tell people about it.Me: So when someone is asking for something and will be unknowingly charged extra, you don't think it's appropriate to let them know?Waitress: Nope. We're not allowed to tell people about it. Me: Not allowed??Waitress: Nope. The owner says we're not allowed to tell people about it.Me: That's really shady.Jen: Could we speak to the manager?Waitress: I am the manager. Jen: Well then can we speak to whoever you report to?Waitress: He's not here.Jen: Well then how does your restaurant handle customer service?Waitress: Fine, I'll take the $4 off.The waitress is gone for about 10 minutes doing who knows what. In the mean time, we're eating our veal, and it was mediocre at best. I would say the meat was maybe a couple millimeters thick with twice as much breading. The pasta sauce was lacking and nothing worth going back for. I gotta say, accounting for the cost and quality, you would get an exponentially better deal at Olive Garden. She finally came back with our check, $31.30, and I paid. It seemed like everything worked out. However, after charging my card, she didn't stick around long enough for us to ask for a to-go container. We waited for about 10 minutes before my girlfriend decided to just go ask for one. She walked over to where the kitchen entrance/waitress station was, poked her head in, and said "Excuse me." When the waitress saw her, she jumped around a corner. Literally. Our waitress ran away. The service was shady and the food was mediocre. I would only recommend this place to someone for drinks.Yuck! This place sucks. The decor is cool and total mob scene but the food is so nasty! Not even close to being authentic Italian food. I got 4 small frozen ravioli for 30 bucks...really? The service sucked as well. Stay away and try Parma or Roma instead.Had dinner here last night for my fathers birthday and to put it lightly...we weren't happy. The back of their menu even says to state any complaint before you leave and asks you not to be a "Jimmy The Weasel". Red flag much?For starters the food was nothing spectacular and extremely overpriced. I had the "Sawed Off" sausage and peppers which was $22! C'mon now. The dish was nearly all pasta and peppers with very little sausage. My dad had the extremely small portioned "Gotti" chicken. My wife had the fettuccine alfredo and actually left the restaurant saying she was still hungry. Don't get me wrong, the food was okay...not spectacular, but okay.Now I'm not one to complain about a restaurant especially when the food is okay. My family and I enjoy trying new places and you're not always going to have a great experience. However, Capo's had me ready to refuse paying the bill. We used a $25 for $50 Groupon last night and Capo's works the system to where the Groupon is useless. We had 4 adults and my 4 year old son (who shared a plate). With the Groupon applied our bill was $77.77 ($127.77 without). However, the waitress took it upon herself to add $25.55 for gratuity putting the bill back up to $103.32. With the price of my Groupon, the bill was actually $0.55 higher than it would have been without a tip and to be honest, the service we received didn't deserve anywhere near a $25 tip. Once they took the credit card, the waitress even went as far as writing the tip amount on the credit card slip herself!!! Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that's illegal...Now I realize many Groupon's have fine print stating there will be an added gratuity or something but not in Capo's Groupon. Be warned, this place has other reviews about the business scamming customers and now I see why. They make the Groupon useless by adding their own tip at their chosen amount. I will never return to this place and will contact Groupon in attempt to have these theives removed from their site. Now I just have to hope they didn't steal my credit card info!Let me praise this place first and foremost for it's customer service. The one thing I'm always impressed by is when you have a large group of people, and they provide excellent customer service. We had a group of 11 people and only 1 waitress. She was awesome and amazingly attentive the entire time. I was very nervous because my boyfriend's grandparents are obsessed with Italian. I never recommend places that I haven't been to, but all of my friends that I trust had recommended it to me. I'm so glad I made the choice! Everyone loved everything they got, and the best in my opinion was the Chicken Marsala. Most of us passed around our dishes to try everything out, and there wasn't one thing I didn't like. I do love Italian, and I have been very picky on the places that I like. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants. I just feel they're all the same and generally the same "OK" type of quality of food. There are a few exceptions, but I usually shy away from these places. I see people on here complaining about the prices. I feel that the prices are very reasonable, and here is why - The dinners come with bread, soup or salad. They give you large portions (even though I typically appreciate smaller portions so I don't over eat.)They have live entertainment, I'm sure it's mostly in the evenings. The ambiance and the experience. It's cute and "mob" style. The service. I always pay attention to the service and the service around me, and everyone seemed very content. The singer and the manager even thanked us for coming in and dining with them. People need to take in account for everything, not just the prices, especially if it's worth the prices and it's good food. I know it may not be consistent across the board for everyone, but I had an awesome experience. Go to their website, look at their menu before you go. It's definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys something different than the norm.Atrocious service. My trip here led to a shouting match with the manager. We purchased a groupon for a party of four. The other couple cancelled, and the restaurant manager refused to honor the groupon, even though it would have resulted in us spending more money than we would have.Apparently they are all good on cash here, so don't bother giving them any of yours. Never had a worse dining, or in this case a "not-dining" experience in my life. Can't wait to see this place turned into more parking lot. Their terrible management is going to make that happen sooner than later.After seeing the show Mystery Diner on the Food Network my wife and I made the decision to eat there on our upcoming trip to Las Vegas.  With three days to go before the vacation I purchased a Groupon that was 30 dollars for 60 dollars worth of food.  We made a reservation for 6:00 on Sunday because we wanted to eat early before we went out.  We showed up about 10 minutes after 6 because the valet was a little behind at our hotel.  After pushing the button and waiting a minute or two the little window was opened and we were asked if we had a reservation.  I told him my name and he let us in.  After we got inside, the restaurant itself was extremely dark and the gentlemen who opened the door said we were late and we would be punished by having to wait longer.  "Whatever" we didn't care, we were just hungry.  It was kind of funny when we sat down and I looked at the menu on the back it said that reservations would be held for 15 minutes.  When we sat down we were given two menus with little lights attached to help us read them.  After a couple of minutes the server came and told us about the specials.  I was very interested in the meatball and shrimp special and my wife was going to get another shrimp dish that was on the menu.After we told the server that we were using a Groupon she said we had to spend the full sixty dollars which we didn't think would be a problem.  We needed another minute to decide so the waitress left and came back a minute later.  I was excited about my shrimp and meatball special especially after reading all the review on Yelp about how good their meatballs were.  When the waitress returned the first thing she said was "sorry we are all out of shrimp," this meant I couldn't get my special and my wife couldn't get her selection.   Now how is it that you have a special and that consists of shrimp and you somehow run out of it by 6:15 at night.  I think that since we were using a Groupon they didn't want to sell us the shrimp , I have no proof but I think it was bullshit.  So we had to take another couple of minutes to look over the menu which had mostly dishes that contained shrimp.  I decided on spaghetti Alfredo with a meatball side, and my wife went with a clam dish in a red sauce.When I the meal came my Spaghetti Alfredo had absolutely no flavor at all.  It was horrible.  The meatball on the other hand was really good.  My wife's clam dish was also very good and there was quite a bit of clams in the dish, which was exactly what she wanted.  After we finished and asked for our check the waitress came back and said we were a few dollars short of sixty and we were going to have to get something else.  My wife decided to get a dessert and she chose a tiramisu which ended up also being pretty good.  It tasted like they used real lady fingers and the whipped cream was also dynamite.Overall our experience was not what we expected and we will not be going back here next time we were in Vegas.  The atmosphere was neat but I just can't fathom a restaurant that runs out of shrimp that is their special for the night by 6:15 in the evening.Coming to Vegas I was told I must try this place, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is fun and it was a must experience. After coming here I won't be coming back. The evening started out on a positive. Liked the idea and the decorations and atmosphere, but the food was sub par for the price. It said steakhouse so I ventured for the $40 steak. My friend had to change her order due to them being out of food and she was also not impressed with the selection. We did make reservations and asked about the special to make sure it was still going on when we called. We were assured it was. However, after we ate the waitress brings the bill and after inspection find out the special was not honored.  She then told us that the special was for locals only and we were clearly not locals. They did finally honor the discount, but not without complaint.  The waitress told me that "next time I just need to be aware". Maybe I should've read more reviews or maybe they should mention that when calling to make reservations.  Either way there will be no next time for this patron.New chef = lots of changes, not for the better. (This review's visit: April 2013)The Italian dressing that was SO good, circa the previous chef is now completely different. Now: inedible (greasy, yellow, tasteless and, just...No). Garden salad ($6) was made with rusty, wilty lettuce, carrots were stale. Nothing in it was fresh. Lasagna - check out my pic. I was expecting a luscious, beautiful, hearty, home-made hunk of well-made lasagna (for $10).  During this lunch service, only two other tables were occupied in the resto, but still my server couldn't get things off the ground. We spent the next 45 minutes trying to deal with one thing after another: funky new dressing, funky salad which he accidentally charged for as it was a swap for the pasta, we ordered a meatball but no meatball arrived, waited another 20 minutes for that lasagna to get boxed up, etc... Too much management required. Oyy.My previous stellar review, which I was delighted to write, belonged to the previous chef. I was expecting a repeat experience, but this was like a different restaurant.The greatest thing about this place is the entrance through the front door. Past that, everything goes downhill. I get that this place is trying to go for the Italian Mafia, pseudo rude, Chicago hard ass mentality... but the people are just not hospitable. When greeted at the host stand, they made me sit like a leper on these gross banquet chairs to wait for my table, rather than invite me to sit at the empty bar and grab a drink. The ambiance is kind of interesting but when you actually look at whats going on, you realize that the lights are just turned completely off. Its almost pitch black. Theres kind of a cool lounge singer that plays piano and does Frank Sinatra songs but hes not very good and it gets really annoying after 3 songs. The food is the worst part about this place. Its just downright bad. Its one thing if the place was super cheap and not TRYING to be a nice restaurant. Its not exactly cheap. I had a dry, crusty meatball appetizer, a boring caesar salad, and a completely tasteless eggplant parm. While I was eating my $22 eggplant park, i was legitimately thinking how i would have rather gone down the street to trader joes and eaten the microwaveable eggplant parm that they have for $4.99.The service is bad to average but i think that part of it simply has to do with how dark this place is. Noone can see anything. Our waitress asked us for our drink order without bringing over a drink menu. And she never came back to ask if we wanted a second drink.I just think this place tried to focus on the gimmick too much and is not understanding that they need to provide an actual dining experience.MUST READ ! MUST READ ! MUST READ! This is my first time to sit down and write a review about anything but after tonight I can't keep quiet. I've been going to Capos for years to starting with there first location on Tropicana. I must say the food is always great. I've celebrated birthdays, anniversary's, New Years eve and just for the hell of it lets go to Capos. But, tonight was the worst experience I had. First we get greeted by the rudest man at the door he has no smile, no warmth, you can tell he was flustered. We're sitting with another couple waiting for a table. He calls both of us up and seats us in this "private room" next to each other. With no menus. And the room had to be hitting 85 degrees and humidity 120. After sitting for about 5 some one dropped off menus. The place is so dark you need a little flash light to read the menu MINE DIDNT work. I had to ask about the Chefs Specials for the night. I get up and ask what i think is a host slash manager slash mater'd to either A. turn the air down in that room or B. Move us to the main dinning room where you can tell it's much cooler by like 10 degrees. He intel responds in his rude italian over worked voice "thats gonna be 20 minutes or so". I go back to my table start fanning my self and just waiting for an open table. He comes up to our table and says "you can eat at the  bar if you want". I told him i didn't make a reservation to sit at the "bar". He responds with "what do you want me to do then"? With his face in my face and body language like he wanted to pounce on me. I just tell him "TO FIX THE PROBLEM" either fix the air or move me. He storms off. By this time one or our appetizers hits our table. So we start eating the waitress comes up to us with our second appetizer and says your other table is ready. Im like great picked up my glass and bottled water and followed her leaving our first appetizer at the original table. We get sat in a booth in the main dinning room. First relief because its much cooler. Then we realize the table had not been wiped from the  previous guest ( which by this point that did not bug me at all). The buss boy sees that and wiped the table for us and apologizes. Well wed like to eat our salads that were dropped off with our second appetizer but we have no utensils. We tell our server that our calamari is on the table still she respond "i thought you where done with that"? I had about 4 bites. So she goes back im thinking shes retrieving our appetizer or re firing a new one. Finally we get our silver ware by the bus boy and no bread. We ask her wheres our calamari she says " you ate most of it" so by this point now shes being rude and defensive. So i tell her " am i S.O.L on my calamari? She responds with well i can have them make a half batch because you ate half. I looked at her and i almost wanted to just over turn my table in that restaurant. Im like i want my check im OUT OF HERE...... She gets her manager slash host slash mater'd. And hes like why are they leaving ? i did everything they wanted. He tells her to fire a calamari. By this point its to late I let him have it. Im so disgusted by the customer service theres no way to fix the situation. I told him ive been in the hospitality industry for 12 years and thats not the way you handle a situation. His last words to me where "Wheres your restaurant ill go eat there".....I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN SUCH DISGUSTING, VILE, HOSTILE PLACE IN MY LIFE. I dont have a restaurant THANK GOD! But let me tell you this i never made a customer that mad that he stormed out of the restaurant i was managing. Im posting this on YELP, and on my Facebook that has over 500 friends, family, and clients. And let me tell you this i see my clients daily and we do is talk about Las Vegas food, shows, restaurants, As god as my witness i will bad mouth you and tell everyone i ever meet about this experience. When i have friends come to Vegas this is one Restaurant that i will not be taking them to. So keep up the great work and the great customer service. Maybe thats why your first original location closed, and thats why you have 2 for 1 on Tuesdays and you are on groupon every other day. Bigger better restaurants have closed there doors you can too..............With out us THE CUSTOMERS REMEMBER YOU ARE NOTHING !!!!!!!!I HOPE YOU THE WORST I HOPE YOU CLOSE AND I HOPE YOU NEVER GET ANOTHER JOB IN LAS VEGAS.........DISGUSTING ! DISGUSTING ! DISGUSTING !After all the reviews I thought I was going to be in for a good time. Sadly it was just ok, I guess the door guy wasn't in the mood to bad I was looking forward to that.  I understand the darkness is part of the feel and fun of this place but I couldn't even read my menu the little light attached to my menu was broken.  :(  Made it extremely hard to order.  I got the lasagna when it came it was burnt so bad around the edges I couldn't cut it so I had to return it and wait for a new one.  By the time it arrived I was starving, the taste was good no complaints.Our group had a group on, when we went to pay we felt like we received attitude.  Don't sell them if you don't want people to use them.  Our waitress claimed the system was down and we couldn't use it, we refused to not use it and suddenly it was working again.  The whole time the manager who could have smoothed some feathers was sitting at the bar drinking.So the food was ok service sucked, oh well...It is rarity and a luxury for my husband I to get free time to ourselves. Last Saturday our daughter was spending the afternoon with her grandparents so we jumped at the opportunity to have a proper date. Capos was not really on our radar and it wasn't until we drove past it on our way back from doing some decorating at his office that we decided Italian sounded great. We turned around and got into the parking lot of Capos.I have to say that I really like the feel and the ambiance of this place. Although it is very dark when you first walk in so make sure to allow time for your eyes to adjust. My husband made a comment that this was the type of place one would bring their mistress. It was dark with high red booths offering privacy and comfort. Our server was excellent. She was knowledgable, friendly and energetic. She took our drink orders promptly after we were seated. They do have a happy hour menu mon-sat but it is only at the bar.We opted for one cocktail each... They ranged between $12-14 per.We started off with their fresh calamari which was lightly battered and complemented by sliced Peperoncinis for that added zest. $14,95For my entree  I opted for "Angels a With Dirty Faces" which was angel hair pasta in pink sauce with peas and mushrooms. I added grilled chicken for an extra fee. $18.95 + $6 for the chicken to be addedMy husband had "Racketeers Ravioli" which were homemade pasta pillows stuffed with ricotta cheese and he opted for Alfredo sauce as the topping sauce of choice. The ravioli tasted homemade and exactly the way my mom used to make them.  $18.95We overheard the server explain to a booth behind us that nothing in house is frozen or pre made. She stated that they have a small freezer which houses some of the desserts. That is what I like to hear. You pay the premium for it, but that's what I like to hear.All entrees come with a choice of soup or salad. I loved their garlic sauce that was on my salad. So delicious!!The only con were the prices. Even with 2 for 1 entree for locals, we ended up shelling over $70 for the two of us. Although the food and service were great, I am not thrilled with the price point enough to rush back. I can see the prices being justified because everything is made fresh and portions are fair, but Italian food ingridients generally don't warrant that kind of price unless we are adding seafood, etc.Cool spot to take visiting friends or family for a unique off-Strip dinner: Italian food in a speakeasy-theme joint with a dark interior and a one-of-a-kind entrance. I'd say this is more for adults than kids, though. Dinner prices are a bit on the high side, but they occasionally come up on Groupon.CAPO'S HOUSE  SALAD or NICO'S CAESAR SALAD ($7): Overpriced and overdressed, they use tons of dressing, but do taste good. Opt for the garlic version on the House, splurge the extra $3 to add chicken to the Caesar.AUNTIE G'S ANTIPASTO SANDWICH ($12): Chicken breast and various antipasto meats and cheeses layered on a tasty focaccia with roasted red peppers, spinach, and a delightful lemon-pesto aioli. Side choice of pasta salad or fries, topped with additional aioli. Large portion, very fresh.SANTUCCI'S PASTA ($10): classic spaghetti with "Capone family secret sauce", add a giant meatball for $5 to make it a real meal. Pasta was a bit mushy but the 'ball was pretty good, BF said he'd get this again.Food quality for lunch was probably a 3/5 but attentive service and atmosphere kicks the overall rating up to a 4 for me. Would come back in the evening for the Frank Sinatra singer, or to catch HH at the bar (3-6PM, M-Sat). They have a private dining room for larger parties. Look for the chalk body outline on your way out the door.This was my first visit at Capo's and it was an excellent one! They have a dramatic entrance where you ring the doorbell and the guy opens up a small window to see who you are, then opens the door to let you in.The place was very dim with lots of awesome decor from the mafia world. While casual dress is ok, I felt under-dressed wearing jeans as many were dressed a little bit more formal.Then the tables that were empty were already reserved. So, my friends and I ended up dining at the bar. Oh boy! I was happy that we ended up at the bar! You can see all the live actions while they cook and prepare your meals. They have TVs at the bar and a live singer by the piano at the center of the restaurant (I came in at the right night). It's really awesome! I ordered Tony Duck's soup and Spaghetti with Meatballs. The soup does not contain any duck. It has spinach and eggs with such a flavorful broth! I came here to try out their spaghetti with meatballs and it was delicious! The homemade meatball was bigger than my fist. It was moist and did not fall apart when slicing. The marinara was well flavored and good consistency. I prefer my pasta a little thicker though. This is one of the great dining experience I would not hesitate to take my family and friends when visiting town. Capo's is definitely an added gem for Vegas! And the cute and friendly female bartenders added a nice touch!Gimme a name...and a kick in the head. From the moment I called to make reservations, to the minute I left the joint - I was smiling. I called to make sure we wouldn't be turned away and the mobster that answered replied with a heavily Italian, "Gimme a name..."We arrived on a Thursday for lunch. We found the secret entrance, gave the eyes in the doorway the code and were granted admission. The entire place is dimly lit and mob like. Red lights flash to alert them of new visitors and creaky wood floors keep people honest. We were seated right away, in a comfy booth adorned with a portrait of Al Capone. All the waiters wear white pressed long sleeve shirts and black trousers with suspenders. I selected the meatball sandwich, which came with a side salad. The sandwich was amazing. The best Italian I have ever had in my life. The creamy garlic dressing is so good, you will wish you could take a bottle home with you. From the drink list, I chose "Kick in the Head". We visited a nearby tiki bar a bit later and let me tell you -Capo's crafts a much better cocktail. It was delicious and carried just the right punch. My man selected the chipped Italian beef sandwich and again, we were blown away. It's as if they have taken good home cooking and elevated it to off the charts good. Their Chianti selection is also excellent. Service was great. We were there too early in the day for the piano player. I am already planning a return dinner trip, so that we can experience that. I have heard nothing but great things about him.

Restaurant name  Blue Wasabi Sushi and Martini Bar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
In a town filled with sushi restaurants, restaurateurs must come up with exciting and innovative concepts to lure new patrons.  I believe Blue Wasabi does just that in merging contemporary American ingredients with their sushi rolls, as well as providing a generous list of signature small plates for the discerning palate - whether that be seared pork tenderloin or the spicy yellowtail mushrooms.  And to wash it all down, a fun and diverse martini menu dazzles its guests with selections such as the "Milky Way" (Skyy Vanilla vodka, cream liqueur, Vermeer chocolate liqueur, vanilla cream with a caramel rim) and the "Strawberry Blonde" (Skyy Citrus vodka, Stoli Strawberry vodka, homemade lemonade and strawberry puree)Blue Wasabi gained recognition and many awards when it opened a few years ago.  Categories including "Best Sushi" by 944 magazine,  "Best New Restaurant" by New Times, and "25 Top New Restaurants" by Phoenix Magazine.This is not the place for sushi purists.  Here, the goal was to Americanize the sushi experience and experiment with many diverse flavor combinations.  The sushi itself may not be top grade, but the signature rolls definitely get an A+ from me!Some of my favorite Signature Rolls:Dirty Sanchez: eel, avocado, krab, jalapeno and cream cheese, tempura'd with soy glazeEating Nemo: Krab, cucumbers, topped with salmon, thinly sliced lemon and ponzu sauceShrimp Bizkit: shrimp tempura, cucumber, asparagus, chipotle mayo, topped with shrimp and avocadoSurf and Turf Roll: shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, topped with seared beef tenderloin and a sesame onion dressingThe average cost of a roll is about $11, but many of these signatures can be sampled for 50% off during Wasabi's happy hour.Happy Hour is daily, Tuesday-Saturday, from 4:30p-6:30p.  Selected signature rolls, selected signature small plates, salads, and sushi are 50% off, as well as the entire menu of martinis.  An incredible value!For those not as adventurous, the signature small plates offer something for every palate.  Starting at $5 and going up to $14, there is much to be sampled here.Starting with fried pizza rolls, the list is eclectic.  Ranging from Americana's best, the hot wing, to buddha burgers and grilled miso salmon, your mouth will water, and your tastebuds tingle.Aside from the traditional sushi offerings, Wasabi also features New style sushi, such as "Cajun Spiced Seared Tuna" (my favorite here) and Striped Bass with a citrus green peppercorn sauce.The salads also diverge from the traditional seaweed and squid salads here.  Try the delicious Grilled Miso Salmon Salad.  The fish is flavourful, juicy, and tender - grilled in a sweet miso glaze.  The salad greens are fresh and crispy, and doused in a miso onion dressing.  During happy hour, this delectable salad is only $6.50 - definitely something you would expect to pay three times that amount for.The incentives just keep getting better here.  Tuesdays is ladie's night, so their signature martinis are 50% off the entire day.  16 martinis can be found on the menu, as diverse and colorful as a gal's handbag collection.  And did I mention they are divine?  The recipes go easy on the heavy liqour, so one can easily try 2 or 3 before calling it a night.  If you want to sample their sakes and wines, imports, or premiums, Sundays are ideal.  If you wear blue, you get 50% off all the alcohol - a lush's paradise.Overall, I love the modern decor, the blue granite at the bar, the blue padded seats, the chilled out music that doesn't overwhelm the conversations, the clean and contemporary feel of the restaurant, the fun staff at the bar, the attentive servers, and even the edamame.  Definitely one of my favorite joints for happy hour, and enjoying Japanese/American fare.

Restaurant name  TAO Asian Bistro
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Friends were in town and they wanted to try the very popular Tao Restaurant.  (It's been reported that the Tao Restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in Vegas!)  Just as we were about to enter the hallway, this VERY large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  Talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!We were seated upstairs on the balcony overlooking the huge Buddha.  As menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  As I perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, I didn't even know where to begin.  My fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. Grilled Kobe Sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.The menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  I could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (I would not consider Tao to be romantic at all.)In the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  And this is what we got:Squab Lettuce Wraps ($14) - This came with five lettuce leaves.  A decent amount to fill all the leaves.  The squab mixture was a bit too moist and the BF found it too sweet.  I had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  There was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.Lobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth ($16) - A clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  Very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  A very light and delicate dish.  Sashimi of Kobe Beef with Fresh Wasabi Sauce ($28) - Beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  We couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  Lovely taste and clean.  However, I didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.Pork Spring Roll with Thai Chili Sauce ($11) - This order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  The spring roll was decent, nothing particular special about it.  The Thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables ($34) - Very good, but I guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece of Chilean sea bass?Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken ($26) - We must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  It did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces of chicken in it, including the drumstick.  It was okay, nothing particularly special about it.Jasmine White Rice ($4) - Of course we had to order some rice!  We got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.Overall, the food was good.  Definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a certain kind of clientele.  You'll be amused to find things like Kung Pao Chicken ($26) and Grilled Prime Porterhouse with Wasabi Dipping Sauce ($88) on the same menu.  We decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended Giant Fortune Cookie ($10) or Fuji Apple Springroll ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (We actually drove over to Luv-It Frozen Custard instead!)Service is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and Tao fails in this department.  I was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the BF to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (Uh, who does that?!)  As they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  I felt like I was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  I'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  The waitstaff should take a few lessons from Rosemary's Restaurant's waitstaff.  That's what I call service!At the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  And it was...just okay.  They asked if we were going to the club afterward and I said yes and asked if they had any passes.  What they do have is a "line pass," which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  However, you will still have to pay cover.  (I think this part is rather ridiculous.  They should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  With the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  Not the best pass I would say.  Tao Restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.    There are better places where service is valued higher.$185 total, including tip and tax, no drinksThis place made my night.I must have gotten lucky because everything I ordered to eat was delicious (see my pics).  I shared the wasabi-encrusted filet mignon, sea-bass, fried rice, and salmon with udon noodles.  The rice wasn't anything special but each of the other dishes was delicious.  The sea-bass was amazingly cooked and the filet mignon hit the spot.We had a group of 15 and the service was ultra-efficient and super smooth.  I'm a huge fan of the decor of Tao nightclub, and can say the same holds true with the design of the restaurant (tho it is a bit dark.)  The servers were super friendly to us and at the end of the night as a perk for eating there, we got VIP stamps to get into the club.  And I'm not talking about "VIP" status where you get into a "VIP" line and wait another f-ing hour.  At 10PM we left the restaurant and were in the club in under 10 minutes even though a line was building up outside.  Considering I spent about $40 on the food, and entry into the club would have been about $20 anyways...well that's what I think anyone would call a good deal.If you're going to come and complain about the "noise level" take a pause and think about it.  What do you expect from a resaurant sitting below the club (with the same name, mind you).The only weird thing to me now is that two of my favorite places in Vegas have the same place ..Tao and Tao.  Nightclub and restaurant.First time diner, long time clubber. Me and eleven other "bachelors" enjoyed an incredible time at Tao for a friends stag party.After three glasses of wine I honestly can't remember what appetizers we had but they were the bomb-ass rap song. If you don't believe me, ask L.A. Lakers Robert Horry - he was at the table next to us saying hells yeah... or maybe, "As usual, I'll take the check." I wonder if he knew that the hot red head sitting next to him just came over to our table and advertised the strip club where she would be working later that night?Our server Sereka was the cats meow. Not only could she handle 12 crazy men, but she helped us haze the groom. She hand picked a table of bachelorettes for us to send a comp bottle of champagne. Imagine the groom-to-be's surprise when 10 boa-clad bachelorettes came over and personally thanked him for the bubbly.Oh, and definitely get the miso sea bass - delicious!4.5 * stars*bias switch on*Unaccustomed as I am to the wayward excess of wesson cooking oil, cryogenically frozen hamburgers -their flesh revived after 5 years of roaming the Mc pastures- and a forced-entry of Harsh Browns-shirts down my esophagus, for the everyday equivalent of a Nazi Spandau prison breakfast, my antibodies capitulated and allowed the stomachal aches to begin their bombing. I decided to tenderly call it "the blitz"This necessary intro will frame for you the picture of my everyday routine in Vegas; as I made my way for the Sands expo center at the Venetian, and with the imperative need to eat some breakfast and lunch. It was not until Friday, after a party at said hotel's poolside, that I finally had the opportunity to sit down at a real restaurant, where I would have at least, real food (the rest of the evenings, btw, dinner was served in a bottle with lime) Enter Tao:Oh yes. Finally some tranquility, some posh, some xanax imbued zest! My muscles relaxed the moment I sat at the couch. My pancreas wept alongside my saliva centers as soon as I blinked through the menu options. I refuse to pejoratively call "drooling" what clearly was the act of tender weeping. The why? Crispy Spicy Tuna and the lusciously fresh Salmon in a sweet (but spicy) sesame sauce and incrusted with crispy onions. Naturally, I enjoyed every bite of these dishes with unabashed contempt to all cuisines under the tyranny of wesson oil, and with unabashed praise towards the butcher's dexterity of the sushi liberating chefs. Kudos.As I made my way towards the bathroom, I noticed that Tao offers an expansive seating area to accommodate many refugees like myself, and when I also saw the stairs that led to the TAO nightclub chamber, I couldn't help but feel how the imposing pictures of the monks and innocent children that loomed in the walls in front of me, where in fact, severely bent on scattering my sinful wishes aroused, or perhaps to manipulate them by whispering in a nomadic tongue: "Its all-ight, we approve!" And so that you know that monks never lie, Tao offers to stamp a comp admission to the TAO nightclub above in your pumping wrist, only and if you have dined in the zen establishment. Watch the horror and astonishment of the serpent-like queue as you breeze by them and re-enter for the club scott-free (yes, they make you exit, and re-enter through the VIP line in order for you to undergo a quick ID inspection. Sorry toddlers!)So I have no problem bowing to the wisdom of the Tao Te King, and acknowledging that "Tao" is indeed "the way". Do come to this amicable speck in the midst of the chaotic Vegas strip Taiji to replenish your Yin, and by all means, your Yang waiting for you upstairs.WHERE: Located inside TAO Nightclub (downstairs)WHAT: My girls and I come here to redeem our complimentary dinners once in a while.  I haven't actually sat down and payed for a meal here so I have no idea what the prices look like, but I know that the food was worth my tip!!The all-girl complimentary dinner includes:-one round of shots for the girls of the party (lemon drop, washington apple, or their tao special)-edimame beans-fried rice-asian seasoned salad-about 3 rolls of sushi-sweet pork-dumplings-eggrolls-lettuce wraps-and you are able to choose a specialty drink from the list of drinks for free!-for dessert, a tao-made fortune cookie with a sexy/funny fortune! =DYuupppp!! Our dinner came with all of that!! It was so much food, I don't think we were able to go up to the club to dance right after! (The most recent time at least).The service was excellent, the food was excellent. So, I leave you with this.EXCELLENCE!! hahaWhile I've been to Tao several times for cocktails  I had never dined there before.  My most recent Vegas excursion rectified that minor detail.From the moment we entered the restaurant, to the time we left, service was attentive and friendly.  I started off the evening by ordering my favorite cocktail, the Tao-tini.  If you've never had a Tao-tini, I highly suggest you do so ASAP.  We ordered multiple items off the menu for our dinner, including the Chilean Sea Bass Satay as an appetizer.  After watching the Vegas edition of "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" on Food Network, we wanted to try this highly touted app.  I am so happy we did!  That was seriously one of the best foods I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Everything else was just as yummy.  Tuna Tar Tar, Pad Thai, Halibut, etc. etc.  We all loved the food. I can't wait until my next trip to Vegas so I can go back to dine at Tao on all of their wonderful food...and to have another Tao-tini.  ;)I came here for a friend's birthday expecting the worst, but was actually pleasantly surprised.I didn't even know Tao had a restaurant until the night I ate here. The restaurant is huge and surprisingly busy for dinner. The service was impeccable, with knowledgable and attentive servers. The food is expensive, but you're in the wrong city if that is a deal breaker. I definitely recommend the Chilean sea bass, order it and everyone at the table will be stealing bites. If you come here for dinner be sure to get your hand stamped so that you can get into Tao nightclub for free.***We had a large party menu (fixed) at Tao's and that could have contributed to the experience; the food was mediocre with some of the courses being decent, but more of them with a quality and flavor similar to a PF Chang's***Tao has never been high on my list to try in Las Vegas, but I've definitely heard a lot about it--especially since it is both a restaurant and, I believe, a nightclub after dinner ends.  Tao was also featured on the Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate where Duff Goldman selected their satay of Chilean sea bass as his favorite thing in Las Vegas.Tao is located in The Venetian and it is a big spot with a dark decor (very loud as well).  Tao's huge menu is very modern Asian or Asian fusion with a wide variety of items including sushi, sashimi, edamame, satay, tuna tartare, hot and sour soup, dumplings, spring rolls, BBQ meats, tempura, wok-fried meat, poultry and seafood dishes, fried rice, and noodles.Everything was kind of okay, but while a few dishes were noticeably better than what you would get at a PF Chang's, a lot of it wasn't (and Tao carries a much higher price tag though part of that is because Tao is in Las Vegas).  We did have a fixed party menu so maybe more freshly prepared dishes would have stood out more though the flavors were not exciting or memorable.Service was fine.  The food came out at a good pace.As mentioned, prices were high for a just okay Asian fusion restaurant.Tao does offer many different dishes and it brings in a lot of customers to make for a lively atmosphere so if either of those two qualities appeal to you, Tao might be worth checking out.  But if you are looking for high quality food or good value, Tao might not be the best choice on The Strip.Like other Las Vegas casinos on The Strip, The Venetian offers both free self and valet parking.I was pleasantly surprised by my dinner at Tao. The atmosphere was lively and fun. The food was fantastic. We started with the lobster wontons in a shiitake ginger broth and the satay of Chilean sea bass that was coated in miso and came with large crisp asparagus. These were both incredible. We ended up ordering a second of the sea bass skewers as they were flaky, moist and sweet. For dinner we shared the udon vegetable noodles, the salmon sashimi with avocado and the New York steak with a peppercorn sauce and veggies. Everything was top notch ingredients, and really flavorful. We ended up ordering some sort of crab roll at the end and that was the worst thing we had, otherwise each dish was really wonderful. I'd definitely come here for a fun dinner in Vegas again.Terrible service and not a good experience at all.It is very clear that this restaurant only welcomes those for whom money is of no consequence as they literally tried to take as much money from us as possible.First of all, we were asked, "Still or sparkling?" Thinking these were our only choices and still must equal tap water, we asked for still. That was a $24 mistake. Although we ended up getting the manager to take it off our bill, it caused a huge hassle.When ordering my $14 vegetarian meal, the waiter stopped me mid-sentence and told me I needed to try their Kung Pau tofu dish. Although mildly annoyed to be told my choice was wrong, I was excited to try this off-menu item.  It ended up being too spicy for my taste and I switched meals with someone else.  Fast -forward to when the check came and I found out the meal he had convinced me to order was almost twice the price of the meal I originally had picked out. Needless to say, I felt a little cheated.The meal I did end up eating was good.... Vegan Pad Thai with Gluten free noodles. (Yes, it was also appreciated that they had GF options!)  we were also able to use their buy-one-get-one promotion for cocktails as it was happy hour. However, everyone at the table was really disappointed and rather indignant at the service that was given. The cuisine was good but the experience was marred by the sub-par service and the costly extras.The only reason to eat here is to avoid the long lines waiting to gain access to Tao Nightclub. Once you've finished dining, your waiter will usher you past all the line-losers to gain your rightful spot amongst the beautiful people.It's there you'll wonder why, after six vodka and Red Bulls, your 'buzz' more resembles a Sunday afternoon on the couch than the dance party you'd hoped for.Well duh, you just ate enough food for a small village in the Sudan.On the bright side, you didn't have to wait in line.Avoid the 'family' meal experience. The bill was a stack before the tip for 8 of us. Stick with the sake bombers instead. Tao has a unique device that cleverly drops six shots into six beers simultaneously. It's so fascinating, you'll want to try this at least a dozen or so times.Don't forget to shout out some Asian babble as you salute the Emperor or else the bombers have very little effect.The sea bass was a triumph. The beef was like butter - I'm guessing it was Kobe, and if it wasn't, it was likely from a bull who'd had his nuts cupped daily by some half wit.Expensive? Yes. Loud? Yes.Was it worth it? YES!To be fair, you go here for the experience. A professional, stylish and hip Vegas dining experience. With staff that knows what they do and with food that will probably drain your wallet a little bit but is also very well presented and, most importantly, delicious.Price range: cocktails $15, main dishes $19-$30, dessert $12. Do the math for your party.Bonus: you get free admission to the night club, ask your waiter for the stamp. You still gotta pass the door though.I truly have not had a bad experience at Tao. The quality of the service is great and the food is excellent. The sushi is always nice and fresh and the Main entrees are delicious. I would recommend to get the crab cakes for appetizer. They are meaty and very tasty. The glazed miso cod is one of the best things on the menu. For side dishes you can never go wrong with the fried rice or the noodles. And for dessert, well you have to get the amazing fortune cookie. This is a giant fortune cookie with half chocolate and half cream! It's just delish! If you are planning on visiting Tao you will be pleased with the food. However, the restaurant is not cheap. Well I guess you get for what you pay!

We had dinner here with some friends.  It was our first time trying out this place and since I'm on my No Meat diet, I went for the Bean & Cheese Chimichanga.  My friends ordered an appetizer for the table that was a Tortilla with melted Cheese on it.....they insisted that I give it a try.  I did and was instantly a fan....wow, it tasted sooo good.  The Cheese was gooey and had a nice, rich flavor.  We added some Guacamole to it and it was great.By the time my Bean & Cheese Chimichanga came out, I was almost full from the complimentary Chips & Salsa plus the Cheesy Appetizer.  However, once I took one bite from the Chimichanga, my stomach kicked into 2nd gear.....it was good!Overall, it was a nice place to have dinner with friends.  It's very casual.....it was busy when we arrived around 7:30, but was empty by 9:00.....I can never get use to cities outside of Vegas where places empty really fast!Return Factor - 70%

WOW...The servings here are huge, enormous, vast, gigantic, massive, mammoth, colossal, titanic!!  A bit of advice, look to split everything on the menu.  I had the sausage gravy pot pie and it was more than enough for two people.  When our server brought it out, my first words were "holy shit" that's huge (please refrain from any cheap jokes)!  Rosemarie ordered some eggs and a mango coconut pancake.  The pancake was so big that it came out on a pizza platter. This place is American gluttony in a nutshell.  I almost felt guilty that there was so much food. Bottom line, even though the portions are huge...the food is good.  We will definitely be coming back and definitely be sharing....As I was waiting for friends, I decided to order their award-winning watermelon-kiwi-lemonade drink at the bar.  I can see why it's a reputable drink.  Not too sweet and the fruity flavors go well with each other.  Just wish I had a bigger glass.    I wasn't sure what to expect at this simple restaurant and bar.  "Twisted farm food" is a good way to put it.  As if they have large creatures at this farm because portions here are gigantic.  I've had 12-14 inch pancakes before, but never were they filled and tasted just right.  I had their blueberry pecan famous flapjack as part of my Tractor Driver combo.  This combo included 2 eggs with strips of bacon.  Thick cuts of bacon and scrambled eggs already made me happy.  It was the flapjack draping over the large plate that scared me the most.  I don't even think 2 people can finish it.  This enormous pancake made everyone look at me.  They were probably wondering why I also ordered a side of hash browns.  Looks like to-go containers are popular here.  Even with large appetites, people still leave home with a doggy bag.  The next time I visit I will have to try their one pound stuffed burgers.  A humongous burger that includes 2 patties, with apple-smoked bacon and mashed potatoes in between, and all the fix-ins and steak fries....sound like breakfast lunch and dinner combined.  Who needs a buffet?  Parking is easy and traffic around is not bad at all.  I would definitely take people visiting from out of town to this friendly establishment.  It sure beats the long lines and loud crowds on the strip.  Besides, food here is way better...and bigger, which makes the prices reasonable.  Thanks to Tish and Cynthia for introducing me to this place.  Can't wait to go back!Nothing can be said that hasn't already been said.Very reasonalby priced,,Enormous,gourmet farm fresh with great atmosphere & service.I enjoyed the fried green tomatoes,pork tenderloin,chicken sandwich and my son had a medium pizza sized pancake breakfast for $5.Check out restaurant.com for a $25 Gift Certificate-get additional 50% off CODE: Vegas.A must try!We joined our out-of-town guests for breakfast this morning, and we figure Hash House A Go Go would be the perfect place.  There was absolutely no wait on a Thursday morning at 8:30 am, but two hours later, there is definitely a wait!* Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato & fresh spinach Hash ($11.25) - The hashes "are tossed with crispy potatoes and topped with 2 eggs, served with fresh fruit and biscuit." Two sunny side up eggs sat in the corner of my skillet along with a large biscuit and a generous portion of potatoes and other good stuff.  I ate it all up, sadly enough, minus the biscuit.  And yes, I am still full from my breakfast.  It's a hearty portion alright! I even managed a couple of nibbles of the biscuit with the jam provided on the table.* Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict "w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream & scrambled eggs" ($14.95) - The Husband was looking for the item that was featured on the Travel Channel's Man v. Food, and the waitress said it was this one.  All of their benedicts are "served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes."  It was a huge pile of something with creamy sauce dripping all over it.  I took a bite, and in retrospect, I don't think I tasted anything beyond the fried chicken and cream sauce!  I did see the generous scrambled egg resting on top of the chicken though!  The Husband did box up the other half since it is such a generous order though.  * Andy's famous Bread pudding topped w/ ice cream and served w/ a cup of coffee ($7.95) - The waitress said the only bread pudding they offered was the Snickers one.  I don't recall a Snickers bread pudding on the menu, and this one didn't taste like there was any Snickers in it.  No cup of coffee arrived with it either.  It was good though.Service was okay, water glasses were refilled in a timely manner. We thought she forgot about our dessert since it was taking longer than usual.  But I think that's when it was busy in the kitchen, so that could explain the lag time.  Overall, Hash House A Go Go is the place to be at for big breakfasts.  (Looking back at my other review, I had a much better experience before!)3.5 starsMy friend told me about this place and when I saw the pictures of the food, sold!!The wait for our table was 45 minutes, which is pretty typical for Vegas I've noticed. Then it got extended to a hour because the people at our supposed booth wouldn't leave. The thing that kept us from leaving? The huge platters of food being brought out.Shared the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken with Maple Reduction. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=dbftVwJt5k64QnewOJUXLA) It comes with 2 eggs, bacon, tomatoes, mashed potato, biscuit and fruit. So much food that I couldn't even finish my share! The chicken was soo tender. And the mashed potato...mmm delicious! My friends got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=lBpd6yqIk3pYFrZ7n9z7cw) and Kiwi Lemonade (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=tUJzW857Q9RmIInyPlu12Q). The benedict was massive and looked really really good. The lemonade was very cool looking also, although it tasted more like watermelon juice than lemonade.Overall, great brunch. Definitely worth the ride and wait! =DIt was nice to get away from the bustle of the Vegas strip to come try Hash House a Go Go for brunch. The wait took around an hour for the 5 of us since it was pretty darn busy on a Saturday afternoon. We just sat around and admired all the autographed menus lining the entry way. Their menu had an incredible selection too! I think I would have had trouble deciding if my friend Marti L. hadn't already suggested a dish that sounded delish.Andy's sage fried chicken meal ($13.95 and $2.50 extra to split the dish) - OMG!! The portions were humongous! No wonder HH was featured on Man vs. Food before. haha The prices are totally worth it if you share the dish with one or 2 other people. My faves were the bacon mashed potatoes and fresh baked biscuit. The chicken didn't taste of sage at all to me and a was a little dry...there wasn't enough maple reduction but was fried to perfection! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=rOcMiMAsg_K3yC-aOPggPA)I sampled the kiwi/watermelon lemonade (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=AvvDoT4CdKsnfcCSUuy5vg) which looked pretty and was really tart just the way I like it. I also tried the bacon waffles which were to die for! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=AvvDoT4CdKsnfcCSUuy5vg) The batter was soft/chewy and the bacon complimented it very well. The food took around 20 min to come out but it was well worth the wait! Our waitress was dressed like the Chiquita banana lady too. lolFun meal and great, affordable food!This time I came back during real breakfast hours (as opposed to fake hours).  I knew what to expect with the food, but not with the wait.  It wasn't bad at all...considering how many people were waiting.  Service was better than my last visit, which was excellent back then.  And cleanliness was obvious!    As usual lots of staring at unbelievable portions of food.  This time I had the Tractor Driver combo with a Brown Sugar Banana flapjack.  The "large pizza" looking flapjack tasted great, not too sweet.  Although I did like the Blueberry Pecan flapjack better.  I also ordered a side of crispy potatoes, which was addicting.The griddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream tasted better than it sounds.  And the Sage Fried Chicken with Bacon Waffles didn't only look breathtaking, but was outstanding in taste.  There was actual bacon strips inside the waffle!  I'm working my way up to the one-pound stuffed burgers.  Give me a month...My first visit to Hash House A Go Go was for a CMYE event, so I couldn't officially review it.  My second visit was a simple breakfast with The Better Half (TBH).I ordered the Chorizo Hash (Chorizo, Jalapeno, Cheddar Cheese, Potatoes, Eggs, Biscuit, Peppers & Onions).  TBH ordered the Salmon Benedict.  To wash it down, I had the Mango/Peach Iced Tea.After a short wait, the food came out.  Since we have been here before, we knew what was in store for us....a massive plate of food.  Adam Richman from Man vs Food picked a great spot to host his show.....portions are LARGE!  You have to bring your A-Game to finish your plate.My strategy was simple....I will save the Biscuit for the end.  Biscuits are stomach busters.  I added some Tabasco and dove into the Chorizo Hash & Eggs.  It was very good!  The combination of ingredients had a good flavor to it.  The saltiness of the Chorizo combined with the gooey Cheddar Cheese and hot Potatoes made for a huge plate of Awesome!  I wish there were more Jalapenos on it though....it didn't seem to have enough of them.....kind of light.  The Eggs were prepared Over Easy just the way I like it....with the runny Egg Yolk covering the Hash when I broke the seal.  As I said, the Biscuit was last and I ate most of it with the final third of my dish....it was puffy & buttery....delicious and filling.TBH enjoyed her Salmon Benedict, but could only manage to finish 1/2 the plate.  I packed up the other half for later.Overall, it was a great experience, just like the first time.Will I return?  Soon....very soon!WOW!  Can we say BIG FAT DISAPPOINTMENT??The first time I tried to line up here, they said it would be a 1.5 hour long wait.  Good thing we decided to go elsewhere because if I waited 1.5 hours to eat Hash House, I would have been even more upset.The second time I came back, we were seated within 15 minutes.  Outside, you see pictures of celebrities that have eaten at Hash House.  The main reason I decided to visit Hash House was because of the raving reviews Adam Richman gave on Man vs. Food.  Adam, your credibility is seriously on thin ice with me after my experience here.Hash House is located inside the Imperial Palace hotel along the strip.  Is it just me or does this place feel cold and unclean?  Service here was also iffy.  It took our waitress a while for her to come over and take our drink orders and the restaurant wasn't even full.  She also disappeared at the end of our meal after she dropped off our check.  Then, she charged us an extra $2.50 for a split plate!  Ridiculous.  If I could give a negative star on service, I would.Hash House is all presentation.  Their dishes come out looking massive!  Andrew D. and I ordered the chicken eggs benedict and I was SERIOUSLY disappointed.  Eggs benedict is my FAVORITE breakfast meal, but the dish SERIOUSLY lacked flavor and kick.  I was waiting for my taste buds to be stimulated, but alas, it was bland.  I ended up having to season the thing to the best of my ability with the tabasco sauce, ketchup and black peppers we had at the table.Our whole group left feeling unsatisfied and a little bitter for having to waste our money on this place.  IIII felt bad also for making the group come back not ONCE, but TWICE to give it a try.Do yourself a favor and find another place to have breakfast at.  Hash House is all talk and no flavor.I have been told for years that amazing food is found off of the strip, but I never did the research prior to my Vegas trips to put this wise advice into practice. Thanks to my handy Yelp app. I easily found Hash House a GoGo and is forever in my app's debt. First of all, this place has moxie. The staff are fun and have character. The menu ranges from run of the mill (eggs, bacon and toast) to original masterpieces (snickers pancakes), of course there is room for plenty of crazy as well (O'Hare of the Dog, which consists of a 24oz Budweiser and a side of bacon). I loved the drink choices, lots of creative mimosas! Hash House will become a new tradition for Saturday morning, I can't wait to return. Word to the wise, show up before you go into starvation mode, you will be waiting for at least 20 minutes.WHY: I have been here a couple times, taking my touristing friends and family to see what everyone is and has been raving about.WHAT:  The food certainly comes in huge portions, so I've always shared.  The dish that I suggest everyone should try at least once, is Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict! It is named after the dude on Man vs. Food. I love condiments, so I usually ask for a side of gravy just in case there isn't a part of the benedict that hasn't been slightly drizzled with gravy, haha.The hot drinks are really good too, BUT my all-time favorite drink is the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade! This drink alone is what keeps me coming back! They puree watermelon, add kiwi syrup, all into lemonade which makes it HEAVEN! TRY IT!Let me preface this review by saying, I've been to both this hash house and the one at Imperial Palace and this by far is a shitton better in terms of wait time, service, and dare I say even the food. I had a large group of famished, sunday-after-vegas-weekend-exhausted friends. All of them more than ready to show hash's infamously large plates what was up. Okay well maybe that could've just been my thoughts, really.I was fortunate enough to have an eating partner willing to partake in my fatty adventure. The original request of a not so detrimental eggs benedict had been replaced by the andy's sage fried chicken benedict and a chorizo hash. Mind you, two very gargantuan orders. What a good sport, I almost kind of felt bad. Almost. Everyone got a variety of things which was of course, more food than anyone should ever force to digest in one sitting. We really enjoyed the sage fried chicken and chorizo orders --and were also the only two who finished all of our food. Side note, the fried chicken in and of itself was a bit dry. Luckily there was enough fat off the bacon, and the fried cheese to keep it moist. LOL. My friend got the kiwi watermelon drink thing which she seemed to have liked. No one else bothered with drinks. Bellies full, albeit painfully. Back on the road for a very long comatose drive home.Hash House a Go Go is one of those places you have to enjoy at least once out of the many trips you'll take to Vegas. You won't regret it. Hash House features American Farmhouse Food with a twist! Portions are huge and the combinations are creative. This place will get you eating outside of your comfort zone, and you'll be okay with it!SAGE FRIED CHICKEN and BACON WAFFLESWe had heard so much about the chicken and waffles, so the bf HAD to get it: Sage Fried Chicken stacked up high atop Hash House's famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction, and fried leeks. Remember that thing I mentioned about the portion sizes being huge?! Yeah, this is the perfect example. One look, and the bf knew he wouldn't be able to finish it by himself. Hah. Good thing I'm always available to pick up the slack. ;) BTW, it was phenomenal. I loved the bacon waffles!BENEDICTOf course once I saw the word "Benedict," I was already drawn in. But um... be warned, they don't serve "traditional" anything at Hash House a Go Go, so don't go in expecting "traditional" American Fare. I love to try new things, so I was real excited about their gourmet-sounding Benedict. I chose the HH original w/ smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted red pepper cream, and two basted eggs. Like all Benedicts at HH, it was served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mash. It was excellent. I'm a huge fan of spinach and roasted red peppers, so this was totally right up my alley. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and all the flavors melded together very nicely. And even though I am the biggest fan of Hollandaise, this red pepper cream sauce was a nice complement. BIG O'CRISPY HAND HAMMERED PORK TENDERLOIN SANDWICHThis sandwich is almost as big as it's name! It's like a HUGE pork cutlet served in a whole wheat bun, with onion, pickles, and ketchup. It comes with a choice of side.Hungry people, search no further! This thing is HUGE. This is taking "huge portion sizes" to another level. You'll have to see it to believe it. As for the taste, it was good. Almost like any other good, tasty, crispy pork cutlet I've ever had. Just 10x bigger..VERDICTOverall, if you order the "right" things, you won't be disappointed. And of the things I've eaten at Hash House a Go Go, I have yet to be dissatisfied. Try, try, try this place! Especially if you are a big eater, like me. ;)Yelp 365 - #280/365I have been to Hash House several times over the years, usually when friends are in town.  I only go when my group of friends want to go.  It really isn't one of my go to places.  I like the food, but I don't think it is super special.  Yes, you get huge servings and will almost always have leftovers to bring home, which is a plus, but not enough to make me a diehard HH fan.  My complaint would be that the food doesn't have a ton of flavor.  I have had a lot of different items that always sound good, look beautiful, and have great presentation, but almost always the food is lacking flavor.  Everything is bland to me.  I always have to add a ton of salt, pepper, hot sauce, syrup, or something to add some flavor.  I love chicken and waffles in general, but the chicken here is always lacking seasoning. I do think the Kokomo sandwich is quite tasty though!I will probably keep ending up at HH occasionally because so many friends are in love with this place.  I will keep giving it a chance when I am there because I like the concept and the idea of the place.  And like I said, I think it is ok, just nothing amazing.3-1/2 stars.In this episode of me vs. food, food has triumphed. I got my ass kicked by a chocolate chip pancake. The pancake sitting on the plate looked deceivingly flat. It was at least a half an inch thick by 12 inches. I thought it would be no problem for me to kill this thing, since the last time, I was here, I completely finished an Original Farm Benedict, and still had room for dessert. Must be getting old - I took half of it home and had it for breakfast the next morning. Spiked Watermelon Kiwi Juice was refreshing - ordered it with an extra shot of vodka. This meal was definitely carb overload. My desire for pancakes has been satiated for the year - hopefully.Portion size is unbelievable..........Be hungry but then again it was great the next day too....Love itAfter reading so many positive reviews, we decided stop here after the mall. I had read some reviews at the mall of so the hype was definitely set. When looking at the picture this place for me seem like "comfort food" with a twist. When we pulled up to a near empty parking lot we knew we did not have to to wait for a table. The hostess quickly seated us. The menu was massive and t took me a good 2 or 3 minutes to figure out where to start. Our server according to our receipt was Jay. He quickly took our drinking order and was prompt on service this evening this is a bonus. Our waiter brought out the drinks and offered us complementary biscuits big portions. For Hash House A Go Go "big portions" is a complete and total understatement. WARNING this place has monster size plates of food leaving the kitchen! This is not the restaurant to be eating with your eyes. Now, let's move onto the food quality. We had a total of four dishes the first  is the Hash House Meat Loaf Pasta. It had charred tomato, basil pesto and crispy parmesan cheese. This pasta was an a decent dish but my taste for pasta has changed since I went to Italy. Pasta in the United States is unable to compete with it. The Slow Grilled BBQ Pork Ribs was amazing. I highly recommend this dish. The ribs are braised with a house soy BBQ sauce and served with mashed potatoes. The ribs was tender and the meat just fell off the bone.The potatoes was the only disappoint on this dish since is was dry. The Kokokmo, is meatloaf with tomato and griddled smooth mozzarella cheese on milk bread. Reminded me a lot of a mozzarella grilled cheese sandwich with meatloft. It took an extra couple of minutes for the last dish to arrival comared to the other dishes for some reason. The last dish was the Famous One Pound Stuffed Burger. We had the hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar it comes with two patties with lettuce tomato and red onion. The prices were a little higher than I usually like to pay, but once we saw the plates of food coming out it didn't matter anymore. The presentation of all the dishes was well done (picture will be posted soon).Highly Recommend the Kokokmo and Slow Grilled BBQ Pork Ribs. So if you are planning to eat here Get hungry and make sure to wear some sweatpants!Living in Vegas for all these years, it was time to finally come here. They used to have a location at the M, but they closed down so we made the shlep across town in the hopes of experiencing a Vegas icon.Sunday lunch time and line was out the door with the promise of seating after a 45 minute wait. We waited in the car since there wasn't much wait seating. Ok, busy place is always a good sign of good food, right? Well, maybe it's more about the GINORMOUS portions.As you can already tell from the 2 stars, I was not at all impressed. However, I must give props to the friendly and cordial service we received from our server.Clientele that day was mostly tatted up hipster crowd with piercings and stretched out lobes. To each their own.We ordered a spicy Bloody Mary that was very good and perfect for a Sunday afternoon.We've been on a fried chicken & waffles kick as of late and eager to try the sage chicken & waffles. The pictures of it show a tower of chicken stacked high on a huge plate. We thought sharing this enormous entrée would be the best option.We were amused at the nearby table of 3 petite diners, each having their own tower of chicken & waffles. How ambitious.We finally got ours and though the presentation looked impressive...it was a huge disappointment.The chicken was soggy and skin was wet and fatty. The overall flavor of the sage and rosemary mixed into the batter was awful. We both choked down a couple bites but hated it. The waffle was ok with the bacon cooked into it, but not enough the redeem this nasty dish. This was the only thing on the menu that made Hash House a remote possibility for us, but after this experience we will definitely not return.The success of Hash House may be directly related to the frequency of hangovers in Vegas. Just the sight of their leaning towers of fried chicken and waffles could cure your hangover faster than IV hydration (which, freakishly enough, is a service you can find easily in Vegas). Opting for a fork & knife remedy over surgical needles, our experience at Hash House was thoroughly therapeutic, and still very Vegas-y. The ambiance is not much different than your local Denny's: big booths, neon colored cocktails in tumbler sized glasses, and smiley waitresses. They do have some outdoor seating and a fun 90s playlist in the background, but the real selling point is the MENU. It'll be hard to order anything but those famous sage-fried chicken & bacon-stuffed waffles everyone is Yelping about. But in case you're anti-poultry or gluten-free, you'll still find something to drool over on their gigantic menu. Homemade biscuits, big salads, scrambles, benedicts, crab cakes, griddled cheese, and meatloaf are all part of the uber-American offerings. Prices are also huge: $18 chicken & waffles, $15 cocktails, for example. But, be wise and share everything. These are party portions, and you've had enough of that. Shout out to our waitress who was SO cool, and happily split our check 4 ways without an inkling of annoyance. And hooray for fresh grapefruit & pineapple mimosas for $7... because quitting cold turkey isn't good for anyone.Items Selected:Bottomless CoffeeButterscotch Pecan FlapjackAndy's sage fried chicken benedict with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggsButtermilk Biscuit with Peach PreservesHot oatmeal w/ milk & mixed fresh fruitHaving visited the Linq location during its Imperial Palace days and also partaking in early morning breakfast at The Rio during last year's Winter Olympics a visit to West Sahara's Hash House A Go-Go was mostly for the amusement of a well traveled guest from out of town, and with absurd portions the rule and smiling service entirely amused by my old friend's antics one would be hard pressed to name a more appropriate experience to show what the San Diego import is all about.Undoubtedly more "Vegasy" than its Midwestern roots or So. Cal. origins would suggest, it was just after 8:15 that we entered the sizable spot and opting to switch to a four-top after originally being seated at a two-seater it would not be long before coffee was filled for the first of several times, an enormous menu next navigated with the resultant order entailing four items - one a daily special, and the rest restaurant signatures all arriving at once to quickly flood the table.Ever bubbly in service, with subtle pop tunes and country floating overhead, it was with great amusement that my pal bantered the server about her Energizer Bunny personality as I began to tuck in and although the oatmeal was nothing particularly special the fresh fruit and berry-streaked plate details did not go unnoticed, a little extra effort elevating an old standard while the buttermilk biscuit with housemade peach preserves remains one of the best in the city - a soft and savory center beneath a top baked golden brown.Moving on to things more interesting, it was next in the Man vs. Food favorite of Sage Fried Chicken beneath smoky pepper cream that the meal progressed and although the heap of griddled mashed potatoes was far too much to be enjoyed in its entirety every bit of the juicy chicken, fluffy scrambled eggs, and crisp bacon was devoured by the time the meal came to an end.Finishing the morning with a hubcap-sized pancake, equally soaked in buttermilk as the biscuit but receiving a substantial upgrade from toasted pecans and butterscotch chips, it was beneath a lacquer of butter, light whip, and brought-from-home maple syrup that a first bite was taken, and although the edges proved a bit dull when lacking all the accoutrements, the center of the flapjack was as good as any griddled novelty in Sin City, particularly at a mere $10.Chastised by some for portions felt to be irresponsible, and reportedly varying in quality depending on kitchen staff and time of day, all three of my visits to HHaGG as well as San Diego's Tractor Room spin-off have been memorable for not only the food but the service - a Midwestern vibe for a Midwesterner at heart, no matter what state the drivers license says.I really dig this place.Why? because they give you so much food it's enough to fill a fat ass like me up.I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich, which is gigantic and tastes great. My partner-in-eating-crime ordered the Chicken N Waffles, which is what this place is probably famous for and I can see why, as it's a monstrosity of waffles piled high with crispy chicken that will make any fatso-mcgee say "Wow".Despite being busy, which I'm sure this place usually is, the service was fast and our waiter was really nice and attentive, and even made light conversation with us. Just another day in paradise for him, as the family of 20 million people behind us with their 800 children threw chicken everywhere. No, he was definitely in zen mode and no brat was going to irritate him. You go dude.The drinks here are pretty good too. Maybe I ordered wrong or they're just weird here, but they gave me my shot of vodka on the side with the watermelon fancy thingy drink. Either way I took the shot and had a party the rest of my visit there.Straight up. The most American place that I have eaten at in Vegas. Bacon. Beer. Alcohol. HUGE portions. Chicken. Waffles. BACON in WAFFLES. Pancakes. Burgers. And so much more. Oh and did I mention, these portions a freakin' HUGE.My friends and I came here for breakfast after a long drive from the Bay Area. We knew we needed a big breakfast to give us some energy for the day and for EDC.We arrived around 9:45am or so and was promptly seated. The place was already super packed. As we walked by the tables, I took a peek at what other people were eating and wow. I don't know how people can finish an entire portion. (Maybe this is why America is so fat...although...the food was bomb).My girlfriend and I shared the signature sage chicken and waffles ($18). If you look at the pictures, you can see that the plate comes with two large pieces of fried chicken, 4-6 pieces of bacon infused waffles and a lot of onions and sage. I was pleasantly surprised. Everything tasted really good. The chicken was soft and tender on the inside and the Bacon/Waffle combination was amazing. Forreal though, it was more than enough food for 2 people. One of my friends, did however, finished his entire meal...Our server was amazing. He kept coming back to check up on us and made sure we were good. He encouraged me to eat my greens as well!! Overall, great food, huge portions, great to split! Come if you're on a date or hungry enough to eat for 2!

The beautiful Carin and I decided to go dinner last night and wanted something burger, within walking distance.I had seen a review of Fusion and the burger looked pretty good so we decided to try it.WOW!!! I have had most of the burgers in the greater Phoenix area and around the USA, and this is in the top 5 of any burger, anywhere ( I am including Taylor's Refresher in St. Helena, CA and the BigAss at Roaring Fork, among others).This thing was more than I could eat (admittedly after the more than delicious Panko breaded Calamari appetizer and a really good vodka martini). The caramelized onions and jalapenos are the perfect sweet counterpoint to the meat, bacon and cheese and chili/cheese sauce on the burger.I brought about 1/4 of the burger home and I think it will be lunch today. Carin had the same thing (we both just wanted a good burger and wanted to try something different...we have been to Stax, etc., and they are good, but this was decadent).The prices were good ($48 for 2 burgers, an appetizer and the marti), and I understand they have 1/2 price happy hour during the week, so we will be going back soon!!!The service was also terrific, our waiter was attentive without being intrusive, the elements of the meal showed up exactly on time, and we had chance to have really nice chat with one of the owners, Jen Lynn ( I hope I spelled that somewhat correctly).I recoomend that you give this place try, esp. if you are burger fan.

Review Text :
I'm an fan of Oregano's but don't like the wait so I don't usually go to Oregano's. I will only go if I can get there before 5:30. So tonight was the night. I had my son run in there to get us a table. No waiting line. Ya ya. We started out with their Big Julius Caesar Salad. This is their small salad. This was huge. We had four people and could barely finish this. So good and fresh. My wife could have just eaten the salad. We also ordered the large order of wings with BBQ sauce. Huge wings with lots of meat. Really love the wings with the ranch dipping sauce. Yum yum good. Of course we always order their Chicago thin crust pizza with sausage, meatballs, and mushrooms. Fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked. Loved the meatballs and sausage so good. I'm a fan of Oregano's pizza and wings. Of course we're stuffed but you can never and I mean NEVER leave Oregano's without their pizza cookie. A must. We had the half chocolate chip and peanut butter cookie topped with vanilla ice cream with chocolate chips sprinkles. To die for. So good. This always tops off a good meal. They are always known for their huge portions and tonight was not a disappointment. Service was great. Drinks were at our table in no time and surprisingly our food came out pretty quickly. Our server and the manager kept on coming by our table to make sure everything we good. Loved the service. Like I said before. Love Oregano's. Good food. Good atmosphere. Loud and fun place to eat. Just make sure you get there by 5:30 at the latest or else you could be waiting in line for a really really long time. We'll be back for sure. Enjoy.Let me preface this by saying the Pizza and service are spectacular, five stars for those!  Why am I writing this and only giving one star? For stupidity!If the manager gave us a reasonable explanation then you wouldn't see this.My mother ordered two shots of vodka on the rocks.  She requested two olives in it... Not an unreasonable request.  The bartender came over to the table and said "we don't have whole olives, will sliced be ok?"  Huh? A bar without whole olives? Perhaps they ran out?  Ok sure my mother said she would try sliced.Presentation of the drink sucked...it came in a pint glass with the ice way above the vodka, no stir stick, and the olives? Were in a rocks glass, they weren't even queen olives, they were small sliced olives like you get on a pizza.  But I am not writing about the presentation of the drink.We got the bill for our drinks, 2-16 inch pizzas, a 12 inch pizza a Pazookie and...here it comes 2 olives!  No shit! They charged us for condiments!  We had to ask why, as we have never been charged for having a lime in a beer, or 5 cherries in my daughters Shirley Temples, or olives anywhere in the world! The bartender never mentioned and extra charge for sliced olives. $0.39 each!Now $6 a shot for vodka not unreasonable, even for rail! I am not upset about the $12 drink. The slap in the face is the charge for olives, that were not even whole!  So the manager (Carrie?) comes over and gives us some BS story that other places have figured the cost of the olives into their drink prices so that is why we have never ever seen this before anywhere in the world.  Hmmmm, how do those places know how many olives we are going to ask for? Or limes, or oranges or cherries.  You know I used three squirts of soap and three squares of hand towels when I used their restroom did I go over my limit on those? Think I should go back and have them add it to the bill? I am only writing this because I was not satisfied with the reason given to me by the manager.  My mother ordered a $12 rail drink (not call) and had to pay for condiments. STUPID!Dear Mark Russell,You have awesome people, great food, and service, however you need not charge for olives in drinks... Kind of stupid. Right?Well well well, what can I say about this little bastion of Italian food down in Gilbert.  One thing comes to mind - if you plan on making a trip to a food joint an all day affair, show up here at the open...and be prepared to leave at the close.  I've had better service in countries where they don't understand what I'm saying...but considering the dairy farm across the parking lot, it's possible I was in another country.  Got there about 11, seated by 1...I had to walk outside and check the sign again to make sure I wasn't back at French Laundry!The food was not half bad - the lasagna was the size of my sister (take it easy, she's 100 LB's), the bruschetta is served on a Toyota Corolla and the garlic bread is soaked in butter flavored oil spill.  So...2 stars for them.  For the tall cool Bud Lights.  Any more stars and I'd have one more heart attack...and just FYI it took me less time to write this than it did for one more napkin to be delivered...thank goodness I wore overalls to wipe my hands on!  Dairy Farm it is!This place is hit and miss! I have gone here twice in the last few months and im still up in the air about it. The first time the deep dish pizza was delicious! Tasted great, came out before they said it would (was worth the 45 min wait time told to us) waiter was on point and it was a good time. This last time I went with my sister it was a mad house (was a Tuesday night). People were coming and going, really loud, everyone standing inside because it was too hot to wait outside for a table, waiters running around running into each other dropping food. A lot of tension and pressure in the air for some reason. After we sat down we had 2 waitresses that were trying to be attentive but were not very good at it. They apologized a lot and we were there over 2 hours for 1 deep dish pizza and a cookie pizza to go. When the pizza came out, it was tasteless, bland and just blah. The stuffed mushrooms..... I dont even know how to describe those. They looked great and I feel had a lot of potential especially with the sausage and cheese...... but nope very bland and boring. Close to being done we ordered the pizza cookie to go, 3 apologizes later from both waitresses we finally got our bill and the cookie and left. It could have been an off night for everyone im not sure. But really not sure if I would go back. Sometimes the food is worth the wait and hassle, but after this visit im thinking Barros will take care of my pizza cravings. :/

Restaurant name  Baiz Market Place
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
My ethnic experience isn't rooted in the middle eastern culture, but my fiancee's is, and she goes nuts in here buying some awesome, interesting, and delicious gear like tahini, chick peas, za'atar, feta, etc for making things like hummus, za'atar bread, and the like.  I picked up a half-rack of lamb chops and a side of couscous for prepping ($12) together.  Their butcher is awesome and far different from retail grocery chains in Phoenix.  They have a mountain of hooves, FYI.  Typically, the prices are inexpensive-to-reasonable, but sometimes the rarer items are a bit elevated in price.  That is totally understandable considering the unavailability of this type of product nearly anywhere else in the valley.  They make you put at least $10 on your debit, so be aware, though they have so much good stuff that this fee is easy to surpass.Today's lunchtime quest was to check out Baiz Market. The place is like a mirage. It sits on a barren residential stretch of 20th St. near the intersection of the I-10 and the 51. Don't worry about the car; there's abundant parking and little potential for destruction and mayhem.This is actually a business-within-a-business. The restaurant inside Baiz Market is called Al-Hana, and it's a clean, well-oiled machine. Al-Hana takes up about an eighth of the market's floor space. A young woman was taking orders at the counter and two white-uniformed cooks were models of efficiency. You can see everything being prepared as the aromas of garlic, sumac, and roasting meat fill the air.I had a small order of hummus and a chicken shawarma sandwich. The hummus was enough for four small people or two large people, and it came with a mountain of freshly house-baked pita triangles. It was delicious, but next time I think I'll ask for a slice of lemon on the side. The chicken shawarma sandwich was a miracle of industrial design. It was a perfectly shaped torpedo: juicy chicken, pickles, onion, and garlic sauce wrapped in a perfectly heated piece of flatbread. Make no mistake -- this thing is easy to eat but it's also impervious to collapse. It's the perfect thing to eat in the car (not that I eat in the car), and at $3.99 it's a bargain. For non-carnivores, the menu has grape leaves, taboulleh, falafel, baba, the famous thyme pie, etc. Did I mention the garlic sauce?After lunch, I strolled the aisles of the market. Picture the market side of places like Haji Baba or Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli, but about 10 times the floor space. Spices, bagged pitas and chapatis, green and roasted coffee beans, a full produce section... it's like being in a supermarket from a more interesting place .Definitely check out the glass cases in the back, where the meat guys reign. There are halal meats available and the staff is friendly. Personally, I locked in on the case to the left of the meat counter. Olives. An armada of olives, floating in fragrant oil. Next to the olives, red pepper paste (the ultimate condiment) beckoned. I wanted it all.Head to Baiz Market / Al-Hana for some fertile crescent-y goodness. One tip: as other Yelpers have mentioned, there's a $10.00 minimum for debit and credit cards.Kalamata, Feta, Baklava oh my!  Pita, Hummus, Baba oh my!Just a few of the items that made their way into our cart as we enjoyed our first shopping trip to Baiz Market.  This place is a great resource for hard to find middle eastern ingredients.  We got a nice block of Feta much cheaper than the grocery, for example.There were many items I saw that we didn't get this trip - we'll save them for our next excursion.  Like European Style Ovaltine.  What?  European style?  I was a big Ovaltine fan as a kid - just imagine how much more worldly I will be if a drink European Style Ovaltine purchased at a Middle Eastern Market!  Sprechen sie Global Citizen drink mix?We ate at the little restaurant in the front.  Fabulous!  Four of us shared a plate of baba ganoush, a chicken shawarma wrap, a falafel wrap and of course an order of fries.  The kids insisted they needed the fries because they probably wouldn't like the middle eastern food.  So everything was delicious including the  fries and some serious haggling took place over who got how many bites of the chicken shawarma.  We washed everything down with a pomegranate juice drink, 2 waters and an orange crush.  Perfection!So glad we stopped here!Once upon a time... when Cher was still Cheryl... I sat in my auntie's old El Camino happily eating my strawberry shortcake when my auntie stopped at a red light on the corner of 20th street & Van Buren when out of no WHERE a crack head with a gun tried to car jack us. My auntie yelled and threw an half empty bottle of tequila out the window as she sped threw the intersection. This was more than 10 years ago and things haven't improved much since that day in this neighborhood.When I read about Baiz Market it was from my fellow yelper Jim W. who ranted and raved and even encouraged me to check it out. The other night not having much to do, my friend Ree & I decided to go to Baiz Market which is just north of the intersection where my auntie & I almost got car jacked and check it out. We both have love for middle eastern food and know how to take on scary neighborhoods. When we walked up to the counter of the deli inside the quaint grocery store we were excited and a little scared of what to order. The cashier was SO patient and VERY nice about explaining everything to us! I really must give her props on that. There was a cab driver who was very helpful in explaining the different dishes and even recommended a few items. I listened to Tarek S. and chose the beef Shawerma it was delishous! My friend chose the chicken toolawoosh (is that spelled right?) sandwich which was very good with it's bell pepper, pickles and tomato fixins. We also chose to sample the small spinach pies which weren't that good btw and cheese pie which I could make at home with pizza crust & some cheese and the yummy yummy hummus that came with some pita bread. We also got a bottle of water and a can of imported orange soda. ALL this for only $27! Can you believe that?! The dining area was nice and quiet with mellow middle eastern music on in the background. Everyone kept to themselves and was nice to us even though we backed up the line. After our meal we wandered around the candy aisle in the grocery store and found lil heart shaped boxes of chocolates which - ummm wasn't that great! lol. We wanted to spend a heck of a lot more time going threw every aisle but unfortunatly they were closing so we had to leave. We will DEFINATLY be back! And prolly with a few more in tow. And no, no one tried to car jack us on our way out... but we did see a tranny hooker get questioned by the cops. Maybe if she went to Baiz Market for some baklava instead of walking the streets she wouldn't be in that situation! I'm just saying. To my yelpers, I say go! and when you go, order the beef shawerma and avoid the spinach pies! Oh and get there before 4pm so you can have time to really enjoy your meal without the rush!I ventured to Baiz Market with a few of my my friends and boy was it worth the trip!  Al-Hana, the restaurant inside, is the ultimate hole in the wall!  The hummus is so good I could seriously bathe in it.  I had the Chicken Taook which was amazing especially the garlic dip that accompanies it!  I also tried a meat pie for only $.69!  How could I resist?Because we went on a Tuesday night things were pretty quiet.   We wondered the grocery store after dinner and picked out sweets by the pound when we were done with dinner, this only added to the charm!I would definitely recommend checking this place out!  Make sure you have time to peruse the store and order the hummus whether you think you like hummus or not!If you need goat or lamb meat, you can get it here. This wasn't the reason for our trip to Baiz Market this weekend--we went for Al-Hana dining, which was delicious. However, the walk through the grocery portion of this place was great. We picked up some produce and feta cheese [I think they make their own: Confirmed, they make their own!] and overall had a great experience.I can't wait to go back and take more time to discover some wonderful products and new foods.I'm moving in. The end. This is the most authentic shop (of any variety) that I've seen since I moved to Arizona. It reminds me of the mercados I used to hit up in VA in that it has everything, hookahs to religious art, and of course food. The bakery was a mystery to me. I pointed at a few things, have since tried two of them, and I have no idea what they are. But I like them. There is a huge section devoted to turkish delights, as I sadly found out after making my purchases. Great cheeses! Massive quantities of dried fruits, nuts, olives and canned meats. If you see me brushing my teeth in aisle 4, please don't mess up my cot in aisle 2. Thanks.We no longer buy our meat from this place because the quality of service and product has been going down and down over the last year or so. After having to throw away the ground beef for the second time, we finally made the switch to I-Mart for all our meat related purchases. When we would ask for extra lean ground beef, we would have to pay an astronomically high price AND it was still not extra lean. It was full of fat and seems like they were mixing in lamb with it too because it stank like hell. I was getting tired of being badly treated by the butchers who conveniently went deaf when we would ask for something (not in Arabic) but would be completely on their toes helping whoever spoke in Arabic exclusively with them. One time when I asked for a woman to repeat herself behind the counter, she literally stared and me for a few seconds and moved over and started helping someone else. I guess we are not good enough for them to help over there. We still like the Al-Hana restaurant and they do offer some good spices that we will go in and purchase but we will no longer be using their meat counter.Great place to shop at when you're needing ingredients to make some homemade Middle Eastern food. They have several choices and brands of everything you could desire. Just pick out some tasty recipes at home and bring in your shopping list.Normally get the ingredients to make fresh Tzatziki, Hummus, and some Beef and Lamb Gyros or Kabobs. Last time picked up some Jordanian Green Zaatar. Saw them make it on a DDD show. Just mix it with some olive oil and add a little chopped onion and tomato. Really good on freshly toasted pitas or even English muffins.My favorite here is the amazing butcher section with all the different cuts of the lamb. Hearts, livers, kidneys, tongue, rocky mountain parts, and even the head. The Chicken case also looked nice and got my attention.Nice Pita Bread selection and then some. Had to pick up a few extras to put in my freezer. You can even use these to make personal size pizzas by adding a little sauce and some cheese. Cool project for the kids when they are needing a treat.Looking forward to trying their restaurant on my next visit. It always smells good and is packed with hungry people. Had several Yelp friends recommend it. Hi Guys!Kinda tucked away in a small neighborhood off the freeway. Place gets really busy and parking can be tricky. This place is like a top secret OASIS in the Desert. TOUCHDOWN!4 STARSAl Hana, their restaurant inside of the grocery store is a total 5 stars!  This review is for the Baiz Market, the grocery store.  For us, this is a great "go to" place for some key items we need from time to time that our local grocer doesn't carry and/or they offer a better quality.  Some of the items we shop for while at the Baiz Market; ~the BEST place in town to get your pita bread!  Both white and wheat and in different sizes.  ~they have a fantastic selection of middle eastern spices especially curries.  ~they have some great butchers that will chop, slice and dice every part of a lamb, cow or goat.  ~they butcher fresh ground to 30/70, 20/80 and 10/90 ~a great selection of nuts, sesame seed and olive oils, curries~some great pastries Sometimes they have seasonal produce you may not find at your local grocer but you have to search for it.  Their produce is not one of their qualities.  It's a great place to pick up some groceries and have a bite to eat!  Maybe I'll see you there.If this place wasn't 10miles from my house I would frequent it all the time!! I went on the road trip here seeking Pomegranate Molasses...yes it is a thing.  They had 4 kinds to choose from!  Mind you I had been to Fry's Marketplace, Whole Foods and Trader Joes trying to find the stuff!  As a side note the Trader Joes 'guy' told me to come here after doing a bit of googling!  FYI Pomegranate Molasses is $27 on Walmart's website!!! At Baiz they have four kinds ranging from $2.49-3.99!  So they are extremely reasonable.  The vegetables section is very fresh with a great variety of vegetation.  If you are making anything from scratch Baiz has amazing ingredients and obscure items to make exotic dishes!  The customer service was very friendly; there were only two cashiers open and decent lines.  But really no big deal, I was tantalized by the yummy looking foreign chocolate bars surrounding the register, but somehow managed to resist!  Just being in Baiz Market inspires me to want to cook more!!  I will be back.

This is a great place to go for lunch or dinner if your in the area.  It is also becoming one of our regular "stay vacation" destinations for dinning when we stay at the Pointe Hilton Resort.  Restaurant ~ decorated with plenty of "cow poke" decor everywhere with a rustic saloon kind of feel to it.  It's very clean and they have a huge patio that over looks part of the swimming area. They have a nice but somewhat small bar area with a TV if your not into the western thing.Service ~ everyone is very friendly and attentive to their customers.  Not sure why some Yelpers have been treated differently but we've been to Hole-in-the-Wall several times without any issues and find their service to be very good! Food ~ They have changed their menu over the past couple of years and we miss a few of the exotic things they used to offer.  Their current menu has a very good variety choices to choose from.  If you like ribs, they have some very good tasting ribs with a good smoke ring.  If you and your guest are hungry I would suggest getting their Backyard Feast for two.  It is a bottomless plate of BBQ goodness starting with salads, ribs, smoked brisket, smoked chicken and some side dishes.  This is one of those dinners to where you skipped lunch earlier and your ready to belly up to some good eats!  We like their smoked and gilled salmon with a three chili peach chutney and fried green tomatoes.  Yum!   Don not forget desert here!!  They may talk you into their creme brulee, which is delish or their house made warm donuts served with a chocolate creme sauce which is also very tasty, but just say no and go for the make your own s~mores!  We have a blast cooking (charing) our marsh mellows over the little open fire they bring to your table and then smashing the melty-marsh-mellowy goodness between two gram crackers and a piece to chocolate bar!  It's loads of fun!  Pointers ~ Ask them about their dinning package.  When you stay at the Pointe Hilton Resort you receive two $25 vouchers upon check in to be used towards your dining experiences.  They have a really fun swimming pool, great resort and a really neat restaurant ~ Hole-in-the-Wall!  Plan a "stay vacation" and enjoy one of the fun "gems" Phoenix has to offer.  May be we will see you there.07/07/13The food and cocktail flyer my sister found (or was handed, I'm not sure which, for I wasn't there when she acquired it) mentioned specials from all the restaurants and bars there, and on Fridays through Sundays, Hole in the River and Rico's American Grill offer 20% military discount on both food and cocktails purchased there.  (Yes, even spouses of military personnel.)  I wish all restaurants delivered food to the pool area, but I suppose that could be taxing when it's too hot and a madhouse of people (moving from one pool to the next) outdoors.  We purchased a couple of cocktails from Slim Pickens, the grill and bar situated at the pool area, and I really enjoyed my "Black & Ginger," which was made with Capt. Morgan spiced rum, Cock 'N Bull ginger beer, and fresh lime, $8.  I wanted to order seconds!  We ordered food from Hole in the Wall (look for my review there soon), but ordered a Pound 'O Fries ($6) a couple hours later (swimming burns around 11 calories a minute!), and it was delicious!  I enjoyed the fries plain, which were simply seasoned with salt and pepper, but also came with ketchup and ranch dressing.  The Pound 'O Fries app was a big hit with everyone!While I saw many servers (dressed in turquoise shirts) darting in and out of the crowds, I never saw any nearby when we needed a drink, or wanted to order food.  There were water dispensers, with small plastic cups, all around, but if you want ice-cold water, you can get some from the bar.I always have a great time at Hole In The Wall! It reminds me of visiting Arizona as a child, even though we never stayed here when I was a child. However, it has the same vibe. Hole In The Wall is a great family-fun atmosphere. They have a patio that overlooks the beautiful pool and it truly makes it feel like paradise. The patio is perfect for a party or simply enjoying a night out with family or friends. Inside, the atmosphere feels true to the cowboy feel. The checkered tablecloths and Most Wanted photos add to the atmosphere and they serve drinks out of cowboy mugs. The food here is classic BBQ. I've enjoyed the BBQ Nachos with chicken, cornbread and ribs...all of which are amazing. The BBQ chicken is definitely my favorite. Hole In The Wall does a great job of making this a fun environment for all and it's a perfect place to visit regardless if you're staying at the resort or not. In fact, it's a great restaurant to visit if you aren't staying at the resort because then you can feel like your on vacation!

Restaurant name  Archi's Thai Kitchen

Review Text :
What a delicious last meal in Vegas, all thanks to Archi's Thai Kitchen, I'll will be back! Dishes: Fresh Springs Rolls, Chicken Pad Thai, Beef Pad Thai and Shaved Ice (Pictures will be posted)Archis has a VERY friendly waiting staff! As for the atmosphere, it has this vintage and inviting feeling like a house! It was nice enough so you didn't feel cramped. I would highly recommended trying the pad thai! Coming from NYC, and having a love for Asian cuisine this is probably one of my top two places. The shaved ice desserts is deceiving because it was not shaved ice. When I think of shaved ice, I think of Malaysian Ais kacang (ABC). This seems more like a type of ice cream but the texture is different from store bought brands. The shaved ice here is some type of ice cream topped with condensed milk and boba! I would still recommended this dish as well. The only reason this restaurant did not get five stars was because of the Fresh Springs Rolls. Fresh Springs Rolls reminds me a lot like sushi.The steamed rice paper that wrapped the other sides is unable to hold all the other ingredients. When you pick it up everything falls apart making it very hard to eat.Archi's had a charming, rustic feel to the place. On the inside, the decor relies much on objects placed in the room, and not fancy decorations adorning the walls. The paint looked old, and there were some patches on the wall. Overall, the restaurant looked clean and it was a little busy when we were seated.Their food didn't really blow me out of the water. I have had better Thai food in Vegas -- the food here is just average. I had the yellow curry, which comes with jasmine rice and your choice of meat (I chose beef). They asked me for the spiciness on a scale of 1-10 and their 4 was just right; not too hot, but just enough spiciness to be flavorful. It was a filling meal, but there are probably better places out there with the same price range as Archi's. When it came to desert, they had mochi ice cream on the menu. Unfortunately, the waiter told us that they didn't even serve it anymore (menu update?). I'd probably come back because it's in close proximity to where I live, but I wouldn't say it's as amazing as all the hype it seems to have.

I've been here many times over the past few months and have tried their Appetizer Sampler (Sliders, Artichoke/Spinach Dip, Boneless Wings) and Classic Breakfast (2 Eggs, Toast, Breakfast Potatoes, Bacon) dishes.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fDe1ZAfFfeV70ngBdG9gog?select=DPRfi8hFYN_ep6YxCd7oRwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fDe1ZAfFfeV70ngBdG9gog?select=H0rl4_E86CYMV98m2bVbDAThe food is decent, but not great.  Since Phoenix has very limited food choices at the airport, I like Chili's Too out of all the other options.The service here is borderline terrible though, the employees are not very friendly and their really slow!.....overall, I'd give it 2.5 Stars, but rounding up because I'm in a good mood today.Return Factor - 75%

This is a very nice Italian restaurant that's perfect for lunch or dinner with your family. It's nice inside and the service is top notch.  I've only eaten here a few times but was always greeted by a friendly person who chatted a bit on the way to the table.  The servers are also friendly and attentive. We got a sampler platter for a starter the last time we came and it was a lot of food!  It comes with artichoke dip, chicken wings, onion rings, mozzarella, zucchini and mushroom fritti. No problem serving three adults and two kids.They have a nice menu with a number of choices. But, I figure that any place that has the tag line, "your neighborhood pasta place" is giving me a hint about what to order. I've had the Baked Ziti and the Sausage Lasagna. Both dishes are very good.  Their sauce is delicious and they're a contender for the best meatballs in the valley.Nice place for a good meal with your family - note, they have a very good children's menu.

Review Text :
We finally made it over to check out the dessert selection at Jerry's Famous Coffee shop! I was in the mood for banana cream pie, they were out so we settled on a chocolate cream pie. A slice of pie is $4.50 so we decided on a whole pie for $15.00 which is 7 large slices. I like that they pre-slice the pie, very convenient and will avoid the mess of cutting it on your own, also the slices are equal size!Mmmm this pie is yummy for sure, love the chocolate whipped mousse like cream filling and the white whipped cream they use is also tasty. The crust is flaky and tasty as well as the generous garnishment of shaved chocolate! This is a generous and rich pie, well worth the $15 bucks!They had the old school style refrigerated glass cake and pie display case and a spinning display. That was a blast from the past for sure.We selected from what they had already made. They had a strawberry shortcake cake with strawberries so large on top. I just could not bring myself to paying $36.00 for a cake when it is not even a special occasion. It sure looks delicious and I think next time I will get a slice to test it out first, I am sure is worth the money as it looked Divine!You can call ahead for a special pie or cake request.All cakes and pies are homemade on premise out of their bakery.The options are mind blowing and all look Amazing!I can not wait for the next opportunity to try other pies and cakes!Cakes...cheesecakes...pies galore all from scratch!CAKES...angel coconut cake, banana cake, black forest cake, black out cake, boston cream cake, carrot cake, chocolate fudge cake, chocolate mousse cake, chocolate peanut butter cake, frost cake, Hawaiian cake, German chocolate cake, Kahlua cake, lemon white cake, m&m cake, marble cake, mango cake, orange cream cake, milk cake, Oreo cake, peanut butter cake, pineapple upside down cake, strawberry torte cake, strawberry shortcake cake, tres leches cake.CHEESECAKES...blueberry, cherry, chocolate, fruit delight, lemon, macadamia, peanut butter, Oreo, plain, raspberry, sour cream, Reese's, strawberryPIES...apple, banana, blueberry, cherry, chocolate cream, banana cream, peach, lemon cream, pumpkinMmmmm yum for sure a great place to get a birthday cake and you can view the menu online and see the options from chocolate gonache to butter cream frosted cakes etc!Delicious baby!I have been missing out all of this time, I wish I had known sooner about this wonderful bakery!Items Selected:Strawberry Ring - Choux, Bavarian Cream, Whipped Cream, Glazed Strawberries, Chocolate ShellJerry's 50th Anniversary Almond Nugget Cake7-Layer Carrot CakeBread Pudding CakeMonte Cristo with Hash BrownsButtermilk BiscuitCoffeeLargely incapable of sleeping in on weekends and having thus taken it upon myself to explore the Vegas 24/7 dining scene after my morning run a somewhat atypical Sunday would mark my first visit to North Las Vegas, home of Jerry's Nugget - a casino having celebrated its 50th anniversary just three days prior - and Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop, the 24/7 retro-modern eatery within.  Decidedly different from the Luxe resort-casinos of the southern strip but featuring a gritty sort charm it was just after 5:00am when I arrived at Jerry's and with a skeleton crew catering to just six other patrons in the large space service was expectedly accommodating with coffee kept brimming throughout as a somewhat slow (likely understaffed) kitchen prepared hot dishes allowing me to focus first on pastry - a collection of over fifty options baked in-house featuring cakes, pies, danishes, donuts, and more.  Beginning with the famous "Strawberry Ring" it should first be stated that for a choux-based pastry baked at least 8 hours prior to remain crisp and buttery beneath two types of rich cream speaks volumes to the quality of kitchen and with both textures and flavors aplenty the dish proved wonderful, a lightly sweet take on the Paris-Brest with a portion big enough for two or three more than justifying the $6 tab.  Working slowly through the ring with frequent coffee refills as I awaited my sandwich it was with some disappointment that when the Monte Cristo arrived the flavors would only prove average, the fried bread shining while proteins and cheese proved meager in both taste and portion, but propping the dish up with a touch of real maple syrup it should be said that at $1 each, the biscuits at Jerry's are worth seeking out - an excellent rise and good layer separation beneath a crisp, buttered top.  Taking the rest of my order to go, a veritable bargain at $5/slice, suffice it to say that while Jerry's may not be the best choice in town for a sandwich I'd be hard pressed to name a better choice for cake as each of my three selections shined; the anniversary cake a sort of dulce de leche with buttercream and frangipane vying for top billing over a delicate crumb, the bread pudding featuring two layers of rich pound cake topped with lightly sweetened egg custard and a bruleed top, and the carrot cake dense with cinnamon, nutmeg, carrots, raisins, and walnuts beneath thin ribbons of cream cheese frosting - the best I've found in the city to date and a contender for the best I've tasted anywhere in years.I stopped in at Jerry's for breakfast this morning.  I haven't been here since the 1980s.  In walking through the casino, I was surprised at how much nicer it seemed to me than it did years ago.  Since it was morning, ti wasn't very crowded with people at slots and there wasn;t a lot of smoke to bother me.I looked at the menu carefully, checked the Yelp reviews, and then ordered huevos rancheros.  I got the eggs over easy and I opted for corn tortillas.  Jerry's was very quiet.  In a short time, my breakfast was brought.  When I ordered, my server asked if I wanted mild or hot salsa.  I chose the hot.  Jerry's doesn't know hot salsa unless someone put the wrong salsa in the small dish she brought.  There was a large serving of refried beans with some taco chips in the beans.  The eggs were done correctly and the entire dish was covered in chopped fresh tomatoes and lettuce shreds.My server, Mamie, was very pleasant and competent.  She was back quickly with the coffee pot to refill my cup.  The breakfast was large, very filling, and good but there was nothing that would make this stand out above other huevos rancheros I've had.I would like to go back sometime in the afternoon and get their strawberry ring for dinner.  It looked so good in the front case as did many of the other pastries including GIANT eclairs.Jerry's is A-OK!

Review Text :
---Good--- Friendly service and I enjoyed the food.  I'd like to go back and try a few other items, but right now I'm kinda perturbed about this place.---Bad---  1) This is just dumb, how could you ever think of putting push/push doors on your bathrooms? Walk anywhere near the doors and you'll be smacked.  Buy two $.89 door handles and fix the problem.2) No ice tea or was it hidden and I had to press a magic button and the tea fairy would appear?3)The ordering system is not unique or funny, it sucks, it blows, it makes me want to kick a puppy.    Why must I use my secret decoder ring to find the code for what I want to order for lunch?     Example: First write the number of the entree down, if you want a burrito put a "B" next to it -BUT THEY DON"T TELL YOU THAT!!!!     WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF   Why make me figure all this out when all I want is lunch.4)Huge pictures of, what you would think to be, menu items above the register so you can order/figure out your selections. The first this she says was something like " These are not our menu items". Awesome, thanks for the mind fuck.But the food was good.I have to say I'm rather disappointed after my half hour + trek to Chandler only to be served cold Chinese food in a cavernous (and empty) retail location.  I'd read all the rave reviews about Jade Red Chicken and was amped for some kick ass grub.  Three different people I know personally  all told me I needed to check out CB as well and one of my buds, whose culinary curiosity is on par with mine, says he literally craves this stuff.I was pretty stoked to try something new tonite for dinner as we tend to get bogged down in central phoenix and eat at the same places over & over again.  It's Friday nite, I'd had a few beers after work and had  a pretty light lunch, so I was beyond peckish and downright ready for the taste sensation I expected Chino Bandido to be.  My better half and I drove from CenPho down to the culturally devoid center of the Universe (aka Chandler), hungry and excited.  We'd read the reviews, used the interactive menu tool on the CB website and we were pumped for an excellent, if not quirky dinging experience.  Not.  ;(The restaurant itself is in a bizarre, gravelly strip mall, oddly wedged between a nail salon and a store called simply "Wide Shoes".  We walked in to what felt like a vacant student union during spring break - -when everyone else is in Ft. Lauderdale, Rocky Point or the Caribbean and you're the only kid broke enough to stay on campus and work at your library job.  There were maybe 25-30 other diners in the place but it is so huge inside that it felt empty and barren.We were greeted by a nice-enough counter lady who took our orders and punched them into the register.  I felt somewhat robbed of the paper-menu ordering experience I'd heard so much about -- no challenge, nothing unique.   We grabbed our drinks, utensils and straws and settled in at the end of a LOOOONG vacant  Rubbermaid folding table. Jason asked why they had church buffet tables set up.  I thought maybe there was something cool about them....but nope...just cheap tables.  We looked around a bit while we waited for our food to come over and raised our eyebrows questioningly at one another. I kept waiting to "get it" -- which I figured we would when the food arrived.There were some screaming kids running around while their parents ignored them, chatted with one another and texted.  (BRATS! BRATS!! BRATS!!!  Get outta my yard!!  ...I yelled inside my head like that mean old lady from down the block when I was a kid). My annoyance with bad parenting aside --I couldn't figure out why everyone loved this place. It has all the ambiance of a med-clinic. I felt like at any minute a middle-aged woman in chili-pepper-embellished scrubs would shuffle over, hand me a clipboard with a flower-shaped pen, ask me to sign a release form and pay my co-pay.  There wasn't even MUZAK playing -- there was NO music playing which made the place seem even more devoid of life.The food soon arrived and we dug in eagerly. Everything was a smidge above room temp -- if that, and pretty boring to be frank. The Jade Red Chicken is pretty comparable to Panda Express' orange chicken.  The BBQ'd pork didn't seem to have any asian BBQ flavor -- more like roasted pork soaked in sugar and the cold, thick refried beans could have come from Taco Bell or a can. Nothing unordinary or even interesting here. The only thing that was in the least bit interesting was the pork fried rice which tasted oddly like it'd been cooked with cheap white sherry and shallots -- which I've not experienced before with fried rice. That was "atypical" but certainly not interesting or enchanting.  The only redeeming thing about the meal was the Snickerdoodle which seemed oddly out of place for either Mexican or Asian food.  It was pretty good though.Even though I was physically full after the meal I felt very emotionally empty, oddly depressed about Chandler, its environs and its residents.  Everyone else in the joint seemed oddly devoid of emotion as -- certainloy not like people who go out to dinner on a Friday evening.  I'm thinking we should have aimed the car towards the original Chino Bandido in the Aves.  I am  a fan of asian and latin foods and admittedly have an odd penchant for cheap asian buffets -- so I'm usually pretty tolerant of cheap bad fried foods.  I'm thinking that the original divey joint didn't translate well to Chandler, so I'm willing to give CB another try -- just never again in the east valley. Please someone explain to me what I'm missing here.It looks like everyone's experince here differs greatly.  It is a novelty to say the least.  Where else would you find asian/mexican/carribean food?  When we first arrived there was no one there.  The guys behind the counter were super helpful in giving out samples and showing me how the ordering process worked.  I placed my order, got drinks, and sat down to wait.  My daughter waited patiently while looking at pictures posted on the wall.  When the food was ready they brought it out to our table.  My daughter had a cheese quesadilla and white rice.  Ya, I know, but what can you do?  I was a picky eater as a kid too.  I had a jerk chicken quesadilla, carnitas, black beans and pork fried rice.  Was it the most amazing food I've ever had?  No, but it was good and it was cheap and better than Micky D's any day.  My daughter gobbled down her rice and quesadilla.  It was tasty, the jerk chicken had just enough heat for me, the carnitas were tender, and the rice had nice flavor.  The decor is a bit different.  It's a huge area with lots of seating.  It feld kind of echo-y when we got there because it was empty.  The kitchen looked clean but I noticed some of the table needed to be wiped down better and the soda station could have been cleaned up a bit more.  This is a great place for families.  Mid way through our meal more and more came in.  There is a little children's play area in front of the asian/mexican panda bear in the corner.  My daughter took the opportunity to make some new friends.  Am I going to go back.  Yes, I will.  Cheap eats other than fast food are hard to find. And you get a cookie with your meal.....Snickerdoodle please!

Review Text :
Kristine, my "lil sis" from college and I were treating ourselves to a nice dinner (during our weekend away in Vegas)... and Hank's looked like the perfect spot for our night out. Upon walking in the dimly lit dining room, I was impressed by the decor, and the plethora of servers busily running around the dining room.  As we were escorted to the very back of the dining room, we joked that we were being sat at the kids table....still the ambiance was relaxing, and the drink menu was abundant. I ordered a Brassy Blonde martini, a spin on my favorite pineapple martini which didn't live up to it's predecessor, but still - it was tasty and tart.The basket of bread they sat in front of us was warm and had a great variety to settle our appetites while we waited for one 1 of the 3 servers that were assigned to take care of our table.  Now THAT's service!  We ordered:The Chopped Salad (and split it between us)2 petite filets (mine with a Gorgonzola crust)A side of creamed corn (and split it between us)A side of jumbo baked yam (and split it between us)The salad arrived - small portions split on two plates between us.  It was delicious UNTIL I bit down on something SUPER hard and sharp. OUCH!  Seriously, I thought I broke my tooth. When I removed the item, it looked and felt like part of my tooth... Kristine called the server over, and he called the manager over to see what it was that I had bitten.  It was a sharp piece of crab shell!  In my salad!  Thank God I'm not allergic to shell fish because it could have been a much bigger issue.  Anyway, I digress.  The manager asked if I needed medical attention... but after feeling my tooth - I told him that while it hurt, it didn't feel like it was broken... so he comped our salad, and we moved on.I decided to order a glass of red wine to complement my steak and requested it prior to our steaks being delivered....The steaks came out - and while mine was perfect, Kristine's was super over done.  The server noticed, and insisted on bringing her a new steak - and that it was only take "1 minute, 1 minute, 1 minute" so I kept eating mine... as she still had the sides to munch on.  10+ minutes later, my steak is gone, and hers was just re-arriving. This time it was perfect, but so much for dining together...and my glass of wine was just arriving by this point. (Side note, the cream corn and the yams were both excellent)So now we're both stuffed and ready to go into food coma mode... even with my sore jaw/tooth but the server insisted once again, that he bring us dessert.   We chose the molten lava cake... which was rich, gooey inside and a little dry on the outside... EH.  Not the best I've had... but it was a nice gesture. So...almost $200.00 later, the two of us bid farewell to the steakhouse at Green Valley Ranch Resort....and I didn't think I'd think much of it again... it was good food, great service but not necessarily a place I'd go back to.....Now fast forward a week later.... I am snacking on a piece of bread (SOFT BREAD) and I hear a crunch.  My tooth broke in half!!! The same tooth that I injured during my dinner at Hank's - eating a chopped salad!  Seriously?  Looks like I'm heading to the dentist... UGH!12/29/11 DINNER.The food was great, BUT EXPENSIVE. (But we knew that, going in.)The service was great. (In fact, the waitress was very sweet and attentive. I feel sorry for her, having to work there. The tips must be good.)BUT the "corporate" leaders AND their policies are ... well ... SCREWED.We went to GVR to attend an event coordinated by an outside entity ("Rock N Roll Wine", http://rocknrollwine.com/thursdays.html), which had advertised in their flyer online "...in addition to the great wine and live music, GVR is offering 15% off dinner to anyone with a Rock 'n Roll Wine wristband in any of their restaurants."So after the event (6p-8p) we decided to take advantage of said offer at Hank's, in the lounge. To make sure they would honor the 15%, we spoke with the "suit" at Hank's.He told us that the event coordinator did NOT have the approval of Stations Casinos (the parent company) to offer that discount.So we were screwed.Wouldn't they just honor it, since we were eating a small ticket after all? It wasn't gonna KILL their receipts of the evening. (Keep reading for details.)Answer: NO.But the icing on the cake?I got home to find that my bill at Hank's was taxed 18.1%, not 8.1%.Don't tell me I was charged a 10% RESORT FEE to dine at what is, basically, a LOCALS hotel/casino?What is WRONG with these corporate hacks? Do they WANT to drive business away? In THIS economy?We've been to Hank's a number of times in 2011, during happy hours as well as regular business hours, spending lots in the restaurant and bar.And we're done. I'll never return to ANY Stations Casino ANYTHING, after tonight. Who needs this?12/30/11 ADDENDUM.We went back to the restaurant this evening to get an explanation as to why I was taxed 18.1%, not 8.1%. They stated it was not a RESORT FEE, it was the ENTERTAINMENT FEE. HUH? I had been to this restaurant MANY TIMES over the past year I've lived here. I've sat in that same bar, I've eaten while their guitarist (it's been the SAME GUY, the entire year) played, and we were NEVER charged a 10% ENTERTAINMENT FEE.Well, obviously "We Luv Locals" no longer.I'll reiterate. The ENTIRE Stations Casino chain, with which we've done lots of business over the past year of living here, has lost ALL of our future business. We will no longer visit GVR, Sunset Station, Fiesta Henderson, Boulder Station, ANY of them. No more dinners at the Broiler, Cabo, Pasta Cucina, Terra Verde, Grand Cafe, buffets, especially HANK'S, EVER AGAIN.And ALL THIS over the princely sum of 15% off $115 = $17.25 + rebating the 10% ENTERTAINMENT FEE of $11.50.We sure hope Stations got their $28.75 worth from this idiotic move, to not have any more business from us, ever again.I was waiting for the moment Hank's was going to disappoint, after all its in any establishment's nature to have a bad day. But it never happened. Coming here 5 times - every steak was phenomenal, martinis were never anything less than tasty, the service was always impeccable, the live entertainment was consistently classy, and every experience was top notch. It should come as no surprise to anyone but it is without a doubt, Green Valley Ranch's best restaurant.It started with their 5-7 happy hour. Sitting by the bar and enjoying the piano ballads / live jazz, while sipping away with colleagues / clients on some of their killer martinis. From the dry glass to the exotic flair, I have always enjoyed their lychee and koi martinis. Every sip was smooth and the potency of the after taste made for a great finish. As one goes further into Henderson, these places just don't seem to exist.When it was evident the drinks would be taking a toll, it was on occasion, some complimentary bar food from the generous bartenders. If it wasn't drinks on the house, it was sides from the kitchen. A creamy and no frills mac and cheese, some cream spinach, an incredibly tasty lobster chowder, and a fresh, yet plump variety of shrimp with some cocktail sauce. After too many chowders / bisques, along with some of the best crab cakes in Sin City, did I finally decide to shoot for what they're known for best: Steak.I started small with a petite filet mignon, which for $40 was a bit more paltry than I had hoped. But any meat with the words "petite" or "small cut" is going to be a pricier, albeit unsatisfying portion for any serious carnivore. Instead of focusing on its size, I switched it to its taste, which was nothing less than foodgasmic. Charred bits, smooth textures, and juicy meat at its finest. I eventually moved onto to the full sized 9oz filet($46) and the prime rib New York ($45), both of which had me going gaga for more.Then there's the grand daddy. It's name is the Tomahawk Ribeye ($95) and while its a portion for two, I think I can gladly take it on by myself. It reminds me of something Tarzan or Fred Flintstone would eat - a hilarious hunk of meat on a bone, with a smell that ignites hunger for even the most casual meat eater. Paired with a gorgonzola crust ($8) and seared foie gras ($19) to add to the meal and sides of creamed spinach and potatoes, and its both a vegans worst nightmare and a glutton's finest moment.I admittedly don't visit Henderson as much as I used to, but after writing this review and an impending trip to Vegas, I think I'm due for another visit.Dreamy scenery, with the warmth of the huge glassed-in fireplace contrasting nicely with the crystal chandeliers. Excellent service, with our server explaining the menu to us in depth. Good food. Not excellent, but good. My one problem that I couldnt overlook and which really spoiled the whole experience for me was this:Our waiter duped us into buying an entree. Allow me to explain. We told the waiter we wanted to split a meal. We werent that hungry and why pay for an extra plate if not necessary? We TOLD him this, and we were willing to pay a sharing fee or whatever. So after he told us the specials, the last of which was a surf and turf that added on scallops for $15 or so, we gave him our steak order. The waiter says "would you like to add on an order of scallops? Theyll complement the steak very well." I say "ok" assuming it would be an add-on. Nope. I got five (albiet very large) scallops. On a separate plate. We shared everything. And when tge bill came, those scallops werent $16, or $20, but THIRTY-EIGHT DOLLARS. So what probably would have been four and a half stars turned into two. Left a VERY bad taste in my mouth. I doubt we'll be back.This is an update for the bar area.  Went on a friday to listen to live music.  The singer was very good and played both acoustic guitar and piano.  However, the service was horrible and the crowd worse.  I tried a couple of their special martinis which were ok butt there really aren't many daring mixes.  The guy next to me at the bar spent 10 minutes complaining that his 24 dollar burger came on a regular bun.  So i went and sat down at the piano bar.  There was one other couple at the piano bar at the same time.  I literally witnessed them order, get served, be asked several times if they needed anything and be served again during the 30 minutes I sat there with an empty water in front of me and an open tab just begging to have something charged to it.  When the singer took a break, I went back to the bar, closed out my tab.  The bar manager asked if everything was ok and I told him no one had asked if I wanted anything.  All he could do was stammer an apology but I was already on my way out.   Shame because I really like this place and remember when you couldn't even find a seat on a friday.  I will go back though because I like live music and maybe the rest will be better next time.Happy Hour at Hanks!The girls and I stopped in for their happy hour since we've all heard great things about it.   You walk into their bar and lounge area.  It's decorated beautifully with many comfy seating all around.   During our visit here there was a guitarist playing ever so lightly which made for great cocktail music.  We decided to split their Mushroom and goat cheese tart.  Oh Yum.  So rich and creamy.  This isn't served with any bread for dipping but we received some without any issues.  We also split the chef's choice sliders.  On that particular day it was reuben sliders with sauerkraut.  Well, we respectfully requested them without the sauerkraut.  They were good but not great.  I'm hoping to try them again on a different slider option night.  Service here was good.  We didn't have any issues with drinks and refills.  There were a few different girls always checking on our table.  It was nice!Yes, I will be back again!  Maybe for dinner next time.  :-)

Must haves:Super HashMonte Cristo Meatloaf Stuffed french toast (4 pieces) with cream cheese and topped with fresh made berry compote.When Friend #1 said he usually goes to Denny's for breakfast when he's in Vegas, I knew I had to lead us all into the light!Parking was easy and free in the strip mall lot, and we seated ourselves when we walked in.  We were greeted with menus by our friendly server and coffee (regular or bold!), decaf and waters came out fast. Our food landed in front of us within 10 minutes of ordering - yay!Me: Angus Top Sirloin & Eggs ($10.95) - served with cottage cheese and an english muffin (my choice of 2 sides), my steak was perfectly rare next to the scrambled eggs.  This is what I needed!Friend #1: Corned Beef Hash ($7.95) - served w/hash browns and an english muffin, this potatoey, oniony hash had crispy bits of meat in it.  It was not as meaty as we expected - they could stand to bump up the ratio of meat to potatoes & onions.Biscuits & Gravy ($7.25) - served w/2 eggs and nicely crisped bacon, these b&gs were yummy!  Still crispy edged yet fluffy under the gravy.To share: Blueberry Pancakes, short stack ($3.50) - super blueberry-y, not overly sweet, really good!After the food came out, our efficient server brought a tray of house made jams and jellies for us.  They sparkled like multi-colored gems!We tried:Apple Butter - super cinnamony, we all wanted to eat this with a spoonPineapple Jam - sticky and chunky, like pie filling, this was tasty but overly sweet.We loved the casual diner atmosphere, and the food and service made us happy. So yes I'm a fan!Not "a go go" I repeat, not "a go go." That would just be disrespectful to this little gem in the rough.No, it's not fancy. No, their dishes don't match. And no, you won't have to take out a second mortgage to eat breakfast or lunch here. Good food is what I'm all about and this place hits the nail on the head. When in doubt, just go to Hash House (how many times do I have to tell you it's not a go go?). Sometimes you just need a little hash in your life. This place hashes like a professional hasher. Awesome flavor, great texture, and more importantly it feels like your getting a home cooked meal. Hash House is everything a chain restaurant isn't, which is why I like it so much. If you're looking for a basic breakfast they do that exceptionally well. Want something a little fancier like a Monty Cristo? Yep. They do that well. Personally, I'm more of a pancake and egg kind of fella. Mary, the owner, was featured for her pancakes on The Cooking Channel, so she has street cred. I can vouch for those tasty hot cakes, they're off the hook. Their homemade jams are superb. Generally 10+ choices and usually a few unique flavors. Hash House is definitely a "regulars" joint. Become one, you won't regret it.I'm not a morning person or a breakfast person, but I can be persuaded to do a lot if my first stop is at Hash House. Not to be confused with HAGG, up the road, this place actually has good food and service.Besides the hashes (just get the party hash that combines everything, watch out for the jalapenos, and you're good to go), there are omelets and my favorite dish, Mary's Eggs- which is Mary's take on eggs benedict. Two poached eggs on biscuits, topped with gravy and the best crispy bacon  you've ever had.Everything is sided with homemade grits (simply perfect with butter) and a bowl of fresh fruit.Their lunch options include soups, salads, and sandwiches. Monday's cream of mushroom is my personal favorite, but they're actually all pretty solid. Only open til 2PM, so run in and grab your order to go if you need to.I really don't write reviews here, but I have to let my voice be heard on how rude I was treated by "Mary".  Myself and 2 other co-workers ordered some food here.  He ordered a sandwich with fries, the other the San Diego omelette with hash, and myself tuna melt with fries.  When he got back we were all surprised to see that we all didn't get sides!!!! Not one of us.  Now I understand that if it said sides are extra on the menu but no it says "comes with your choice or sides!!! And to make it even more "wtf" my sandwich and my buddies omelette are in one box!!!!! Really "Mary"?!?!So I called and "Mary" answered it ( the reason I put quotations on this is because she said she was Mary the owner but you never know). So I told her that we didn't get any sides.  She replied that's how we ordered it......yes Mary all 3 of us decided we all don't want sides so that we can keep our figures.....OH NO!!! We are hungry boys working morning till night!!! I told her no we ordered 2 fries and one hash.  Her response was, "no you didn't". I also told her that even both my main order and my buddies main order were in the same box. Her response, "that's how you wanted it". Yes of course Mary we wanted our food together so that we can recreate the scene from Lady and the Tramp!!! So then she just cut me short and ask, "so what do you want"......Excuse me?!?! I told her well cutting your attitude to a customer would be nice.  To which she replied again, "that's how you wanted it, so what do you want?"  After that I asked her for her name and she said, "Mary, the owner.  Well Mary the owner.  Thank you for no sides even though you gave us a bottle of ketchup!!!! And thank your for your gracious attitude Mary! You remind me of the character "Mom" from Futurama.  Look it up Mary.....I will definitely not come here anymore. And will let everyone know about your attitude.  Like I said I don't do reviews unless it's super awesome service, or someone treated me bad.  You fell on that Mary.  Best of luck to you and your business....(also check out my pics on here on how our food was presented along with their menu)I really wish I could give a lower star for this place. Let me just start off by saying I really tried to give it a shot because the owner was on Chopped, so I assumed it would be a hidden gem. Nope. Our server was rude, pushy and tried to rush us to order because she "had a 45 top that was coming in". Once we were ready to order she rushed through everything, spoke over us, so we kept having to repeat our order, and never have us her full attention.I got the asparagus and Swiss omelette, mediocre at best. It was luke warm and she brought the wrong side dishes. ( White and Sourdough are two completely different styles of bread)The biggest complaint I have however...the hash on my friends plate was the Salmon Hash, which would be fine but she ordered the Super Hash, and in fact hates Salmon.So either they aren't cleaning their flat top or they served the wrong hash. Good thing she isn't allergic right? The staff is older, which I sometimes prefer, they have a way of making you feel at home. The entire time I was there I felt uneasy, in everyone's way and inconveniencing my waitress. The 'As seen on Chopped' sign on the window should be taken down if this is the general expectation here.We waited 37 minutes to get our food and our waitress was a miserable excuse of a server. Towards the end of our meal, my husband and I were in agreement - we hate our waitress. HATED her. Okay, so we came here on a Saturday morning around 11AM. We tried Eggs & I first, but they had a wait time of 25 minutes. I think if we just would've waited there instead, we'd have been much happier.WAFFLE SPECIAL ($7.55): A Belgian waffle served with 2 eggs and 2 slices of bacon. Gave the husband my bacon, who thought they were pretty delish. The waffle wasn't anything special, nor were the eggs. Very underwhelming. 2/5CHICKEN HASH ($8.45): Ordered with a side of fruit and 2 eggs. My husband said the dish was bland. According to the menu, the chicken is 'garlic-poached', but my husband didn't detect any garlic undertones. 2/5 SERVICE: A white-haired woman with glasses greeted us as we walked in and seated us immediately. She was awesome. An older lady with short brown hair and no personality is what doomed our visit. When taking our food orders she walked up to the table and just stood there, silent. Finally, she mumbled "Need a moment?". We gave her our orders and she scurried away. She didn't interact with us until she brought some food to the table, which wasn't ours. She took the plates away and said "Oh I thought these were yours". Eons later, our food comes. Not once did she return to check up on us or offer refills. I would've liked more butter and syrup but seeing as how she avoided us, that never happened. Lady had a perpetual frown on her face. If you're not service oriented, you shouldn't be a waitress! Also, it irked me that the check wasn't itemized and that there weren't fountain drinks, only bottled cokes. 0/5VIBE: Old-school breakfast diner complete with ceiling fans and box TVs.   Worth a Return Visit?Other waitresses seemed to be competent and friendly. We got the bad apple. The food was unimpressive and took waaay too long to arrive at our tables. There's a problem in the kitchen and a problem with service here.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #218

Even though this place had three stars (and three $ signs, which made my cheap side a little worried) I still had heard a lot of good word of mouth, so I wanted to try it out.  I went about this dining process by rating it as the action started.  Our server walks up to us and asks if we had ever been there.  His response was great, telling us all about the farm to table experience they try to create there.  He was extremely helpful in picking out our drinks, Lyeth Meritage for me...at $14 a glass...YIKES.  But it was really light and refreshing for a red wine.  My friend got a gin and tonic, the gin being infused with cucumber deliciousness (I assure you, I tried it a couple times).  We're 5 stars at this point folks.We both decided on the tasting menu since everything looked good.  $35 for three courses is pricey for me, but I was splurgin' here (dah, $14 wine).  To start I choose the Wild Mushroom Flatbread.  Now bear in mind, I thought the tasting menu portions would be, well, tasting size.  It was regular appetizer size, you know, for like two people.  I ate almost all of it....other than the piece I shared with my friend.  It was THAT good.  Porto mushrooms, pesto and feta cheese.  YUM!  Still 5 stars people.I was torn between a the healthy Sonoma Salad and the Pecan Crusted Haluomi.  Since my friend is generous, she said she'd get the cheese and give me a piece.  Win win!  The salad was good but the Haluomi...holy crap!  It was amazing!  I cannot believe it's served as a whole meal.  It comes with potatoes and broccoli, but I would need something else.  Even though cheese does fill lots of voids in my life.  At this point we've downgraded the score to 3 stars because our second course came out AN HOUR after our first course was served.  The server came by only once to say our courses would be close together (because we were going to a show and in a rush at this point).  He never came by to ask if I wanted another glass of wine (a no, but still).  Or just to tell us the kitchen was running slow tonight, etc.  I would have taken any excuse.  But there was nothing.     Final course was the Crispy Indonesian Glazed Duck.  Don't get me wrong, it was VERY good and crispy, but I thought the glaze overpowered it enough where I felt like I was eating at a Chinese restaurant....where my meal would have been $8.  Regardless of the wait times I still thought the meal was solid, if not a tad overpriced.  Would I go back?  Yes.  Would I soon or frequently?  Probably not.  The mystery of the 3 star rating has been solved.  Sonoma Grill, get on your game, you could be a 5 star!I meet up with one of my friends from college about once per month, and we go out to eat somewhere on his work lunch break.  One of our recent lunches took us to Sonoma Grille.  It's probably one of my favorite places we have ever gone.The wait staff here is exceptionally friendly, and they want to help you find the perfect meal.  If you don't like chatty servers, this isn't your place.  However, our waiter was super helpful, and it was just his first day!  They must have some pretty fierce training.I ordered the crabcake BLT.  Crabcake, sunny side up egg, tomato, coleslaw, and bacon on a sandwich.  YES, please!  It was delicious, though a bit messy.  So if you're trying to look graceful.... Who cares?  This sandwich is worth it!I really loved the ambiance here as well.  Table cloths and cloth napkins for the win.  They also had a huge wine list if you don't have to go to work after your meal.  When I've gone past at night, this place gets crowded, especially after shows at the Benedum.  You might want to consider a reservation if possible.I can't wait to return and test out more of this menu!When you mess with my momma, you mess with me.  Okay, it's not THAT serious, but...  I was out with mumsie for a pre-theater dinner this past Saturday night at one of my favorite lunch spots, Sonoma Grille.  Having never enjoyed dinner here I thought it a safe bet since the majority of my experiences lunching and brunching had been fabulous to date.  The goods news - I [mostly] enjoyed my Mixed Grill (loved the Branzino/didn't love the pork shank/salty stir-fry) and she thought her pork tenderloin was delicious.  Unfortunately, our overall experience was sullied by slow service and less-than-welcoming management.  We arrived shortly after 6pm and were promptly seated by an exceptionally courteous hostess then greeted by our server Dominic, a true delight with a 100-megawatt smile.  At 6:35pm we received our drinks.  It was a beautiful day and we weren't in a huge rush so the wait didn't both me too much.  The issue came when the manager (I'm assuming) interrupted Dominic while he was taking our order to instruct him to give the [freshly-seated] table next to us extra care.  I could've let that go, but as I waited patiently I watched the aforementioned table receive their entrees before we even had a bread basket.  The moral of the story is, we enjoyed our meals and made it to the show on time, but left feeling like VUPs (Very Unimportant People).  With so many incredible options downtown I'll likely look elsewhere for our next dinner.

Decor has been or is in transition. New floor/carpet. Looks good. I had Pat Peking. ? It was beef, green beans, carrot s in a brown spicy sauce. It might have been the best tasting and hottest spicy food I have ever actually loved. Served with rice, wonton and soup...perfect,!The staff its awesome too...they hustle.My lips are returning to normal now.

Review Text :
Having dinner out on a Thursday evening, it was slow over at Mi Casa Grill Cantina.  The hostess almost  took us all around before seating us in the corner of  this huge dining area that was nicely decorated and had a lot of promise.  We were seated in front of a giant screen TV showing Thursday night football.After our beverage orders were taken, chips and three salsas arrived at our table.  There was one limed based tamarind sauce that the BF was practically drinking, while I had an affinity to the spicy red pepper color one.  We were very impressed already and couldn't wait for our orders!After deciding on the manaza $7 (apple rum, lime juice, and mint) for myself and the caprinha $8 for the BF, we realized our waiter was very new - at his job and at this restaurant.  It humored us nonetheless as he had trouble understanding and pronouncing our drink orders.  (The BF's caprinha was a bit too strong for his liking and my manzana was pretty much an apple mojito.  It was a lot tastier than his drink, that's for sure!)  We decided to ask for his recommendation on food items since they had an extensive list.  He gave us some ideas on whether to order tapas or go straight for the main courses or do the mix and match.  We decided to try out a bunch of different things by going for the Appetizer Sampler ($17) and the Mix and Match entrees of three items ($17).  We had the waiter bring out all the food together so we can enjoy it all at the same time.The food was rather quick to come and just as well since we had already finished off a basket of chips.The appetizer sampler came with two corn cakes that were sauced up and topped with guacamole.  The BF thought the cakes were pretty decent.   Two chicken(?) flauntas also came with the sampler.  I found it to be dried out and tasteless.  The adobo seasoned deep fried calamari was left in the oil too long, and the BF couldn't taste any of the seasonings.  These items were laid out on a bed of coleslaw and came with three dipping sauces - a dill based cream sauce, a chipotle sauce, and the lime-based tamarind sauce from earlier.  There was also a cup of queso fundido, which is melted cheese that you're supposed to dip your tortilla chips in.  However, once the cheese starts hardening up, it becomes one big goopey mess that's pretty challenging to eat with chips.Of the Mix and Match entree, we got one shrimp, lobster, and crab enchilada that wasn't to my liking.  The BF was appalled when he saw and tasted what appeared to be imitation crab meat.  Blah on that!  There was one soft flour tortilla (or you can choose the hard corn tortilla instead) holding what would be our carne asada taco.   It was alright.  Hiding behind that taco was one tiny ass what they call a burrito filled with dried carnitas.  The burrito was small enough to fit into the palm of my hand.  (Was this a kid size?)  Half of the plate was covered with rice and beans.When it came down to it, I found myself eating more chips and salsa than the actual food we ordered.  That's a bad sign.  The only leftovers we took were the cheese (so we could remelt it), the tortilla chips, and that lime tamarind sauce. Service was fine.  It took awhile to get our orders in, but the food came out rather quickly.  Our waiter was nice and friendly, so no problems there.  I'm glad that we had a gift certificate too like Allison J. because it's definitely not worth the price they are charging!   Sidenote: They offer a weekday happy hour from 4 pm to 7 pm with $2 chips and guacamole, $3 nachos, $2 flauntas, $3 calamari, $1 margaritas, and $1 tequila shots.AWFUL. I had to give myself a few days of cool down to write this review otherwise I think I may have dropped a lot of "f" bombs. so unclassy. just like this place! If i could give this place zero stars I would.My friend and I wondered here this past weekend in the hopes of getting some decent margaritas. we were so wrong. we were seated by a girl who didn't seem to like her job. pretty bland. it was whatever. we looked over our menus and the margaritas looked pretty good so we ordered one each at $7 dollars a glass. I asked for a not so sweet and sour one, but a stronger one with more flavor so the waitress recommended one to me. While she put that order in my friend and I decided to share some basic beef taquitos for 8 dollars. She dropped off some free chips and salsa which were nothing too impressive. the 3 choices of salsa all tasted the same pretty much and were bland. so sad. Our drinks came over and I took one sip and already felt sick from all the sweet and sour. It tasted like a virgin drink. I'm sorry...I'm 27...don't you remember checking my ID while I asked for something of the opposite? I did not say bring me a virgin margarita. open your ears. My friend was not impressed either with his frozen margarita which tasted like frozen lemon water. UGH what is this place?! our taquitos came over and they looked like they were from the freezer isle at target. believe me when I say there was no beef whatsoever in this little things. there were 3 of them and they were the size of my boney little pinky finger. $8 dollars for what?! OMG. unimpressed. When the waitress came over to ask how our drinks were I told her mine was too sweet and I didn't like it as I moved it to the side for her to take away after one sip. obviously she didn't get the hint as she watched me and walked away. umm alright. she brought our check over and I noticed our drinks were $8 dollars while on the menu they were $7 dollars so I decided to ask her about this. She said they charge an extra dollar for the alcohol. nowhere on that menu did it say they were going to charge more money for a drink that already has alcohol in it. WTF! yes...I understand it is only an extra dollar per drink but it is the point of telling your customers about this before they order. I didn't even drink my margarita because it was disgusting and wanted you to take it away but instead you decide you want to charge me more for it?! not to mention your food sucked and was such a disappointment. I left this place so angry and upset over this. The waitress offered no help and it was obvious she wanted us out of there.I'm apparently still very angry over this about half a week later. I will make sure none of my friends and family ever go to this place. I really hope they do not stay around too long and are replaced by something better. I am so let down with mi casa's food and service.

Review Text :
I find this place absolutely delicious, but rarely end up going there when the inevitable conversation arises: "Where do you want to go? I dunno. Where do you want to go?" It is a bit tucked away in a little strip mall, so I'm going to chalk it up to location and not the fact that I typically have the memory of a gnat.If you've never had a pasty (pronounced pah-stee, unlike the pay-stee nipple adhesives strippers wear), you're missing out on a hearty English Hot Pocket. However, likening it to a Hot Pocket does it a disservice. Hot Pockets consist of cardboard crust filled with nuclear hot goo that causes blisters and cursing, rather than sighs of content and delight. While both are great drunk/hangover food, the Cornish Pasty Co. far surpasses the measly freezer dried Hot Pocket. While they have flavors that are also available as Hot Pocket varieties (taste test!), my dining partner routinely reminds me that he will shun me for indulge in one of those. Not that it's hard to find at least five different flavors that you could imagine chowing down. I always end up just blurting out my decision at the last minute to end my indecisiveness. They updated the menu recently and it now includes a bunch of flavors that weren't previously available, like carne adovada. Mmm. So if you haven't been here in a while, give it another go and try something new.For about seven bucks you get a huge, stick-to-your-ribs pastry filled with a wide variety of meats and vegetables. I've never tried the vegetarian choices, but there are quite a few on the menu (about half as many as the non-vegetarian options). Among the traditional pasties, you can't go wrong with the oggie, shepards pie or lamb and mint. I've tried the chicken tikka masala, greek chicken, and lamb vindaloo from the fancy schmancy options and they were just as stellar. The greek salad is also pretty respectable, with a hefty amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese. Watching the cooks at work is part of the fun at this place, so have a seat at the bar. Just make sure to do so far enough away from the oven that you won't end up dried out like beef jerky at the end of your meal. When you get the bill, there's a cashier near the door that you can cash out at if you're in a hurry, since the servers are a little bit on the slow side. Slow, laid back, whatever. Their happy hour is also an awesome option to opt for, and is offered every day from 3 to 5 pm. There's a dollar off beers, three dollar Irish car bombs and two dollar top shelf shots (Ketel One vodka, Jameson whiskey, etc.), so if you're looking to spend an afternoon getting stinko and munching on some awesome food, this is the place to be.UPDATE: I've tried just about every non-veggie pasty on the menu. The salmon trumps them all. Do it.I'm in LOVE with Cornish Pasty Co!  If you've never had a pasty (pass-tee) before, picture a big pocket made from buttery-flaky crust and filled with your heart's desire!They have nearly a dozen delicious, vegetarian pasties to choose from!  I love the Veggie Oggie filled with veggie-steak, potatoes, rutabaga and onions.  Mmmmm!  Pre-order 45 minutes before hand and they'll custom make you a vegan one!My only complaint?  Since the place is so small it can really heat up because of the ovens.  Be prepared, it can get pretty hot in there!If you ever had 3 days of meetings in different cities each day, spending more time at the airports than the hotels, you will discover that you can end up eating non stop because food is available everywhere...at the meetings, at the hotel, in your luggage.... and you  eat sometimes just to pass the time.   At the end of the 3rd day, I had seen enough food to feed the LSU National champion football team.  I could out fast Les or Bear on their survivor showsDinner time was approaching.....My business associate and I couldn't face a full course dinner for at least another 24 hours...but we knew we had to eat something so we wouldnt wake up at 3 am famished.  I remembers reading about this place in Yelp that would be perfect for our situation....so remembering some favorable Yelp reviews in Phoenix  I said to him:"How about pastys for dinner?"He went from a relaxed and carefree disposition to a stunned and shocked demeanor.   He looked me like I was from another planet and his glance indicated doubt about my integrity.   Then with a delayed but dry smile he spoke up and said...."Aren't those things they wear at the.....""NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!    Not pasties......pastys."   I retorted quickly before the people in the lobby heard the next nouns he was just about to utter.   "Pasty's with a short vowel, not long.   Have you ever had one.?"Still thinking of the long vowel version, he hesitated a little and answered with a "No" veiled with a lot of doubt and concern."Good.   That's where we're going."    As I glanced over to him, I could see a sense of curiousity, dispair and expectation of upcoming chaos.We arrived at 7:45 pm.   It's dark everywhere.   In the street, in the parking lot.   We enter the restaurant and it's no brighter.   It is a very narrow and long restaurant with just enough room for seats at the bar nearly the length of the store and small side tables on the side.  The interior decoration theme is obvious here.   Build the biggest bar that would fit in this row house type of store, and accessorize the rest of the restaurant around the bar.  Sitting in a very dark restaurant, with Beatle music blaring away, this English pub type of place had a huge variety of pastys....from traditional steak and potatoes, to bangers and mash, to more contempory selections that include vegetarian, curries, and fish.   They have a huge selection of international beers, many of which are of the UK......duhhh.I wanted to eat "light" so I selected the Lovely Bit a Salmon which isAtlantic Salmon in a white wine cream & dill sauce, sauted asparagus, spinach, roasted red potatoes, spinach and roasted tomatoes. WHAT A GREAT DISH.   Everything was layered carefully inside the pasty which was served cut in half.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  The asparagus was not over cooked but had a crunch.   All the flavors blended well together.   I still wasn't hungry so I took one half of it back to the hotel....and had it for breakfast the following morning......which tasted just great.My buddy had Spicy Asiago Chicken which was spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes with a side of sour cream & salsa.   That too was excellent.If ever in Phoenix, this would be worth any drive to have lunch or dinner and a beer.After dinner I asked him if he would return to eat here and he said he readily would.    Then I detected a slight pause and a curl of a smile in the background.........maybe he was fantasizing buying a long vowel...I have a small history with pasties.  Having close friends that have been eating pasties since before Christ was born + hanging around said friends for 20 years = a small history with pasties.I recently heard about this place on Yelp and every time I saw the name, I managed to over and over mis-read it as pastry.  My only defense is that I keep getting those forwards from folks that say it doesn't matter the order of the letters or even if all of them are there, you're brain will figure it out anyway.  i guess this time my brain figured wrong.  I digress...It never occurred to me that this little known dish would have it's own establishment run in its honor.  Of course, once I finally clued in that it was pasty and not pastry and stopped acting like someone hopped up on pills, I naturally invited my pasty-lovin' friends to share in the experience.  They too were elated at the variety of pasty options and the fact this was the restaurant's purpose and specialty.  An added bonus is how f'n cheap it is.  Talk about a steal!This place was packed!  Someone said to get there before 8 or 830, but it was 7 and overflowin'.  We managed to fit 5 of us in the awkward geometrical booth built for 3.  My two pasty veterans ordered the Oggie with ketchup since that's what they grew up on (minus the rutabaga).  They both liked it, but thought it was a little spicy due to the rutabaga and the fact they are both ridiculously sensitive to spice induced heat.  One of their sig others ordered a chicken pasty of some sort which he thought was just okay.  The other +1 and I had the shepherd's pie and there wasn't a crumb to be found on either plate.  Our waitress seemed completely unfriendly and a little standoff-ish.    She warmed up as the meal progressed, chatted with us, and she ended up being a great waitress.  One of the guys drinks diet coke like he's in some sort of contest.  After he downed the first one in record time and the waitress gave him a curious "you need a refill already" look, he warned her that he drinks a lot of diet coke and will be gettin' a lot of refills.  About two minutes later she came back with a pitcher so he could refill till his thirst is content.  Rock star move on her part.  We all left full, happy, and ready for the next phase of the evening.I'll definitely be back again - maybe even for lunch since I work relatively close.  Just remember pasty, not pastry.  Yum!To review or not to review, that's the question I've been struggling with. With 50 reviews already, what more could little ol' me possibly add? Absolutely nothing, I knew.But then, today turned out to be a special day...I was trapped - back to back meetings from early morning through late afternoon with no time for lunch. Fortunately for me a good friend but obviously not as hardworking co-worker on her way out the door offered to bring me something back. Where was she going? Pasty!!! She just needed to know what I wanted, of course. So I checked the Pasty to go menu hanging from the bars of my cell - oops - I mean the wall of my cube, and to my surprise discovered that this wasn't going to be just another Pasty... Being the quasi-vegetarian I am, I've been slowly working my way through their vegetarian menu (more than 10 delicious options, including my favorite eggplant parmesan), and there was only one left - the Veggie Tikka Masala. My 11th and final vegetarian pasty - quite the momentous occasion, don't you think?It was while I was savoring the perfect mix of fake chicken, bell pepper and basmati rice in tikka masala sauce wrapped in that soft chewy crust, dipped in that rich mint-yogurt dressing that I realized, 50 reviews be damned. Something new to say or not, I've got to say it. So for what's it's worth, this is it.So, in conclusion: If you haven't been to Pasty yet, you need to go - soon. Come on, man - 50 reviews with a 4 1/2 star average rating? This place so obviously rocks! One tip: if you go for lunch, go early (they open at 11). It gets pretty busy and takes longer the later and busier it gets. Going early is also recommended if there are more than 2 in your party - there are only a couple of tables that fit 3 or more (otherwise you'll be sittin' at separate tables, or at the bar - oh, and should you find yourself headed for the bar, try not to sit directly in front of the one of the ovens, as those seats get pretty freakin' warm).I love this place. If your looking for a good English treat, this is the place to go. The food is phenomenal and the atmosphere is fun. My favorite pic is "The Pilgrim", which has Turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, and comes with a side of cranberry sauce. My husband, who is a vegetarian always gets the vegetarian Shepard's Pie, which he loves.The only two things that I think could be improved on is the inside of the restaurant is hot hot hot in the summer (better air conditioning). And, there could be more space (it's pretty cramped) for seating. Especially if there is more than 2 people in your party.Well I've still got my socks in case you were wondering.I ordered the Rosemary Chicken which was Marinated chicken breast, roasted red potatoes, brie, roasted red peppers and fresh rosemary. Served with a side of mustard cream sauce. (see pics)I'll just call this like I see it, so don't Hate, Glorified Hot Pocket Anyone??It wasn't bad at all but it wasn't the Great and Powerful OZ either.I thought it was just OK. I wish it would have been hotter also, Maybe that would have made the difference?  We even decided on the Strawberry Pavlova for dessert which is Homemade meringue shells, strawberries, kiwi & fresh whipped cream, Finished with raspberry coulé. (see pics)UGH! That was just plain awful......over ripened and flavorless kiwi, zero sugar whip cream and stale meringue all at a tad above room temperature. (and we were still charged for it)Despite the fact that upon leaving I said I couldn't care whether or not I ever ate here again........I probably will give it another try because I really wanted it to be better than it was.  Maybe it would be better if I got them to go and baked them at home?I still don't think it was great enough to have a line out the door, You'd think they were baking 100 dollar bills into these things or something.Is it a bar! It's a restaurant! It's Cornish Pasty Company! Dum do de dum.The music is superb. Elvis Costello anyone? Yes please. The beer selection while I didn't partake this trip is A+.The food....yes!I met the lovely Sarah G. here and loudly remarked on her review point of a pasty being "a glorified hot pocket" just as our waitress came by. Oops.English accent? Check.  As stated a brazilian times the chicken tiki masala is tops. They come split in half so Sarah and I traded halves and I also got to try the pilgrim. Definitely amped my excitement for turkey day. both selections were tops.I want to go here and drink and eat like a king one night. Sarah changed her tune and decided it was definitely better than her last trip and even grabbed a few uncooked to feed the family that night. How cool is that?Ate here a few times since 2004.  Haven't been in many, many months.  Love all but one of the pasties I've tried, thus far.  Great to know that you can call ahead to custom-order!  Also, you may call ahead and have your order started so that it's ready by the time you arrive!  (It took one of my pasties 50 minutes' preparation and cook time from phone call to my table!)Best to order a few and share!  Keep in mind, one of these pasties could contain up to 1200 calories or more!  One word: BUTTER.  Vegan pasties are also available, but you must call ahead to have them made.When I saw the name "Cornish Pasty" I immediately felt like I needed a peasant dress and a goose following me around in order to visit this establishment. Boy was I wrong; I fit right in with my ripped jeans, straight bangs and tattoos!! The people at this place rawk. (yes, I actually typed the word "rawk")Anywho, this place is absolutely amazing. They have a whole entire page of veggie creations that make me salivate just thinking about them! I have had the Veggie Mexican (by far the best IMO), the potato and onion and the cottage somethingorother... and oh brother, I loved them all.I think that the small dining space, worn seats at the bar and the fact that you can see your food being prepared adds to the experience.My only complaint is that it takes a bit to get your food, but they fill your drinks while you are waiting, so I can deal with it. They also have Irish Car Bombs. Very cool. Very, very cool.Ok so I don't know whom I should be exactly pissed at here... Yelp....my neighbors....citysearch....HOW HAVE I NOT FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS PLACE?????Okay Yelp, I can't be mad at you because your little mobile application showed me what was close to me for lunch when I was down in Tempe at the Japanese market buying some Echigo beer which I discovered while at Yasu.Amazing, simply amazing, I saw the outside of this place and was like, "well here we go, another smokey pub filled with old timers"But as I passed through the front door I felt as if I had been magically transported to somewhere back east, a hustling bar with employees shouting orders and pressing fine pasterys and a decor that would make even Gordon Ramsay proud.I had the traditional being that I've never had a "patsy" before and it was simply amazing, beef, potatoes and a red wine gravy that made my mouth go, um what the hell just happened? They have a huge variety and it was really cool to see one of the kitchen members sitting next to me trying out one of the new recipes and critiquing on it.....huge brownie points in my book.. Best part, 10 bucks for lunch including a 3 dollar tip. SCREW YOU ECONOMY! I'll be back for sure!!!No - this is not a review of the pasties that women wear to cover up nipples underneath their clothing or instead of bathing suit tops... this is a review for Cornish pasties... and to be honest, I didn't know what they were either, until I read the 133 reviews that came before mine!So, I finally made my way to Cornish Pasty Company today after months and months of seeing the reviews roll in, and now I know why there are so many CP fans.  This place is great!It's kind of a British pub atmosphere inside. Really laid back and comfortable - and mostly men dining... my party balanced it out as the three of us brought some estrogen inside!  The menu consists of a diverse variety of pasties, which are like calzones or English hot pockets.  They are all homemade with fresh ingredients, and many of them sound super yummy; i had a hard time deciding what to order... I went with the chicken greek pasty while my dining companions went with the carne adovada and the spicy asiago chicken.  I think we were all pretty happy with our respective orders.  I noticed they have large salads on the menu also.  I'm thinking perhaps next visit I'll try a salad - maybe even go with someone who has similar tastes to me and split a pasty and a salad?  Any takers?Either way, I'll be back - it may have been my first Cornish Pasty experience but it will not be my last!Wow... i don't think I've ever been in a more narrow place.. ever! but it was just perfect in ever way!!! They have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side... you can watch them make your food.... its like the food network... but live and you can smell it :) my coworker and i sat right in front of the oven... every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier!! :) we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients!! i had the Reuben (Pastrami, corned beef, homemade sauerkraut and Swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing) WOW... it was amazing... for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage... it was more sweet than bitter... and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery... so delicious!! and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef! over all it was very rich... but great to share.... My Coworker had the Italian.. (pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce) it looked great... he loved it... you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes... it smelled divine we didn't speak for a full 20 minutes... just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and o-m-g this is amazing... said quietly to ourselves.... all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time... just really cool guys... i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place... i cannot wait to come back!If you can find it you will enjoy it - It's a tiny place located around the FAR left side of the plaza on the NE corner of Hardy and University in Tempe.The Pasty, I was informed, is a long ago English mining tradition. Which breaks down to it basically being a "Limey's" take on a burrito. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LimeyWe tried this for lunch on Sunday - Her cheese steak pasty was amazing, and my chicken pot pie pasty was delicious too. The crust is so so flaky, and the "oven chips" with jalapeños were the best I've had. This is NOT fast food, so don't be in a rush when you visit.3.5 starsRemember when Hot Pockets were the best invention EVER? Well now there's a restaurant that is totally dedicated to a fancy hot pocket filled with tasty treats! Yup, Cornish Pasty Co!After promising myself that I would try this place for way too long, I decided to go with a co-worker for my first visit. For my first trip to CPC, I chose the Tikka Masala pasty. It was pretty good! I guess I was hoping for a serving of spicy, somewhat creamy, and savory tikka masala served in a hot pocket. What I got was a good hot pocket full of chicken and some sauce. Not nearly has juicy and spicy as I had imagined it would be, but still good. I chose the peanut butter and jelly pasty for a dessert to take home with me. When I got home and baked it, I took a bite and it was peanut butter and apple jelly? I was confused. It was ok.On my second trip to CPC, I had the cheeseburger pasty. That was pretty darn good! The meat was juicy and a little grease was dripping out of the pocket, which meant that it was nice and juicy! Whenever I am tempted by a hot pocket, I make sure that I head to CPC for a well made, tasty, more sophisticated version!Dating back hundreds of years, the Cornish pasty comes from humble beginnings. The half moon shaped baked pastry filled with meat and vegetables was designed as a lunch for soot-covered Cornish tin miners. To eat it, miners would hold the pasty at the crimped edge, and then discard that part after eating the rest of the pasty. This way the miners didn't eat the dirt they were covered in, missing out on ingesting stuff like arsenic that was common in the mines. While most tin mining is gone, we're fortunate to have the Cornish Pasty Co., which specializes in pasties.With restaurants in Tempe and Mesa, each location has its own spirit. While both are laid back, the Tempe location has a more subdued feel with dim lighting and no windows. Mesa has a brighter interior with indie rock blaring over the sound system.If you enjoy watching kitchen action, belly up to the bar at either locale for a first-hand look into the hard work that goes into making their delicious pasties.As soon as I entered the Tempe location, the warm smell of wine gravy and fresh baked crust covered me like a blanket of mouth-watering comfort. The feeling was like going home for the holidays. I know it's a million degrees outside, but the feeling transcends the summer heat.The first pasty I tried, The Pilgrim ($8), exemplified everything that tastes good at Thanksgiving, luscious turkey breast, sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions all wrapped in a tender crust, then served with a side of cranberry sauce. After one bite, I felt like I needed to pay thanks to someone.The Porky ($7) is filled with all that is good: pork, apples, potatoes, onions and sage and served with a side of red wine gravy. The problem with the gravy is that it's so tasty I'm not sure whether to dunk my pasty into it or drink it.Never able to resist a good burger, I decided to take a chance with the Royale with Cheese ($7.50). Ordered medium, this pasty was brimming with a juicy hamburger, French fries and cheese and served with a side of Thousand Island dressing. As the meat juices ran down my face, I couldn't help but think of the scene in Pulp Fiction where John Travolta explains to Samuel Jackson what the name of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese is in Amsterdam.The Peanut Butter and Jelly ($5) was served piping hot. One bite of this was not going to be enough. Filled with creamy peanut butter, raspberry preserves and sliced banana, the sweet goodness oozed out after the first cut was made. The plate was expertly cleaned in mere moments.Cornish Pasty Co. has a small, but great, beer selection, including one of my favorites, Kronenbourg 1664. Plus visit during their daily happy hour from 3-5pm and you'll enjoy a buck off of every pint.Love at first sight. Lust at first bite. And now I'm drunk with a red curry pasty infatuation. I don't know how it could have taken me so long to eat here, I've been eyeing this place since I moved here 3 years ago. This is my jam. This is what I look for in an eatery. This is where I want to hide out, drink beers and chat with my tatoo artist about the next ink-scursion.Small, narrow, dark, perfect level of noise, good music, cool waitstaff, fun kitchen peeps, inexpensive, and friggin delicious. At 9:30 pm there was a line of about 10 people waiting for tables. Yep the food is that good and the joint is that cool.New mission: try every veggie pasty on the menu and all sweet pasties.Ive been here multiple times and love their food. Living in california i come here at least once a month. Any foodie knows there is more to a restaurant experience than a great product. An amazing restaurant has three basics covered:1) customer service 2) great food offerings 3) an overall great experience. This place lacks customer service which kills the experience. I stood there on a packed Tuesday and saw 3-5 different employees walk by with no acknowledgement that I existed. No eye contact, no greeting, no words at all! After 10 mins and a line out the door I left irritated and ticked. I sympathize with the youth movement and the college atmosphere this place has, however customer service needs to be emphasized to the men and women working the floor. They are the face of your store and if this trend continues, eventually customers will get fed up and go elsewhere. If I am an owner I would be pissed if this negative behavior was going on in my business. The business acumen is very important and should be a learning tool to teach the college kids the important lessons which can be applied to all different job titles. The staff I saw working tonight looked lazy and tired. Maybe due to the high temperature of the restaurant however with poor customer service and lack of a face in the entrance greeting me with a smile and a friendly greeting, it leaves me feeling like you don't want my money and you don't care enough about your customers standing around. Eventually the attitude of we have a superior product that ppl pay for and they not have to worry about customer service will come back to bite them in the butt.Areas for improvementThe waiters should be focused on turning tables and getting the checks as soon as the dessert is finished as opposed to walking around with their heads cut off. More tables being turned equates to more tips. I saw 4-6 tables sitting talking on their phone when they could have been served their checks or ordered more food. My avg time from start to finish was between 90-120 mins! You cut my time in the restaurant to 60 mins with efficient service and food running from the kitchen this place could double its profits and increase tips. They need someone to work the front and greet the customers and let them know they are wanted, appreciated and they want to provide me with a great meal! Drinks out in under 5 mins from order (I waited 20 mins and she forgot about my 2nd beer later in the evening and I had to remind her so 30 mins for a pint of beer...total wait time for 2 drinks: 50 minsNotification on food times (depends on who is working) Challenge your servers to turn tables faster Servers need to be smiling and socialIt was my first visit.  All my co workers have been talking  about this place....with that said,  ..........walking up to this establishment is not impressive.  Please do not take a 1st date here.  All I have heard is about the expansion..and thank goodness!! This place is dark, the staff look like they are all on tour of some skating boarding ESPN tour  in town.BUT!!!!The staff  (who look like skateboarders) were great!  Each one of them so friendly, polite and very attentive. Beer selection-par none...excellent selection on tab.  The expansion section is inviting for large groups...which was perfect for our work HH.MENU- as my friend would say......UNBELIEVABLE!I took home a Carne Asada concoction and it was sooooo good.  The calzone idea is great! When you can come up with creative stuffing you can't go wrong.  Ambiance 3 ..too dark for me Staff  5+ -very friendly, attentive & politeFood 5+- the calzone spin -UNBELIEVABLE...so good.  even take home.Beer 5 -great selection on tab......can't get that everywhere.Picture this...3 $1 bills (which may or may not be from a bet I lost (or won) at the strip club)...an affinity...a propensity...nay, a proclivity! for Irish Car Bombs and a menu that says 'CAR BOMBS: ALWAYS $3'.Those 3 words, squiggly symbol and numeral made me squeal and giggle with glee. The music they were playing was also very appeasing.Monday night, Hubzilla and I were looking for ADVENTURE!, completely exhausted with the usual suspects that we pick up for take out, we headed down to the college town affectionately known as "Tempe" and whipped out the handy dandy Yelp App.  Up jumps "Cornish Pasty Company" at the top of the list.  Eventually we found it tucked into the back of a strip mall (weirdly unexpected location...but sooooo glad we didn't turn away).  Down to brass tacks:The menu has a bunch of stuff on it, yummy-sounding stuff, inexpensive stuff...After a brief conference with our server (and a couple of car bombs to lubricate our speaking skills) we decided to split The Oggie and The Peppered Steak.  The Oggie was the favorite because once you added that red wine gravy to it, the flavors just kinda...pop. The Peppered Steak, by default, was the 2nd favorite, but was also very yummy. I just wish that the peppercorn brandy cream sauce that came with it wasn't cold. Some people really like that, I guess, but I'm a warm-to-room-temperature-or-hotter saucy kinda chick. Next time, I look forward to tackling their delicious sounding dessert menu (they have creme anglaise!!!). I REALLY look forward to going back (soon) to try more pasties!Second visit, just as good as the first:Mushroom, Walnut, Spinach Soup with Homemade Bread and ButterCheese Steak - Onions, Green Pepper, Mushroom, Swiss, Red Wine GravyChicken Pot Pie - Carrots, Red Potato, Green Beans, Celery, Thyme and Chicken GravyThe Pilgrim - Turkey, Sweet Potatoes, Grilled Onion, Stuffing, Cranberry SauceBanoffee Pie - Graham Cracker Crust, Caramel, Whipped Cream, BananasApple Caramel Pasty - Apples, Cinnamon, Caramel topped with Ice Cream and Whipped CreamMoving from sweet to savory (and then back to sweet) our arrival at Cornish Pasty Company was met with a raucous crowd enjoying any number of craft brews but seated swiftly as Led Zeppelin, The Who, and The Ramones competed for air time overhead we were greeted equally quickly by an excellent (and funny without being fakey) young server who understood our time constraints in terms of making it to the game and took our whole order at once noting that she'd place the order in a staggered manner to make sure food wouldn't pile up while still leaving us time to make it to ASU by kickoff - a plan that worked flawlessly.Knowing from my last visit that the pasties would all be excellent - and they were - what truly wowed during this visit to Cornish Pasty Co was actually the soup, a recommendation from our server as "her favorite thing on the menu" - a dense, creamless potage with a hefty mushroom nose and a subtle vegetal note on the tongue while the walnut base added a lingering smoothness that went well with the hearty housemade soda bread and cultured butter.  Obviously not leaving without dessert and having already enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding and bread pudding on my prior visit this time we opted for the house-special Banoffee Pie and Caramel Apple Pasty, neither as good as the pair off puddings but both better than the vast majority of in-house pastries at restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale (where even top tier restaurants choose to outsource their desserts to Ms. Dempsey.)Holy shit is this place awesome. Great unique foods, which are essentially hand held pot pies, wonderful beer selection, and desserts that will knock your socks off. This is truly a unique gem. One thing that shines brightest is the warm, friendly service. It'd be easy to look at the staff and assume you'll be getting shat upon by a hipster tattooed crew, but in reality- they really care about service, and have pride in what they do.Pro Tip- have the banana dessert, it is insanely good.Eek!  This was a second time in just a few weeks I've had a "Meh, I've had much better experience!"  What has happened to Cornish Pasty???  So I felt compelled to write a review about my experiences so that others would know this Cornish Pasty is in need of some management/owner love/help or something.... Service~ yikes! It was turrible, to quote Charles Barkley.  Both visits were the same experience but with different servers.  The servers here seem more interested in talking with each other rather than serving their customers.  On both visits we had to remind our server multiple times to refill our drinks and bring us condiments.  Probably the biggest disappointment is when we complained about our food.  They both were very disinterested in turning our poor dining experience into a positive one.  When we asked to speak to someone in charge in our 2nd turrible visit the waitress disappeared!  I kid you not!  She never came back and when we asked the bartender about her she stated that she went on a break....Food~ prior visits we've had a pretty good experience trying the different pasty's however lately their food has not been up to par!  The pasty's are very dry lately for some reason and they lack flavor.  This last visit we had the bangers and mash, chicken and the traditional beef and potatoes.  We also had a couple of side of fries and some salads.  The salads and fries were the best parts of our dining experience again unfortunately.  The banger and mash was ok.  It had a good balance of bangers to mash but had too much onions.  Since when did onions become a major star in this pasty?  The chicken pasty was not filled completely and was very dry.  The waitress suggested the red wine sauce to help?? WTH?  NO THE RED WINE SAUCE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH ALL PASTY'S, ESPECIALLY THEIR CHICKEN PASTY! It was gross!  We asked for a different sauce.   The waitress stated that was their only sauce but she could bring us ketchup and that's what a lot of people use.  Yes she did say that! If a lot of people are requesting ketchup, the cook, heck the owner needs to know their customers are having to douse their pasty's in ketchup because they are too dry.  The beef and potato pasty was more potato than beef and yes it was arid dry as the desert....So for both visits I give this Cornish Pasty 2 stars because of their salad and fries.  For had we not order those this would easily be a 1 star review. I hope they can turn this place around soon!I'm sure I agree with just about everyone else's raves about this place, so here's my own spin on the place:I love love love that I never knew puff pastry could be so versatile and delicious.Lovely bit o salmon is just that! The veggies inside are perfect! And the sauce mmmm!The Royale is named so appropriately!! If you like burgers, you will Love it!! Service is good, always someone spunky and friendly.But my main reason it's awesome???I reheated my Lovely Bit o Salmon in the microwave 2 days later, and it was still astoundingly fresh tasting but perhaps even more flavorful?!  That might just be a culinary miracle. I recommend this place to anyone, visiting, living here, young, old, meat lovers and not.Finally had the chance to stop in here for lunch and was not disappointed. Arrived right when they opened and was the first one to get served. Sweet!This location is definitely set up with the college kids in mind. Inside is very dark with black painted ceiling tiles and walls. Looks like the basement of a really old bar or maybe even a coal mine. Great place to gather up with the crew and down a few pints and then chow down on some tasty grub.Their west side entrance has a long sit down bar with a few small tables and is rather cramped. The east side entrance has more of a full seating area with additional bar seating. Recommend using the east side one unless you are going undercover and need a quick escape.Started with a cup of Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton soup. It came with bread and butter and was very good. Ordered the Peppered Steak Pasty which is filled with Sirloin Steak, sautéed Portobello Mushrooms, Leeks, roasted Zucchini, and Stilton Bleu Cheese. It also came with a side of yummy Peppercorn Brandy Cream sauce.Everything was very satisfying. There are so many different versions of what they can make. Lamb, Chicken, Pork, Beef, and Veggie are just some of the fillings. I suppose you could make a check list and try them all. Hmmm?Don't forget some Dessert if you still have room. Can't wait to explore more of their delicious menu. Would probably go to the new Scottsdale location or the Mesa one on my next visit. Same great food with more lighting and better suited for a blind old fogey like me. PARTY ON TEMPE!3.75 STARSThe food at Cornish Pasty is unique, freshly made, and delicious! For the vegetarians, I highly recommend The Greek ($8.50) and the Balsalmic Portobello ($9) - both are flaky, delicious and oh so flavorful! My mates enjoy the more traditional meat and gravy pasties and rave about The Oggie (steak + potatoes) and The Royale with Cheese so there's something for everyone and you really can't go wrong!ServiceVery attentive and friendly. Relaxed yet polite servers. The waiter kept a close eye on our beverages and offered refills on our water. I'm always concerned going with a large group to dinner about the check because rarely do I carry extra cash and some restaurants make a fuss about splitting checks. Thankfully, splitting checks isn't an issue at Cornish Pasty. Our server happily complied with our request without batting an eye. The service was excellent so we were fine leaving a little extra gratuity since it made splitting the bill easier. Our waiter was jubilant over the slightly more than 20% gratuity, which just underscores that this is not one of those fancy, pretentious restaurants that expects a generous tip. Physical spaceBeware: The restaurant is NOT visible from street when driving down University. When I finally found the restaurant around the corner and walked up, the windows were black and it appeared as if it was closed. Fret not - it IS in fact open! Apparently the restaurant also recently expanded and friends who had visited the restaurant previously were impressed with the remodel. The bathroom was the one place that suggested more of a pub and college feel. On the bathroom walls I found strange graffiti art. Some inscriptions may have been written by Lady Gaga during her carnivorous costume days or a confused co-ed (e.g., "I am meat"). In any event, once you find the hidden restaurant delicious pasties and friendly service are just a few steps away!Quite frankly, my little sister doesn't understand why I write reviews on Yelp and it annoys her when I take pictures of food, but she has demanded that I give this place 5 stars and exclaimed, "Look at the craftsmanship (of the pastry)...this is actually worth a photo!" Sooo, yeah Cornish Pastry Co is a 4.5 in my book, easily rounded up to a 5.While I would probably never find and/or try this restaurant on my own, I was highly intrigued by the excellent ratings and sheer number of reviews, so my sister and I dropped in just after 11:00 for lunch. I think we made the rookie mistake of entering through the dark, candle-lit kitchen side (with tables along the wall) rather than the far door with the actual dining room, but sitting on either is fine. They even have a patio!The staff was great, answering any questions we had about the menu and service was well-paced. Now...the FOOD! As a (mostly) vegetarian, I was pretty blown away by the options - I have to eat a lot of veggie burgers elsewhere - but this place has a whole vegan/vegetarian page of items, some of which include veggie chicken and beef. Forget what anyone else has said...nothing could be better than the Eggplant Parmesan pastie! ;) My sister also loved her Lamb and Mint pastie, saying it was "effing delicious" and that the mint was not overpowering. The pastry is not doughy like pizza crust, but rather flaky and crispy like a biscuit. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, as they were fresh and still a little crunchy. Literally my only complaint about this place is that my meal was so good I kept trying to bite into it while it was still hot, burning my mouth multiple times. I look forward to coming back the next time I'm visiting my sis in Tempe, as I know she's about to jump on the Cornish Pastry Co regular train! She already has the "Pilgrim" pastie picked out as her next one to try and at about $9/meal, I bet she'll have worked through most of the menu by the time I see her again.Definitely put this on your "must see" list of places to eat (for lunch)!Having only been here are few times I can tell you that when I find myself in Tempe this is the first place that pops into mind when someone asks, "Where do you want to go eat?" With as many reviews as this place, it appears to cover various aspects.  What I will further drive in is the fact that this is quality scratch food.  Be patient this is not some Hot Pocket fresh out of the microwave. It is real food.  Pasties are not the only thing on the menu.  They have a great selection of salads and soups.  Vegan, veg whatever...they got you covered....With 1,079 reviews (and counting) and a 4.5 star rating, I'm not sure what else can be said about the Cornish Pasty Company. The food is always delicious, almost any beer you could want is a flowin', service is excellent and the atmosphere is on point. Back in March one of my childhood buddies was visiting from Boston, and we hosted a Homecoming/Reunion party for him here. I have to hand it to the staff for how well they handled our wild, crazy, LOUD group of 15+. Our drinks were never empty and I can't recall any hiccups on anyone's orders. Also, on this visit, I finally shared some Banoffee Pie with Greg G.Ho Lee Fook AMAZING. Why did I wait so long to try it?! Graham cracker, caramel coated crust with pillowy whipped cream and banana slices. If Greg and I hadn't known each other for almost 20 years, I may have fought him to the death for the whole thing!Any place I can get out for well under $30 after a filling entree (Lamb Vindaloo Pasty is my fave!) + two pints of Raj IPA is a winner in my book.Don't ever change, CPC!YUMMY PASTIES, and no i'm not referring to the ones you're used to. Pasties here are thin flaky pastries filled with many savory options from american to indian influenced one pasty is perfect as a meal & the crust is what makes them so good---oggie: the beef wasn't the best but the potatoes were flavorful! i liked the red wine gravy that comes as a dipping sauce!i can't wait to come back & try other optionsNOTE: in terms of atmosphere don't expect to walk into grandmas house because they serve up pasties, think dark dive bar (which was perfect as a low key lunch after our crazy night)I have been hearing great things about this place.  I had to try of course.  L and I had our god-daughters for the day.  So we try to take them to different place to try out.  We found great parking and walked in.  It is seat yourself, but most of the empty tables were dirty.  So we sat at a dirty one waiting for them to clean up.  The staff came pretty quickly to clean off the table and gave us menus.  I ordered the chicken pot pie pasty and a side of roasted potatoes.   The chicken pot pie was very good, but the potatoes were slight under cooked.  The service was pretty good.

Review Text :
I noticed after this visit just how much the price has changed when it comes to a brunch buffet. Generally brunch costs more than breakfast, lunch or dinner, but not here at the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station. Brunch on Sunday runs around $9.99 (same price for dinner during the week) with a players card. After being seated I noticed how dirty the highchair was that my nephew was in. I'm talking all sorts of food on either side of it. I cleaned it up with some wipes his mom had with her, but this highchair looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. Our server was great and checked on us often. Even with the big group we had at our table she kept the dishes cleared and brought us refills without us ever having to ask. They brunch buffet has the usual stuff. Different breakfast and lunch option at the same time. I walked by the pizza as it was coming out so I figured that was a good time to get some of that. It tasted OK, but definitely tasted like a frozen pizza that was made. They do have a pizza oven right there and you can watch it cook, but it wasn't anything I'd ever go out of my way for. The bacon was hard and tasted microwaved. Scrambled eggs weren't bad or the mini waffle I had. The hash browns were a soggy mess with some burnt crispy parts. I did enjoy the mac & cheese even if it tasted like Kraft deluxe. The breakfast sausage looked good, but tasted nasty. I brought back an assortment of desserts for our table to try and they were terrible! All of the pastries were hard which was a disappointment. I will say that the salad bar had a lot of options including fresh fruit and it all looked good. I enjoyed what I had from the salad bar area much more than anywhere else at the buffet. This buffet could use many changes and isn't really worth it until then in my opinion. Kids 2 and under are free.Didn't like this buffet. The tables and chairs were filthy and the food all seemed like frozen food that was microwaved. I even had a BOGO coupon and still didn't find the buffet here worth it. What happened the Stations buffets used to be better than this?! I remember a larger selection of desserts in the past compared to the mostly sugar free desserts they had during my visit. The prime rib even lacked flavor. Just not worth it for me.I'm pretty sure all the Station Casinos' buffets are called "Feast Buffet." This Feast Buffet is located inside Sunset Station in Henderson. My son and I came here for dinner last week and it was a better atmosphere, better service, better food selection, better quality of food, and a better looking clientele as compared to Boulder/Texas/Palace Stations; but certainly does not compare in the least to Red Rock Resort nor Green Valley Ranch, which are both upscale resorts operated by Station Casinos.As typical at Feast Buffets, they offer Pepsi products served to your table. From there, each dining patrons is on their own to serve themselves walking back n forth to the food areas. Many ethnic varieties of food to choose from, most of which were fried aka not on the healthy side. (e.g., American, Carving Station, Salad Bar, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, and Dessert Bar.) The selection and quality of the foods offered were very basic and very average, but certainly much better than what i've experienced at Feast Buffets of Boulder Station, Palace Station and at Texas Station.The interior of this restaurant was well lit, very clean, and with modern decor. The staff were all very friendly...from the cashier, the hostess, our food server, and each of the employees working at the food selection areas.For $10 dinner, it was a good deal considering the variety of foods/drinks, and the AYCE-All You Can Eat dining concept. We will be back again when in the area, hungry on a budget.YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #259I still haven't changed my mind much from the last time I was here but they have changed a few things. You can now add a steak for $5 or 1 lb of crab legs for $6 to your $6.99 buffet. It's the standard Vegas buffet, pretty small with so few choices, they do have charbroiled hamburgers and sausages. But they got rid of the hand scooped ice cream & now have the machines which really sucks that was the highlight of this buffet. The prime rib was par roast part rubber. .The  chicken and tacos were good overall its not bad for $7, but still I usually only go when it's comped on my players card.The service is non-existent here-get your own drinks and they hardly come around to clear plates. However they did redeem themselves at the end with some good coffee.If you're looking to be wow'ed by a Las Vegas buffet, look elsewhere, toots.The Feast Buffet located in the Palace Station Hotel & Casino is very affordable for those looking not to spend a lot of money for an AYCE.  Here's my 2 cents on my mealtimes, in chronological order-Lunch - A step-down from your local Hometown Buffet.  There is a grill where diners can ask for slices of roast beef/turkey, burgers, hot dogs & brats.  Located next to it, is a pasta station where pasta is made to order with whatever choice ingredients the diner desires.  The rest of the hot/cold foods were decent, but nothing extraordinary.  The dessert section was nice w/ various cakes, cookies, sweets and the obligatory nonfat froyo machines.  Overall, meh.Dinner - See lunch, but w/ a few extra items scattered hither & thither.  Not worth the extra cost, IMHO.Breakfast -  Now we're talking!  Several egg dishes, mounds of bacon, biscuits & gravy, country fried steak etc.  There is also an omelette station where diners can have an omelette their way.  The dessert section had most of the same items from lunch/dinner, plus various doughnuts and other items.  The Feast Buffet is an affordable, no-frills buffet.  I recommend breakfast over lunch & dinner for those interested in checking this buffet out.  I had free buffet vouchers, but if I had to pay, I would stick to breakfast.Excelsior!We were staying in this hotel and didn't feel like getting into the car and driving around looking for a place to eat so we decided to check out the on-site buffet for dinner. Get a boarding pass- which is the Palace Station players card. You get a discount at the buffet and end up paying the child's price. You cannot beat the price of this buffet. Even McDonald's for my family of 5 is more expensive than what I paid for the buffet for 5 people.I didn't really explore the rest of the buffet too much as it's pretty small and the selection and quality are lacking. They even have a carving station which I usually dive right into but the meat lacked flavor and was incredibly dry. The real star of the buffet, and the only reason why I would return is because of the made  to order pasta station. Now that was delicious and I returned again, and again, and again. There aren't even that many choices and I kept ordering the same thing over and over but the pasta was pretty good, considering one plate of pasta at the Olive Garden costs more than this entire buffet. I was craving pasta so this was definitely worth it and hit the spot. You get your choice of pasta noodles and sauce. Toppings include shrimp, clams, and vegetables/spices such as tomato, oregano, garlic, onions, etc. The small asian man is grumpy and rude and will make you go back to the end of the line if you want to order two dishes. He made my son and I go to the end of the line each time but some old white guy was able to get multiple dishes cooking because he had tipped him. No fair but that's Vegas I guess.I had come to expect good quality from this place but this time around found it very disappointing.The price was right-2 comped buffets. The service was great, quick to take the plates on top of the drink refills and extra napkins.The salad & soup bar was great. Bleu Cheese Chunks for the salad and great chicken noodle soup with tender white meat chicken.They have lots of sushi, fried sushi, wontons,potstickers,dim sum and lots of aian cuisine.Most of it is very weak with little pop to it.The beef brisket was tender & juicy  and had a nice smoky flavor. The Roast Beef was a little uhhh..No seasoning on the meats.The cornish game hens were super juicy and very good.The fried chicken however was tough and dried out.Most of the side dishes like mac n cheese, beans,potato salad, coleslaw, and collard greens were just bland its like its all the same food with no fllavor.The pizza was doughy and the vegtables and meats were not cooked. The whole Italian section of ravioli,rotini and spaghetti is all pretty weak. Dinner they usually do made to order pasta with shrimp etc.The desserts were pretty dry & crusty with a very limited selection.Real diappointing.There's lots of other things available but I did not try tham because they didn't even look appealing. I see there is quite a varied opinion on this place and I would say 6 months ago the food was 4x better now it just seems like all the same quality as other station bufffets, one of which I tried just yesterday at the Palace Station. Same tasting food. Red Rock had better presentation plus a little more selection.For my money I'm sticking to the Palms-filet mignon & crab legsRed Rock Feast buffet is pretty darn good! I am always satisfied with the fresh selection of buffet items. They have the basics, the classics and build your own creation stations such as tacos, omelets, and pasta. Fresh sliced meat options, turkey, roast beef, prime rib and ham. They also have shrimp cocktail, simple sushi, salad bar, soups, breads, pizza, enchiladas, fish & chips just to name a few. Desserts are incredible, cakes, pies, gelato, soft serve, cookies, macaroons, etc. Drinks anything you could imagine from chocolate milk, lemonade, coffee, iced tea, and sodas. The lay out is comfortable, spacious with both booths and table seating. The service is always fantastic, the servers always keeping our drinks filled. Great food, wonderful service and fantastic deals with a players card for comped or two for one deals. I have done this buffet many times and will continue to do it every time I am in the mood to be satisfied.In the sea of buffets at Vegas, Feast Buffet @redrockcasino has go to be on top of the list of great deal buffets. The prices at this buffet are very reasonable and you get your money's worth.Breakfast:Monday - Saturday 8:00am - 10:45am $4.99 w/boarding pass card, $7.99 without boarding pass card Lunch:Monday - Saturday11:00am - 3:00pm $7.99 w/boarding pass card, $10.99 without boarding pass card Dinner:Daily4pm - 9pm $13.99 w/boarding pass card,  $18.99 without boarding pass card Sunday Brunch8am - 2pm $13.99  w/boarding pass card,  $18.99 without boarding pass card I highly suggest getting a boarding pass card because you will save some $$ at the buffet. It's pretty easy to get one. All you have to do is sign up at the front of the casino and you ta da - boarding pass! :)There is a lot of selection at this buffet. It's international with different stations dedicated to foods from around the world. They have Japanese (sushi), Mexican (fajitas, quesadillas), Chinese (orange chicken, bao, fried rice), American (mini hamburgers, mac and cheese) and Italian (pizza, pasta). They also have an awesome dessert area (pies, cupcakes, cookies, cannolis, brownies) and a gelato bar! There is so much food, I just can't list it all!I've been here for Sunday Brunch and lunch and they actually have pretty much the same offerings. Sunday Brunch just has champagne, mimosas, an omelet bar and breakfast goodies like eggs, bacon, sausage, corn beef hash and breakfast sweets like donuts, muffins and croissants.  I tried out the omelet bar when I was here. I got a vegetarian omelet and it was great! It had a good share of different veggies and nicely made. The gelato bar here is my favorite! Some of the flavors they had were: mint, vanilla, raspberry, caramel, strawberry and spumoni! The spumoni and caramel were excellent. Sweet and creamy, it's the perfect dessert at lunch or dinner or even breakfast brunch (hehe). Gelato and Vegas, how can you go wrong?Lots and lots of selection with decent prices! Don't forget to get your boarding pass for even more savings! :)There are certainly a lot of people who think that Red Rock is one of the best local casinos in town and I will admit that it had a lot going for it. That is, it HAD a lot going for it. Over the past two years I have watched as this once great Red Rock has slowly soured into a joke that is not at all funny. There seems to be no aspect of this casino that has not deteriorated in quality, with the rare exception of the Yard House (which is not associated with the casino).But let's keep the focus of this review to the Feast Buffet. I have eaten at the Feast Buffet on a very regular basis for several years, although it had been a few months since I was last there. With some friends in town, it was a good option for a good budget meal, so we went this past Sunday.First of all, I am supposed to be a VIP of the Station Casinos, with a Presidential status that was earned almost completely at the Red Rock. The President status is supposed to get me a 50% discount on the buffet, but it only amounted to about 25%. So the Sunday night buffet is $19 per person ($15 after my VIP discount). One would think at those prices, we were about to be pampered with some great food choices. Boy were we wrong - very wrong.Let's just sum this all up with a reference that I think we can all relate to - the food quality and choice was what one would expect to find at Sizzler (but of course, at twice the price). There were less options to choose from than there used to be and what was there was crap, just pure crap. No prime rib, shrimp or crab legs, something they were calling sushi (ha!) and a plentiful collection of some of the cheapest menu items a buffet can offer. It reminded us of a cattle feed lot, troughs of a food like substance that all tastes the same.Crap - pure crap!$20 lunch for two with drinks and dessert? While the food is standard fare comparable to a good ole Chinese buffet, the dessert is quite good. A lot of "NSA" options. As if you'd be worrying about sugar when you eat at a buffet. They have different ice cream flavors, gelato, AND soft serve with a topping bar of course! You can even make an ice cream cookie sandwich if you so desire. The pastry section offers different kinds of pie and again, with sugar-free options.$3 specialty drinks if you want some adult bevies.Excellent service, it's like they're secretly watching you eat and clear your plate as soon as you eat your last bite and refill your drinks right away. Sign up for a boarding pass card for $3 off :)I've been to this particular buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner over the past year, and feel it's a solid three stars. The selection is pretty good but dinner has been underwhelming- lunch is your best option.Breakfast: Typical breakfast buffet selection. On weekends you may luck out and find shrimp and grits, which is done excellently here. Other than that, it's just fine. Nothing in particular stands out.Lunch: Best time to go, selection is large and you'll have most of the dinner options. Start with massive salad bar, end with a smorgasbord of desserts including a gelato bar. The Mexican food options are surprisingly solid.Dinner: Underwhelming. Little to differentiate it from lunch options. Seafood selection (my favorite) is limited, sushi quality is comparable to a grocery store, shrimp are small and not very clean. Service is consistently good, and you can find locals discounts pretty easily. Always surprised by how busy this place is.3.5 stars-My favorite Feast Buffet:    The Red Rock Feast Buffet is my favorite Station Casinos Buffet. It has consistently been very good without achieving the level of outstanding. Today, when I made it my post - hike supper; it was one more positive experience.    Station Casinos might be genuine when they advertise they love locals. They sent this local a booklet with a half - off cupoun for any Feast buffet. I planned ahead to Saturday nights when Station doubles their price for the gimmicky prime rib & shrimp night. Station Casino's love for locals reduced a $17.99 dinner to less than $10. Lol, I would regain all the calories that I lost from hiking the Red Rock hills bordering Blue Diamond.   From experience, I recommend arriving to the Feast Buffet before 5:00 pm. After, the long lines seem to appear. When I arrived, the line was short. However, it seemed to move like molasses.     This Feast Buffet represents a wide assortment of food in food stations featuring sushi, Mexican, barbecue, International, Asian, American, Italian, pastries, and salad bar. If I am not mistaken, this is the only Feast Buffet to feature sushi (I have to check GVR again ). Each station offers a nice variety of food. Some examples:Asian: Asian ribs, fried rice, Singapore noodles, wonton soup, orega chicken, stir fry, lo mein, spicy tufu, Spring rolls, etc.Sushi: peal & eat shrimp, assorted sushi, ginger, & mussel salad.American: Live cooking station of prime rib, chicken, and turkey. Plus meatloaf, cabbage, mash potatoes, fried chicken, etc.Italian: pizza, meatballs, sausage, chicken pesto, etc.Pastries: full service ice cream. Plus cheesecake, German chocolate cake, cream puffs, raspberry poulade, cookies, sugar free desserts, etc.   In recent times my buffet station of choice is Asian foods. However, when sushi is offered it is my station of choice. I filled up on assorted sushi which appeared to be varieties of California rolls. My complaint is that they don't name many of the items. It was good at the same time that it wasn't close to the excellence of Yummy Sushi. Sushi and Asian foods represented my plates. I filled up on stir fry, wonton soup, and this no name soup that is below in a picture. The wonton soup was good, and I appreciated that they never ran out like they do at Sunset Station; yet it fell short of the great wonton soup that Cravings and Carnival World Buffet have served me. To conclude my meal, I drank coffee with raspberry poulade.   This very Feast Buffet is my favorite of them. The deal is that this meal is usually $20 after tax. They use the prime rib & shrimp gimmick to increase the price on a night that many people go out to eat. From experience nearly every buffet includes prime rib. When I think shrimp night, my mind has visions of broiled shrimp, stuffed shrimp, shrimp cocktails, shrimp scampi, and pealed shrimp. The only shrimp I laid eyes on here was the peal & eat shrimp. This is ordinary buffet food that I recently had during lunch in the Gold Coast Buffet. The upshot is that this gimmick is prevents me from rating it 4 stars. In conclusion, this is my favorite Feast Buffet.Rarely do you find the combination of good value combined with good quality, but this buffet does it with amazingly great prices, (for Vegas that is) and a real decent selection of quality food. The line can be long at times I hear, but was not bad when we went at 7:30 on a Saturday for breakfast. They opened at 8am. We got there early so we got more to the front of the line. Get a players card and be local and the prices really comes down for all the buffet options. We paid only $7.50 each for breakfast. I like the whole scene as it was not as hurry up and get in line like the places on the strip. Food quality was better than expected for the price ... so no, this will not stack up to a $40.00 buffet, but remember you are paying less than $10.00 here, but well worth the price. Better than most of the other Station Casinos in town as well.This was gonna be our last meal in Vegas before we head back to Reno/Carson City area and the only buffet we tried while here in Vegas. I've been to many a buffet, so doing buffets is not a big deal, but I wanted to see what the Red Rock had going. It's nice to be away from the main strip casino area.The food selection is all you normal breakfast stuff. All the bacon you can eat! The quality was actually pretty decent for a buffet, and for the price of $7.50 ..... I'd spend more than that at Denny's! and this is waaaay better! Service was fine, plates were cleared and our coffees and OJs refilled just fine. This place really got packed, and I can see why, the prices and the quality and mostly locals as the Red Rock is away from the main tourist areas. OK, off to the nearby Costco to get gas and we're outta here. I'm glad I came here and got in line early!

This is what I get for being lazy.  I know there are plenty of good places to eat after hours in Las Vegas, but I decided to dine here after watching Carrot Top's show simply because I was too lazy to go find something better.  The 24 hour Pyramid Café located on the casino floor of the Luxor was quite the popular spot when I was there as there was a constant line of patrons waiting to be seated.I liken the restaurant to a Denny's based on its menu.  They serve items such as all-day breakfasts, salads, burgers and sandwiches and a few main dishes.  The prices are very reasonable.  The staff is all pretty friendly even though I noticed quite a few of the buspersons lagging in their step and just standing around and doing nothing while there were multiple tables to be cleaned off and countless patrons waiting for a spot to sit down.After a ten minute wait I was seated.  I'm not complaining, but they sat me (dining solo) in a table for four while tables for two were available forcing groups of three or four to continue to wait for a table.  The whole seating arrangement just seemed way out of whack.  I got a nice waitress though who constantly smiled and checked up on me multiple times.I ordered the New York Steak dinner and asked that it be cooked medium.  The dinner is served with fresh seasonal vegetables which turned out to be steamed carrots and broccoli and a choice of potato.  I chose mashed potatoes and made the mistake of saying yes to gravy.  The wait for the food was about as prolonged as the seating process.  In the meantime I was brought a basket with two warm garlic rolls and four pats of butter served cold and hard.  The bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=Ji_LeplLxwpK_0wCAN9n6g) was flavorful, but it was not fresh as the center was kind of firm instead of being soft.My steak dinner (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=xVshpLhrKF23IUVFmNqt2g) didn't fare any better.  The meat was unevenly cooked as half of the steak was served medium-well and the other half was well-done.  I hate well-done steaks!  I wouldn't have minded had the entire steak was medium-well since that part remained tender and juicy.  Trying to cut into the well-done meat with only a semi-sharp steak knife proved to be a task as the entire table shook.  The huge serving of mashed potatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=bOshUN8Fs5iGod0KBTGG1Q) might have been okay had it not been drowned in the super salty brown gravy.  The best part of my meal ended up being the steamed broccoli.Pyramid Café, no thanks!  Next time I won't be so lazy!I can only assume that the awfulness and douchebaggery of the Chris Angel show is rubbing off on this place. Like an airborne virus or something. Awfulness: a fifteen dollar burger that just wasn't tasty. I thought that bacon, onions, cheddar, and BBQ sauce would automatically make this thing great. Not so. The fries were mushy. The pickle was good though. The partner in crime liked her panini, but since she's not writing this, her opinion doesn't count. Douchebaggery: Walk in and tell the hostess we want a to go order. She says that's what the servers are for and to grab a seat. Whatevs. 15 mins later, our order gets taken. Another 15 mins later and we have our food. Thank god for those big, stupid plastic drink thingies to keep me company. 30 minutes and $35 later, I am totally underwhelmed. Disclaimer: I did not see the Chris Angel show, however, when it ran on TLC it was full of awfulness and douchebaggery, so I just assumed.

Not a big fan... the bar is fairly large with several rooms, though all are pretty dumpy (not so much in the old school "good-dive" kinda way). The crowd is somewhat interesting. Drinks are pretty strong, but smallish. Prices are fair. No smoking patio here - go outside the front door and wave at cars on McDowell while you puff.I have yet to dine here.I did see a band play here recently, and that was pretty decent. Without a band - no thanks...

08/13/07 UPDATE:They have the best, most crisp, french fries around.  And you can now watch music videos on their big plasma screen, from the Arabia channel.===========================================Opa!  I'm speaking Greek, right?I write this review as a Caucasian male whose only familiarity with Mediterranean cuisine was when I ingested a leaf while eating grapes.  Turns out the leaf ended up being from a tomato vine.  I'm still wondering how that wilted foliage found its way into my cluster of concords.Back to Phoenicia.  My first time there, I orderd the safest thing I could find... gyro and fries.  Roasted lamb and cucumber yogurt sauce.  It was like my mouth was having a party, and everyone was invited.  But wait, it gets better.I see they have babaganoosh, and momentarily, I flash back to the Wedding Crashers movie.  Great, now I have to order it... and I'm glad I did.  Its just eggplant, people.On subsequent visits, I ordered the chicken shawarma and kabobs, cilantro jalapeo hummus, tatziki.  Fantastic.  There is also a great place in Tempe called Haji-Baba.Phoenicia also has a huge mural on the wall, of a Greek coastal setting, which you can stare at while you fill up.  For some reason, I keep reminding myself to wait an hour before going into the water.This place is a real treat.  And their treats (desserts) and great too.  I'll take the pistachio baklava.-SwoopI like it.  The food was mostly very good, the service was good in a hurried sort of way and the prices are reasonable.We ate on a weekday evening and the place was bustling.In the valley of the sun, Z's Greek at 40th and Indian School continues to be the standard bearer for this sort of cuisine and Phoenicia does not measure up, but they are solid enough that I would return.I would add something clever and Greek or Middle Eastern here but I've got nothing right now so you're out of luck.If you like, send me a compliment with something good and I will add it to the review and credit you...Oh wow...this place is really good!  I've been a couple of times now and I could go on and on (you know I could), but really, it's excellent almost all the way around. I've tried a few different things on the menu by this point, as you can see by my pictures, and everything has been delicious.  Their tabouli has to be some of the freshest I've ever had, and the meats are full of flavor.  The only reasons they don't get 5 stars are because the service is a little shaky at times, and the one time I got the chicken kabob, it was a pretty skimpy portion.  Other than that, I would go back any time.  They also have a Yelp check-in offer of 50% off your second entree, which is a great deal.  Their prices are reasonable anyway, even without a discount.

Restaurant name  Trader Vic's

Review Text :
An empty restaurant is never a good sign so perhaps Gabi K, Jared M, and I should have found dinner elsewhere, but we decided to give Trader Vic's a chance. Our meal started off on a good note...Attentive service, although then again we were the only people to really give attention to.  And we did enjoy the bread basket...although I could do without the bread with chunks of pineapple in it.Gabi and I decided to share 2 entrees- both highly recommended by the waiter. In fact, he said they were 2 of the most popular dishes on the menu. What you ask? Hold your horses yelpers...I'm getting there! Macadamia crusted mahi mahi and some lo mein like dish topped with halibut.  Jared was eating his 2nd dinner of the evening so he decided to keep it light and ordered the won ton soup. And it turned out he ordered right because the won ton soup was apparently better than anything else that came to the table.The mahi mahi and halibut (on top of the noodles) was beyond bland...it tasted like one of my flavorless weight watchers meals I make at home.  And it's really a problem when Trader Vic's cooks like the gal who burns pasta (yep, guilty of that last week). The mashed potatoes that came with the mahi mahi were decent, as were the noodles...but that was pretty much it.  Our bill came to $90- $90 too much!!We skipped the drinks after having our fair share of them at the hotel bar beforehand, but if I ever have to come back to Trader Vic's (which I don't plan on) I'll have to mask the bland taste of their food with lots of their specialty drinks.Not sure if we went on a really off night, but I was extremely disappointed with TV's.  As Andrea wrote below (damn her for writing her review before me), our bill came to $90 for dinner and it was $90 too much!The waiter (Tyler I think) said that their version of pad thai with halibut was his favorite dish on the menu... favorite dish?  really?  it was pretty bland - nothing special at all!  We also went with the macadamia crusted mahi mahi - not so much - pretty bland as well.  The steamed asparagus was fine but how can you really screw that up?  I had a spoonful or two of Jared's wonton soup - that was actually decent... but not enough to bring me back.Sorry, TV's - I won't be seeing you again anytime soon but good luck to you!I once went to a perhaps unsurprisingly now defunct Trader Vic's in Washington for happy hour and was impressed by neither the food nor the drinks - this is not that story.An almost empty restaurant (making our reservation comic relief) excluding the bustling bar area (slightly after the end of happy hour) on a holiday despite a well-decorated hall brimming with Tiki kitsch should have given us an indication, but since I was there for a family dinner with a picky family and this was already a compromise location, it was a bit late to change course(s), and among the goods for which we bartered were:- Cosmo Tidbits ($22): Enough fried and meaty flavors for three but nothing of note.- Lamb Curry (~$27): A flavorless cream of lamb soup that would have made Campbell's proud as a special? I have no idea what the chef was thinking with this.- Polynesian Snowball ($7): Coconut-encrusted vanilla with chocolate sauce done well.- Chocolate Macadamia Nut Torte ($8): Adequate, appropriately sweet, but forgettable.If I'd gone to Outback Steakhouse and paid commensurate prices, I would have been pleased with the results, and thus it might fare better for happy hour (despite a previous experience at another location) but for near Ruth's Chris costs I expect near flawless execution, especially on a special, the failure of which overshadowed the experience.I can't decide if Victor Bergeron (the real life Trader Vic) was any or all of the following:- A shrewd capitalist genius who traded pittances of mediocre food for large sums- A C team stock trader who went long on 25% odds based on our dining experiences- A victim of continued posthumous branding that has brought shame to his name- A one-hit wonderquack who never surpassed or fully channeled his Mai Tai "invention"However, I have decided that I am comfortable leaving this islander mystery unsolved.I had some visitors from corporate in town - one for our annual operations inspection, one to have a look at some of the tactical marketing we're developing in my region.  Anyway, they wanted to eat here so...Here we were at Traders Vics.  The atmosphere is nice, island themed opulence and texturally pleasing.  We were greeted very warmly and sat in the bar for cocktails and a snack before dinner.  The drinks were tasty.  The appetizer "tidbits for two" varied from good to uninteresting.We moved on to the dining room.  It was a Thursday night and the place was D ecidedly E mpty A nd D evoid (DEAD) of customers.  I tried one of the specials which was some sort of Thai inspired noodles with curry and some seafood and peanut and some mild pepper spiciness and...and...and...I frankly don't remember what it was supposed to be because it frankly wasn't anything.  Too many things going on, nothing made a big impression.  The other diners apparently chose better because 2/3 of them were happy with their dinner.  Wait, if there were 4 of us and I wasn't thrilled and only 2 of the other 3 diners were happy that means that 2 of the 4 or 50% of the diners were underwhelmed.  Now if Trader Vic's had been traveling north on a train at 75 mph and had 160 miles to travel...wait I think I just had a flashback to sixth grade math.  Ok, my bottom line impression of Trader Vic's - kind of cool atmosphere, interesting history (I think they were owned by Merv Griffin) and the food was average at a premium price.   Oh and the bathrooms were very nice.I went back on this trip for the happy hour. It's twice a night, every night, from 4 to 6 and 9 to 11. Appetizer specials are $1, $2, or $3, and a few drink specials are also available.Our group enjoyed relaxing on the lanai, sipping our drinks underneath the tiki torches, bamboo, and heat lamps. Amongst the six of us, we ordered the Maui burger, Chinese spareribs, popcorn shrimp, calamari, and chicken skewers. I thought my spareribs were excellent and meaty, but Vicky T. really won with her $3 Maui burger. Somehow our group passed on the frou-frou tropical drinks that Trader Vic's is famous for, but we were all content with our cocktails. Even the teetotalers were happy with their fruit concoctions. Sadly, I forgot to try a Drunken Geisha (next time, I promise to remember, Brian S.).We arrived shortly before happy hour ended, but our waitress was great at getting our order in on time. As we relaxed with the good food, good drinks, and good company, we joked about hanging out until happy hour started up again at 9. Next time, we surely will.

Restaurant name  Pin Kaow Thai

Review Text :
Solid Thai food.  Quite so, I must say.I enjoyed an order of pad thai, hot and an order of sweet sticky rice with coconut milk.  I really enjoyed the pad thai, great blend of flavors in this Thai food standby.I liked the warm atmosphere and the service was very attentive.They pay attention to the presentation of the food as well as the taste and it was an overall enjoyable experience.I would go back.This was my first visit back to Pin Kaow in several years and I still can't say that they are a favorite of mine. The restaurant is very nice looking. Large, clean and nicely decorated. We came in around noon and there were two other parties seated already. The restaurant was eerily quiet, I wish there was louder music playing to offset the awkward silence. My mom and I almost felt like we needed to whisper, it was that quiet. We ordered a chicken fried rice and basil duck to share. The rice was tasty, but it's hard to screw up fried rice. The basil duck was pretty good as well. The sauce was good, but a little lacking in substance. The flavors are a lot more subtle than I would like. Overall, Pin Kaow is just an ok dining spot in the valley.If you're in the Southwest part of the valley as I seem to be more lately, Pin Kaow is a solid choice for Thai food.   There are three Pin Kaow locations; I've been to Pin Kaow 1 (Rainbow/Lake Mead) on my side of town several times, but it was my first time at Pin Kaow 2 (Rainbow/Robindale).  I'm happy to report that the quality of the food and the customer service are the same at both locations.  We came here for Sunday dinner around 6:30pm and were seated in a booth immediately.  I really like the Thai décor at these restaurants and the food and service were on point.  Girlfriend and I shared the following:Mango Salad ($8.95):  I always order this salad, which I prefer over papaya any day; light and refreshing, with enough of a kick for me to handle.  I'm trying to leave the zero spice level behind and grow up; I ordered it at spice level 3 and survived.Panang Curry with chicken ($9.95):  This has become my new favorite Thai dish, since I was schooled on panang recently.  I'm not a fan of curry in general, but there's coconut milk in panang and I am a fan of that.  I chose brown rice instead of white rice; if there was an upcharge for this, I don't know what it is because I forgot to check.Pad See Ew with shrimp ($9.95):  Another favorite noodle dish and a nice break from Pad Thai, which used to be the only thing I'd ever order.  The shrimp were plentiful and delicious.We were checked on frequently and our water glasses were never empty.  This experience was so good that the Thai food phase that I'm currently in is going to last a while longer.  I even forgot to take pictures because we were so ready to eat.  I'm looking forward to the next visit and hopefully we'll even have the sweet rice with mango dessert--after Lent.Brought a client here for lunch by her request. The restaurant is beautiful inside with traditional wood carvings and Thai art throughout. We were seated asap at a booth and I ordered Thai ice tea.Our waitress who was Thai seemed like she didn't want to be there since she was unfriendly and was just going thru the motions of servicing us. I went with the Thai red chicken curry. The entree came with a spring roll, soup and steam rice. The curry was actually tasty good and contained bamboo shoots and was spicy creamy. Our waitress brought the me the bill and I had to hit her up for offerings of dessert which happen to be only green tea ice cream. I ordered a serving and it was yummy but I only ate about half of it.If not for the mediocore service by our waitress I would definitely return here again but it would problably be on my own to test the waters again. What a shame how a negative attitude can turn what should have been a above average experience into a below average rating.3 1/2 stars. Second time visiting this location during lunch on a weekday. Heart the decor of the interior of this restaurant.  Started off with a refreshing solid glass of Thai ice tea. Instead of ordering a lunch special I went with the ala carte yellow curry which came with steamed rice.The sauce was spot on but the white chick meat  was on the tough side which was disappointing but the sauce and potatoes over the steam rice was yummy. Service was attentive from the entire staff this time around and friendly.I'll probably be back but would avoid the chicken curry and try another entrée.

Restaurant name  The Pub at Monte Carlo

Review Text :
(short review alert!)During the Vegas trip the guys wanted to hit up a bar...  Being a Vegas veteran knowing that there really isn't any "stand along bars" available so decided to check it out.  (Most of the bars in Vegas are infused into the casinos as a Bar/Lounge style next to the slots)  The pub's got a cool logo of a whale with fire coming out of it's blowhole so I guess that was the draw of my attention.  (I enjoy these little things)Once we were here, we noticed that it was more of a restaurant than an actual bar.  The place was wide open with decent decor, dim lighting, and dark furniture around the facility.  Since we were looking for a bar and my friends were more disappointed because it wasn't an actual bar (and actually wasn't crowded at all), so we decided just to have quick bite to eat instead.Ordered chicken quesadilla with mango sauce, calamari with 2 sauces, and nachos...Quesadilla was great... I mean, how can you go wrong with tortilla, chicken, cheese, and sweetened sauce?  An easy and safe choice.  Calamari was fried to perfection with decent sauce accompanied with the dish.  Nachos were humongous in portion, but it was overly salty and the cheese looked fake... so the nachos wasn't a hit at all.We didn't get any drinks as we were really looking forward to a bar, so after the meal immediately we left the pub so that we can get some drinks in our system.  The entire meal (appetizers) cost us almost $40 so it's not a cheap meal by any means, but I guess you are paying just like the whale with the fire out of the blowhole....(is that why he is burning inside?)I may or may not come back to this place... some entertainment was happening on stage but it wasn't really grabbing anyone's attention so perhaps Monte Carlo have to rethink their strategy by having this place within their facility.  It's just another another mid-high priced restaurant with mediocre food...Now you see why this is such a short review...Locals get Happy Hour 24-hours a day!  $1 sliders, $1 wings, and 1/2 off Miller & Coors beer I think.  The best deal out of all of those are the $1 sliders, but they're just your basic mini burgers.The Pub has an extensive beer menu, both a mix of draft and bottle selections.  They also carry unique seasonal bottles (all over $15 per bottle from what I remember).  I need to come back here on a Sunday, since they advertise 1/2 off all beers; not sure if that's just for locals or for everybody.  If you area a Las Vegas local, in the Monte Carlo, looking for cheap nourishment, this may be your best bet.The wife and I stumbled in here, (literally), while drinking our, (my), way through the streets and bars of LV...Was feeling a bit parched so we stopped in here for a cool refreshing beverage, (or two, or four), and a bite to eat while simultaneously taking a break from our financial downfall. (Contrary to popular belief, I cannot live on beer and gambling alone).We both decided on the turkey / avocado clubs and sweet, (and I do mean sweet), potato fries. I started off with a 22 oz. Firestone Walker IPA, (draft of course), and while I've tried it before, it was exceptional... (Maybe it was the buzz???).Our club sandwiches came and they were uber tasty, especially when, (dumbass that I am), I put the marshmallow sauce intended for the fries on it by mistake!!! Seriously, I thought that shit was ranch dressing, but boy am I glad I'm "visionally impaired", lol.Which takes me to the sweet potato fries... Doused in a delectable sugar / cinnamon mix, these babies are friggin' good. Once you dip those little shits in the creamy marshmallow dipping sauce that accompanies them, you have effin' died and gone to heaven!!! Probably went thru a months worth of caloric intake at that bar but I really didn't give flyin' f*ck. I had died on gone to pub bar "food heaven". No need for that swanky a$$, gourmet chef, shit, just feed me beer, (or any other type liquor), and decent pub food and I'm a happy camper.Can hardly wait to try it again...just got to Vegas checked into the hotel and hit this place for lunch.I had the CALIENTE CHICKEN  $16.00Brioche Bun, Pepper Jack Cheese, Grilled Onions, Lettuce, Tomato and Chipotle Mayo.....bland-o-ramamy 2 customers had the CUBANO SANDWICH  12.00$Roasted Pork, Black Forest ham, Pickles, Yellow Mustard and Swiss Cheese they said it tasted like a poor boy more than Cuban cuisine.Basic beers nothing special great atmosphere wish the food tasted as good as it looked.

Review Text :
We came here for happy hour one evening.. 4 stars? Of course we have to check it out..They have happy hour from 4-7. For food we ordered the Bruschetta, and the Melanzane Ripieni. The bruschetta was ok. It was just mainly tomatoes on it. I felt like a slice of cheese with it would've been perfect. It was no meat friday again so these items were perfect. The Melanzane was good. It's baked and filled with eggplant, cheese, zucchini, etc. I felt they could use some more items on their appetizer menu. It's mainly all seafood. Mussels, calamari, scallops etc. For the drinks... I was kind of shocked that they don't have a drink menu. They don't have a regular drink menu, wine menu, or anything. You basically tell them what you want and that's it. The first time, I ordered a Strawberry Martini while my friend got a Cosmo. Then we told our waitress, can you just have the bartender mix up a fruity martini. I'm not sure what was in it, but it was really good! The good news is their martinis are really good and they're a steal! $4! I would really recommend having a drink menu though, maybe throwing some specialty drinks on it along with a wine list and perhaps expanding the happy hour menu with the appetizers. I'd come back for a martini though for a price like that! =)

Had another great lunch at Corbin's today. Couldn't decide between the vegetarian cheese sandwich and the pulled pork... so I compromised: went with the cheese sandwich (sliced tomato, fresh asparagus, red bell pepper, cheddar, Swiss AND queso fresco grilled on sourdough) and fries to dip in a side of BBQ sauce. The asparagus was perfect -- still had a crunch! I sat at the bar, which was just a plain-ole cruel thing to do to myself in the middle of a work day. I swear the Pimm's was staring at me! (Look for me there at 5:03!)After 4 years of dining at Corbin's here are some of my favorites:Their quesadillas are open faced (kinda like a lavosh pizza). Huge, too. At least two people could share one. The Southwestern Pork one is out of this world!Best salad option: Club Salad - Field greens, grilled chicken, tasso ham (a hot-smoked Cajun specialty that's got a cayenne and garlic kick), crumbled blue, hard cooked egg, tomato & avocado. When I'm craving a burger I go for the Carolina Burger: apple-smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, red onion and that awesome house-made BBQ sauce!It's a tie on the chicken sandwiches: Buffalo Chicken Sandwich - GRILLED chicken breast, wing sauce, sautéed celery and blue cheese dressing or the New Orleans Club, a breast of chicken topped with Swiss, tasso ham, tomato, red onion and real mayonnaise. (I can't get enough of that ham!!) Truly, it's tough to go wrong at Corbin's. This place is at the top of my list!Stopped by the other evening with Chrissy P. and Andrew K. after hiking North Mountain, at this point we were ready for a refreshing beverage and something to eat. We chose to sit on the patio since it was such a pleasant evening. Turned out that on Monday's Corbin's special is happy hour menu and pricing is available all night! *Bonus* I sampled the Sesame Crusted Seared Tuna - tasty and delicious with a great combination of flavors and textures. I am looking forward to return visits to sample other menu items.It was a dark and windy Bike Week 09 type of night. After spending most of the evening at West World, surrounded by hot biker boys... I was hungry. I suggested hitting Corbin's for some food and drink. I had never been to Corbin's before and I'm glad we went in for a quick bite. When I opened the door to Corbin's I was hit by a semi-swanky vibe. I was certainly glad I wasn't all "Dirty Harleyed" out. I was more "Harley Hookered" out which, in my mind, is more swanky bar vibe acceptable. We were greeted warmly and seated at a table in full view of a family that was VERY interested in our presence (it could have been my super low cut shirt...hmmm...sorry about that...not really.). I even waved! I love my "adoring" fans who found themselves back to being busy with events at their own table. Anywho... back to the events at my table! After ordering a glass of wine (and being told they were out of my first choice..grr) I finally scored a nice glass of pinot noir. I also went with the grilled cheese sandwich. It wasn't just any ol' grilled cheese, my dear yelpers! This yummy sammie had cheddar, swiss and queso fresco cheese and it was all grilled with thick-cut bacon and a good hunk of tomato. I chose whole wheat for my bread. It was WONDERFUL. The home-cut fries were so good and they have yummy ranch to go along with it! My biker boy chose the Cajun Tasso ham quesadilla. Again... so yummy! The ham was nice and spicy but not HOT, just had some nice seasoning going on. The quesadilla is the size of a small, thin-crust pizza. So it can easily satisfy one person with leftovers to take with them. The whole meal was surprisingly VERY good! I only wish that Corbin's chairs were more comfortable to allow for some serious lounge time. I could imagine myself lounging after a great meal and just soaking in the swanky atmosphere. They have a nice bar area and also have hip music playing in the background. I look forward to another visit to Corbin's. I promise to not come dressed like a Harley Hooker next time... or not.... we'll see! Continue to surprise me, and I might surprise ya back Corbie!My husband and joined a group of Yelpers at Corbin's after the OYE last week.  I had never been there, and was excited to go somewhere new.  Unfortunately, after perhaps one too many at the event, I wasn't at my best for observation of the surroundings.I do know we had excellent service, however.  Although we began arriving after 9 pm (they close at 10), they were happy to push tables together and keep the kitchen open.  They were willing to do separate checks for our large group as well.As for the food, I was honestly so hungry, I didn't spend much time analyzing it.  Everything I tried was tasty though, and I would not hesitate to go back.  Disclaimer:  see first paragraph.

Review Text :
Ian's Pizza for breakfast is now a thing and it's amazing.I love oatmeal and I love Ian's Pizza, but I never thought I'd be eating oatmeal at Ian's Pizza. Indeed, this is what went down this weekend as Ian's opened shop bright and early to introduce to the world their take on breakfast. With a steel-cut oatmeal and yogurt parfait bar, along with nine breakfast pizza options, late night destination Ian's Pizza crosses into new territory as a new destination for the early birds among us.Given Ian's Pizza's affinity for concocting wacky flavor combinations, the intrigue was high for what ingredient pairings would make up their nine breakfast pies. On the day of the breakfast launch, workers were spinning out Denver Omelets, Huevos Rancheros, and Chorizo or Roasted Vegetable Hash, all manifested onto a pizza. With such a loyal adherence to classic breakfast fare, a trip to Ian's in the morning will be just as tasty as or even better than the typical Saturday brunch. And Ian's hasn't forgotten the folks who crave an injection of something sugary for their morning fix. One slice of the sweet Apple Cobbler pizza later and you will forget your usual syrup soaked pancake or French toast needs. The Sweet Potato & Kale pie that I indulged in in my visit to this momentous occasion, left me already declaring Ian's breakfast my new Saturday morning ritual. From the trusty crispness of Ian's crust to the generous layer of cheese, and flavorful additions of sweet potato and seasoned kale, this was a smashing pie. While they're only serving breakfast on Saturdays from 7am-11am, I decided that yes, I will wake up for this.On top of the hearty handful of creative pizza varieties, Ian's is also looking out for those with the more traditional breakfast options on the mind. They've transformed their salad bar into the oatmeal and yogurt station of your dreams. With over 15 topping options, the likes of granola, dried and fresh fruit, and a handful of different nuts, the flavor combos are endless. If you're like me and lacking the creativity this early in the a.m., Ian's will set you up with one of their signature favorites. With a base of Sugar River Dairy yogurt and house-made oats, you really can't go wrong. And however delicious the pizzas are, 'The Mifflin' Oatmeal that I feasted on was what really had me swooning. In this signature flavor, Ian's steel-cut oats are topped off with honey, fresh strawberries, toasted coconut, dried cherries, a splash of almond milk and, wait for it, chocolate chips. The heartiness of the oats acted as the perfect base for this delicious party of ingredients. The almond milk and honey added a delicate sweetness, the strawberries contributed a refreshing taste, and the crunch of the coconut and chewy bite of cherries were both just right. Add a sprinkling of melty, rich chocolate chips to this already beautiful (and ginormous) bowl and you are sitting in oatmeal heaven. Thank goodness Ian's has decided to team up with Just Coffee Cooperative for their breakfast days. This is coffee so great that even sugary latte addicts will prefer to drink it black. Though I am far from a dedicated coffee drinker, I'm able to fall in love with and easily drink a black cup of Just Coffee Cooperative's brews time and time again. There is no bitterness to these roasts and it is amazing. The coffee, the oats, the yogurt, and the pies, Ian's you've done good.

Review Text :
Went in for Sunday Brunch with high expectations.  Without my GPS, I am not sure that we could have found this place!  I wanted to bring my BF here for the mussels and I was in the mood for some spectular waffles!   Sorry to say, it didn't live up to our expectations.  Seating was crapped, service slow and the food was okay.  The moules were nothing special and my waffles were a little cold.  We also shared an omelette which was decent.  I know everyone loves this place.  But I am sure that we will not be making a second trip.Delightful, delectable, de-lovely! Driving up the street I could smell the wonderful aromas before even exiting the car! One of the best dining experiences in Pittsburgh. Walking in I soaked in the busy atmosphere and found the last seat at the bar as we waited to be sat. Pinot Please! We didn't wait long this night.For a starter I ordered the famous moules, they were out of this world! Plump, juicy, tender, and without the often found chewiness. The classic sauce consisted of white wine, shallots, garlic and light cream. I ate all the bread just to sop it up. I don't usually like to get full on filler bread but I couldn't help it. You can also have them prepared with Red curry coconut milk, lime juice, basil and cilantro or tomato saffron, and fennel broth. A-mazing!Intellectual types make the modish community. The whole place hums with wine, brews, food pouring out of the kitchen, and conversation.  It is a minimalistic design but so warm, and cozy as you sit at the candle lit mosaic tables in the huge storefront windows. The twinkling lights in the trees and the starry night seem massive outside, so European. They have more seating such as booths and other tables in the back but I loved where we were placed!My entree came out steaming as I fluffed the perfectly cooked noodles. I decided on the ragu bolognese since I had been craving it from HB's E2 dinner choice awhile back. A rich ragu made of beef, pork, and sweet sausage braised in red wine and herbs had my mouth singing! It's watering so bad right now as I close my eyes and remember it. Oh dang! fasting sucks right now! I had a large to go since I had eaten the bread but I was happy for the lunch a day later. I can't wait to visit again and again.Before traveling to Pittsburgh, I turned -- where else -- to Pittsburgh Yelp.  By a serendipitous stroke of good fortune, another Pitt-bound traveler had started a Talk thread: where do I *have* to eat in the 'Burgh?  The Pittsburgh Yelp community chimed in in droves, and I found myself furiously bookmarking away.  It's how husband and I happened on Salt of the Earth, Prantl's, and Point Brugge among other local musts.  Point Brugge is a tiny little brasserie tucked away in a residential neighborhood between Homewood and Squirrel Hill.  By another serendipitous stroke of good fortune, husband and I timed our arrival so that we were given the best seat in the house, a table for two in the floor-to-ceiling front window with the doors open, overlooking the outdoor tables and the street outside.  The perfect ambiance for what would be a wonderful dinner.  Ordered some Belgian tripels and settled in to enjoy Point Brugge.We started with a bowl of moules frîtes, of course, with red curry, coconut milk, lime, and basil.  The heaping mound of mussels was thoroughly satisfying and meaty, the broth rich and flavorful, the frîtes thin and crisp with a basil mayonnaise dip, and nice, crusty baguette for sopping sauce.  For entrées I had the locally-made, organic tofu bánh mì style sandwich, and husband opted for the charcuterie pork chop.  My sammie had ginger soy marinated tofu, cucumber jalapeño relish, napa cabbage, carrots, basil mayonnaise served on more lovely, crusty baguette with a side of cole slaw.  It was delicious, if a bit one-tone; I was hoping that the relish would pop, but it was hardly noticeable.  And I could have used twice the cabbage and carrot.  The mayo-free slaw was light, crunchy, and a nice complement to the sandwich.  Husband's grilled, bone-in chop came with potato-leek hash, corn and pepper relish, and a homemade pork sausage.  He loved the tender, juicy chop and sausage paired with the cool, vinegary relish.  Everything was priced quite reasonably, too.  We paid no more than $21 for any of the dishes we had the pleasure of noshing.Rounding out an excellent meal was the even better service provided by our server, Flora, as well as the host and the manager.  When I asked Flora what "locally-sourced" tofu actually meant, she went and brought the manager who wrote down the name of the West Virginia-based producer.  Quelle service.Thank you, thank you, Pittsburgh Yelp!  We were steered, again, in a great direction.It's taken me way too long to get here!  Especially with all the rave reviews.  So naturally, you'd have to ask after that statement, did it live up to the hype?  Absolutely!If not for the popularity, you'd never know it was here!  It's amidst a cute little row of houses.  When you walk inside it gives you a homey feel, since it's so tiny inside.  But the food packs a huge punch!It's hard to chose what part of the day you should come here based on how great everything sounded from the reviews.  Since brunch wins me over most of the time, I chose that.  Good thing I was not disappointed in the least!I love me a prix fixe meal because it offers a lot of options.  The prices for these are $19 and $23 depending on what you pick.  I chose the Eggs Benedict, Potato Strudel and Mimosa.  First off, the mimosa was slammin'!  They don't give you a dinky champagne glass, they serve it in a wine glass.  Total win!  Speaking of large and in charge, the loaf of bread my eggs and Canadian bacon sat atop was HUGE!  it was delish and most definitely fresh. The eggs were a fluffy-ness I've never experienced before and the Hollandaise sauce was light and abundant.  I need lots of sauce and it included enough for dipping.The potato strudel was equally as yummy.  It's made with Parmesan sauce that is actually making my mouth water as I type this.  This should for sure be your side dish pic.  Although, I'm sure the other ones are winners as well!  I will note that we didn't have to wait for a table at all, which probably had something to do with particular sports team playing at the same time, our win though!  Our server was incredibly friendly and helped make suggestions on different food items.  The meals came out super fast too.  I was really amazed at how smoothly everything was!  We kept glancing over at other people's dishes ogling what their choices were.  I wouldn't say it was food jealousy, because ours was equally as fab, but everything that came out of the kitchen just looked so darn good!  Of course, I absolutely want to come back and try the mussels.  I will NOT wait too long again...see you there soon!My boyfriend made fun of me for wanting to show up to brunch 20 minutes before Point Brugge opened. Five minutes before opening, like a flash mob, 15 cars pre-parked nearby the establishment opened their doors simultaneously and the line formed for Sunday Brunch behind us. What would follow would be one of the greatest brunch experiences I've ever had.We were seated by Dana - I remember her name because she treated our table of 6 like old friends as soon as she met us. She was quick with the mimosas and the jokes, while also recommending her favorites from the menu.Though a little cramped, it was an intimate experience and can easily sit small groups. The menu is almost entirely European-inspired and incredible. We all ordered something different so that we could try each other's meals - and no one was disappointed. In fact, we all ordered another mimosa and couldn't stop gushing about our awesome meal. I personally got the Baked Brunch Cassoulet and it raises the bar for what I expect from my brunch.This visit also led me to return on a weeknight to explore the dinner menu. I ordered the Mussels, which confirmed that the chef's talents don't just reside in a few dishes but across the menu. Point Brugge is must visit for everyone in Pittsburgh!

GB always a good choice. Gordon Biersch is always a good choice, especially after a day of shopping at Tanger Outlet Mall. GB has a relaxing atmosphere and I admire  the decor on the inside of the restaurant,  with all the subtle references to beer.The server's at GB are always very helpful and take the time to review the menu and explain the various selection of beers offered. The menu at GB is large with a great selection of appetizers.  If you like fries, then you should sample the garlic fries. These fries are addictive, made with fresh pressed garlic, and pair nicely with  beer. If fries aren't for you, then the Blue Crab Artichoke Dip, or Ahi Tuna  is an absolutely must.I enjoyed several of the Marzen Beers and we finished our meal with a delicious Warm Apple Bread Pudding. I look forward to my next visit to GB in the future. The prices are fair,  the menu is appealing, and the customer service is great.

Our server was a horrible, lying bitch, to put it nicely.She didn't greet us at all; the first thing she said was, "What do you wanna drink?" with a bit of an attitude. We saw other tables with baskets of bread, so we asked her if we could also get a basket. Sh straight up told us bread was for the people who ordered from the lunch menu (not us). For some reason, she still brought out a measly basket of bread for us and said that was all that was left -- even though all the other tables had big ass baskets full of all kinds of different bread.When she took our orders, she didn't ask my father how well he wanted his steak, which we didn't realize until his steak came and it was all bloody on the inside. Maybe that's how it's supposed to be prepared, but she could've at least warned my father. I ordered a Strawberry, Raspberry, and Blueberry waffle which was actually really tasty. That was the best part of the meal.Then, she took 20 minutes getting our bill and finishing the transaction. We didn't even know what the hell she was doing. She kept circling the restaurant, going in and out of the kitchen, looking around, going back into the kitchen, and coming out with nothing. It was really unfortunate we were stuck with her cos the other server who was taking care of tables nearby us seemed so attentive, and she just failed upon comparison.And it wasn't just us who thought the service was terrible. The table right next to us were also served by this lazy ass waitress. Apparently, one of the ladies wanted white bread and the server gave her Sourdough. The lady told her it was Sourdough and instead of just apologizing and bringing her white bread, the waitress argued with her and insisted it wasn't Sourdough.  All the lady said was, "Uh, this is Sourdough. Trust me, I ate it," which did the trick. They ended up not finishing the majority of their food and left a $2 tip (for a party of 4), which was hilarious cos you know how expensive food is in Vegas. They didn't follow the "15% tip rule," and neither did we.I wish I remembered the server's name, so you can all avoid her. She seemed to be Hispanic, middle-aged, short, kind of on the large side, with curly brown hair.  I'm sure a lot of people have had great experiences here considering all the positive reviews before mine; they just really need to get rid of her. Never again! Go spend your money elsewhere.Straight up good, resort breakfast for the business traveler at reasonable prices.Side note: Stop reading if your idea of breakfast in Vegas is 15 strips of bacon, a couple scoops of greasy fried country potatoes, and heaping of eggs scrambled in butter and heavy cream finished with a glass of OJ (for that serving of fruit).  Nothing wrong with that, just remember the city's slogan as you're frantically searching for that special room a few hours later.The ambiance is contemporary.  Even the suit clad or dot com urban cowboy totes iPads and iPhones instead of printed WSJ or Financial Times.  Service warm and unobtrusive.  The food; the best breakfast on the Strip.The custard pancakes with vanilla butter and macerated blueberries is outstanding.  Warm, fluffy, and extremely moist.  The pronounced vanilla works so well against the tart berries.  The simple waffle with a warm, fresh fruit compote and the to die for maple mascarpone stays crisp to the very last bite.  Finally the white chocolate raspberry brioche French toast topped with macadamia nuts and frangelico syrup; perfect.  Rich, not too sweet, eggy goodness.Heavier eaters should opt for the incredible in house cured salmon with its melt in your mouth goodness or the smoked pork benedicts.  Pork with eggs and butter is the breakfast of champions right?Portions are very large.  Even the sides are huge.  The bone in ham easily 6oz.  The three strips of extremely thick cut, crispy broiled bacon 4oz.Around $20 per person, a real bargain for the quality and quantity.

This was so close to being a 4 star review until the very end of my time here.  I'm giving it 3 because the food was decent, the beer selection was insane, and its convenient for brew and view.  To see why its not 4 stars read on....I went with my husband on a Friday around 3:30 for their happy hour to get toasty before seeing a movie - a pretty convenient location for that.  When we first got in, I remarked how I couldn't believe there was a woman at the bar with her friend and her infant child in a stroller next to them.  Something I'm not used to seeing but the place was pretty empty at that point so I disregarded it.  (Even though if I came with a baby in a stroller- which I would not-  I would choose to sit at one of the 50 empty tables and not AT the bar, but that's just me.)The place was big and as I said mostly empty, and somehow the hostess still managed to seat us in an area with no waitress.  After eyeing a few of them as they walked by our table to help the tables around us, one finally came over to us - "Is anyone helping you?  I can go figure out who is supposed to be your waitress."  No, you are going to take our order.Like I said, the food honestly was pretty good.  We had the chicken lettuce wraps which had a ton of pine nuts (yum!) and came with three delicious dipping sauces - hoisin, peanut satay, and a sweet and spicy.  We also had the chicken nachos and onion rings which were average.  The onion rings were served with your choice of dipping sauces- ranch or slightly pink ranch.  (I like to call it Ranch Rose)  I would highly suggest they develop a horseradish dipping sauce.  Overwhelmed by the beer selection, my husband asked for a recommendation, saying he usually goes for the lagers, pale ales, and amber ales, and the waitress had no clue what he should get, only that "I remember someone ordering one of the pale ales earlier and didn't like it."  Ok. . .I ordered a rum and coke, seeing as well drinks were supposed to be $4 for the happy hour special.  We got out beverages and I tasted my drink and thought the bartender screwed up and put stoli vanilla in it - my husband tasted it and agreed.  Oh well, I'm not one to complain.  When ordering our second round, I specifically emphasized "ANOTHER RUM and coke."  This time, a bus boy brought our drinks to us and handed me the glass and said "Your Captain and coke."  Here's a lesson to all the waitresses out there - when your special is $4 well drinks and your clientele doesn't specify the brand of alcohol they want, that means "well liquor."  Don't substitute it with "top shelf" liquor (if you can call Captain that) and definitely DON'T substitute regular rum with spiced rum.  "Captain and Coke" is a VERY specific drink.  "Rum and Coke" is not.  It turned from bad to worse when the kid in the booth behind us decided to toss his straw over and it hit me in the head.  I turned and scoured at the table of parents and they shrugged it off and pointed to the kid as if to say, "Oh it wasn't our fault, he was just a kid."  For all the parents reading this, if your children can't behave and you can't control them, don't bring them to happy hour.  It is NOT okay to shrug off bad behavior like that.  If it were my child, I would demand he apologize to whomever he hit.When we got the bill, I was glad to see that I was charged the full price for my "rum and cokes."  Stellar, exactly why I came to happy hour.  As we left, the place had filled in pretty well, and I saw ANOTHER stroller with a baby in it, only this time the parents were just standing around not even in seats or at the bar! (They also had a toddler who was sitting on the floor of the bar area.)  I'm sorry, I'm just appalled.  I've never seen babies saddling up to a bar before.   What if someone accidentally walked by and spilled beer on your baby?!  A bar is not a place for children, I don't care how bad you need a drink and its happy hour.I'm a fan of the Yard House, so when I saw that there was a location at the Desert Ridge Mall, I had to stop by for lunch.  I ordered some Sliders & Fries and a pint of Green Flash IPA:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=sy9P0ShsAXZrv2H-CVje9ghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=9i6Nv0PT-Uye96zJrz8W3Ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=uK60mVysXfTVfvznGgsozghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=4AbpvM3j4KJYChtYIz-SFwThe Sliders & Fries were pretty good.  You get a stack of 4 Sliders and a pile of Fries.  The IPA went down smooth with the meal...yum!Was there during lunch hour on a Saturday, so the wait was short dining at the bar alone.  One of the best things about dining at the bar is that your glass is never empty.....Return Factor - 90%

Review Text :
See profile site for full review with formatted pics.Chatting on his Vertu in a strange language (something arabic I believe) I couldn't help but notice my neighbor's Constantin Patrimony Series watch flashing in the sunlight of Tableau's patio...clearly there was money around. When the waiter arrived to refill his water and asked if he could get the check the man pulled out a money clip, peeled off two $100 bills and said "that should cover it" before getting up and walking away...the man had ordered a fruit plate. Tucked away in the gardens and pools of the Wynn Tableau is both rich and beautiful in appearance, much like its patrons. Sure I didn't expect low quality from Steve Wynn, but to say the clientele of Tableau was "well to do" would be a vast understatement.Arriving at 7:45am I was greeted by the gorgeous lobby and the gracious hostess who asked whether I would prefer dining indoors or on the patio. As the patio was amply shaded and most of the patrons were outside I chose the patio and was subsequently offered a copy of the Wallstreet Journal, New York Times, or USA Today to browse. Seeing the headlines regarding the USC upset, I opted for the USA Today (clearly indicating my status compared to the rest of the diners who sat browsing the Times or Journal) and chose a wonderful table half sunny/half shaded with a great view of the pool and gardens. Water was filled and the menu was delivered while the waiter went to get my coffee.Browsing the menu I was instantly captured by the pastry basket and the Peach pancakes, but not being hungry enough for both decided to ask the waiter what was available in the basket. Approximately 10 items were rattled off including an apricot tart, apple scone, and nectarine turnover. When I asked if pastries could be ordered individually it was explained that these were 'petite' pastries and if I wanted to try only one it would be free of charge. "A nectarine turnover and the peach pancakes, please." "Certainly, sir."While I waited for my food I stood up and roamed the pools and gardens. Approximately 20 people were present at the time, all dressed either business casual or semi-formal and all dining on items ranging from the freshest appearing fruits to pastries to eggs and sausage that looked incredible. When I returned to my table (my tableau?) my coffee was waiting along with cream and sugar/spelda/equal. No nutrasweet was to be seen and when asked I was informed "Mr Wynn does not fancy nutrasweet." Fair enough (for what it is worth, Alex also didn't have Nutrasweet but noted they could obtain it immediately if I desired.)After approximately 10 minutes a fantastic yet dainty apricot turnover arrived fresh from the oven. Crispy, flaky, loaded with fresh nectarines it was the perfect opener to the meal and I'd have certainly enjoyed many more had I ordered the basket. Another 10 minutes and a laugh at the Trojans passed, my coffee was refilled once, and then my pancakes emerged from the kitchen.Described in the menu as Ricotta Peach Pancakes with lime butter and organic maple syrup, nothing could've prepared me for these pancakes. Fluffy and light, airy yet moist, sweet yet savory and absolutely jammed with fresh skinned peaches, the dish was presented with a simple dusting of powdered sugar, a side-pitcher of warm syrup, and a dollop on the side that tasted like a fresh key lime dissolved in butter. Having tried Ricotta Pancakes only once before but any number of stellar pancakes in the past, this dish was a revolution and I truly sat and savored each bite. Sure, $14 for three pancakes is not a bargain, but $14 for breakfast bliss? That is a bargain.When I finished my pancakes and resisted the urge to lick my plate clean my waiter arrived and asked if he could get me anything else. "Perhaps a coffee to go?" "....don't twist my arm....how about another turnover too?" "Certainly, sir." While I didn't tip $185 like my neighbor, I certainly wish I could have.On my way out everyone was very friendly, from the other waiters to the hostess, making each guest feel like their visit was truly valued. I was even invited to return for dinner, but when I told the hostess we had reservations for Alex that evening she noted "oh, excellent choice, perhaps some other time." All told the meal was fantastic and on par with Bouchon in terms of quality, presentation, and service. Go early, sit on the patio, eat, smile, and enjoy the richness of the food and the clientele...even if you yourself aren't rich...sometimes it's fun to see how the upper crust lives.Regardless of where you are on Saturday, this is definitely the place to be on Sunday! Well, for brunch that is.From the relaxing views of the well manicured gardens to the elegant dining atmosphere, no detail is overlooked at this posh "English tea party" inspired restaurant. The brew here is eye opening and the OJ is freshly squeezed. Small details IMO that make the dining experience that much more enjoyable. In this day and age, we all know little things do mean a lot!In regards to the brunch fare, I was pleasantly surprised with both the quality and flavor. You can tell the execution was performed with distinction & care.Although the white chocolate French toast was the claim to fame here, I was hooked by the pictures of fluffy blueberry pancakes on my iPhone Yelp app. Suffice it to say, I was not disappointed at all. It was as fluffy and soft as I expected. I would have preferred more fresh blueberries, but with all things considered,  it was still quite a treat. Especially when I drizzled a generous amount of that warm maple syrup on top and watched it cascade down each thick layer of divine, doughy goodness!However, the highlight of the meal had to be the Duck Croque Madame. I'd even venture out to say that it's the single best thing I've ever had for brunch thus far in Vegas! Topped with a fried egg (now how can that be wrong?!) this French sandwich was packed with mouthwatering deliciousness!  From the perfectly tender morsels of duck that tasted like it was slow roasted for hours, to the melted Gruyere and caramelized onions (reminiscent of a french onion soup), it was like a virtual foodgasm in my mouth!So there ya have it, pleasant atmosphere, beautiful views, and incredibly good food.  What more could you ask for? That's right, seconds!Happy Eats!A group of 5 girls wandered in here for brunch after a long night. We were told to wait for them to set up our table. We waited, and waited, and waited. And the place was empty! Finally we walked back over to the host stand and pretty much demanded to be seated. Things weren't off to a great start. We browsed the menu and ordered several items for the table. I thoroughly enjoyed my salmon Benedict. An egg white omelet was also a success. The lobster fritatta was thoroughly disappointing as was their homemade ketchup. The granola with greek yogurt was quite good. Food came out quickly, which everyone appreciates after a long night. Overall, the food was decent enough to return but the service is what was a bit annoying. Especially considering how empty it was. Five hosts were standing around doing nothing.Tableau is a very open and inviting restaurant. The one thing we enjoyed about Tableau is their outside seating and the weather was perfect for having brunch outside. The seating arrangements are done well, you're not close to your neighbors and can enjoy your meal freely. Service was efficient and fast. We never had to ask for our drinks to be refilled and they made sure our coffee was filled which was real nice.The first order was museli. It was made with cinnamon and small strips of apples. You are served with milk, brown sugar, etc. The museli was soft and tasty. The aroma of the cinnamon was enticing. We enjoyed the museli quite a bit.We ordered the lemon ricotta pancake.....need I say more? It was gooood! If it was a short or full stack, we would have eaten it in a hot second. The hint of lemon was perfect and the ricotta added a very nice texture to the pancake. It was served warm and moist. We didn't even use the butter or the maple syrup.  Next order was their benie! They make their benies 3 ways and we chose the most basic one. It had cured ham, poached egg, and a nice sauce to which we requested be put on the side. I still enjoy Mon Ami Gabi's benie more but Tableau was good.Overall, Tableau was a good surprise. We will be back for more in the near future!My best dining experience in Vegas thus far. I loved everything about Tableu, the ambiance, the service and the food was all 5 star quality for me. Is it expensive? Yes, but have you been to Vegas lately? Everything is expensive. This one however was worth every penny. We walked on a busy Saturday morning for brunch, a large group and our wait was about 30-40 min. We were seated indoors, due to the cold. Our server Georgina really took care of us, she answered all of our questions and really tended to us the whole two and a half our we were seated there. The food? AMAZeeeee! What I tried? Their fresh juices, the Bloody Mary, the intelligentsia coffee, the steak Benedict and the duck hash. The duck hash was perfectly combined with a creamy cheese sauce inside of a puff pasty  topped with eggs any style you want. The steak Benedict had decadent crab meat hidden underneath which complimented the steak and bernaise sauce beautifully!This was an amazing meal I will cherish forever and I cannot wait to go back to the Wynn to enjoy this amazing meal again. Oh did I mention they have a little cushion for your purse! This place is a must try, please try it, you will not be disappointed!Looking for a serene location to have breakfast, my friend and I decided to dine at Tableau. While the food was decent, the service was not up-to-par to that of other restaurants at Wynn. With the exception of several carb-heavy dishes, the food at Tableau was overpriced for its quality. Although I liked the fact that my butternut squash soup was not too sweet, I was not a fan of the stale almonds in it. The Greek yogurt was light and went well with the berries. While the orange zest juice was refreshing, its portion was small compared to its competitors like MOzen. At the same time, my friend greatly enjoyed the Duck Croque Madame - the duck meat was very tender and juicy, while the croissant was warm and flaky. In terms of service, the waitress was unfriendly and only stopped by our table once after she took the order. She also forgot about one of our dishes until I reminded her in the end of the meal. Since the restaurant is always packed, I definitely recommend Yelpers to make reservations in advance. My friends and I plan to give Tableau another try and order its famous pancakes in our next visit."Proper" is the word that comes to mind when I think of Tableau. It doesn't hold a negative connotation, but the space definitely is reminiscent of an English tea party. Servers were prompt and attentive and very, very proper, and the setup of the sunlit room was classy and elegant. Trio of fresh juices: Red Deliciousness, Purify, Orange Zest:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zdiMak6UuWRV5AlvsB8_7A&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)I was unfortunately allergic to one or more of the fruit mixes in these juices, but the other members of my party verified that these juices were definitely freshly-pressed. They also mentioned that these are healthy and do taste it, so if that's not your cup of tea, maybe go for.. actual tea.. Cream of cauliflower soup:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=FdKXwBSOKe2aBqpIBQvKKQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)Per proper preparation, this soup was served via pouring at the table. It was thick, gloopy, and luke. warm. I had one sip and was so disappointed in the lukewarm temperature that it immediately became a miss in my book. I did appreciate the bits of toasted cauliflower and creaminess of the soup, but any soup that is lukewarm is a lost cause for me.Chicken noodle soup:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nC5Jo6HDz4I6RpLxP2jkrw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)The temperature of this soup was slightly warmer than that of the cream of cauliflower, but it was still far from hot. The noodles were slightly overboiled, and the broth was too salty for my taste. Duck hash and eggs:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=StJ8amQAT9SBTS11CtBhMQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)The puff pastry on the bottom was rolled beautifully; it was flaky and melt-in-your-mouth despite being a little oily (as puff pastries can be expected to be). The duck hash was seasoned well, although I didn't get too much of a duck taste, and the egg balanced out the slight saltiness of the hash. I also enjoyed the roasted fingerling potatoes, as they added a cozy mealiness to the dish. White chocolate orange french toast:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mbPZyByuEpY0N7WRm4v9RA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)I love french toast, and I always itch to try it whenever I see it on any menu. After reading the rave reviews about the white chocolate orange french toast here, I was practically salivating even ordering it. When it was served, the presentation was beautiful and I was expecting it to taste as wonderful as it looked.. but it fell really short of expectation. The two pieces of bread were incredibly dry, and despite the beautiful browning of egg on each side, there was no egginess. I did get the orange flavor, but none of the white chocolate (and I prefer white chocolate to orange). Even plentiful syrup could not offset the dryness of the toast, and this dish was a crestfallen disappointment to me. It's possible it was just a fluke, but then it'd be a huge fluke.Filet Oscar benedict with beef tenderloin, poached eggs, blue crab, and housemade sourdough muffin:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=b4ZzfgTgNOQOMfyKJ9zabQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)I thought the pairing of beef tenderloin and blue crab was interesting, and it worked to a degree. The blue crab meat was slightly cold, as if it had just come out of the refrigerator, but the beef tenderloin was cooked a nice medium rare. The poached eggs had model runny centers, although the hollandaise sauce was a bit too watery for me. There was a lot going on with this one dish, and it's definitely something to dig into when ravenous rather than as an ending entree. I have mixed feelings about Tableau, but I'd be open to coming back for a second brunch visit.

Review Text :
My girlfriend and I decided to ride our bikes down to Coca Cafe and get some breakfast. Once we arrived we were told there would be a 10 minute wait.A lot of people keep repeating that the service here is bad. I guess I can see where they are coming from if you're a pretty high strung person who is used to being in and out of a restaurant and fed as soon as you sit down. The Coca Cafe is not this place and it's really obvious. It's a pretty small cafe and you're going to have to deal with a little bit of waiting. The owner, or at least what I thought was a manager of some sort did not seat a group of two while we were waiting because the rest of their party was not there. This is a simple rule and it allows people who are ready and on time to get a seat. In a place as small as Coca Cafe you can't afford to seat half of a party while they wait however long for the rest of their people. This might be considered "rude" to people but it's born of necessity. The "customer is always right" mantra is not universally accepted at every establishment you patronize.Anyway, with that out of the way. We were seated in less than 10 minutes and ordered two omelets. I had the wild mushroom omelet (shiitake and portabello) with Jarlsberg cheese, a side of grilled potatoes, and pumpernickel toast. My girlfriend had the tomato, feta, and pesto omelet. I got an orange juice with my water which was definitely freshly squeezed and delicious.After a little bit of a wait (see my earlier rant) we got our food which was amazing. The omelets were full and incredibly hardy. The mushrooms were fresh and springy with a tiny bit of crunch to them. The Jarlsberg cheese was so mild that I forgot it was in there at first; you can choose from two different cheeses so next time I think I'll try the other cheese to see if it is less subtle. The egg was cooked just right, a little crispy brownness on the edges and fluffy everywhere else. Nowhere in the omelet did I find raw yolk which I absolutely hate. The potatoes were cooked through and crispy on the outside, seasoned to perfection.I agree with Teresa T, LOVE the environment but the food....it's just OK.  I've been to this place on a couple different occasions and tried their lunch selections (sammies, salads, etc.) and I've always been underwhelmed.  The surprising thing is that people rave about it!  So when this place came up for brunch plans I decided to give it another try.  I had heard the brunch was the best part so I was cautiously optimistic.  I hadn't been here in a while and what I will say is I LOVE LOVE LOVE the renovations.  The bright red paint and the funky artwork really makes this place pop.  So bravo for whoever designed this.  I sat outside on the side of the building, which I never realized was there.  It was so cute and quaint.  I just really love everything about the atmosphere.  I SO wish I could say that about the food.  I love me some almonds and almond flavored meals, so I tried the Almond French Toast.  Sadly, again I was underwhelmed.  When I imagine french toast I want a puffy thick piece of toast.  This came on a flat thin baguette.  Not a fan.  It was drizzled in lemon sauce and had almonds and fruit sprinkled on top.  I could hardly taste the almond flavor over the lemon drizzle.  Was almond extract even used in the egg mixture?  That's what I would have liked.  I wouldn't be opposed to coming here but maybe I'll just pick up a chai latte and enjoy the great atmosphere instead of the food.  So the search is on for some slammin' almond french toast!I have been meaning to try out Coca Cafe for some time now, and my friend brought me here for an end of the semester brunch celebration.  Yay for finishing my first year of graduate school!There is no atmosphere to Coca Cafe, which I would have expected from the hipster-ish menu.  It's what I would refer to as upscale Yinzer atmosphere.  The tables are too close together so people will continuously run into you, and there will be children screaming at the tops of their lungs while their parents ignore them.  However, there are some really unique food options and the servers are pleasant enough.I ordered an omelette with pesto, tomatoes, and feta.  It was presented very prettily, and there was a cute orange slice to give it some more color.  I wouldn't order this again necessarily, as it was too salty for my taste.  I did enjoy it, but I would prefer to try something else next time.  My friend got shrimp grits, which she raved about.Overall, I totally prefer Coca Cafe to Square Cafe is Regent Square, and I would say that is the closest equivalent.

Review Text :
I was looking forward to my dining experience at Roosters but was greatly disappointed. Though I had a reservation, I had to wait 15 minutes for my table. The bar was full and it was raining so I was forced to stand in the doorway as they have no designated waiting area. The atmosphere was far too noisy to hold a conversation. The waitress did her best sales job and told me about the beautiful scallops that looked like "toasted marshmallows" when they came from the oven. She didn't tell me that they were miniature marshmallows, three of them to be exact. For $18.00 I got three scallops with no sides. The best part about the meal was the steamed green beans ($5 extra) and the bottle of wine. Hard to mess those up. I came home, made a sandwich and crossed Roosters off of my places to eat in Charlotte.Date night was a success because I chose Rooster's.Great attentive service, though the waiter was a little touchy feely. I guess that's how he likes to interact with his customers, touching shoulders and such. Odd, but not odd enough to say anything.We opted to skip appetizers and went right to the mains. My wife chose the roasted duck breast which she said was excellent. Very moist, very tasty, truly delicious. I chose the half barbecue chicken and it was awesome. Super moist, very tangy, really easy to eat with knife and fork. Yum and a bunch of it went home.For sides, we chose three veggies to share - roasted beets, Yukon puree (really, mashed potatoes) and steamed spinach. All were great.No dessert today. I should have saved room for that coconut cake.

Iguana Macks can be a great reality check. If anything, it will remind you how suburbanites in the rest of the country get down. Take any themed tropical bar, ala Rainforest Cafe, that you might find in Bakersfield or Indianapolis, and throw in a dancefloor and some Buck Hunter - and ta da - you have Iguana Macks!We found ourselves here after a cornhole tournament died down a few neighborhoods away. This place is quite the mob scene on weekends and feels as if half of the singles in Gilbert and Chandler are up in here wearing their evening best -- whether it be from Wet Seal for the ladies or guys sporting black/white caps over their brows ensembles from TapOut. So you have a few choices:* Try to engage in some mind-numbing small talk with the regulars.* Be among the first (because no one else in the club is drunk enough) on the dancefloor to the local band doing mid-90s alt rock covers.* Or hide in the corner with your friends, and avoid everyone while sharpen your Buck Hunter skills.We tried those three options in exactly that order until we couldn't take it anymore.Pet Peeve #1 - When Yelper's give an establishment a bad review based solely on service issues alone without staying to eat. If you didn't even eat the food then are you really entitled to write a scathing review? ...knowing this...I'm about to piss myself off and break my own rule...because I'm going to do the exact thing I hate; as described above. Damn me. My brother and I went out on a week night a while ago for some reverse happy hour grub, and just so happened to cruise by this place. Upon seeing the uber-cool iguana wearing sunglasses on the sign which instantly reminded me of those cool 80's IZOD shirts, we knew we had to stop. Sadly, upon entering the place just had this grimy look and feel to it, the kind of feel you get when you stop at a Dairy Queen in some one horse town on the way to Vegas. The experience that followed is summarized below: -We park and enter the front door. -There is no hostess or visible employee anywhere. -We wait for a few minutes trying to figure out what to do. -Still no employees around...we wander the whole place...and to our shock do not find a single waiter/waitress/hostess/bartender/cook anywhere. -We go back to the front room, standing there confused about what we should do. -Wait five minutes. -Walk around again...still not a single employee of Iguana Macks to be found anywhere. -Leave to find a better establishment...in this case...Applebees. (Which is saying a lot because I hate Applebees.) ...can someone explain how a restaurant/bar like this can be devoid of any/all employees around 10 o'clock? I was tempted to go and ask one of the inebriated bar patrons, but it just didn't seem worth the hassle. I would have liked to try Iguana Macks; but sadly wasn't given the chance. It shouldn't be a challenge to eat somewhere...an establishment should be courting you for your business, and this was the complete opposite. Now the bigger question is this...where were the employees? Some of my theories: -An all at once employee weed smoking break -They were transported to an alternate timeline and are now living in a parallel universe where they work for a classier restaurant. Kind of like 'Lost' for wait staff. -Employee Orgy ...eh, who knows...but I'm just not too jazzed about going back to try this place. It left a bad taste in my mouth and I didn't even have any of the food; that's saying something.Not my favorite spot. It looked promising walking in, there was live music, but too loud so decided to eat inside. Each food and drink  item we ordered was disappointing. This included wings, and some kind of Asian tacos, and a handful of mixed drinks.  Service was pretty bad as well. Our initial server never came back to check on us after our order was taken.  We  had to flag down other servers walking by each time we wanted something. Probably won't be back anytime soon.

Review Text :
I've heard it multiple times from the Terri R and Alicia R.  Sumo is one of their favorite places for sushi.  And for them, it's all about the Lion Roll and Screaming Orgasm (Sashimi). Both of the Twins also claim that they haven't found a place out here that can make the Lion Roll as good as Sumo.  I'll just take their word for now. I've driven by this place a handful of times and with Blue Fin just around the corner, I never had the opportunity to eat here.  I got that opportunity recently when TR and AR invited me for a dinner with their co-workers.  No way I'm turning down food.  No way I'm turning down sushi.  No way I'm turning down food and sushi with my favorite twins.  This restaurant is located in the Henderson area off Sunset and Green Valley.  The restaurant itself is averaged sized, quiet, and the staff is amazing.  When I first walked in, the staff greeted me with a smile and started flexing their muscles.  Not sure what that meant at the time.  I assumed it meant that I better workout after eating here because eat is what I'm going to do. I had their Garlic Tuna Sashimi and Yellowtail Nigiri. The Yellowtail Nigiri is a little bigger than most and taste is about the same with most.  My nigiri was fresh and I didn't have a problem finishing it.  Now for the main event...their Garlic Tuna Sashimi.  First of all, no one warned me about the size of this dish.  I thought I was getting about 5 slices of tuna.  What I got had to be 15+ pieces of sashimi.  If I knew this, I wouldn't have ordered the nigiri.  This was so good, so fresh, and for tuna not fishy at all.  Texture was perfect, simply rolled down my throat and into my belly.  I tried to share, but everyone got their own dishes.  Next time I know better, this is a dish for two.  But don't worry, I still finished it on my own. Am I a fan?  I can't speak for the rest of the menu.  All I can say...it's all about their Garlic Tuna Sashimi.  Garlic Tuna Sashimi:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mcacEQbVaYaqExhwXZxG_w&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQYou Need These:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jVQBoohYcI0JVFCU-4ubYA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQYellowtail Nigiri:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=apQNpR8bhs5VdTuEm_38MA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQI feel like this place should be rated in WTF's instead of stars because if I was rating in WTF's this place would have like, the highest score of all time.I went in with a pretty large group at lunch time and my they were eager to eat all of the sushi. So it's not like we were wasting their time. I mean, lunch time... restaurant... hungry people: It all made perfect sense!We waited several minutes to be acknowledged. WTF? Once the hostess came out of the back we noticed she was on the phone. WTF? Amazingly, she looked at us and went away again without acknowledging us. WTF?When she came back she was still on the phone. Really? WTF.Then she pointed and grunted towards the dinning room. WHILE STILL ON THE PHONE. Seriously?We sat and she gave us one menu. ONE. There were 5 of us. We had to ask for more menus when we saw her again. She was still on the phone, and without a word she went and grabbed like 2 more menus and kind of threw them at us. WTF? I can't believe that was even real life.At this point we were all just madly uncomfortable. Like what if we wanted to ask her for something more complicated than a menu... like SUSHI? She was still on the phone when we walked out and barely glanced at us. WTF.I guess I can't say anything about the food because I was too busy WTFing to order any. But I definitely wouldn't go back so it doesn't matter if the food is the best. If I want service this terrible I can eat at home where my private cook is NEVER around.That is like 8 WTF's in the condensed version of this story. That is like 1 WTF/ minute for this place! Great job!One of the ol' school sushi joints in Vegas, these guys are doing an OK job. I was told by one of the owners that they were the originators of what is known as "Las Vegas sushi" I can neither confirm nor deny this claim.Came here with a bunch of peoples who were on the lookout for some AYCE sushi. After we came in, we were shown to our seats in which they used banquet chairs. The tables are a little smallish for 4 peoples but we were able to squeeze in. I had to hold my breath.Now off to the AYCE. Everything was good, some standouts include the tuna karai, the coconut shrimp which tasted like TGIFridays version, and salmon kama.One thing though the service was inconsistent. Sometimes they were thoughtful, other times, I had to flag down a server several times to refill our water.Another note, the portion size was a little bit too big for AYCE. Normally, I complain when a business is too stingy. But for AYCE, I wish they were smaller so that I could of had a chance to try the nigiri, and other rolls. I would come back here as a fallback in case bluefin was too packed. But it is what it is, so next time take care of yourself.. And each other.

Review Text :
Trying to find a Sushi place that is open for lunch on Saturday was tough but we did find Sushi Ken. We were served complimentary miso soup and edamame. Their sushi picture menu had a lot going on so it was hard to decide, we ended up getting an avocado roll, a vegetable roll, a crunchy roll and a tempura fried California roll. I wasn't really paying attention to the sushi being made because I was busy eating my soup and edamame. All our rolls looked good but sadly, not tasting all that great. The seaweed was so chewy, the Crunchy Roll is advertised as using snow crab but it was obviously mixed with Krab as well, not to mention what tasted to me like a gallon of Miracle Whip, it was soooooo gross!! The Avocado roll was the best one despite the chewy seaweed, the deep fried roll was just gross too, definitely made with a roll that was quite possibly rolled days ago and the vegetable roll was just OK, it had a strange mix of veggies inside, I don't even know what they were. Now another couple walk in and sit near us at the sushi bar and I was able to see the sushi being made since I was done eating. Sure enough, I see the chef grab pre-made rolls from across the counter and top it with fish for a rainbow roll. GROSS! There is no reason why these rolls could not be made fresh to order. Now on to an even bigger surprise, you know how they usually grab a piece of seaweed and a hand full or rice and begin to work it onto the seaweed........ I saw the chef grab a piece of seaweed and take it down behind counter for literally 1/4 of a second and come back up with it covered with the pressed rice WTF!!! Their rice and seaweed it also pre-made not wonder it was so damn chewy! I would rather wait and wait for freshly made sushi any day than be served soggy chewy old  pre-made Crap! Seriously I'll never go here again!!I could only imagine how bad the service in a restaurant could be, until I visited Sushi Ken with my family on 8/12/2012 for lunch.   The waitresses who served our table, (I really wish I knew her name, she is the taller / older one, and with *less* Japanese accent),  she performed the worst service I have ever seen, it was as if she did everything in the purpose of offending customers.(1) Our party was 6 adult and 3 kids occupying 3 tables putting together, when she came over to take order, I was sitting at the far end of tables and I told her "we are ready to order", she said "That's what I am here for." and just stood still there, I had to raise my voice to finish ordering for everyone with her.  I mean, I was the one who's talking and couldn't she just move a few steps toward me ?(2) We ordered some sushi rolls and 5 complete meals, she told us we will get 5 appetizers and asked if we want salad or Edamame, we said 3 salad's and 2 Edamame's, and they were served, no problem here.Later on she brought over 4 bowls of miso soup.  I think it is quite normal that you would expect 5, right ?  I asked her "Shouldn't it be five?"  Guess what?  SHE ASKED ME: "WHY?"  Oh my god, she asked me back "WHY" and then we went totally silence waiting for me to find out the answer by myself,.  It took me about 10 seconds to guess and said "is it because one of our meals only comes with appetizer but not soup ?",  then she have me a "uh -ah" and walked away.  Are you serious ??(3) After we had our fried rice and curry beef delivered, we looked around for spoon and not finding any on our tables, I waved her over and said that we need spoons for eating THIS fried rice and THAT curry rice.  I even pointed at these two plates because I was already afraid of mis-communication.Then she brought over "one" spoon!!  1, o-n-e, single, uno !!I told her again that we needed two, she stared at me as if saying "Why didn't you tell me clearly you want two?"  Hey, I told you we need it FOR THE FRIED RICE AND THE CURRY RICE !!  IT IS YOUR PROBLEM serving plates that need spoons and not bring spoons with them, not my problem.(4) After that moment I think her attitude turned from "not friendly" to "rude", when she brought over my noodle, SHE THREW THE BOWL WITH NOODLE SOUP TO MY HANDS, can you believe that !?  She delivered the noodle to my hands, not to my table !!  What if I did not catch it ??She definitely had gone over my edge at that time, if I were not with my parents and kids, I would have exploded right away, it was my family that saved a confrontation from happening right there. (5) The food is plain, actually after all of the above happening, I didn't care about the food anymore even it was 5-star quality.  After the kids were fed, I waved her a couple times for check and I don't know if she overlooked me deliberately or she really didn't see me, after about 5 minutes I walked over to the cashier's stand and asked her "Can we have the check, please?".  YES I SWEAR TO GOD THAT I STILL USED THE WORD 'PLEASE' TO HER.   She did not bother to raise her head or even speak up, she just keep doing what she is doing, and nod her head.   At that time I immediately told myself two things:(1). I am not stepping into this restaurant ever again in my life, and(2). I will do whatever it takes to let the store manager know what happened today, or let the store owner (if she happens to be the manager).  Having this kind of employee is definitely hurting the business !*** To that waitress ***.If you do not like providing service, then don't do this job.  I am not expecting you to show any passion, if this is just a source-of-income for you; but you need to have some basic manner and attitude and respect if you put 15% gratuity on my bill.  If I wasn't forced to pay that, you were not getting ANY tip from me because you do not deserve any.I'm warning you already, I am very grumpy in this review. More than usual. I am a very lenient Yelper most of the time. This one isn't going to be a pretty one.Oh man. I was really looking forward to this meal. Having to drive 30min for the highly-recommended Sushi Ken? It'd be worth it, right? I had even skipped lunch in the hopes to be famished and love every bite of the dinner even more than normal.:( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( It was the worst Japanese food I've ever had.I had the Beef Curry and Tonkatsu Ramen combination with a salad. The salad was colorless and wilted, and the dressing (I love Japanese dressing), was overly vinegar-tasting. The Beef Curry was ok, but I make better Japanese Curry at home using the curry cubes in the boxes sold at supermarkets. The Tonkatsu Ramen....should not have been called such. The ramen tasted worst than instant ramen! It was mushy! There was no taste in the broth of marrow-y goodness. It was a salty, lifeless broth with shriveled bamboo shoots, too much wakame, and one measly thin slice of charsiu. I had about 4 bites and left the rest to die. I didn't even take it home to try to remedy it.My husband had the Tempura Bowl and Shoyu Ramen combination with an Edamame side.The edamame was the grayest-green shade I'd ever seen. Frozen edamame from the supermarket looked better than that! His tempura bowl was bizarre...gone was the flaky, crunchy Panko breading. What was brought out was a glazy, weirdly crusted abomination that was overly sweet. I would like to dip my tempura myself, thank you very much. His Shoyu Ramen was terribly salty. My husband even likes things very salty, and he couldn't drink it. He also left 90% of his bowl untouched. The only thing they didn't mess up was their California Roll, which is pretty impossible to mess up so thank goodness for that. And the service? Terrible. Absolutely terrible. We were a table of 9, and they could have cared less. The 15% was already included in the bill, so maybe that's why they didn't even bother to try to be nice to us. The ladies were so mean! It looked like they just hated everyone they were serving! And usually Japanese waiters are SOOOOO nice. I know, cause I used to wait tables alongside co-workers who had just immigrated from Japan.Funny thing is, the rest of the table really enjoyed their food. (Update: One of them messaged me after reading this review to tell me she actually didn't like the food...lol I guess my husband and I were not the only ones that didn't enjoy it) Nobody enjoyed the service though, I can assure you of that lol.I live in Los Angeles and I come out to AZ every other month. I have been to Sushi Ken many times, and every time I have had terrible service. This last visit was the last straw. The girl who was our server approach us with such a poor attitude and a sour look on her face. Needless to say, we tried not to ask her for much. At the beginning of our order, I notified her that I will need to place a to go order toward the end of the meal. She walked by our table many times, while our water glasses were empty, she never once stop to ask us if we needed anything or just fill our water glasses. I then asked her nicely, that when she had a chance, could we get some more water. She then said, "don't you need to place an order to go?" I said "yes, but when you bring the water, we can do it then". She walked over, slammed a pitcher of water on the table and then walked away. I proceeded to serve our table the water, then walked over to the register to place my to go order and pay my bill.I have never in my life stiffed a waitress. However, in this case it was necessary. The waitress followed me out to the parking lot and asked me where I had left the tip. I told her that expecting a tip for NOT doing your job is not the way it goes. T.I.P. means "To Insure Promptness" and since I did the job for her, she did not deserve a tip.The unfortunate thing, is that the sushi is actually good and affordable. I might suggest take-out for this place.You can't buy happiness but you can buy ramen and sushi and that's kind of the same thing.Le grr.  I was hoping to start the new year off with a 5-star worthy meal!  At least it's not as bad as the Japanese-Mexican fusion place I went to earlier this week.  Yikes.  Anyways, met up with the in-laws today to celebrate my sister-in-law's milestone birthday.  I have never been here before so I jumped onto Yelp last night to see what would catch my eye.  Since it's been pretty chilly due to the winter storm, I was leaning towards ramen.  It ended up being a safe choice after seeing and tasting a little bit of what everyone ordered.I ordered the Miso Butter Ramen with the Deluxe Dragon Roll on the side.  My ramen came with either salad or edamame and three California rolls.  I should have checked the tips on Yelp because I chose the edamame thinking the warm soybeans would help warm me up as we were seated under the only ceiling fan that appeared to be running.  It was cold and old and I ended up sliding it over the Mr. W. who had a very gross salad.  The California rolls are basic so it's nothing to write home about.  The ramen was satisfying.  Although the noodles seem to be the store-bought variety, I enjoyed the flavor of the miso broth immensely.  Paired with the butter that made the soup base creamy and coat my mouth with a wonderfully richness, I was pretty happy --- even with the hard-boiled egg [I was hoping for a soft-boiled egg].  I wish they had corn instead of bamboo shoots in their ramen but that's just all personal preference.  The chashu in my ramen was also nothing special.  The Deluxe Dragon Roll is a fancified dragon roll with the addition of cream cheese and tempura shrimp.  I also got to try some sashimi that didn't seem all too fresh, a cold lovely-dressed jellyfish salad, and other little bites.Service was a little lacking but it's understandable since it was super busy.  It was a full-restaurant for the two hours we were there.  If I ever stop in again, I think I want to try their udon.I came here for dinner last night and finally remembered why I didn't come back here for more than 5 years.Sushi ken's menu is so extensive. They serve almost anything Japanese. I had chance to try variety of food in the past including ramen, sushi, tempura, donburi, curry, grilled fish to name a few.They are not bad, I am sure one can find similar quality restaurant in Japan. For me they all tasted like cafeteria type food. Cafeteria food serves its purpose and they are there to please diverse people.It's just such a drive for me to visit, unless I am already in the area, I don't think I would make an effort to drive there just to eat their food. Thus being said, if you are in the area, and with picky person or not sure what to eat, this place is a good option to visit.

Review Text :
French food in Plaza Midwood? Sure, sounds great - let's give it a go!Hubs and I rolled into Lulu quite literally at 5 pm...hoping for an early bird special. Well, not really, but we were the only customers in the restaurant. That being said, our service was just peachy. Inside Lulu is quite adorable, albeit a bit nondescript. For a French eatery I was expecting more Parisian flair, but instead Lulu is charming, quaint and comfortable. The menu is pretty diverse - everything from mussels, to calamari, to pork. They also have a great wine list with some fabulous French wines. We had plenty of time and attention to choose a smattering of inspired dishes, I samples the: Calamari, French Onion Soup, Mimosa salad and Chocolate Bread Pudding. First off, the calamari was delectable! It's lightly fried and accompanied by the tastiest "Asian love sauce", which is a conglomerate of a myriad of spices...I'm thinking Chinese 5-spice? The portion was plenty for two of us and it also comes with an Asian slaw. Mmmm!Hubs ordered the French Onion Soup for an appetizer, which I promptly dug my spoon into. Taaaasty! Real Gruyere bubbling over flavorful onion broth and large slices of onion - absolutely spot on. I went a bit lighter on my meal - the Mimosa Salad. The salad was full of mixed greens, two toasted Brie chunks, apples, spiced walnuts and topped with a light coating of super delicious champagne vinaigrette. It's the perfect summer salad, IMO.And lastly, dessert. I toyed back and forth between their classic Creme Brulee and one of their feature desserts, Chocolate Bread Pudding. Sadly, this was the only disappointing part of my meal. I should have listened to our waitress when she mentioned how delicious the Creme Brulee was. The Chocolate Bread Pudding wasn't bad by any means, it was just ok. It tasted more like a nice French toast than a chocolate bread pudding - I especially didn't taste any chocolate in it. Le sigh - I guess I'll just have to come back and try a multitude of desserts! :)

Review Text :
I had dinner here last weekend with friends and shared a couple of dishes. We started the meal with delicious, crispy calamares then went on to nilagang baka (boiled beef and veggies), sisig (a spicy pork dish), relyenong talong (roasted eggplant covered with ground pork and scrambled egg), and fried chicken. The portions were generous, the dishes were good, and with rice it turned out to be too much food for the three of us, meaning we had some pretty good food to take home. It was Saturday night, so there was also Latin Dance instruction being given on the dance floor at the end of the restaurant, with several people enthusiastically trying out the steps being taught. I came back today to try the lunch buffet with fellow yelpers Rand H. and Mike  C. The restaurant decided to venture into offering a lunch buffet option only recently, so I guess they are still feeling their way around in this field. The selection of viands was limited (especially if you're used to going to Chinese buffets). I liked the dinuguan (pork stewed in pork blood; this could be a bit daunting for the uninitiated), the lechon kawali (deep fried pork belly), the tapa (thinly sliced beef fried in garlic), the ampalaya (bittermelon with beef) and the kinilaw (the Filipino version of ceviche). Some of the dishes could have used some tweaking: the lumpia (spring rolls) could have been a bit more crisp, and the pancit noodles had an overcooked texture.  Come for the regular menu for lunch and dinner. The buffet also offers authentic Filipino dishes and will hopefully incorporate the needed tweaks in some dishes as they get more accustomed to offering this option. Four stars for the regular menu, three stars for the lunch buffet at this point.

Review Text :
If you had told me last week that I would be giving a cafe in Gilbert five stars I would have told you you're crazy.  Folks, YOU CRAZY!!I was not expecting to be wowed by the unassuming uptown Romeo's Euro Cafe in Gilbert's little downtown district.  But it delivered and outdid itself.  After the painfully hard decision based on the huge and extensive menu, I ordered the Avocado Feta Pita ($7) and was BLOWN away by the taste. The inside of the pita revealed a sauteed melange of grilled turkey, avocado, feta and a special dressing.  I'm a huge fan of avocado, so I had an inkling I might like this - but I was a bit skeptical of the sauted part of this.  That's a bit too decadent and rich for my tastes. But I didn't care.  That's how freaking good this pita was.  I'm a dude and don't have hips or anything, but if bigger hips were a consequence for this, LAY IT ON BABY!!  Was it authentic Greek?  Not at all.  I would consider it more New American, with Mediterranean influences.It didn't stop there though.  My fellow eating partner ordered the Corinthian salad ($11), which looked mighty attractive I might add - and I don't care for salads at all.   It was gigantic and came appointed with grilled chicken, artichoke, hearts of palm, red peppers, mushroom, feat and capers in a Italian dressing.   Sounds pretty pedestrian until you see the size of the presentation and the veggies used (marinated mushrooms, for example).  Dessert was just as incredible.  That's what you first notice when you walk in the door, btw - the big glass counter full of freshly baked desserts - from cheesecakes to tarts, you name it they probably have it.   The apple strudel was a rather large portion, flaky and not too sweet.  But the runaway winner (that even the server agreed on) was the caramel kiss cheesecake - caramel marbled with dark chocolate.  The texture and taste outdid even the Cheesecake Factory. While lunch was pretty cheap and basically consists of pitas, burgers, subs and salads, the dinner menu is larger (chicken, seafood, Greek plates and pasta) and seems to run a bit higher at $15 - $20 for entrees.The space itself lives up to its name with marble tabletops and wrought iron chairs.   It feels very Euro and very cafe inside - with a decidedly boutique feel.  While it's not overly lady-like in here, it would be kind of uncomfortable for a casual everyday Joe used to steakhouses and burger joints. Good service despite the busy and brisk lunch time crowd.  Romeo's Euro Cafe is really out of the way for me but definitely worth going out of my way for.  I can't wait to return.5 stars? How about 6? 6.5?We had such an amazing experience here. The menu was massive but delicious. The service was fantastic. The deserts were mouthwatering. I can't say enough.The hubski and I went with a few friends last weekend. Lucas was our waiter and I swear I have never had better service in my life! My friend and I both ordered the spankophillo, which is a cross between spanakopita and pizza. Pictures will be posted shortly. Lucas advised us that the dish is very large and maybe we should split it (at the risk of lowering his tip by lowering the overall bill). We decided to get our own anyway. All meals came with soup or salad. The soup of the day was cream of asparagus, which I ordered. Perfect. The asparagus was obviously grilled before being creamed in the soup, and there was a smoky flavor to it. You could tell that it was made there and not just out of a bag like some places. It was also not microwaved.My main dish arrived. Lucas was right- it was ginormous. I stick by my decision to have my own. After my delicious soup, I only ate one small slice of the spankophilla in the restaurant. I would love to tell you that this monstrosity re-heats well, but I didn't get that far. Maybe I'll be a little less impatient next time. What can I say? I am impatient. It tastes better warm than hot. Its also great cold.Spankofilla? We've been spanked!My friend had the salad with her meal and she loved the yogurt dressing. He husband ordered the gyros and was told by our waiter that it is "the best sandwich in the country". And it was.Hubski ordered a tuna melt. If I thought my dish was huge... it came on a big Italian roll with slices of tomato and melted provolone cheese. It was $7. For this size and quality, we would have paid twice that.For dessert, because I saved room, I had a piece of the "Morning After" cake. It is a white sponge cake soaked in sangria... amazing. Our friends had the tiramisu, which was out of this world.On top of that, while hubski was drinking coffee, Lucas the magnificent was watching which kind of sugar he was using, so when he refilled the coffee, he brought a whole container of just raw sugar. He checked on us regularly, but was not on top of us. He had plenty of suggestions but was not in our faces, and he was just overall the best waiter I have ever had.Eight thumbs up. We'll be there again soon.This was on my 'To Try' list forever.  My wife and I finally got around to going and I was pleasantly surprised.  As soon as you enter, there is a tiny little gift shop.  Quaint, but not what I'm looking for in a restaurant.  Service was quick and polite.  We didn't wait too long for our food to arrive, and our drinks were always full.I got the Greek Salad, and I wasn't disappointed.  Strange, the salad didn't come with any leaves (i.e. lettuce, spinach, etc..)  It was more of a humongous plate of finely chopped vegetables in an outstanding oil-based dressing.Next time I go, I want to try one of their Gyros... They looked amazing!After spending most of Saturday grazing at various East Valley locations, who would have thought any of us could find more room to eat any more? Well, we did. And Romeo's was the perfect fit for topping us off. Instead of going with entrees, we opted for a few appetizers. Good, filling and flavorful.Afterwards, the desserts seemed to be a hit since their plates were nearly licked clean. (Since I'm not one to eat sweets, the cleanliness of a plate afterwards is the only gauge I have for such things.)Our server was the sweetest thing ever! I wanted to wrap her up and bring her home. But, that's frowned upon in certain societies.I had such high hopes for this place, especially after reading all of these great reviews and I was thoroughly disappointed. First of all, they request that you do not make any changes to their menu items - which is just nuts to me. I couldn't request that a salad NOT have mushrooms thrown on top for some reason....apparently it's too much trouble? Second of all, the one or two things I did find on the menu without mushrooms were salads and one didn't even come with lettuce. So I defaulted to another salad and it came how it came - which was pretty bad. The dressing had no flavor whatsoever, and the salad as a whole was just boring. Iceberg lettuce, red pepper, and artichoke hearts...that's it! Now, my coworkers all loved their meals so I may give them another shot, but it's not likely. Any place that doesn't let you modify your order is just not a place I want to go.Euro Cafe used to be in Mesa across from Fiesta Mall.We LOVED the pizza and the fries.Then they closed. :(So, when we saw they had re-opened in Gilbert, we got rather excited. :)Then we went to the new Gilbert location. :(They have no pizza oven, so without our favorite menu item, we were forced to start trying the other pricey items in their large but restrictive menu. Over several visits it's all been fine, but nothing's been great. On our last visit, we tried the spinach-ball appetizer thing, and there was some strong herb or something that tasted almost like chlorine. We got through most of 1 (out of 5) ball, then asked the server to take it away. They didn't offer to replace it with anything else.When our bill came, the appetizer was still on there and it was like pulling teeth to get them to take it off. They finally did, but this last experience left such a bad taste in our mouth (both literally and figuratively) that we won't be coming back.Ambiance: 3 (too small, but there are some cute things in their shop area)Restrooms: 2 (outside with a key - lame)Food: 3 (no substitutions and much of it is overpriced)Service: 2 (often understaffed, weird with food issues)If you feel you still must go, get the fries appetizer - still pretty dang good.An interesting place theme-wise - quaint, crowded. As the name suggests, european in both look and feel. A bit fussy somehow. Huge menu. I really liked the pasta salad I ordered - huge portion as previously mentioned. However afterwards I couldn't help thinking, damn, I could do this myself at home! It inspired me to explore vinagrettes in general and eat more vegetables which is a good thing. And I was right about being able to make the dressings. BTW, walmart has this new thing called a multi-mixer which is great for making (and storing) your own vinagrettes at home. Check out epicurious. But I digress. To wrap up, huge menu, ok to good food, mostly high prices especially on dessert items. I took home the peanut butter cheesecake but was not impressed with it. Plus it was about $6 a slice. The case definitely beckons but I wouldn't fall to temptation there again.Also notably, the wait staff was slow, unresponsive and not particularly friendly even though there was only one other couple in the whole restaurant. Maybe they've been told to be that way in line with the European theme??? just kidding but it does make one wonder..."WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE"I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS on places but this one had to be done. My wife and I have travelled many places and eaten at many restaurants. We go out to eat every weekend and when we like a place we tell everyone about it and go back many times. My experience with Romeo's was so shocking, rude and offensive I could not not post my review.This was our 4th time going to Romeos in the last 3 months since reading about them in the paper of how great their desserts were. My wife and I love desert cafe's and Romeo's had a large selection. The first time we went we each got dessert and liked what we got. The 2nd time we went with freinds for dinner and thought it was pretty good. The menu is so huge it took us 20 minutes to order as we couldn't decide on what to eat. The 3rd time we went for desert with 10 people from my office. The final and 4th time we went which was on Friday was litteraly the worst experince of my life. 3 out of 4 times we went we alaways had the same waitress who I am assuming now is the owner. (I did not get her name).We came once again for dessert and my wife and her sister spent about 20 minutes trying to decide on what to order. They went to the restroom for a bit and then came back. They had ordered a piece of white cake, baklava cheesecake and some fudgy pie cake thing. The cheesecake was pretty good, the fudgy thing was decent although at 5.50 was extremely small and the white cake thing was terriable. It was dry and basically no flavor. We all tried it and left basically 3/4 of the cake.When the bill came it was 3 pieces of cake and tax. I told our waitress that I did not wish to pay for the piece of white cake as we did not think it was good and dry. She just looked at us and walked into the back of the restaurant and told the lady that had helped us the 3 times in the past.THIS IS WHERE IT GETS SHOCKING:The waitress (owner) came over to our table and said I was told you didnt like something you ordered. I proceeded to tell her that we would pay for the other items but didnt think the white cake was good as it was to dry. She then proceeded to pick up the plate with my fork on it. I knew what she was going to do and sat there in shock. She litteraly cut a piece off the cake and ate it and said "there is nothing wrong with this cake, it is not dry". I told her I cannot believe you just did that. She said I am not going to take this off of the bill just because you didnt like it. She then asked me and my brother in law if we owned our own businesses which we do both happen to do. She then walked away from our table.As we all sat there in SHOCK I said I am not paying for that cake. I left $11 in cash which was 2 cakes and tax and walked out. My wife, sister in law and her husband stayed in the restaurant. The waitress then came back to the table and said so you just are not going to pay for the food. They again told her they would pay for it all but that piece of cake. She then proceeded to say to my sister in law out loud to the whole restaurant. "Are you not the one who was just in the bathroom throwing up" trying to make her look stupid in front of the other patrons. At this they left the money on the table - minus the cake money and walked out.What was this person thinking? We estimated that this piece of cake cost them .80 to make. Was it really worth the amount of lost business they will be recieving? The least she should have done was to offer us something to replace this piece of cake with or just offered to remove the charge from the bill. Besides the 12 other people we told to come to this restaurant who will never go again. How many people will they tell.Like I said I never post reviews but this experience to me was so shocking I couldnt not leave a review.They don't make substitutions, actually they won't even leave off a piece of cheese because as the waiter told me"The menu is exactly as the chef wants it."when I replied I had food allergies I was given a smug response "No, we don't do substitutions."again I asked if I could have something without cheese. He said "no" and walked away from the table.Then some fussy lady walked over and told me very loudly  "no substitutions!"I walked out embarrassed. The staff are rude, obnoxious and classless.I often use extremes in my reviews...."best service" or "worst logo"...you get the idea. Unfortunately, I'm not concerned about overusing superlatives in this review. Instead, eating at Euro Cafe turned out to just be weird. Like seriously weird.We walked into the cutesy gift shop/waiting area (think LGO for old ladies) and we were greeted by a very chipper young teenage hostess with whom we had some fun, pleasant banter. I was thinking....hmm, this place should be cool. Before we sat down, I glanced over to the large dessert case, which--from my friend's recommendations--was likely to be the highlight of the visit, and I was a bit surprised to see that it was half-empty. And this was at 7pm on a Saturday night.I wasn't too worried, though. Our server seemed great at first. She actually just sat down at our table and talked all about the menu with us....she was very helpful and made a couple of recommendations. She proceeded to take our drink orders, for me a glass of the Malbec and, for my dining companion, a vanilla latte. We had to re-try on the wine because they were out of the Malbec, but no big deal, right? Our drinks arrived, and she asked us if we had decided on our entrees.This was when her attitude got a bit weird and pushy. We told her what entrees we wanted, but before we could even tell her that we also wanted to try an appetizer, she jetted away from the table. If I may add, she left the table grabbing my companion's latte without asking if she was finished (she still had about 10% of the drink she wanted to enjoy).The server then brought our salads. Their salad is a nice, standard mixed greens and I ordered the yogurt dressing which was quite nice. We finished our salads, and being the good former server I am, I placed our plates--along with my fork--in a small pre-bussed stack on the side of our table. My friend asked me if I thought they would want me to re-use my fork, and I replied "I'm not planning on eating a $20 entree with a re-used fork". Note: I'm aware that $20 isn't like haute cuisine pricing, but I mean I just don't think you should have to lick the dressing off of  a salad fork to eat your entree at that price point. What happened next was very weird. The waitress stopped by, saw my dirty fork on top of my pre-bussing pile, then proceeded to--while I sat there perfectly still and silent--take my dirty fork off of my salad plate and move it over to my place setting next to my clean knife. Weird.Then our entrees came. Well, they were really tossed at us more than anything. She dropped the pork tenderloin in front of me and the almond tortellini in front of my friend, which is especially odd since the server had made such a big deal about me being a vegetarian. I'm not surprised, though. I had--just five minutes earlier--seen a full-on food auction at the table next to us because the server had no idea who ordered what. Anyway, back to our food. Our server just dropped the food and walked away before we could say anything....not asking "does everything look ok" or "is there anything else I can get for you". Of course, it wasn't the end of the world for us to have to switch our plates, it was just really weird.The good news is that my Almond Tortellini was amazing. It was full of fun surprises like sunflower seeds and pine nuts, and the sauce was heavenly. The tortellini were the perfect texture and consistency. My dining companion ordered the tenderloin, and although I couldn't try any of it, I couldn't help but notice that the amount of sawing it required to cut off a bite was more reminiscent of a pork chop than a tenderloin. In spite of the dryness of the meat,  it looked to be a nice balance of flavors, with a cherry sauce, grilled onions, and horseradishy mashed potatoes. The odd service continued, though. No one ever checked back to ask about the food, and when my friend's water went empty it was a full 8 1/2 minutes for the hostess to finally come by and refill it. Even more odd was that once we had clearly finished our entrees, it was a long time before anyone came by to take away our plates. It was 18 minutes between our last bite and when our server came back (yes, I was keeping track by now, because the whole thing was just so odd). She offered dessert, but by this time, we both just wanted to leave, so we asked for the check.When she brought back the check and my card, she suddenly was miss personality, telling us how glad she was that we came and how much she looks forward to seeing us again. Honestly, I wish she had been so helpful when we were actually still having our meal.Overall, the environment at this restaurant is just plain weird and uncomfortable. I would love to eat the Tortellini again, but if the price for enjoying that great dish is sitting through another hour of awkwardness in this restaurant, I'll just have to go withoutWalked here after having dinner at Liberty Market, since I couldn't have any of the desserts offered there.  After the friendly and very helpful female host helped to phone the pastry chef to address my food allergies, I placed my order of a slice of "Dangerous Dilemma" and a chocolate-covered walnut strudel and was seated at a two-top next to a window with a view of a parking lot.  I decided to while away the wait on the dessert by looking at the baubles on display by the entrance.  A few moments later, the host notified me that the strudel had cornstarch, so it's a no-no for me, and that  I would not be able to dine inside since I should not have been seated with an "outside drink."  "Would this be a problem?," she asked. I said no, paid for my to-go dessert, and settled on a bench outside the cafe.  While the two forkfuls that I tried of the multi-layered dense cake (cookie crumb bottom layer, dark chocolate fudge cake, white chocolate mousse, another layer of dark chocolate fudge cake, and then topped with raspberry coulis) were delicious, I inadvertently became the meal of ghost mosquitoes (so I had to pack up and leave, yet again).  All because I had a lidded to-go cup of Liberty Market drip house coffee with me.The $6.54 (tax included) cake slice was tasty (although almost a bit too sweet), and I can't fault someone for following house rules, but I wished my drink could've been overlooked.  (There were only two occupied tables out of 12 to 15 tables.) Heck, I could've ordered a glass of wine, or another cup of coffee, with my dessert had I not been turned away...My wife and I tried the Euro Cafe this weekend. Place is small and quaint with a huge dessert display case in the entrance and looks amazing! We were greeted by friendly hostess and servers and were excited to give it a try.Received our menus. All I can say is WOW -- overwhelming. Although many items seemed to share similar ingredients, it's extremely difficult to do that large of a menu well -- especially in such a small restaurant. We got even more nervous when we saw one of the staff walk right through the dining area with a large bag of frozen stuffed pasta to the kitchen. This happened again later with something else, but I couldn't see what was in the bag. Not sure if they are making trips to the grocery store or they have a walk-in in a different area of the building, but it wasn't very professional and was an indicator of what was to come. Anyways, the food. Well it looked nice and was a large portion but it went downhill from there. Both entrees seemed like a confusing jumble of flavors and textures overwhelmed by the different marinated/flavored ingredients that made up the dishes. In both cases, the protein (shrimp, chicken) tasted like they were boiled or poached and had little flavor. Anyways, maybe we just ordered the wrong things. But to be honest I won't take the chance again to find the better ones. Maybe the chef/owner needs to reduce his menu by 50-75% and concentrate on what works well. Its pretty hard to do 100 menu items (my estimate) without compromising.BE ADVISED:  A group of 4 employees where I work and some vendors that took them to The Euro Cafe in dowtown Gilbert were diagnosed with food poisoning just last week.  A few have been treated at the hospital, while others are home fighting through it.   VERY SERIOUS - the proper authorities were notified and are collecting data of everyone affected for the department of health.

I don't get to Glendale very often... but I headed over to Bravi for a tweet-up this afternoon, and I ended up staying a bit after to get some work done.  The restaurant is located in a newer looking shopping center off of Union Hills and 59th Avenue.  The service was fine and the restaurant itself was clean and welcoming.  I saw there were a handful of people dining outside on the patio while I was there... I can't be too critical since all I had was a Mediterranean Salad (to-go) and a diet coke (with a few refills).  Jared and I had the salad along with an acorn squash and baked cod for dinner... and it was fresh, enough for both of us, and A-ok in my book!  Will I rush back? No.  But the rest of the menu looks appealing and if I am ever in Glendale seeking somewhere to get some grub or a glass of wine, I'd gladly return.

It's been about seven years since I've been here and not much has changed.  We met a friend from Toronto who was in town for 2 weeks for bridge tournaments and gaming.  This is one of the places he hits up every time he comes to Las Vegas.We had reservations for 5:30--not needed as it turned out--but there were more people there than I had expected.  We were quickly seated, brought menus, and our drink order was delivered.  We then ordered and the server split the order into two checks as we requested.My wife ordered the Chicken Cortez and Jack and I each ordered prime rib.  Each dinner comes with soup or salad and choice of starch.  I got potato leek and a baked potato.  I asked for my prime rib to be blue and the server said very rare to which I nodded.  We also ordered a side of scalloped corn with prosciutto to share.Bread was brought to the table along with two plates of pastry piped butter.  There didn't appear to be any difference in taste among the three.  The lavash was not as flavorful as some I've had and the pretzel roll was somewhat dry.  It seemed like the bread was a little on the old side.The soup was good.  One of the bus people came to grind fresh pepper which was a bonus.  There was a good separation between courses so we could chat and catch up with what our friend had been up to since we saw him a few months before.Our mains arrived.  The prime rib was red as I wanted and Jack's was a medium rare which was what he ordered.  Andrea's chicken was, well chicken with cheese melted on top and some avocado.  My baked potato was large but needed a bit more baking time.  I got the normal accoutrements--butter and sour cream and the waiter left extra horseradish if we wanted to charge up the creamy horseradish served with the prime rib.  All three of us liked our meals.  The scalloped corn was very good.  Creamed corn with lots of cheese baked until the light bread crumb top was browned.For dessert, I got carrot cake which was quite good.The Cortez Room is OK.   Service was OK if not a bit nonchalant.  The price was good because the casino had mailed a BOGO to my wife and we used points to pay the balance.  For the price of gratuity, we had dinner for two.  The A-OK rating is apropos  because while nothing stands out about the whole evening, the food was OK and done the way we wanted.This place is hit or miss! Some nights the service is great and the food is perfect...other nights its terrible service and average food. I have tried every cut of steak that they offer and I will say that their best piece of meat is their Prime Rib and New York.The seafood is good...I typically get the lobster tails or the Alaskan Crab Legs. I would say that their biggest let down is the older woman at the front desk...she seems very lazy and is EXTREMELY SLOW!

Review Text :
I write this review not so much as a judicial examination of the palatableness of the meal I had here last weekend, but rather as an urgent public service announcement meant to warn potential customers of the gastronomical suckerpunch they stand to receive should they make the mistake of eating at this wretched trough of culinary embarrassments.My meal was quite possibly the worst meal I have ever paid money for. And please, do not for one moment, think that is hyperbole.Below is a brief list of the sufferings I endured at brunch on Thursday morning.Omelet bar? Not exactly. Instead all the egg choices were fabricated in some sort of Omeleton 5000 device which creates strange semi-circle discs of "cooked" egg. In execution these abominations were really more akin to salmonella Hot Pockets with the outside cauterized into a leathery shell and the inside a viscous snot pocket of uncooked egg. Not even wrapping them in a tortilla, slathering them with cheese, salsa and sour cream could even save these leatherback puke pouches.Alright then, eggs are a pass. Let's move onto the pork products. You can't mess up pork products, right?Good god, yes you can apparently.The sausages were finger-length vessels of fail wrapped around latex-strength casings. To fully understand how it felt to cut one of these things I recommend you take a Robusto sized cigar and attempt to cut it crosswise into one inch segments. I think I used to make log cabins out of these things when I was a child.Terrible bacon? A statement like that should be nothing more than an oxymoron, or perhaps an ironic band name. But seriously, how do you fuck up bacon? It was more like tasteless crumbling wood chips. I'd just assume glue a bunch of Bacos together and eat that instead.Next I thought that perhaps the French Toast would make amends for the pillaging my taste buds have already incurred. Nope, the pillaging continued as I tried futilely to cut a bite-sized piece of the eggy bread bricks with my knife and fork. The slices were so tough that they actually resisted the maple syrup I had drenched them with. You know, the French have a version of their eponymously named bread called, "Pain perdu". Now, while the word, "pain" is certainly a poignant way to describe eating one of these Rubbermaid breakfast sponges, I really feel the best way to describe the Roundtable Buffet's French Toast is to use the literal translation of "Pain perdu", "Lost Bread". Truly, this dish was a tragic loss indeed.In the end I settled on a bowl of cottage cheese, an unpeeled orange and some pith-heavy grapefruit slices. For the next half hour I nursed a cup of (serviceable) coffee while my stomach curdled, whimpered and bubbled in discontent.Before we left however, my friends and I made one final gruesome discovery. The meatballs.Having arrived during brunch a small number of the buffet stations were serving luncheon fare. As almost a sort of macabre experiment to attain absolute certainty that the Roundtable Buffet at the Excalibur was the worst dining experience found on "The Strip", my friend brought back a small sampling from the Italian station. On his plate lie a minute serving of penne pasta with a meaty marinara sauce and a single, innocent looking meatball. A Tuscan inspired amuse-bouche perhaps? No. More like a vomi-bouche, or even, an amuse-fail. The meatball positively reeked. My friend couldn't eat more than a thumbnail-sized sliver before pushing the plate away in disgust. His wife, upon catching a whiff of the plate, rather insistently demanded that it be removed from the table. Somewhere in the distance I'm sure I heard a wolf howl.To those who claim, "You get what you pay for!" I call bullshit. I consistently eat far superior meals for well under $14.00 every week. The fare here in inexcusable; the fact that we waited in line before entering is baffling.So, to all the lords and ladies staying at the Excalibur, I say the following. Should you be swept up in the medieval theme that surrounds you at the Excalibur, please know that bravery is not attained at the Roundtable, only food poisoning.Tom: "hey honey, what are you girls doing?"Me: "looking for a buffet. hows the one at excalibur? i got a coupon for buy one get one free. is it worth checking out?"Tom: "OMG THAT IS THE BEST ONE GO GO GO"Me. "..oh. ok."I'm actually quite surprised that this buffet has such a low ranking, I really didn't mind it and my boyfriend was super jealous when he found out I was going.First off, check your coupon books that you get when you check in (most hotels do this, or if you ask can get you one). I stayed at the Luxor and had a buy one buffet get one free, so for me and my girlfriend it worked out great! It was $17 for the both of us at lunch and we came at the perfect time. We got there at about 345, so they charged us for lunch, but put out the fresh dinner foods right at 4, so we basically got a whole ton of stuff for not a lot. Pretty awesome. And by awesome, I'm talking fresh crab, fresh shrimp, fresh, carved to order prime rib, and because we were there on st. patrick's day there was corned beef and cabbage. aw, that's sweet.There was an entire alley of soda machines, tons of food, pretty decent price, and a dessert-ed island (see what I did there?)Overall I had a great time, had a ton of pretty decent food and I'm happy with it all. I'd definitely do the same thing where I go in have a salad then chow down on some dinner food but hey, that's just me. I like to hustle.WOW, this buffet has really gone downhill ever since the last time I was here, which was a couple of years ago. The first time I was here, everything was flawless. But now, a lot of the dishes were mostly bland and mediocre. The only thing good here were the desserts.

Review Text :
We had a little left on a Station Casino gift card and a weluvlocals.com coupon which made this a very reasonably priced dinner for us. I really like the atmosphere and style of the restaurant itself. The big fireplace on the left side makes it feel cozy, the high ceilings and their outdoor bar is the best place to have a beverage or 7 in all of Red Rock. I noticed a lot of complaints about the prices in other Yelp reviews. Here are some ways to keep dinner under some kind of budget: 1. Skip the appetizers completely. Let's be honest. There's nothing you haven't had before here. Crab cakes, caprese salad, oysters, shrimp cocktail..zzzzzzzzzzzzz. And there's no way they'll do it better than your favorite place anyways. The bread is good enough here if you're starving. Plus you're at a freakin steakhouse for chrissakes! I for one always end up getting tons of things boxed up since the portions are so big. Why stuff yourself with pricey and meh things? 2. Go with the Chateaubriand for $99. Its a complete dinner for 2 and it comes with a rainbow of roasted vegetables and potatoes. That means you don't need to pay for $10 side dishes. On a side note, it continually blows my mind how any steakhouse charges $10+ for steamed asparagus. Good god! I want them to at least work a little bit on the damn vegetable. Grill it!! Sautee it!! Show me the chef put some elbow grease into it. It's simply wrong on principle alone to spend that much on steamed anything unless it's a whole fish. Like any real restaurant that serves Chateaubriand, they will cook the beef tenderloin table-side, carve it and plate it in front of you. Its like the soft rock music of steak to teppenyaki's heavy metal. The presentation could also be potentially semi-impressive if you're on a first date. Just throwing that out there. The tenderloin itself is good enough and enjoyable. No way can it compare to some other places in town but it still makes for a nice steak dinner. 3. You could also keep it cheap for dessert by going to the Grand Cafe or Ben and Jerry's in the food court. Neither of which we did since we were so stuffed from the entree but there's another suggestion. I would only come back here for a proper dinner if I had a significant discount. There are too many other cows in the sea.I went here last night and was really disappointed in the whole experience vis à vis the price and the surroundings.  First, it's a beautifully done restaurant with a nice gas fireplace and elegant surroundings.  That comes with a fatal error.  There is a glass wall that separates this lovely dining room from the bar and several large TVs all tuned to basketball.  Can't you put some drapes on the glass and keep the dining room a dining room?  One other thing, it would be nice if you used real candles instead of those cheap plastic battery operated ones.  Goodness knows your profit margin on each steak would allow that.As for the food, it is very over-priced.  Total bill for 1 person before tip was just under $80.  That was for 1 iced tea, a bowl of French onion soup, an 8 ounce filet mignon, a side of fingerling potatoes cooked in duck fat with thyme, and chocolate bread pudding.  That's it.The bread basket had a nice selection with a slice each of olive, raisin, and sourdough bread, a pretzel roll, and one lavash.  The onion soup was standard.  It wasn't a rich tasting broth but standard.  My server didn't understand "blue" so I said black and blue and then he responded with Pittsburgh style, and I said yes.  The steak was more medium rare than extra rare as it should have been.  The potatoes were much ado about little.  The bread pudding was excellent.  Service was quite good with several people seeing to more iced tea or checking on my dinner.I recently had a 5 course chef's tasting menu at a steakhouse at a Strip hotel and it was only a few dollars more and it included an 8 pounce American Wagyu filet.  I guess my expectations for t-Bones were simply too high.  It just doesn't produce a meal that merits the prices they charge.  It's a shame when you walk away from a pricey dinner and you remember the bread basket and the dessert.I should have listened to Holly!Over the past 4 years, I've been here numerous times for a variety of occasions (a date, business dinner, birthday celebration).  The service is fantastic, the setting and decor devine...but the food just doesn't stack up against better known steakhouses, and with virtually the same price point.  The location inside the Red Rock Hotel makes it an easy-peasy, no hassle, off-strip choice...might be the only reason to choose it (especially, if your staying at the hotel, or if convenient to Summerlin residents).  For me, having an appetizer or a drink at the inside bar, or better yet -- the beautiful outdoor bar with a firepit, large sofas and chairs -- is absolutely terrific.  For the main course, I'd take my business elsewhere.A tip for parking is to valet park on the backside, the hotel entrance, with just a short walk thru the hotel lobby and either up the stairs (passing the outstanding chandelier), or 1 floor up in the elevator...takes you right to the T-Bones entrance.T-Bones is a beautiful place and elegant place.  I was thrilled to be invited to dinner there, since I'd never been.  First, the good:  the bread might be up there with the best bread I've had in Vegas in the 10+ years I've been here.  Maybe it's an East Coast thing, but I like bread with a crunchy crust, and this had it in spades.From the beginning to the end:  the crème brûlée was outstanding.But man (or woman, in this case) cannot live by bread and dessert alone, though I wish I could.  I would have been content with both of those.  My appetite was whetted by the beautiful, jumbo shrimp sitting atop ice in a huge bowl brought to our table.  While they looked great, nothing about their taste was remarkable.  They were just THERE.  And as soon as the shrimp were whisked away, the waiters started to remove the bread basket and bread plates of all the others at my table.  I caught them in time; when there's good bread I save a bite for the end of my meal.  Did I play hooky from etiquette class the day they taught this topic?A very ordinary Caesar's salad was followed by what should have been the raison d'être of a steak joint:  the steak.  Mine was a petite filet.  It looked like it was cooked just the way I liked it, i.e., medium rare.  Somehow it didn't taste that way.  Actually, it didn't taste like much of anything.  I'm not a huge steak aficionado to begin with, and this one didn't do anything to change my mind.  If I had paid the menu price of $43, I sure would have been ticked.  The green beans were just about raw.  Lots of folks like 'em that way.  I am not one of them.  The mashed potatoes were eminently skippable.  My husband had the salmon, which came out as a thick slab.  It wasn't as rare as it should be, but he likes it well done, so he had no complaints about that.  But it, too, wasn't flavorful, unless you count the excessive amount of salt on the top, almost a salt crust.  Ix-nay on the salmon, too.  We've had great salmon, and this wasn't it.If we were on our own dime, we would have been sorely disappointed.  Instead, we were just disappointed.

Review Text :
Wow...this was absolutely the worst dinning experience of our lives.  (This wasn't our first Brazilian Steakhouse)We called before to see if they took reservations.  The girl who answered the phone was clueless.  She didn't know the answer so we just asked how long the wait was since we were only about 30 minutes away.  She started rambling about seating us maybe at table 30 or table 36 and then just paused for about 30 seconds.  She finally said there would be no wait.When we got there, after a few minutes we were seated.  We waited about 5 minutes and then our waiter came by and said, "Hi, how are you doing?  Have you been....Oh, hold on, this table was here first." And then he turned around and started helping a table across from us that actually just sat down!!  (They had 6 people so he probably expected a larger bill)  After another 5 minutes with them, he came back to us and we ordered water and he explained that we turn the block to red when we're eating salad bar and to green when we want meat.  We got our salad from the salad bar. (Best part of the meal but it was still very average in our opinion)  After another 5 minutes we asked one of the server assistants for our water and for some bread that comes with all the meals.  It took another 3-4 minutes after that before they brought our water.  No bread.  We got seconds on our salad bar and came back to the table.  At that time, we decided we wanted to start trying some meat with our salad bar items.  I flipped over the block to green.  The waiter came by and flipped BACK over the block and said "NO, you're not ready!" and kept on walking by!!  We we're floored by his response, if they wanted us to wait until the sides came they could have said it more tactfully.  A few minutes later we pushed our salads to the side and flipped over our block again to show we wanted our sides and meat.  They brought over our sides (rice, beans, fried bananas, and a few other things).  Still no bread, we asked again.  They brought it a few minutes later.  So I put some rice and beans on my plate and waited for meat.  They brought by our option of meat and put it on our plates (we accepted every meat they brought by).  I started eating and took a bite of my rice.  I felt something stringy in my mouth and proceeded to pull out a long, blond hair.  We were disgusted.  I waited for our waiter to come by but after 5 minutes he didn't show up.  Finally, a meat server came by and we asked him to get our waiter.  He came by and I showed him the hair, he asked for it and examined it.  He then looked at us and said that no one in the kitchen has blonde hair...inferring it wasn't from them.  My wife and I both have brunette hair so we knew it wasn't ours.  He took away the rice and my plate and they brought by new rice and plates a few minutes later.  (No apologies at this time)  I didn't care for rice now and really wanted to try some more meat.  I waited for about 7-8 minutes until the next person came by with meat.  They put a small portion on our plates and walked away (never asked if we wanted more or a larger piece - none of the meat servers do this and they all give tiny pieces).  I ate that piece in 2 bites and waited again.  This became a pattern.  It was usually about 10 minutes between meats.  (Shouldn't be this way)  We mentioned this to our server and he said okay and walked away.  After another 30 minutes and only 2 more pieces of meat (one was pineapple) we said we had enough.   It was extremely frustrating looking around for someone to bring you meat and having to wait 10 minutes between bites.  We told the waiter we were finished.  They brought by dessert but after our experience we passed.  A few minutes passed and he dropped the check on our table and said "sorry bout the hair" and walked away.  We expected to see a discounted tab, however it was for the full amount of $65.  He came back by and we asked to speak to a manager.  He walked over to one, talked for a bit and then came back and said no manager was available, but "I am available".  We told him how unhappy we were with the experience and that we didn't believe we should have to pay this enter amount.  He then asked "Did you both eat? You both ate food so you have to pay."  We again explained how unhappy we were and brought up everything that happend.  He said there was nothing he could do.  We asked to speak to a manager.  He said no, there was nothing they could do.  We asked again and he got one. The manager walks over (and guess what, she had long blond hair) after we explained the evening, she rudely asked if the waiter saw the hair, then she said that they had people out and it was too busy, and then said they couldn't do anything about our tab.  We argued and they finally took half off.The reason why we are so upset was the customer service.  Places can have off nights, hair falls in food, but the way they handled it was absolutely pathetic.  SAVE YOUR $. DON'T GO HERE!Dinner. This visit was premeditated. I fasted for most of the day and abandoned the health-conscious mentality. My stomach was stirring up mixed feelings prior to the long drive to this place, due to some who did, or did not like Fogo E Brasa. Thoughts: 1) hope the drive is worth it, and 2) being challenged by hungerSo, arrived around 8ish, snooped around the salad bar while slyly checking out the meats in the kitchen. Salad bar was alright... you can have potato or pasta salad any day, so I skipped that. The fresh calamari looked appetizing, but it seemed as if everybody had picked out all the "good" parts. I think it was scallop ceviche, or some shellfish ceviche... it was good. But again, the good parts had been captured. Were served sides of rice, beans, pico de gallo, and breaded bananas. I thought I would enjoy the slightly carmelized, fried plantains that I'm used to, but unfortunately, not here. Onto to the M E A T.  And, into my intestines, still slowly digesting: ham, chicken enveloped in bacon, barbecue chicken, sausage (slightly dehydrated, but okay), trip tip, garlic steak (hm... this thing was tough, and will ignore next time), sirloin, prime rib, and lamb (favorite, prepared well- tender, pink middle, familiar aroma).Whoa, and you would think, after those generous cuts of meat, I'd be done. Not quite yet. Of course, you need to round it out with something to cleanse the palate. So, behold the cart of desserts. I chose the tiramisu, and I guess the gal sensed my hungry eyes, and gave me a large piece of this tiramisu. It was good tiramisu, but I couldn't taste the undertones of rum. I'll have to say I've had better. I consumed copious amounts of water thanks to the attentive waiters. Also had some red, and capirinha to aid the flow of food in system, and lilliputian-sized espresso to end the night. Now, I'm just feeling all sorts of lethargy and other things that prevent me from being productive. My initial thoughts were tended. I'll drive here again, and the food did, indeed conquer me. I won't be hungry for days.I had always wanted to go to a restaurant like this where they serve the meat to your right at your table and you have such a big variety of choices.  The service was very quick, almost as soon as we had turned our little signal to say that we were ready for food, someone was coming out with a fresh skewer of meat.  All of the servers were very friendly as well.The food itself was good but not great.  Some varieties of meat were very very salty, others were great.  Luckily they come around with all the different meats multiple times so you can figure out which ones you like and want more of.I would suggest saving some room for dessert though as there is a multi-tiered cart of different delicious choices.  I tried the Tiramisu and it was some of the best I've had.I can honestly say, eating here was the worst dining experience I have ever had. I've been to worse places. I've dealt with worse service. But bundle together the entire experience of the evening and top it with the hefty price tag for a bow and you've got something you would wish on nobody.I had high hopes for this place, really I did. I recall going for lunch a couple of times when they were Fogo E Brasa, and they were very good. Something changed. We saw our server (who turned out to be the manager...) only once, meaning no drink refills. The person bringing the meats around could best be describe as a "meat pusher"; he would butt his way into our conversations, mumble what he had, then start sawing, without asking if we wanted any. The meat was inconsistently bad... I saw everything from overcooked to the point of burning, to something that looked like it was in the pan for no more than 15 seconds. Add to that an apparent total lack of seasoning and you get a rather unappetizing meal.For this lovely experience, we were charged $31 each, not including any drinks or desserts. This is the first time I honestly considered walking out on a check. I will never be returning here, and am making sure to spread the word of just how bad that dinner was. I actually went to Applebees afterward to get some better food in me. Yes, Applebees was better.We came here for dinner the other night and we weren't overly impressed and, honestly, I'm quite surprised by some of the higher reviews. The atmosphere was fine; low lighting, decently decorated, but it was much smaller than I had expected. It was also nearly empty when we first got there at 6pm.Service was decent; a couple of the servers were hard to understand but we got by. Now, I understand the whole concept of how the servers will keep coming with the meat  until you turn over the little colorful toy looking thing but it was a bit distracting to have a conversation when the servers are circling around you and interrupting. Maybe it would be better to just bring out a dish of the samplings and if you want more then you could ask for it.The salad bar was...okay. It wasn't anything to rave about. I tried a sampling of six different salads; mushrooms, tilapia and tomatoes, chicken salad, egg salad, crab salad, and garbanzo bean salad. Of the six I thought two of them were good; chicken salad and egg salad.After we finished with the salads they started bringing in the meats. Again, we thought they were okay. The beefs were definitely way better than the others. I liked the prime rib, the sirloin, and the fillet, however they were a bit over cooked for my taste but they were seasoned well and moist. Although, the sausage was dry, the ham was so-so, the pork chop was completely dried out, the lamb I didn't care for, and the piece of rib I got didn't really have any meat on it.They also brought rice, beans, some other sauce, and a small dish of fried banana's. I didn't try the beans or whatever the sauce was but I did try the rice. It was plain, nothing exciting, plus it was slightly undercooked; I got a few crunchy pieces. The fried banana's were really good though.We had the flan for dessert, it was actually really good. Keep in mind though, flan is pretty easy to make, but it was tasty.I think that it's a great concept and would be an enjoyable experience if the quality was better. While I'm glad we at least tried it, because it's always good to try something new, I doubt we'll ever be back. The price we paid wasn't worth it. Unless they lowered their price to $20 a person, I probably wouldn't come back. I think it would be a better idea to take your money to one of your favorite steakhouses.Now I was going to give this restaurant a 2, maybe 3, star rating however, after reading other reviews and seeing how the manager of Brazilian Bull responded to negative reviews I changed it to a 1 star rating. Tip to the manager: if you want people to return after a bad experience, being rude, disrespectful and extremely defensive is not the way to do it. Being argumentative and trying to prove a point won't help your restaurant and you should keep in mind "word of mouth" is a powerful tool. Learn some customer service and common courtesy.

Review Text :
Crazy that some people are giving this place 2 or 3 stars...!!Social House was a real highlight of my recent trip to Vegas.  Terrific service (thank you, Louis), great ambience, good and stiff drinks, amazing food, orgasmic desserts, and even FABULOUS coffee.  FIVE STARS ALL AROUND!  We went here based on the findings of our friend who was buying us dinner (thanks a million, Rob!), and it's a memory I will treasure for a long, long time.  (Photos of some of the food uploaded.... well, when I remember to take photos, as I was busy chowin'!)We started with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno.  Thin, delectable slivers of hamachi, topped with a crispy-fried slice of jalapeno, doused in a very tasty sauce.  At a whopping $17, it is rather pricey but a very interesting and tasty dish.  The Tuna Tataki Spicy Ponzu was also excellent.  The Gyoza with Spicy Ponzu was out of this world - fried perfectly and full of taste.  YUM.  Their cod dish was good but a little bland, though fresh and well-prepared and presented.What was exhilarating was their Tamarind Short Ribs.WOW.WOW...WOWWWWW!!!  Their curry fried rice with vegetables was very light and flavorful.  I did not try many of their nigiri - but the few that I did try were very good to downright excellent.  I'm a firm believer that one must try the mackerel (saba) at each Japanese restaurant to decide just how good the place is - - and Social House's saba was seriously amongst the very best I have had.  Their rolls were decent - - but all we tried was a typical Spicy Tuna Roll, so perhaps that is not enough to fully comment on their sushi roll selections.On my next trip - I am not even going to bother with anything else - I'm going to these ribs, with a bowl of their rice.  The meat just fell off the bone, and the sauce that graced this dish was just heavenly.  What it consisted of, I cannot say, but the taste.... WOW.  This, and an order or two of their saba, and I won't care how much money I lose at the tables.  Amazing food.After dinner, Louis moved us out to the patio area which has a nice view of the Venetian Hotel across the street, as well as a direct view of the Treasure Island Pirate Show.  The weather was perfect, and the patio area is just beautifully done - - has a great feel to it, comfortable seating, and just a wonderful place to finish off a perfect dinner.  Then came the desserts.Now, I am not big on sweets.... but we ordered a chocolate cake, and something called "dough balls".  The chocolate cake was rich and was accompanied by several different sauces, or scoops of other fattening and really tasty stuff.  DEFINITELY WORTH IT.  But the dough balls..... they came out in a paper bag as promised, and was acccompanied by two sauces, one chocolate and the other vanilla.  You take a hot dough ball and dip into one of the sauces and bite into it.... and you swear, if this is your last meal on the planet, you'd die happy.  WOW.Then our server brought out our coffee.Holy Sh*t.  Best damn coffee I've had in Vegas, and hands down, there is no "Japanese" restaurant on this side of the planet that serves this type of coffee.  I could still be sitting there drinking my millionth cup and would not complain.  It was THAT good, and I am a real wench when it comes to good coffee....Social House is by no means "cheap" or even "moderately priced".  In fact, it's downright expensive, really, given the servings.  But based on taste/flavor alone - - it's worth it, and worth doing again and again, and again.  Perhaps it was the good company that added to my opinion of this restaurant, but I'd swear this was excellent food.  Service, once seated, was topnotch between Louis and Robert - - but I will add that the hostesses left something to be desired in terms of courtesy but not enough to affect my rating of this place.  We got Mojitos and Lychee-Tinis from the bar - - both were strong and excellent drinks.  Hit the spot.  :-)I don't much like Treasure Island as a hotel, and do not visit often, but guaranteed - as long as Social House remains inside this hotel, I will be back on each LV visit....Update Sept 07:And everytime I go back, this place exceeds my expectations again and again........ I LOVE SOCIAL HOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I had the prix fixe dinner here before the Mystere show.  Everything was fantastic!  And I am spoiled by all of the top notch sushi joints in the bay area.  This place could easily rival the best sushi anywhere.From start to finish, everything was top quality.  Especially the cod.  I wouldn't have ordered cod if it wasn't a choice on the prix fixe menu, but I'm glad I tried it.  My mouth is still watering as I think about how tender and tasty it was.Try the sparkling sake; you won't be disappointed if you like bubbles.  If you aren't a fan of the sparkling variety, there is an extensive list to choose something to your liking.So, why not 5 stars, Keeks?  Well, it's at TI, which means that you have to put up with that lame-ass Siren's cheesy hoochie fest with pirates while you eat.  If you can get a table away from the Pirates of the Caribbean meets raunchy Showgirls, then go for it.  Unless you are into that sort of thing.Being a Bachelorette rocks. Free drinks, free entry to clubs, everyone smiling at you and congratulating you. So that's why I hang out with so many of them... to reap the benefits, over and over. Social House did not disappoint! The evening couldn't have had a better start for our Bachelorette Party escapades. No longer located at Treasure Island, we were able to catch Social House during the first week of it's reopening in the swanky City Center next to Aria. The Manager stopped by our table to congratulate the beautiful bride-to-be and to offer shots for the table since we had the honor of being their first Bachelorette Party in their new location. Whoo! Donning pink tiaras, pink feather boas, and hoochie dresses, our six-pack of chicks got the party started knocking back choice cocktails and fancy sakes. Our super helpful waiter had tremendous patience explaining the menu to our drunk asses. We choose an assortment of sushi rolls, one of my favorites being the Crispy Kalbi Beef Roll. I was also digging the Sesame Kelp Salad. The specialty cocktails were eclectic and worldly, but I think next time I'll stay Asian instead of delving into the South American... their Pisco Sour 2.0 was interesting but I still prefer the traditional version over their take with hibiscus syrup. The Red Champagne was delicious, especially if you like sweet and bubbly. The winner of the night was the sparkling blueberry sake by the name of Star Rabbit. It came in a little blue bottle with a hot pink label... delicious and a perfect fit for the theme of the night. I think we killed about 3 bottles of that stuff. Since we couldn't bring ourselves to leave, we decided to order dessert as well. The Milk Chocolate Cake was a hit with the table, but the Coco-Nuts a bit too out there for our palates. Also, an arrangement of chocolate truffles was sent out to our party which ensured that we left with full bellies. After passing out "Hottest Jawline" and "Nicest Eyes" stickers to our waiter, other waiters, the manager, and busboy, we left Social House and continued on elsewhere with our Bachelorette festivities. Not without a quick romp in the fountain outside Aria... watch out for those Star Rabbits!!!3 words...Pulled Beef Fries!!! These were one of the delicious items on their happy hour menu and they were amazing. Perfectly cooked shoestring fries covered with pulled beef in an amazing slightly sweet and smoky sauce with wasabi creme fraiche...mind blowingly good!  There are also sushi, beer and sake specials. The service was fantastic and the restaurant is beautiful. I would make the 4 hour drive to Vegas just to get these fries again!Contemporary decor matched with diverse selection of  trendy, modern interpretations of Japanese food.  A great combination.The food is bold.  Flavors always pronounced.  No dish is overly delicate and it works perfectly in a social setting with good drinks and great friends.  It is a running theme at social house that you should be social.  Share your food.  Portions are large and with the exception of mains are plated to be shared.The cold starters are all very fresh.  Top props to the yellow tail. Each piece topped with a jalapeno slice, micro cilantro, a hint of garlic (garlic dust), and a tart but salty calamansi soy.  The subtle flavor of the fish is quickly lost but its texture is the perfect foil to the bold flavors.  The toro tartar is also worth a try.  Love the texture from the arare (Japanese rice crackers).The rock shrimp tempura starts the list of great hot dishes. Sweet shrimp surrounded by a fluffy yet crisp outside and served with a spicy ponzu dipping sauce.  Perfect with any drink.  The citrus peel miso cod in a lettuce cup is phenomenal.  Deeply infused miso flavor and a juicy peace of fish.  Add the sauteed foie to it and the richness will blow your mind.Sushi? The crispy eel, shrimp tempura, avocado, with a spicy aioli and teriyaki unagi sauce make for GREAT eats.Several visits and the food never disappoints.Service is very good and never intrusive.Although there is a good and fairly priced wine list,  its more fun sampling their cocktails and matching it with the food.Note: Sure you can dine here alone but that wouldn't that be antisocial?Recommended.I came here during a busy night and I do recommend getting recommendations since this is a place where parties tend to linger and drink.  I had two rolls the Kalbi Beef and Seared Albacore both of which were tasty but the Kalbi won out since it's not often I eat beef in a roll but I think the Kochuchang sauce really pulled it all together.  This place has a full bar and great sake menu.  It has great intimate lighting and can be loud but that helps keeps the conversation intimate and not have to listen to anyone else.  I've had a sit down dinner and spent time at the bar with friends and enjoyed both, if you're in Crystals and want a fun place this is a great stop while window shopping.I love "family style" Japanese restaurants. Even though "family style" may remind you of Bucca Di Beppo, I assure you this is nothing like that!  Let's break it down for you... order a plethora of items and dig in! I love when you can trust a server to pick out the best items and just let them go for it!  We just told them a price point per person we wanted to stick with and off he went.  Honestly, for $60 per person, we ended up with A LOT of food.  I was a little nervous, considering Japanese can get pricey, but by the end of the meal I could hardly finish the last dish (although I did:)I think the marinade for each sashimi we got made each one, topped with the extremely fresh fish made those the stand outs of the evening for me. I thought they were all killer and would recommend any of these:Yellowtail Jalapeno - garlic, cilantro, calamansi Soy with a fried jalapeno to topSalmon Wasabi - wasabi crème, lemon Soy, crispy shallot, chivesFluke Soy Salt - chili Oil, soy salt, citrusKobe Sashimi - a play on thinly sliced kobe beef, yumm-o!We also ordered the Cod Bibb Lettuce Cups. I thought the contrast between the cool lettuce and fried cod was really good.  I know this wasn't a favorite of the table, but I really enjoyed it!Our last course was the sushi. The angry tuna roll was pretty amazing. I mean, deep fried sushi roll? Who wouldn't love it! The seared albacore was good and so was the yellowtail, but angry tuna, the star of the show, for sushi at least. I would definitely recommend making a reservation before you get to Vegas, but one thing I will note is that we came in around 7pm and the place was dead, so you may be able to squeeze in last minute.  Ambiance is classy yet hip, so wear your hot cocktail dresses ladies and for dudes... something other than jeans and sneakers will do!I believe that good ramen can cure most any non-communicable disease related ailments, and great ramen can entirely change your day. The bowl I had at Social House lies somewhere in between, but considering it's found in a strange land where such simple pleasures are hard to find I found it worthy of extremely high praise. I cannot say that I tried any other dishes here, as unfortunately on the day I visited they weren't offering the lunch special that's available during the week which includes 2 other courses in addition to the ramen, however, this one bowl was enough for me to lock Social House in as a regular stop when visiting Vegas.My service was also exemplary here, which isn't an easy task considering I sat at the bar and only had one item to eat, but Jonah managed to do his best to keep me from dozing off and winding up with noodles on my face at 1 in the afternoon. Yeah, long night watching the sun come up, although thankfully I wasn't stuck out at the Vegas Motor Speedway like my friends who attended that night's EDC event, which was shut down due to wind, trapping everyone in an ecstasy induced frenzy for a few hours. From what I heard though the Steve Aoki protest set was pretty memorable and well worth the headaches. Jonah seemed to know all the blondes who looked like they had just left a "Peepshow" audition by name and typical menu orders as they strolled in, so clearly the guy is doing something right.But, back to the ramen. It's about $17 for a bowl with pork belly and tonkatsu broth, and I think slightly cheaper if you want the seafood or miso versions...pricey, but what here isn't? I definitely recommend the pork belly though, even if you're vegetarian, because it's Vegas and whatnot, so if you can cheat on your husband you can cheat on your diet (and it might help take your mind off all the meat you had in your face at Thunder Down Under, which you just know your "best friend" Orphelium has photos of and will be eagerly awaiting the next time you forget to return her organic sewing kit to accidentally break them out in front of Thadly). The pork in this bowl is quite plentiful (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g?select=nHoa4e7h9Fe8ocEHkMI44w#-PhxZpR8PqXM_IFuzOupXg), and after a minute or two of soaking in the steaming broth it's extremely delicate and easy to dice up with your chop sticks. The broth itself has a good bit of depth as well, but I highly recommend dumping the entire side portion of pepper and spices and crispy garlic in for added flavor. By the time I got to the bottom of the bowl there was a really nice subtle burn going on in my mouth, exactly the thing I needed to get the day started in the right direction.The setting here is pretty sexy (it's located inside the super luxurious Crystals mall), in a bold and brooding teahouse sort of way, and while those ideas may seem rather juxtaposed, I promise it works. I would love to return to Social House for a full course dinner meal, if this ramen is any indication, but for the time being I'm content in knowing I found what is likely one of the only places, and quite possibly the best, to offer up one of my favorite post-drinking-night cravings.Funny story: in 2007 I went on a blind date to Social House when it was operated by someone else in TI.  The guy insisted on ordering for me: sunomono (cucumber) salad (the size of a soy sauce dish) and 1 order of tamago (egg) sushi that he split with me.  No joke!  We sat outside and that was my first view of the siren show, ugh.  After that I tore off to Godiva in Fashion Show and bought myself chocolate.  Good riddance.  Fast forward, Social House left TI, and I forgot about it.  Then I was in Crystals one day walking around and saw an ad for desserts in restaurants there.  The yuzu frangipane called my name.Last night Eric R. and I attended a really cool event at Social House in Crystals.  It was a sake lesson from a sake sommelier, paired with different bites from the food menu.  First we had junmai premium sake paired with yellowtail sashimi with tempura jalapeno, garlic dust, tiny cilantro, and calamansi soy.  Did someone say tempura jalapeno slices?  Yes indeedy.  Next, we sampled another sake, some higher level, paired with big eye tuna sashimi, sweet chili sauce, crispy shallot, red onion, and negi oil.The next dish was amaaaaazing: nasu spicy miso: small delicate roasted Japanese eggplant with spicy miso glaze.  This was truly delicious!!!  Our last dish was a set of rolls: salmon avocado, hama-chimi (hamachi, avocado, jalapeno-cilantro chimichurri, garlic chips), and negi toro (fatty tuna with green onion).  Our final sake was Ty-Ku coconut flavored nigori (unfiltered).  This was actually really delicious.  I have long been a coconut fan but I am on a huge coconut kick lately.  This one is worth purchasing, and I can get it at Total Wine or Lee's according to the sommelier.This ended up being a really fun event.  At the end, I ordered the yuzu frangipane, which is made to order because it is a molten cake!  Warm almond cake, molten yuzu cream cheese filling, raspberry sorbet, almond toffee, and fresh raspberries.  It was tasty, more like almond than yuzu.  The idea of it is really good, but I am looking for yuzu to punch my taste buds, so this in the end was not quite yuzu-y enough for me :) and it cost $12.  Anyway, I would come back for some bites here, especially that eggplant!I haven't been to Social House since it was located in TI years ago. From what i can remember there seems to be some similar items on the menu. Of course my guy and I decided to go big and get the 10 course Omakase w/ a side of a 5 course saki tasting. I'm not as young as I used to be and I just can't hang with 10 courses anymore! Luckily my guy can pick up the slack! Everything was delicious -  kobe sashimi, scallops, braised beef, mango pudding and these leche donuts, holy crap! I drank too much saki so I honestly don't remember it all.At the end the chef came to talk to us. When he found out we were local he told us to come back and make sure we mentioned we were locals who had been there before so he could make sure we got to try something different. This made our night. There is no point in doing a chefs tasting and spending all that money to taste something you have already tasted. We'll go again to see what else the chef can do for us.This review is for their happy hour only. We walked in and being a Thursday at 6PM, it was not busy. As the happy hour is only available in the bar lounge area, we were seated at a table next to the shuttered windows looking outside (to the mall walkway). The happy hour menu consists of cold items, warm items, rolls and beverages. I ordered the most expensive happy hour drink... $9 for a sparkling sake Bellini, and it was yum. So easy to drink, I could have easily had 3 of them. For food, we had: Ramen with poached egg and pork belly - O.M.G. This is a hidden gem for ramen. The Tonkotsu broth was creamy and rich (thinking about it makes my mouth water). With the poached egg, the broth became even more buttery. Amazing. There were 2 slices pork belly I thought there was a good mixture of fat and meat, but it was perfected with the seared outer layer. You can tell it's a good sear when it's still firm after sitting in broth for a couple minutes. Some of the noodles were stuck together but at least they were all cooked and not al dente. Salmon tartare with Taro chips - I didn't get a picture of this because it was our first dish and I was bordering hangry, so I devoured it. The taro chips were house made and fresh. The salmon tartare was good but it came with a load of Ikura on top, and I'm not fan. Also, there was a layer of wasabi? cream in the middle which added to the creamy texture of the salmon and gave good color contract but I didn't think it added to the dish. Thai Beef Salad - these were essentially Thai beef butter lettuce cups. The beef was tender and flavorful but this was certainly not spicy and I was expecting spicy. I guess I could have asked for sriracha. Kalbi beef roll - I usually don' like rolls and especially cooked food rolls, but this was not bad. I think this is how they made it.... take a long slice of cooked kalbi (cut out the fat), bread with panko, flash fry, and then roll in sushi rice. Topping each roll was the Korean sweet spicy red sauce. All in all, great food, great value. Would definitely come back!We were on our way to the Cosmo Pool for Lorde and wanted a quick small meal, so we decided to give their happy hour a try.I arrived first before my friends, and when I approached the hostess stand, I was "greeted" by a very bitchy hostess. I told her there were two more people coming, and we were there for happy hour, so she leads me to the bar area and gives me one menu (not even the happy hour menu) and promptly leaves. I sat for a good 10 minutes before someone even came over (the place was dead) my friends arrive and someone finally makes it around. We place our orders, I went with Salmon Tartare and Steamed Broccoli with Calamansi Soy. The salmon was so salty, it wasn't edible, I ended up eating the taro chips it came with and the broccoli was all dried out. For 2 items and 2 drinks, my bill (with tip) was $40. Sorry Social House, this is "not so happy hour". Won't be coming back.This place would have had a full 5 stars if our hostess had paid attention to us when we walked in. She didn't really even welcome us which only lead to us sitting anywhere near the bar area and waiting for a few minutes before someone noticed that we were there to hand us over a menu and gives us a better welcome. I did notice she was on her phone while at the front as a hostess, not cool if you ask me. She also left a few minutes later so I am assuming she didn't really care being that it might have been the end of her shift. Ok on to the better things about this place. Super cute and cozy, somewhat romantic atmosphere. Our waiter was nice and even helpful when we asked about the drinks. We also happened to show up during their happy hour. Their happy hour menu is pretty decent, 5pm -8pm every day INCLUDING WEEKENDS!!We ordered their kokonattsu ($8) coconut flavor, semi strong drink and a Mothra Japanese Bellini ($9) sweet and refreshing, both drinks were easy to drink, enjoy and get a nice little buzz going. We decided to try their Angry Tuna Roll ($10) to share. The Angry Tuna Roll consisted of spicy tuna (duh!), avocado, a little jalapeno that wasn't spicy, and sweet amazu ponzu onion (which was super delicious). The roll is also deep fried. BOMB.COM!! I loved it! We were very tempted after the roll to order some more food such as their salmon tartare, kobe slidders and ramen.. Gosh,  that only means we totally have to go back!! Get a few drinks in, some tasty food and roam the Crystals shopping center. I wonder if I would have gotten a few more drinks in the husband, if I would have had any lucky coming out with a new purse or fancy shoes hahaha. Will definitely come back to Social House.

My office is now with in walking distance, but we have been going here since it was Dee's. We being a couple of guys and I. So today Bruce said; lets go to lunch, I say, ok. He then says; I know anywhere except 5Th ave. The boy knows me so well ;-[) I tell him no I will go today, it has been a while since I have given in and gone with the masses. I just do not like the place. So we walk over and are greeted by a bubbly waitress. This place always has nice wait people. She talks with us for a few minutes and then takes our order. Oh the food, the food. I order a french dip with Cole slaw and a side of onion rings. Bruce has his usual a BLT with well done bacon and fries.Now mind you we are the only folks ordering at the time and still it takes an unusual amount of time to get the food. Which by the way would have been better if we had never gotten our food. What I get is roast beef cut thickly and with the grain. Now anyone who likes a french dip knows the meat should be supple and sliced thinly, piled nicely on the bun. It should also have a rich beef flavour as should the au jus. I mean even the lowly of the low line cook should know one slices meat against the grain, always. The bun on which it sat was just that, a meat seat. I also love Cole slaw and usually will eat what is served, not this. Totally lacking any inspiration resulting in no flavour. The rings looked good, but looks can be deceiving.So Bruce you are right, any place but 5Th ave.

So you're looking hot and feeling the fire in your white tuxedo. You have a bodacious babe on each arm. They're licking their lips waiting for you to roll a 7 at the craps table because that means a wild menage a trois with Dom Perignon champagne and caviar at the fanciest penthouse suite in the Venetian. You let one of the bodacious babes blow on the dice. You roll. CRAPS! You lose!The bodacious babes leave you for the dweeb on a winning streak at the next table. You have to kill your reservation at AquaKnox, the Venetian's most exclusive restaurant. Where do you go, loser? Why, you come to the second floor food court and eat at Nathan's, of course. Yes, they have one here in the otherwise plush casino hotel. I guess the food court is for the rest of us who are too stingy to consider dropping some do-re-mi to dine at the nicer places.I had the Chili-Cheese Dog with their standout Crinkle-Cut Fries. You know, the tray of fries with the red plastic pick on top that makes you think for a moment that you went to Sizzler's and ordered a steak. Those are kinda too good in a greasy way. The dog not so much. Look at the picture I uploaded in the gallery. Is that appetizing to you? Oh really. I guess I know which side of the railroad tracks you come from.FOOD - 2.5 stars...a dog and those friesAMBIANCE - 2 stars...it's a food court...what d'ya expect? a hostess with bodacious ta-ta's to take you to your plastic table?SERVICE - 2 stars...uhhh...what?TOTAL - 2 stars...sorry Nathan, Coney Island just called for you

My stomach, my palate, and hot dogs have at best what could be described as an abusive relationship.  My love of chili, cheese, jalapeno hot dogs hurts so good.So if you love hot dogs and are in pittsburgh missing a Chicago style hot dog, a New York style dog, or a Texas chili cheese dog then Franktuary is the place to go.Hot diggity dog these are darn good hot dogs!I am ashamed at not coming here much sooner!  But in my lame defense, it's tucked away in in the back of Trinity Cathedral.  All tiny and unassuming.  Even when you first walk into the "church" doors, you have to ask yourself, am I coming here to confess some sins or eat some sinfully delicious dogs?After reading through the many reviews on here I decided to opt for the "healthy" locavore dog.  It's awesome they carry this particular dog because it's made local AND doesn't have all those little mystery ingrediants that our other little dog friend has.  As soon as I read banana peppers I was sold on the Chicago Imposter gourmet dog.  It also comes with a whole pick, relish, tomatoes and celery salt.  It was really a great dog, although I still had to add ketchup, because we are in fact deeply in love, to the point where I have to add it to anything burger, dog, fry related.  I was sad to find out they were out of their slaw because I'm a huge fan of the slaw, when made right.  I opted to get the Greek Salad instead.  Good for me they were out of the slaw because the Greek Salad was KILLER!  I had to ask if it was made in house and it in fact is made by one of the chefs there.  It comes HIGHLY suggested!  I had to carefully inspect the salad so I could figure out how to make it at home.  Artichokes, cucumbers, banana peppers, orange peppers, onion, tomatoes and olive oil....amazingness!  To be completely honest, I don't think I'd have been disappointed by any of the sides because I had to steal a taste of my friends baked beans and they were also stellar!  Mega plus, they carry Boyle's soda!  I love me some Diet Cream Soda (I know...diet + hot dog = defeats the purpose).  AND, they give you a fun little gummy hot dog treat.  So freakin' cute!Totally cheap option for anyone working/lunching or visiting dahntahn Pixburgh!  Then you can head into the church and tell God how thankful you are he created hot dogs.  Amen!

The best meal I have had in a very long time. I'm so excited to review this place i don't even know where to start...!Met a friend here last night and decided to grab a drink at the bar before sitting down. The bartender was a tall bald guy (cant remember his name) but he was so awesome! he made me a ginger mojito but used vodka instead of rum, it was delish!We sat in the gorgeous intimate dinning room. With the high ceilings and kitchen behind a glass wall it was a very enjoyable setting. Our waiter (Arty i believe his name was) was amazing. very informative and accommodating with my peanut allergy request. He suggested I start off with a Lychee Lemon Drop. this was mixology at its finest. Sweet but refreshing and with rock candy sugar i cant wait to try to replicate it.We started off with the lobster pancakes as an appetizer. More of a crepe then a traditional pancake filled with plumb lobster meat, mushrooms, red chili, scallions and dressed a lobster and coconut milk sauce they were melt in your mouth goodness.Moving on to the main course. We decided to split two entrees. Grilled Garlic Shrimp- Huge prawns over a bed of black fettuccine in a red coconut curry sauce they were mouth watering delish. The sauce truly made the dish. With the spice of the curry and a sweetness from the coconut milk it was the perfect combination.Our waiter then suggested the Short Ribs- totally melt in your mouth meat accompanied with goat cheese mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of Wasabi mashed potatoes... which i ate the entire portion. don't judge me.I also had the Strawberry Burst cocktail. Made with cachaca (a Brazilian rum) it was packed full of strawberry flavor in every drink. We finished our meal with a bottle of pinot gregio. This was an amazing experience and i highly recommend it to everyone.

ok, first review, here goes....sangria- killer, and if i recall correctly they have a pretty fancy happy hour, so i recommend a dd.guacammus (guacamole mixed with hummus) yes and yes.ticoz chop chop- i'm a huge fan of salads with lots of stuff in it. i really don't dig it when i get a big pile of lettuce with a few random veggies thrown on top. there are so many great veggies out there. live a little. the chop chop is great, jicama, hominy, chic peas, red beans, black olives, etc. good stuff.as far as the rest of the menu goes i really couldn't tell you, because for some unknown reason they decide to put chicken stock in about everything, and i happen to be vegetarian. my question is this, why on earth would you find it necessary to ostracize a substantial portion of the population to "add flavor" to your rice? no one notices anyway! i dont think i am asking too much, really. i'm ok with the fact that there isn't any tofu on the menu (i mean it would be nice, but hey), but can you please leave the rice alone?!?!? seriously. i don't get it.ok, so maybe i'm just bitter because i've had my eye on the coconut ginger curry rice since ticoz opened. whatever.Oh, how I love thee Ticoz.  From your close proximity to my work making for the perfect happy hour spot, to your very large glasses of pinot grigio highlighted by your awesome patio with the couches.  And, let's not forget about the great food and the wonderfully adorable bartenders and servers.My first time at Ticoz was last summer for a birthday happy hour.  It was hot and sweaty, but I had a great time.  About 10 of us gathered on the patio and talked and laughed until the sun went down.  I've had quite a few happy hours here and 1 lunch and one evening meal.  The lunch was amazing!  I don't remember what it was called, I believe "palm frond chicken" or something to that effect.  Their chop salad is to-die-for with a light dressing and corn, garbanzos.  Just amazing.  Their service is always great and when I was going in regularly they always remembered me and knew what my friend and I wanted to drink.  They've taken down their sign (don't know why) so it is a little harder to find now and its kindof a bitch getting there when 7th St has that suicide lane thing going (thats a whole nother review) but I will always love this place and will deal with the traffic to get there.I'd been wanting to try Ticoz since it opened. There was so much buzz surrounding it for a couple months after it opened, and some of my gay friends still rave about it. So I finally tried it on Saturday for lunch and was a little dissapointed.First off, I don't care if you are gay. That is absolutely your choice and I respect you making choices for yourself, but please for the love of god hire ONE person that still talks like he has a pair of testicles. Every waiter, bartender, and host that we encountered was almost inaudible and spoke in such a high tone of voice that I actually thought I was speaking to women.Secondly, being the only table in the bar (+1 table in the patio area) should mean that we get decent service. Watching 4 staff members stand in a close proximity circle behind the bar talking about how much they drank last night and forgetting to bring us more drinks, a bill, my credit card back after I paid the bill, etc. is a little disconcerting. Perhaps even more disconcerting than my lack of ability to spell or my run on sentences. Finally, when I tell you that I think your Pork Chile Verde dish has an almost inedible salt content, and you reply back to me "I've been telling them that for a long time and they wont change it," it's obvious that something is going wrong in your lines of communication. You wouldn't tell me that if a) you didn't also feel that way or b) you've heard other customers say the same thing. Regardless, what you should have said is "well I appreciate the feedback sir, may I offer you another dish with a lower salt content? and I'll be sure to let the chef know what you thought as well."The atmosphere was cool, but not nearly up to Fez or Switch levels. It's obvoius that I am in the minority, but this restaurant really didn't score many points in my book.4 STARS???If I could I would be all up in giving 0 stars in this motherfucker.I visited Ticoz based on the many good reviews. FAIL!Is TICOZ short for TOSTITOS?Because I swear... the chips served by the waiter were out of a cellophane bag from Costco. Margarita.... more ice than anything. Bleh.Service.... poor. We waited to be seated. We waited to have a drink order taken. Waited to get our drinks. The main courses were bizarre to say the least.The "tamales" were more like 2 scoops of sweet corn polenta.The shrimp were in a pile next to it, rubbery, frozen, slightly off flavored. The rice and beans, generic.The burgers were more like sliders. I think the burgers are prepared far in advance and assembled prior to serving. The bun was made soggy by the watery salsa. The mayo... became watery from the salsa as well. The cole slaw was bleh. The waffle fries were decent.The waiter was just weird. He was disengaged, unfriendly, and sluggish.Yo what be up wit yo foolz an yo fo stah reviews?!@!One of the worst places I have eaten in Phoenix - super trendy looking, with miserable vittles.1 star, only because there is no way to give 0 stars.Word is bond!In a city teeming with Mexican and Spanish cuisine, Ticoz offers more.  Its melange of Latin inspired dishes, lovingly prepared by Chef Holly Gibson, offer a variety of flavors from Puerto Penasco (Ticoz Street Tacos) to the Caribbean (Coconut GInger Curry Rice).I had the opportunity to speak with Chef Holly when coming here for a "YAP." (Yelper Appreciation Party)  Invitees were lured by drink tickets and a specially prepared spread.  Ticoz' reputation had previously awakened my culinary curiosity, so this was my first experience of the restaurant and its food.Ahhh, the sight before me when I walked into the restaurant brought back visions of nights in Puerto Vallarta; ordering tacos and tostadas from street vendors at 2 in the morning.  Or was it the talk I had with Chef Holly, when she talked of her inspiration for one of Ticoz Signatures?  Though she grew up in Arizona (so rare, i know!) she spent much time in Mexico, vacationing with family.  It is here where she discovered the "street taco" and brought it back to Phoenix. I was to enjoy four of these ambrosial tacos the night of the event.  House braised meats on soft corn tortillas, festooned with cabbage, and blanketed with chipotle and an avocado crema.  To give the right amount of tribute, I want to describe Chef Holly's simple secrets to the taco meats.  The chicken is braised  in pineapple and chipotle, the beef in lime and cilantro, and the pork in orange and clove.  These make for distinct flavor combinations, and the juiciest and most tender meat.   The tacos caused a great well being, as everyone was magically transported to the Mayan riviera, with a cold margarita in hand.I have to digress here, because i just typed one of my favorite words.  Margarita.  I easily enjoyed four of them, to go with the four tacos.  I could not help myself, they were pure titillation.  Not to mention, all the exotic libations are1/2 off between the hours of 4:00p-6:30p.   An unbeatable value, considering the average tropical cocktail here costs only $7.   In addition, the owners were extremely generous in offering its "Yelping" patrons two free drink tickets - even for 16oz. of jubilation.  The drinks deserve a list all on their own:#1 Coconut Margarita.  (who would have thunk that agave and coconut make great bedfellows? a first for me, now i will never go back to anything less than...)#2  Passion Fruit Margarita. (a contender for the number one spot. perfect balance of ingredients - so much so that one hardly tastes the tequila and instead thinks they are plucking Maracuya from the vine.)#3 Blackberry Margarita. (hold me back! I thought there was nothing more divine than a blackberry capirinha.)#4 Lychee Margarita. (this sweet and fragranced fruit makes the cadillac margarita pale in comparison)I will not admit to drinking any more than the above stated, but I did sample the other signature cocktails such as the kiwi white sangria, and the peach mojito.  With so many exotic and enticing blendings of flavors, I was overwhelmed.  The list of flavor combinations for mojitos and sangrias, as well as margaritas and martinis goes on...I only wished my liver had not been so well fortified after my drinking expedition.  I would have explored the wilds of this potable jungle, but I settled instead with putting the flowers, that came as decorative adornments in the drinks, in my hair.So, after that wonderful veer, my focus was back on the food.  Other items my taste buds explored on the generous spread were the BBQ meat sliders, as well as the pork tostillados and guacummus.  What is guacammus?  It is Ticoz famous blend of house made guacamole and garlic hummus - a unique gathering of mediterranean and caribbean.  Go Chef Holly!What one will find here on the appetizer menu are the characteristic  southwestern and even south american comfort foods such as empanadas (a taste of buenos aires) and flautas.  In addition to the guacammus, the basket of corn waffle fries seasoned wtih lime and chipotle distinguishes this eatery from the rest.More than a half dozen salads grace the menu, with unique ingredients such as grilled peaches or hearts of palm.  Burgers and sandwhiches are available for the unadventurous, but the signature dishes is where Ticoz defines itself as a Latin Restaurant.From the house Paella prepared in a citrus saffron broth, to the shrimp and lobster arroz in crab filled coconut rice - Ticoz will give you a small tour of the Latin World.Consider this 3.5 stars for now...a return trip is merited.Chef Holly wowed me with the delicious food at the UYE YAP at Ticoz a week ago.  So much so that we decided to return for a lunch date.I was not as impressed on the lunch date.  I had the burgers (two decent sized burgers served on slider sized buns) and subbed green beans for my fries.  The burgers were fine.  The green beans were pretty good but it was kind of difficult getting to them.  I had to talk my way to subbing a vegetable for the fries (I was on a low-carb diet...mercifully done with that) because "they don't do substitutions"...they "don't really have vegetables"..."maybe we can do something"..."I think we can do some green beans."All in all I will return to Ticoz for a third visit and update from there.  It was kind of odd to be wowed the first visit and underwhelmed the second.Why the hell did no one drag me to Ticoz before now? Seriously, you all call yourselves my friends? I'm disappointed and saddened everyone kept this secret to themselves.As usual I was craving breakfast this morning and was able to convince the amazing Tony A. to meet me somewhere. He recommended Ticoz. I will go out on a limb and say this probably ties for one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Similar to Bri D., I am practice a non-tomato diet, and therefore, usually have issues with many places I eat at. I suspected I would have to order everything today minus tomato. However, I was clearly wrong.Let's start with the salsa and chips. For brunch. Yum. One of the salsas was pineapple based, which in itself would've made me completely content. Had my breakfast not arrived in a timely fashion I would've asked for them to take the other two away and replace it with three bowls of the pineapple salsa. Establishments that can make a great salsa without the use of tomatoes are hard to find. Along with my salsa and chips (I swear I didn't eat the salsa only with a spoon despite my desire to) I had a $2 mimosa. Yep. Only $2. It was super fantastic and had minimal amount of pulp which I also appreciate, not to mention that it looked sunshiny and happy.I went with the huevos rancheros for breakfast, which is comprised of 3 eggs any way you like, green chili, pulled pork, and potatoes. Um, please Sir, may I have another? It was one of those just about perfectly sized meals (had I not front loaded on salsa and chips) that made me all happy inside as I consumed it. The server told me it would be spicy. It did have a kick, but a little more of one would've been welcome.Stepping away from the food, the service was prompt and the staff was super friendly from the moment I walked in the door before I could take my sunglasses off until I was headed out the door on my way home. Very conversational. Very prompt. Very much appreciated. The prices were also extremely reasonable. Although the menu for brunch is limited, at least half the items appealed to me, which means there is hope of a future trip.I adored the laid back decor which was perfect on a Sunday morning. The colors were warm and inviting and the seating was creative. The bigger chairs at the table though almost don't work for short people, but I managed. I want to go back again. Now.Maybe this will be better:The food was gross period. IN MY OPINION (that's for the owner)  and the beef tacos tasted like what I would imagine dog food would taste like. Wet, nasty .99 cent dog food. It was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had, the service was snarky and bitchy and on a Saturday night it was DEAD. *shocking*. I see a lot more nights like that in your future Ticoz. This place will never see another dime of my money. So sue me.  :)You can't point fingers and blame others when clearly inferior product (In my opinion) is the problem. I have no ill will toward any establishment. If you want good reviews, provide quality ingredients and good service. It's that simple. If this much effort was put into creating a positive dining experience, I wouldn't have written such a negative review in the first place. Now go away.I'm the newest fan of Ticoz after trying it last week for the first time. Myself and two wonderful ladies...shout out to Dottsy Z!..hit up happy hour on a beautiful Wednesday evening. Only happy hour turned into happy HOURS! Things I loved: *the over all vibe and styling of the place. Great decor and great hint of Spanish flair without over doing it. *the food was excellent. I had some chips and salsa which were pretty standard. The tacos, although, were outstanding. I had one chicken and one beef. The beef was AWESOME! I am trying to eat red meat only two times per week and I may just have to have both meals be these tacos! *The service was great as well. I've heard people say this place is "gay friendly". This day and age, "friendly" anything is wonderful. But seriously, our server/bartender was very knowledgeable, friendly, and prompt. I can't wait to head back to dine on the patio and explore the menu more!here goes, Ticoz, a bad reviewafraid. what will the owner do?see i don't harbor mal-intentand haven't  broken, TOS yetso please don't, Ticoz, jump my shitlike you did that other chickwho didn't care much for your foodcalled her out, i thought that rudeso risking hate mail, well, here goesthe food we tried at Ticoz, blowsi know, i'm sorry, wasn't goodi'd dish more stars, you know i wouldif the host had greeted us within five minutes, in no rushturns out he also waited tablesTicoz, you're busy, and surely ableto hire someone, for up frontto meet and great and seat at lunchliked our waiter, real nice guytook our order, things we triedincluded 'pozole'  served with limeand cabbage, oops, i'll pass next timei love posole, when done rightbut only managed, a few bitesalso the blue corn enchiladaswith sour cream sauce, sorry, nottafan, too heavy and too rich  stuffed shredded chicken, gotta bitchsame goes for your shredded pork tortaboth proteins dry, the flavor sortalike they'd seen a couple daysin a steam table, tasted that wayon the plus side, décor and vibecozy, hip, way cool insideprivate dining room, great bartrick patio all worth more starsbut the food, Ticoz, is why we camenot for drinks, though I must sayi could imagine, hanging outcocktails only, highly doubti'd order food, but never saynev....maybe the chef, had a bad dayFirst of all  BIG THANKS to Alex our waiter. Saddled with the party of women celebrating, he never was rude or impatient but handled us like a pro at customer service!  He made the evening click with smoothly timed drinks and ordering. Brought some of my friends to TICOZ  for a go away party for a friend  getting married. So glad we came here..the ambiance was festive yet upscale.  We loved the food , music , guacahummus and the the nice big table which we hogged all evening. The gals loved the guacahummus , salsa and chips , a great start with drinks , we had wonderful entrees  like the special of chicken pasta and my delicious blue corn enchiladas which I would gladly have again. Nice touch with the complimentary  Churro with ice cream and raspberry sauce. I will be back!I feel like I've been all over with my reviews for this place, but don't worry, this may be the last update. My last experience at Ticoz was awful... It seems like as soon as Lola Tapas closed, everything went completely downhill. The happy hour went way up (used to be $2 sangria on Tuesdays now $3.50), they hired a new staff, service became crap during busy hours, they altered their menu (to cheapen it up) - like Kat S said, there used to be 3 salsas that came with freshly fried chips...now, there is one crappy salsa that, last time I visited, came with cold, stale chips - and to top things off, their sangrias lack the greatness in flavor and quality that I once saw in them.It really sucks to regularly go somewhere and watch it crumble. Ticoz initially ticked me off, but then won me over for the longest time. I recommended people go there and have a great experience (and sangria), but like any roller coaster relationship, the highs and lows are beginning to take their toll on me, and I know I need to just let go. I may wind up at Ticoz if a friend of mine wants to go, but I won't be leading the pack there anytime soon. #sadfaceWhoa!  What happen to Ticoz? This place use to be awesome.  As I waited for an eternity to get a drink I looked around the place and it looked like it was in desperate need of some TLC - furniture and carpets need to be cleaned, walls need to be repainted.  The plants were all dead in the women's restroom.  This place is dying a slow death.  What used to be a happening place for happy hour was dead, it was sad hour.  The service was terrible!  We were sitting in an empty bar and it still took a while to get a drink.  My friends and I were going to order apps but they never came back to ask us if we wanted food, thank god too because we would have had to stay there longer.  We chugged our drinks and bounced out.I used to really like Ticoz -- like 3-4 years ago. In fact, I'm surprised I hadn't already reviewed it! Loved the drinks and had two favorite entrees: the grilled burrito with fish and the coconut curry rice with chicken. Both are still on the menu and neither are as delicious as they once were. In fact, they're both kinda gross now! :(The grilled fish burrito contains breaded fish and the breading texture is mushy inside the burrito. The flavor is weak.The rice is skimpy on the chicken and you are given the option of if you want it spicy or not. It used to just have a nice mild spice to it. Now? Now, it is sweet! Blech! And, if you make it spicy, it's still more sweet than spicy.Sorry to say, I'm in NO rush to go back.  :(The food here is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. No idea what's going on back in the kitchen, but they really have it going on. Our four top was immediately seated on a lazy Saturday morning. Ok, maybe my Friday wine brain thought it was morning. I'm not really sure. But we were in the market for eggs.My eyeballs read, "$2.99 weekend brunch drinks!"So....I asked what a Greyhound and a Cape Cod consisted of.  I heard mwah mwah mwah VODKA...and then something that sounded like a Bay Breeze. Then Jordan recommend a "Big Girl Mimosa". I assumed (incorrectly) this was also part of the weekend brunch drink pricing. Yes, the drink was $2.99. However, when the bill came there was a supplement for $1.83 for a shot.  Boo! Hiss! Not really a big deal, but, per discussion with the two other adults at the table, none of us heard the additional pricing for the shot. (Nor did the highly intellectual teenager.) The Big Girl Mimosa was really easy to drink, a bit tart for my friend, as it was heavy on the grape fruit side. (I sucked it down like a camel in need of water.)  See my photo for evidence of empty glass.Alright, so I ate out today with my favorite family that allows fork-fuls of food to be traded. So I got to taste four very different things. I'd order ALL of them again. Listed in my preference order, here's what we Hoover'd down (like the savages we are, but with linen):1. Lobster Egg Benedict2. Mexican Eggs Benedict2. Huevos Ranchero3. Hot Cake Trio with Schreiner's SausageThe Lobster Egg Benedict really is something. It's hard to describe. The sauce isn't too heavy for a benedict and there's plenty of lobster on the plate. I was a bit envious of this dish.  To use my usual sound for food this was "Hhhhhooooohhhhh my good." Yeah, that good. GET IT.The kid at the table went for the Mexican Eggs Benedict. He pretty much orders chorizo at every restaurant in Phoenix. (I don't understand teenagers.) Buuut, if anyone is an expert on chorizo, I'd say this smarty pants would be. He liked it. I did it too. And he even let me take THREE fork passes. The green chile hollandaise is hot but not "burn your eyes down" hot.  He called it "intense". I agree.I went with the Huevos Ranchero as I wanted something with eggs over easy and meat. I asked for a recommendation and Jordan suggested this. I absolutely LOVED the spice on everything. The eggs were great. The texture of the stuff underneath the eggs - eh. But I still ate 80% of my meal :) If you're in the market for a staple - the pancakes and sausage are WONDERFUl. I put them last as they're basics. But they were really well delivered. The sausages "spurted" when poked and "popped". They weren't over cooked or rubbery. The three stars are for service. I'm bummed about this. Although we were checked on my friend's ice tea was not filled often enough. (It was empty most of the time.) Nor were we asked if we wanted another round of drinks. (Strange!). And then there was the odd thing with the pricing on the Big Girl Mimosa. Otherwise, I'd Four Star this all the way! They have a super cute patio, a nice bar area and plenty of table seating. I'd give this place another go round!Oh Ticoz.. You've joined my great happy hour list! =)My friend wanted a Mojito one night.. So of course Yelp came to the rescue and I heard this place has some of the BEST mojitos. You guys were not lying! lolWe came after 9 because they have happy hour. Quite a selection actually. A majority of their drinks are on happy hour and pretty much half of their appetizer menu. For the drinks we ordered the passion fruit mojito and the mango mojito. I really liked the mango mojito. It tasted soooo fresh! I ordered the street tacos. You get two tacos for $5. So I got the shredded chicken and beef. I really liked the chicken, the beef one was a bit salty for my taste. I really liked their waffle fries too. They're seasoned and very crispy.I really liked this place! Great happy hour items and prices and their Mojitos were really worth the long drive for me. lol. I definitely want to come back to try their other Mojitos not to mention  I love me some happy hour! Til next time Ticoz! =)

Bellying up to the bar, the Husband and I wanted a light dinner before our movie date.  We ordered Pan Roast with Lobster to share.  In the meantime, we enjoyed their complimentary baked items.  No cheesy flat breads this time, but the sesame one was available.  They also had warm sourdough bread with butter that wasn't too cold to spread and it was just so good.  When our pan roast arrived, they were nice enough to split the portion into two bowls without charging us for a split plate charge (nor us asking them to).  There were chunks of lobster meat, which surprised us both, and it tasted so good with the warm bread dipping into the yummy goodness.  We left satisfied! Service was fabulous - from the staff working behind the counter and the staff coming around from the floor.A friend and I decided to try this place for their $29.99 AYCE Crab Legs. This comes with soup or salad and dessert.  I was excited since I hadn't had crab legs in a very long time.  We decided to sit at the bar.   They weren't overly busy in the entire place so I figured service wasn't going to be a problem.  Big fat WRONG! Our waitress took a while to even come over to get our drink orders...  and even to bring them to us! We both ordered the New England clam chowder. They offer Manhattan also. This also took a while to get placed in front of us.  Hmmm..  Are you seeing a trend here? I will say the clam chowder was really good! They bring a bread basket so this went well with the soup.And we wait...  and wait... and wait for the crab.  Once it was brought out, it was delicious.  It was served with a small piece of corn on the cob and red potato.  I didn't try the sides since I was devouring the crab! About 2 minutes after we got our first plate of crab, another plate was brought out and set in front of us.  This would have been great if we were almost done with the first.   When we started on the second plate, they were already cold. Bummer. Of course cold crab is fine but just not what I was wanting. Then our finished plates sat in front of us for a very long time.  Was she really that busy?  No.  Even just a 'how is everything?' would've been nice.Finally dessert was brought out.  It was a little Banana nut cake with whip on the side. I would say it was good not great.  I ate about half.  So the meal was good.  The service was absolutely horrible. I guess I would say that I probably wont be back since there are many other places to get crab legs.

We had Melman bucks. So we came for dinner. Just four of us. But holy shit. They fed us like we we're three hundred pound men. Don't get me wrong. I love food. But there's enough, and there's just too much. We split a pasta as a first course. It was adequate, taste wise. But portion wise? How one person could even think of ordering it for dinner is beyond me. I would blow up. Wafer thin? I think not.We followed with baked clams which were pretty darned good. I like to put a little finely grated lemon rind and romano in my homemade version. I tasted both in theirs. I may sue.We moved on to a chicken saltimbucca, which was actually quite good. We followed with a salad. I could see the dissapointment in the servers face. When we only asked for espresso after, she seemed sad. I almost felt sorry for her. I guess she's used to people who live a week off the leftovers. We did, however, enjoy some very nice wine. So I think that may have made her feel a little better.Happy hour at the bar (I ended up w/ a couple glasses of wine - nothing special but not bad for under $5 each, either) yesterday turned into "hey, are you hungry?" "I could eat..." "well, let's see what they have..." "what do you see?" [back and forth like that for a while] turned into our waitress saying "i'll send the chef out to talk about what we can do for you."  ah, the joys of #glutenfree dining. chef aiden was the consummate salesman - describing the veritable smorgasbord of options. TWO gf types of pasta, nearly all of the sauces, as well as all of the veggie sides and meats. he was detailed yet efficient, and demonstrated (separate fry oil!!!!!)  that he really cared about my party's food intolerances. i was quite impressed. we'll be back soon.8/11/11After reading so many reviews about how great Maggiano's happy hour was, I decided to check it out myself and use a $10 gift card that Maggiano's had sent to me in honor of my birthday.  [Yes, I'm writing this review almost two years' later... I am that backlogged with reviews and photos- bear with me.  I don't think that these should be discounted based on how long it's been since these visits, because I (and others) could use these observations to see if the restaurants and their service and products have improved, or in some cases, worsened.)]  Was going to try a couple of the apps when I spotted the Four-Cheese Ravioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maggianos-little-italy-scottsdale-3?select=GzMWRgNr3Im5eTXGK5rFiQ#GzMWRgNr3Im5eTXGK5rFiQ on the dinner menu.  The description mentioned ricotta, cream cheese, mozz, and provolone in a pesto-alfredo cream sauce, and I was hooked ("ricotta," "pesto," and "alfredo" hook me in 95% of the time).  Unfortunately, the dish was a HUGE letdown... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maggianos-little-italy-scottsdale-3?select=dMECY1zFqidngRglm1e3sA#dMECY1zFqidngRglm1e3sA  All but two of the ravioli were half-frozen (especially at the edges), and the flavors?  All of the cheeses, marinara sauce, and pesto-alfedo cream sauce tasted the same!  All bland, without any distinction between them.  I tasted samples from allover the plate, from all components, separately and together, and couldn't discern any difference.  Even the entree's appearance was subpar.  Suffice it to say, I have not stepped foot into another Maggiano's since.The two good comments I could say are that the restaurant was quiet (no one was there) and the plates were quaint-looking, with that old-fashioned rose-and-bone tinted floral print.Honestly, the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars was because the cheesecake was heavenly. Everything else was a disaster; and this place deserves 1 star.To start off... we had a reservation for 7:30. The reservation was for 20 people. (Yes I know serving 20 people can be very difficult, but it can be done... Apparently this is not something that can be done at Maggiano's.) When we arrived the hostesses needed an EXACT number of people who would be dining. That would be 20; hence the reservation for 20 people... This was about 10 minutes of pointless back and forth with the hostess and how many freaking chairs needed to be at the table. 20! SHEESH! The next run around we got was that we were not allowed to be seated until all of the guests had arrived. After some of our guests arrived a few minutes later we were still all standing in the lobby. We were told our table would now be ready in 15 minutes. After 20 minutes of clogging up the front door and part of the bar area we walked up to the hostess and asked what the status was. Once again our table would be ready in 15 minutes. Another 20 minutes painfully ticked by. Oh did I mention we had a 3 month old and a toddler in the group? Anyone with a baby/toddler knows how great it can be waiting 45 minutes for a table. NOT! 50 minutes after our reservation had passed we were called up to be seated. Not one of the 3 hostesses apologized or even batted an eye that we had been standing there for 50 minutes?!?! ARE YOU FOR REAL!?Once we were seated we were understandably STARVING. Two waiters appeared to take our drink order. The young lady who helped was pleasant and very hospitable, but the gentleman who served us was rude! RUDE! RUDE! RUDE! Like we did something wrong spending our money at this establishment.  We asked him if the toddler who was with us could get his water ASAP, as the long wait had been hard on him. He looked at us like we were from another planet. Not only did he not apologize for the wait he huffed and puffed and started stammering "YOU HAVE TO BEAR WITH US". WE HAVE BEEN BEARING WITH YOU FOR AN HOUR!!!!!!!!!!!!! The rudeness continued throughout the entire meal. After all of this, the food was mediocre. Nothing special. Bland.  We were never apologized to from any of the staff nor were we even offered a fee appetizer or drink for the wait. If I ever return to this restaurant I can assure you it will be by force and not by choice. I can find good cheesecake at a lot of other restaurants that will be happy to take my money.

An Italian restaurant in a Chinese casino?  It's just like North Beach, then!  Our quest for Chinese food took us to the Imperial Palace, but the Italian restaurant inside turned out to be perfect for us.  It was decorated like an Italian wine cellar, with the tuns of wine in the walls, old columns, the barrel vaulted ceiling.   Like we were deep inside a hillside.  Brick walls exposed through plaster finish.  A mural of Venice, for some reason.  It reminded me that everything on The Strip is a copy of something else.  The pizza was great.  The menu had all kinds of Italian food, and it was a very pleasant experience.  Dinner for two came to about $35.

Delicious. What do you think of delectable 'chaat' that melts in your mouth? In a way, you're always left unsatisfied after you dig in to these tasty treats, simply because you yearn for more. And yearn I did! I've been frequenting this place for the past two years or so. It is relatively close by to campus, and is definitely on the route to my house, so if it's 100+ degrees and you're experiencing a craving for a flavorful treat, what better place is there other than Little India? Honestly, I haven't had a myriad of foods here. When I like something, I'm quite obstinate, and I stick to it. However, I have tasted bhel puri at five or so other Indian "chaat" places peppered around the valley, and nothing can compare to the bhel puri in Little India! Anyway, instead of yelping about it, I'm going to shut off my laptop, leave campus in an hour or so, and then go to Little India because I'm hungry.

5 girls were hungry and wanted a bite before we started our journey back to the OC so we pulled over @ the bellagio...after we smelled the lovely flowers we saw the line for cafe bellagio...long but it would have to do. LUCKILY as we stepped into line a hostesss came around saying "5?? 5?? anybody have a party of 5??" thats when i jumped out saying "5 here!!!!!"so we got seated QUICK. our table ordered a pulled pork sandwitch, french toast & sausage, steak & eggs, caramelized grapefruit, yogurt parfait, and my penne pasta.our server was a really sweet lady and she claimed my pasta was the BEST CHOICE!!the pasta was....alright.. the sauce wasnt out of the world plus (I HAVE SOME BAD LUCK WITH PASTA!) the pasta was a tad overcooked. as the girls tasted it they confirmed i wasnt crazy and it was a lil mushy...blah but it was ediblethe brownsugar coated grapefruit was yum and the parfait had the yummiest fruits & granola!everyones food looked alright. the lady substituted my friends toast from steak & eggs for a bread basket for the table which didnt rock nebodys world...it was MEh bread.i expected more from the food. but service was superb!btw iono whats goin on but wen i got home i saw i did get charged the $70 on my debit now i check today and that charge is gone and now im charged $12 for cafe bellagio...wtheck?The food overall here is probably a 4 star but the service is really lacking here. I feel a little bad as well because I recommended this place to my friends. We had a big group here and the automatic service charge of 6 or more people took affect so I guess the servers were in the state of mind that "We're getting our money anyways so who really cares?".  Our food literally took about an hour or so to come. The service used to be pretty good here before. I have no clue what happened? Luckily for us we were having a good time and weren't too upset about the slow service. I ordered the Oriental chicken salad which happened to be pretty descent. I remember the Bellagio Cafe having a pretty good French onion soup as well, although it's a bit pricey at $11.I'm not sure if I will recommend coming here after this past experience.I arrived in Las Vegas pretty damn late on a Friday night.  By the time I checked into my hotel and got to the Bellagio, it was already midnight.  I was hungry and needed food badly, and Café Bellagio was the only restaurant open that late.  Being that it was so late, I didn't want to pig out, so I decided to share the Crab Cakes Benedict with my friend( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/V0tAJLQlgYNCWAj5di3AoQ/l ).  The crab cakes were huge!  Instead of an English muffin, the crab cakes were on a bed of crispy hash browns.  The dish was really good, and it definitely satisfied my late night hunger.  The service here was good.  We were seated right away, our food came out fast, and our server was very friendly.  This is definitely a good spot to cure the munchies!I don't give out many one stars (you have to really fail to get that), but our trip to Café Bellagio = brunch fail.Since my friends and I were too hungry for crepes at Jean Philippe Patisserie but not hungry enough to tackle the buffet, our options for brunch at the Bellagio were rather limited.  After wandering around the casino to check out any other alternatives, we ended up at Café Bellagio since the line was relatively short and they were able to sit our group of nine pretty quickly.I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and it came with a decent amount of food - homemade corned beef hash, two poached eggs, hash browns, and choice of toast.  The eggs and hash browns were fine, but the hash itself didn't do much for me.  While their generosity with the amount of meat they used would usually be a good thing, it felt like I was eating a salty corned beef patty than an actual corned beef hash.  Ironically, their attempts to make it a "hash" didn't help either, as the shreds of potato they threw in tasted a bit undercooked.Although I might have given the food two stars on its own, I'm giving a one because I thought the service wasn't entirely there...literally.  After bringing out our food, our servers seemed to disappear for long stretches.  We had to motion several times to get our bill and once we did get it, one of my friends had to practically hunt them down to give them our check.  After what felt like 10-15 minutes, our server finally returned with our credit card  and slips...but only the merchant copy (none for us to keep).  Rather than wait around to ask for our copies, we just signed and left.Considering the quality of food and service, I'd rather take the $14 I spent on my "hash" and head over to Hash House for something bigger and better for the same price.This review is based on a single dinner at Cafe Bellagio.The first thing I noticed was the nice opulent decor, followed by friendly greetings by the hostess and our server, Julie K.  The meal then began with a warm tasty roll and butter, followed by a good Crab Dip spread on toasted baguette slices.  But the dip could have been creamier.A crock of French Onion Soup with well-melted Gruyere Cheese was excellent, and dense Meatloaf topped by Brown Gravy and mushrooms was very good with Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans.  Unfortunately, the chef read the ticket wrong, and Diane had to send her medium burger back to receive a medium rare replacement.  Then she pronounced her Bacon Cheddar Cheeseburger with Parmesan Fries as tasting very good.3-1/2 stars overall!  We will likely return for another meal when we are in close proximity somewhere on the Strip as dinner time strikes, and have no other dining plans.After working a nine-hour shift, rushing through a quick shower, and driving for five hours to get to Vegas to meet up with my girlfriends, we stumbled into Cafe Bellagio haggard and famished.Service here is awful.  Maybe it was the way we were dressed [it was 12am and we were all in a different array of pajamas], maybe it was because we all had our travel faces on, or maybe it was because they lacked decent customer service but waiting around for 30 minutes in a near-empty empty restaurant on a weekday for a glass of orange juice and a sandwich with fries is ridiculous!  At least give us some water if you can't pour me a glass of oj!  I get that the servers deals with the drunks and asshats that venture into their beloved city but we were nothing but polite.  My friends and I all work in different fields of customer service and the lack of manners and a smile is just rude.So how was the food?  Mediocre at best.  I daresay that even Denny's or Village Inn can slap together a better sandwich and deep-fry some frozen fries.  Oh well.  We ate, we paid, and we left.  Never again, Cafe Bellagio.________________________________________Side-note:  I received a nice message from Mark H., the customer representative, offering me to give them a second-try.  I'm flattered for such a gracious offer and I admire they're business integrity on trying to bring the best service possible.  It shows great work ethics and I respect that 100% but I must decline.  Definitely noted though and very cool of them to try and kiss and make up.Cafe Bellagio gets three stars for food and five stars for the ambience, making it an even four star rating for me!  The line to get in was ridiculously long on both attempts to go.  We finally stuck it out on attempt #2 and were then underwhelmed with our breakfast.  Can't put my finger on why, but the whole breakfast just fell short of our expectations in regards to taste--didn't hate it, didn't love it.   The best thing about the whole meal?  The beautiful ambience.  I. LOVED. the. ambience.  Overlooking the conservatory listening to Christmas music was just lovely.  The whole experience put a smile on my face and made me not care about the food whatsoever.  I can't wait to go back to see what the display is post Holidays and try something else.Decent food that's priced for the Bellagio clientele.First I must say that this place is super anti-kids they don't have a kids menu and really just don't seem like they want them around at all.We walked up and were seated very quickly which was a plus but it didn't make up for the accommodating situation of them not liking the little ones who were with us.They had a few beers on tap of those a chose the Goose Island as that's a great brewery with delicious glass of brew!Their chicken salad sandwich just sounded right and it was! The sandwich had a good amount of flavorful chicken with the right sprinkle of pepper on a yummy roll w/ a juicy tomato that went well with the crisp lettuce.The sandwich also came with fries they had this crispy awesomeness to them that rocked!One thing that I did like is they serve breakfast all day long so no matter what time it is you can get your pancake on!Overall I can't see another visit here unless I'm staying in the hotel as it's just not that accommodating and there is many other choices in the area.

Review Text :
This is probably one of the most expensive Asian fusion restaurant I have been to that serves mediocre food. For two people, our check was a hundred dollars after gratuity.  I don't remember how much each dish costs, but I know the broccoli with beef order was a whopping $23.00.We ordered two bowls of hot n sour soup, a dragon sushi roll, a pork pad thai, a broccoli with beef, and a large beer.The hot n sour soup was extremely salty. So salty that I had to dilute it with water. The dragon roll was okay. It's basically a regular California Roll with avocado and eel added to it. Nothing fancy,  and it's no big deal.  The pork pad thai was also okay. It had enough flavor in it, but the rice noodles was a bit too clumped together. The order was tiny, not enough to feed two people.  The broccoli with beef was probably the best tasting. The oyster sauce made it really good, and the broccoli was fresh. Yes, this order was also very small. And finally the beer was cold and refreshing. The service was not too good. We had to keep flagging down the waitress before she came. She probably had a bad day since she was on the grumpy side.The restaurant is really nice. Very comfortable setting. I could have enjoyed my dinner more if we didn't have to sit in between obnoxious people.  Boy, they were loud the whole time.  Since our dining choices are in abundance at Sin City,  I probably won't be back to this place.  A hundred bucks for a meal that is probably 30.00 elsewhere is not worthwhile for me. I should have gone to Panda Express. LOL.

Review Text :
With a name like Ping Pang Pong, you're not sure if you're headed to one of 'those' shows in Thailand or sitting down for some dim sum at a Chinese restaurant.  When in Vegas, it's the latter...at least in this case.Seeing billboards all over town advertising their dim sum, I must admit, I was very hesitant.  I would even say I wanted not to like it.  But I did, believe or not.  Ping Pang Pong located in the Gold Coast Casino has some of the better dim sum I've tried in Vegas, and I've been to a few.It's a smaller restaurant than the only ones I've tried (listed below) and you can watch the casino floor as you dine.Saturday morning and we were seated rather quickly.  Quite a few Chinese people eating dim sum here as well, which is always a good sign.  They give you a menu with prices which is a bit unique for dim sum, but definitely helpful.  (Price ranges split into four categories for the most part - A plates are $2.18; B plates are $2.88; C plates are $3.88; and D plates are $5.88. ) Immediately after you're seated, the dim sum carts come your way.  If you can' t find what you're looking for, but it's on the menu, wave a server down and they'll order it for you.  Ping Pang Pong has a surprisingly large selection of dim sum choices and it's pretty good.  Regular steamed dim sum range in the A and B categories.  They even had the elusive Shark Fin Dumpling ($5.88), but no Shanghai dumpling.  They also give you the bottle of red vinegar as opposed to the dinky little soy sauce dish amount.  The Shark Fin Dumpling had a nice mushroom broth too that was quite tasty and stood out.  They didn't have the Pineapple Custard bun that I love so much, but they had the plain Pineapple Bun ($2.18).  The BF especially loved their Macanese Egg Tarts ($3.88).  He hasn't had them since being in Macau and even had an order to go. They have a decent amount of 'cool sweets' in the B plates - Red Bean Pudding Cake, Chilled Mango and Pink Grapefruit Cocktail, Tapioca and Purple Rice Pudding, Lychee Pudding, etc.  'Warm' and 'hot sweets' range from A through C categories and include Baked Tapioca Green Tea Pudding, Steamed Egg White and Sweet Cream, Seared Water Chestnut Pudding Cake, Thousand Layer Cake, etc. Service was okay.  We did have to wave the servers down as only certain people can assist you with special orders while others only clear tables and push the carts.  Prices weren't too expensive either and I would say it's moderately priced for a casino.  The only downfall would be if you came with a very large party.  It might take awhile to get seated if they are extremely busy.  Nonetheless, looks like Ping Pang Pong might be where I'm headed when I want some dim sum in the desert.Rankings for dim sum in Vegas thus far:1) Ping Pang Pong2) Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine3) Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant4) Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant5) Cathay House RestaurantSidenote: When you ask for hot sauce, be sure to specify hot chili oil.  It'll be the good stuff instead of the red sauce with chili flakes.  Well, it's the good stuff I prefer with my dim sum.  And of course, hot yellow mustard too.Updated! 06/10/07 - We returned again yesterday for dim sum and imagine my surprise when I saw pickled pig's feet being served!  This delicacy is usually only served after a woman gives birth.  A bunch of the older women relatives would come over and take over your kitchen while stewing up this stuff for you.  Once in awhile, I would wake up to this wonderful aroma when my mom felt the desire to make it.  I used to joke that I would have kids just to have people make this for me!  Now I can enjoy this vinegary fatty goodness anytime at Ping Pang Pong!  Yay!  For our party of five, it was about $100 with tip and tax.Updated! 03/02/08 - Went to dim sum on Sunday...arrived around 2:35 pm and was reminded they closed at 3 pm.  We were fine with that and were quick to load our table with all the dim sum dishes we wanted.  The staff horded around our table asking if we wanted to make any final orders since the kitchen was closing up, and we said we were good.  With that, the check was presented to our table.  We continued eating and it wasn't long before the server reached across for the bill.  (I told her it wasn't taken care of yet.)  She pulled back in surprise and walked away.  She then returned to tell me they were closing out the register, so could we pay?  I have been to other dim sum restaurants where you are 'allowed' to eat, despite the kitchen part closing.  It was pretty discouraging that they were so overanxious to get our money and to get rid of us.  The dim sum lady obviously hated her job 'cuz she was banging the little dishes around.   Note to self: Don't bother going to PPP after 2:00 for dim sum, service is crap.  Food is okay though...but going downhill.  Seek other dim sum restaurants SOON!  I brought their star rating down from a four to a three!Maybe it was all of the bad restaurant that I have tried prior to coming here but I thought this place was FANTASTIC. Granted the service was not that great and they were a little slow. It's also in one of the oldest casinos with probably the oldest clienteles. But this place is an actual gem. I got to give it to them.............they know how to make dim sum. The dofu fah, har gow, sui mei, Chinese sausage and egg white fried rice, beef cheurng fun were all very good. If you are here for the Koi Palace atmosphere, with the Koi palace experience then this probably not for you. This is more of a down home Chinese soul food restaurant........ the way it was meant to be. Good, reasonably price being that it is in a casino, and rude servers pressuring you to buy from their carts.We were looking for a Chinese Restaurant that serves Dim Sum late.  We stumbled across this restaurant in the Gold Coast Casino around 1:30 am.  At first we didn't know if they were closing.  No one acknowledged us for a good five (felt like 10) minutes, and nobody else was waiting.  There was no staff in sight to welcome us or take our name.  Right before walking away, someone finally confronts us.  Because we were hungry and lazy, we ended up waiting another 5 minutes since the place was packed.  Once we sat down, service was tolerable.  Our drink refills came frequently, and the food was prepared quickly.  We got our Dim Sum fix with Shu Mai and Hargow...pretty average.  Everything else (Fu Chow Fried Rice, Black Pepper Beef, Kung Pau Chicken, and Walnut Prawns) exceeded the standard except for the Hot & Sour Soup.  Bad start...but good finish..What's up with the name?  Seems a bit racist if you ask me. I kid. I kid. Every person in this joint was Asian.  Everyone.  That may be because it's in the Gold Coast and this place was nicknamed the Pan Pacific by my friend.  It was literally an Asian invasion.  So, when you see that all the peeps in a Chinese restaurant are Asian, that's gotta be a good sign, right?  The food was good, great even.  The prices were extremely reasonable for large, family style dishes.  We tried the usual offerings, including a spicy fried rice that had some serious kick.  Loved it.  The salt and pepper pork chops were delicious, but didn't have a ton of meat on them.  Minus one star for the wait.  Service wasn't great, but remember the saying...the worse the service, the better the food.  That always applies to Chinese food, so if you know this, you get it.Our second day of $25 food credit, we decided to try the Dim Sum again here.  Our visit this time seemed better.  I liked the food and the service.  You can't compare this with all the Dim Sum restaurants in So Cal, but Ping Pang Pong gets the job done with some of the classic dishes; Ha Gaw (Shrimp Dumpling), BBQ Pork Buns (both baked and steamed), Sticky Rice Wrap, Salty Sticky Rice Dumpling, Sesame Balls, Porridge, Egg Tarts, Chiese Broccoli, Fried Shrimp Balls, and so on and so on.  It seemed like they had more varieties this time than I remembered.  It could be because we were there earlier than last time, too.  Do get there earlier than later or there will be a wait (and also they don't run out of your favorites)  since the place isn't very big.  The prices are fairly reasonable.  Most dishes are around $2.88 (for B dishes).   We tried to order enough to use up our $25 food credit and ended up packing some left over to go (ate it for breakfast the next day). I've tried going to Dim Sum at the restaurants on Spring Mountain Road and it was almost impossible due to the wait time.  I'd much rather come here.  If you're in the mood for Dim Sum, give this place a try.I met a friend from Canada for dinner at Ping Pang Pong tonight.  My only other dining experience here was with the same friend about 4 years ago.We ordered three dishes to share:  The Singapore rice noodles were excellent.  There was a fair number of shrimp and some small slices of pork along with onions.  The curry flavor was good.  For my taste, I could have used a bit more.  We got an order of wrinkled green beans.  I don't think they were seared as much as they should have been to make them wrinkled.  They were crisp.  Their flavor was very good.  Finally, we got the half roasted Cantonese duck.  The flavor of the duck was a winner, too!  I'm not a big fan of duck when it's on the bone, but this was cooked well.  Service was good.  My iced tea refilled often without asking.  We did have to ask a server to bring us some clean plates so we could get rid of some of the duck bones.  The one drawback of Ping Pang Pong was the loudness of the place for the first 1/3 of the hour and a half we were there.  It was so noisy from people talking loudly and the kitchen staff, filling orders for take out and yelling the orders to each other.I do like the place and I will be back if only for the Singapore noodles.  That was my highlight of the meal!PS:  I love the name.  I can't help think of Puccini and Turandot!  Addio amore, addio razza....Brought the parents here at opening time, and it was good that we made it almost on time, as a line quickly formed outside.Very decent dim sum service, with the carts and everything.  Quality of the food was good, though the selection could have been a little better.  We are always on the lookout for slightly non-standard dim sum, and though there were rumors of some interesting things, what we saw was the basics.  Price to quality ratio was really good compared to anywhere on the strip.It's not quite high end.  Service and food are on par with places in other cities with a big Chinese population.  I have no problem with the idea that this is the best dim sum in Las Vegas.This place has grown into one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Vegas, for a couple dishes, entrees, and appetizers its a good $100 plate, the prices are reasonable and the food is mouth-watering. I enjoy the shrimp chow mein & the chicken fried rice has the perfect amount of salt & seasoning. The sauces with the Kung pao & honey walnut shrimp are out of this world! On weekends the kitchen closes at 3.How the hell are Asians supposed to convince everyone else how offensive the term "Ching Chang Chong" is when we go off and name one of our own restaurants "PING PANG PONG"? My Hong Kong-hailing real estate agent was visibly horrified when he found out in casual conversation that my parents and I had not yet been privy to the local dim sum experience at Ping Pang Pong (how is anyone supposed to take me seriously when I say this aloud?) in the Gold Coast casino. So while showing us detailed French doors, luxurious hardwood flooring, and expansive high ceilings, he kept peppering home features with "shao mai" and "cha shao bao." I was sold - on the food, not the house - so not long after that, it was off to Gold Coast we went. The casino is not the most convenient to navigate, but the restaurant sits pretty much smack dab in the middle of it, and that's where my biggest issue with it lay. The restaurant is open to the casino pits with hip-level pillars that whisper, "Smoky Smokerson! Enter, please." On the flip side, however, the dim sum is solid. Every dish we hailed off the cart was well-prepared and got a stamp of approval. The xia jiao, chicken feet, congee - all good in the hood. It's just that this hood carries a bit of an eau de FUMAR!I would give this place 5 FROWNNIE FACES :( . Where should I begin... FIRST OF ALL, they open at 10am, but don't have any food ready. We placed an order for a few dim sums at 10:10 am and got our order at 11am. UNACCEPTABLE, REALLY? 50 mins for dim sum?! Servers could barely speak english, messed up our order and manager was too busy to care. ALSO, the worst part is dim sum cart lady DROPPED food on the wet, dirty ground and procedded to place it back on the plate and back into the cart to be served to unknowing customers. GROSS, LADY..GROSS. I had to ask her to throw it away and she at first said " it's okay." WTH. NO LADY, IT'S NOT OKAY. No worries, I made sure she threw it in the trash..where it belongs. Finally we get our food at 11, after asking multiple times and our consolation prize for their mistakes were some cookies.. WOOHOO. Probably the ones that fell on the floor... Seriously, DO NOT EAT HERE.One of my highlights during my recent trip to Vegas was visiting Gold Coast where I tried the slot machines and came out ahead with some change.  And then visiting Ping Pang Pong for lunch and dinner.  PPP offers authentic Chinese dim sum with some unique items which I don't see in SCal, or maybe I have yet to visit to the ones that serve the similar dim sum fare.  Chill waitresses, friendly service, they are more than happy to show you what's in those little tins from their carts. The porridge with century old eggs was very satisfying, I was half full after eating it.  Enough century old egg pieces in it to qualify for the name if you know what I mean.  Here is my YAY!(‿) The slow cooked/simmered snails ($5.88) on dim sum menu is probably quite common in Hong Kong, but it's rare in the States.  Definitely a winner.  They were easy to be taken out from the shell, nothing broke off in the process, marvelous!  I enjoy doing that!  They were very flavorful, slightly spicy but not too spicy and had a nice chewiness to them.  What a treat!  Good times. ()The shrimp ball with sticky rice is a variation from the well known 绵阳三蒸，but theirs have more vegetable matter and less shrimp matter than I expected.  Still good though, and goes well with the egg white dipping sauce.  After I spotted the snails, fried shrimp balls with sugar cane ($5.88) were put on the back burner, I ended up taking them to go.  Those shrimp balls got nothing on them snails.  They didn't taste that good when they were cold, they probably taste better when they were freshly made.  The disc shaped sticky rice patty with lotus seed paste is the kind of mochi that I like to have for snack.  Not too sweet but sticky enough.  I should have got some to go.Can't resist the sight of any pan fried dumplings, how can I?  Just look at their pan fried bottoms.  In this case, the bun was perfect but the filling needed to be bigger and more substantial with more meat.This restaurant is shaped right, the circular floor plan goes well with la rotunda breadbasket of mine. I like the decor too, very Chinese in a traditional way.  (¬‿¬)Encouraged by the dim sum success, I thought I would try their dinner.  I wasn't particularly inspired by the porridge with abalone ($9.99) which didn't have much flavor as I expected.  I had better ones at a friend's house with chucks of abalone pieces.  But this is how they make it in most Cantonese restaurants, you get the thinly sliced abalone pieces in the porridge.  Dried abalone is some kind of delicacy, but quality various.  Those were definitely not the best I've had.  And they don't put much in there.  If you read the knock-off version of Sun Tzu Art of War, and take the last strategy's number, minus 2 dozens, that's the number of abalone slices I got in the porridge.When I was having dinner, I noticed they (the managers or the ppl by the register) just let the customers waiting by the door without acknowledging them and telling them how long the wait would be, that's rude.The name almost sounds like the punchline for a bad joke you wouldn't dare tell at a Chinese restaurant. Except Ping Pang Pong is not that, nor is it the name of the Azn triplets in your cringeworthy joke.At Ping Pang Pong, they take their dim sum quite seriously. At least I'm pretty sure their dim sum is among the best I've ever had. I love how they add these bits of salted shrimp to their taro cake for flavor. Yum.It seems a bunch of the older casinos in Vegas have a 'hidden gem'; Ping Pang Pong is Gold Coast casino's. We went there for lunch & there was this mega queue of Azn ppl (as myself), a queue that stayed long, long after we were done eating lunch (we stayed to play a bit of Wheel of Fortune). I figured this meant that a continuous stream of people kept coming in - & that that's maybe because the food is good. The things I learn from watching Sherlock.TIP: How do you skip the super long line at Ping Pang Pong? No, this isn't that non-PC jokeIf you spot a big empty table that will seat you/your group & the people in front of/behind you, consider befriending them, at least temporarily, for the purpose of sharing the table. That's what we did. There were 3 of us, 2 of them, & a few empty seats separating us from them. Otherwise, we would've had to wait another 30 minutes to an hour.I'm a fan of Dim Sum, and usually try to make it a point to try them when I come across one.  To this day, I have yet to find a place that blew my mind.  Din Tai Fung was probably the closest (is that even considered dim sum?), but in the more typical joints where they come around with the trays, I've never been super impressed.  We decided to try Ping Pang Pong since it was in a casino, and we figured it would provide the necessary cleanliness that I find to be generally lacking in dim sum spots.  We got there 15 minutes before they opened on Sunday, and there was a line of 3-4 parties waiting in front  of us.  By the time they opened, there were another 5-6 parties behind us.  Shortly after we began dining, the place was full.  Good sign.  The wait staff was surprisingly Chinese - I say that because this is inside the Gold Coast and I would have thought the wait staff would be more diverse - and resulted in a service very typical to other dim sum restaurants.  They spoke little English, and often called out the dish in Chinese even after realizing we were not Chinese.  The décor was clean and typically nice for a casino restaurant, so this part we enjoyed quite a bit - dim sum in a clean environment.The food was actually quite good.  It was quite distinctly lacking of the dumplings and shumai that we were looking for, they just kept telling us it would come later and they would come in trickles.  But what did eventually come - shrimp shumai and shrimp & pork shumai - were very good.  But alas, no har gow, no rice noodle rolls with shrimp (they had one with beef...), and just not enough choices of these little pieces.  What they did have though, were interesting and not common.  Congee porridge is common, and theirs is good.  They have a large bowl for the table and a smaller bowl for one.  They had cooked congee in spice broth which were excellent, and clams in similar sauce that were great also.  Their souffle-type dessert (they only make 10 per day) was delicious, as well as the custard flavor rolls.One big issue I had with them were that the dessert dishes started coming out first, and just kept coming around.  Why do they do that?  Bring out the porridge and dumplings first!  We kept having to tell them "later, after we eat!" as the dessert trays passed by probably at least half dozen times.  They've got to fix this.But all-in-all a good meal, and our meal for 4 came to $49 plus tips.  That's not a bad deal, and perhaps I can overlook some of their glaring shortcomings.  3.5 stars is more appropriate, but I'll bump up a half based on the quality of what we actually did get to eat.Table-for-1 Factor:  May be for regular lunch & dinner, but for the dim sum brunch it's probably not a great option.We like to eat here occasionally when we are here to play bingo. It's good Chinese food, decent sized portions, but terrible terrible service. Open late hours so when I've come here it has usually been on the later end of the evening. They pretty much have a very traditional Chinese dining menu, but a small bowl of white steamed rice is 50cents which I was surprised with all the entrees we were ordering we were not getting a free bowl of white rice. Tonight we had the Kung Pao Chicken, Dry Beef Chow Fun, Salt and Pepper Pork, BBQ Pork Fried Rice, Gobo Beef, and seafood mixed Soft Noodles which probably is their fancy name version of lo mein. All the food actually was pretty good.Kung Pao Chicken - I enjoyed how tender the chicken slices were, and the sauce for this particular dish was just right, right amount of spicy and right amount of sweetness to it. Gobo Beef - probably my new favorite dish to order when coming to this restaurant. Small thick cut cubes of beef sirloin, every flavorful and savory taste of beef cubes. could be more on the tender side, but otherwise very tasty.Beef Chow Fun - average tasting chow fun, a little on the oily side for my liking, but chow fun is my all time favorite chinese food dish, so I normally will order this entree at any chinese restaurant i'm eating at. BBQ Pork fried rice - it was a little on the dry side for me, but I guess it's better to be dry than oily. nothing unique or special, pretty standard dish for fried riceSalt and Pepper pork - a little too much on the salty sideseafood Mixed soft noodles - this name of the entree to me is in no doubt that it's their fancy name for lo mein, very standard display and style of cooking for the seafood lo mein look-alike, their hot tea was very very good, but their service overall sucked and some people (the hostess) really have terrible and rude attitudes and I know the customer can sense and see it. slow service, and just overall even if they are understaffed, they dont have to be sour faced or rude about it. 3/5 for pretty standard okay food and terrible service :/It's had been some time since my last visit to Ping Pang Pong so I decided to give it a try for our pre-holiday dim sum meal with friends.We arrived around 1pm and the line was pretty long. We were seated by 1:30 at a table that was a little on the tight side for our party. Drinks and refills were plentiful, but the cart service was extremely disappointing. They were slow with the carts and despite us trying to flag them down, they were hard to catch and skipped us a few times which irked me and my friends. We eventually got their attention and got everything we had hoped for, but the bad attitude and service was annoying. The food ranged for just ok to downright flavorless. Service issues aside, I can't think of a single dish that stood out to me as being good and I think I can safely cross Ping Pang Pong off my dim sum list from now on.I wasn't expecting much from this restaurant after reading some of the reviews but I wanted to try this restaurant with the silly, ridiculous name anyway. My friends arrived before me so we didn't have to wait in line. There was a small line already. We arrived right when they opened at 10 a.m. The restaurant is the smallest one I've seen from the other dim sum places I've been to in this town.The server took our drink orders right away. The dim sum ladies came by with their carts. We picked a few items. Some of the carts can be a little slow because a few times, we were waiting to eat more. The service is the least friendliest compared to the other dim sum places in town. Nothing too friendly or too abrasive...just your typical, nonchalant Asian service. Moving on to the food...It was fresh, good, and hot. Shumai, shrimp har gow, fried shrimp ball with mayo dip, shrimp in rice noodle, shrimp in bean curd, egg custard tart, & the donut resembling a malasada with red bean were delicious! The only thing that bugged me...We asked for hot sauce twice but never got our hot sauce. It's not a deal breaker but I like my foods with a little kick. Whatever, no biggie. I'll be back and I will make sure I get my damn hot sauce!I was looking for a good dim sum joint in Vegas. When I travel, I like to try the dim sum from other places. This place did not disappoint. It's located at The Gold Coast Hotel, all the way in the back. I have to give this place props for the nostalgic Chinese feel to it. Everything from the  tables to the uniforms scream Chinese. It seems so out of place at this hotel. It's as if it's in it's own little bubble.We got there about 10:30am and there was no wait. The place opens at 10:00am. When we left an hour later, the place was packed. When we first got there, I heard the workers speaking in Cantonese, a good sign. The hostess sat us at a table and gave us one of those stamp cards. Every time we took something from the cart that they pushed by us, they would stamp the card. That's how they total the bill at the end. This is the only dim sum place that I've been to that charged for tea. With that being said, the dim sum here is a good deal compared to Hawaii, where I'm from. All the items were about a dollar cheaper. We had the black bean spare ribs, chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, stuffed eggplant, and the hot tofu dessert. These are pretty much my staples. I tend to order the same items at dim sum. I have to say the food is excellent. Everything that we ordered was on point. The shrimp in the dumplings was fresh and the wrapper translucent. The chicken feet was plump and huge. The eggplant was stuffed with shrimp paste. My favorite was the hot tofu dessert. It was silky smooth and so yummy with the ginger syrup. It was as good or better than most dim sum places in Hawaii.As with most dim sum places, you get better service if you speak Cantonese. After the hostess sat us, no carts came around for a while. As soon as I asked for shrimp dumplings in Cantonese, the hostess waved all the carts over. Within 10 seconds, I had all four carts in front of me. My husband was laughing because he knew the drill. This happens at a majority of dim sum places that we go to."Sundays are for Dim Sum. While the rest of America goes to church, Sunday School, or NFL games, you can find Chinese people eating Cantonese food." ― Eddie HuangSo our friend wanted to grab some dim sum at a place he was profusely gushing about.  I was pretty unimpressed as a Cantonese person and after the meal, he echoed my sentiments.  What's the big deal?  I suppose it's the best dim sum in Las Vegas but places in Arizona have impressed me more.  I can't believe we drove all the way to Gold Coast to try this place!It may be because we were here for dim sum on a Thursday but the food was pretty cold despite being in steam carts.  We tried a wide variety of dishes and the salt water dumpling, egg tarts, and the chicken feet were the only ones that were particularly good.  Salt water dumpling is always good because they're fried, the egg tart is generous with custard filling, and the chicken feet had a good sauce on them.  Plus, they were really plump!  I did find the roe on the siu mai and other various dumplings to be interesting.  They didn't add much the dish themselves but it was okay.Service is that of all dim sum places: basic.  They do treat Cantonese and Mandarin speakers a lot better than the English speaking customers. 3.5 stars!

I was intrigued by all this talk of the salad room. I had to check it for myself.I thought the interior atmosphere was quite nice, a little dated but nice.I decided I would try the Salad Room. (see pics)While I was impressed with the Salad Room itself, the contents were mostly things I wouldn't  care to eat, not even sure what some of the stuff was. I only made one trip and ate only half of that, And the Little Debbie Pinwheel wasn't one of them.Everything looked and tasted too institutional if you know what I mean.  Maybe you don't.....OK how about looking around and seeing waiters coming out of the kitchen serving plates with those plastic lids over them(they really did)......I Just got taken back to the convalescent home I used to visit my great grandmother in during dinner hour.......blech......I've never seen those lids used in a restaurant?I really just got grossed out while eating there, maybe it was the guy next to me me having the all you can eat fish and chips with his little jar and spoon of cocktail sauce that was served to someone else after he left I don't know, but I do know I wont be going back.this place always smells like geriatrics. the green wall paper doesn't help with that ambiance either. don't forget to note the brass light fixtures.for some reason my family loves this place and i'm always forced to go for birthdays or whatever. I personally don't get it. The food is pretty nasty. Everything I have ever had here reminds me of the marie calendars frozen dinners...except that marie calendars frozen dinners taste better and are priced to match the quality of food. The service is mediocre, I guess. They have a salad bar which also has a few other options but all nasty, again. nothing grosses me out more than plastic bowls filled with cold and cheap ranch. and not to be mean or anything but the people who dine here gross me out. There are certain ages of people who just gross me out when they eat: infant-3 yrs old and then it starts again somewhere around age 80-death. I love old people and babies, but I hate watching them eat or thinking about their hands being anywhere near food that I have to eat.  This place just isn't for me I guess. I will say that my step dad thinks the bread pudding is to die for- keep in mind he's in the same age range as most of the diners here so take from it what you will...

Restaurant name  MGM Grand Buffet

Review Text :
An important part of a Las Vegas trip is eating at a buffet. You're exhausted from the night before, dehydrated from not enough water and too much alcohol, and already given into gluttony, so what do you have to lose? Well, your standards and possibly your dignity if you choose the wrong buffet. I have had the good and the bad, and I would say MGM is neither. It's just okay. On a saturday morning just before noon, I was starving. So starving, that by the time we finally sat down to eat I literally grabbed a plate from the closest food station and filled up a plate with things I couldn't even pronounce. I actually found it quite tasty, so I was curious about what other delicious things were out there. Well, that's where the okay part of it all comes into play. Everything else was just okay. For $25 though, I like a little better than okay. I go to Silverton for $17 and it's AMAZING, so I wasn't impressed by the price.I was, however, impressed with the pay here kiosks! Instead of waiting in line for eternity you just walk up to the kiosk, get your receipt, and get seated. Done. Simple. I appreciate that. I would eat here again if it was very convenient or I was starving and couldn't wait, but I don't think I would really plan to eat here.Being from Portland I cannot believe I went into a "buffet" place. That is one thing Portland does not do, and if they do do buffets they are horrid little places.  I guess Las Vegas is the opposite because this place had some pretty decent food and the price was fantastic for the location as well.We only ate there when we got out of bed for two mornings so I can only talk breakfast. However, there was lunch out there as well.  Tons of food, all tasted fresh, and they always had it full and plenty hot enough.  My inlaws back in the day, used to make us go with them to a Portland buffet and they would have the nastiest food in those big square containers with the boiled water underneath. The food would be crusty around the sides and be overcooked and pretty much canned. The desserts would be things like puddings that had a layer of hardened pudding on the top and you would have cool whip to put over it. There would be the fruit cocktail with the cherries on top and the dried up pizza.. Like I said, Portland does not do buffets.I digress, but I was making a point, sort of a contrast from what I saw here. First, none of those square containers with the boiled water below like a cafeteria was anywhere to be seen. Their presentation was appetizing instead, and the items were things like:smoked salmon, smoked trout, homemade crepes made on the spot with any fruit you wanted them to make for you, root veggies, apricot, prune, mango fruit salad, all kinds of olives, lots of egg choices, and even homemade grits. The servers were friendly and helpful as well.The price for breakfast all you can eat was a good deal, especially since we just did not eat lunch after that meal anyway!  And Las Vegas charges so much for meals!I think Portland could learn a thing or two from the buffet here. There's a niche in this market that's waiting to happen. I mean it's kind of like a brunch and we do that quite well.If you have a VIP card, you get to cut the line. For being 35+ a person, this place is not the business. They have a good amount of options, but all very meh. To keep it real, the best thing IMO was the salad...which I made on my own. Lol. Even the dessert wasn't all that great. One thing I didn't like was that they don't tell you if the items are spicy. The guacamole I got was actually pretty darn spicy..not that I don't love spicy, but still.My dad got these clams, and he almost started crying because of the spiciness. Warn a brotha!Formally called, "The Oz Buffet," the MGM Buffet is a step lower than the Bellagio, Wicked Spoon, and Bachannal Buffet.  To me, it looks like an upscale Hometown Buffet with premium eats.  I bought a comp buffet pass from playing MyVegas and decided to give it a try since I'm always eating in the pricey buffets. The Buffet is located right on the left side of the casino by the strip entrance and across from Rain Forest Cafe.My buffet pass was only good for lunch and I made it a mission to make it all the way from the Cosmopolitan on time before they switched to dinner. =DThe food they serve here is typical in any other Vegas Buffet, like: Italian, Asian, Mexican, Seafood, Meat Station, Middle Eastern, and Japanese. Overall the food was just average and the customer service was on top of it's game. The surroundings weren't fancy or eye catching, just plain boring. No, "Wow Factor" at all.I expected better from MGM, since it's one of the biggest hotels in the Las Vegas and the world. They need to step up their game or they'll just end up being mediocre, like the Excalibur and Luxor Buffets. I'd sure eat here again, only if it were free.I was hoping for a gourmet buffet experience. I decided I wouldn't look at every rating and read reviews of everything prior to my trip to Vegas recently. Unfortunately the overall rating here is right on. Have you ever been to Golden Corral buffet? Well, GC is better than this buffet. BY FAR. Not only was the price for what you get, totally shit, it lacked amounts of offerings. Three dinky rows during dinner? Not worth it. They offer the buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We tried it for dinner on the first night and said nope, not coming here again. The prices on their website also are incorrect. It is $33 for the dinner buffet, and extra for any drink at all. I assume they fluctuate their pricing based on busy times.The best part was the dessert offerings. Save your $$ for gambling and just eat elsewhere.It's been about 10 years since I was to the MGM buffet.  There was no line at the register and the person at the register told me to go to the VIP line as I had a comp.The layout is different since they renovated some years ago.  I checked everything out first.  After looking around, I got a New York steak piece (not really NY steak) but it was OK and there was still a small amount of pink.  There were also creole shrimp and they were very good, very spicy!  I added a chicken cordon bleu which was not the best of my first selections.  The fried wonton were not good at all and should be avoided.  Rounding out the first plate was some pasta Bolognese which had a surprising amount of heat from ground red pepper.  It was pretty good for a buffet.  Someone wasn't afraid to spice things up a bit.For the second plate, I got some sushi roll slices which was standard buffet type.  I got two pieces of spicy Portuguese sausage which was quite good, and I went back for more of the pasta.  I loved the pepper heat of it.I had some carrot cake and a chocolate pudding for dessert.  These were standard buffet type desserts.  Nothing special but not bad.The staff was a little slow with bringing my first iced tea but when she did bring it, she brought two glasses at once which was nice.  The buffet is OK but for the price, I'd go to others which have a better selection of items.

Review Text :
Located on the strip. . . not THE Strip, just a long, long strip of strip malls full of chain stores endlessly repeating themselves until you start to feel more than a little insane.  This eatery appears to be one of the better options amidst the sea of Applebees, Taco Bells, and Burger Kings.Standard American-Italian fare, is what you'll enjoy here, with lots of bread and large portions, which were quite welcome to our table of hungry hikers and climbers.  The tomato-basil soup was divine and the chicken marsala with mashed potatoes was A-ok.  My friend had some sort of lobster pasta that she was still swooning over the next day.  Service was energetic and pleasant.  Prices are higher than what you'll pay at other places on this "strip," but the food is noticeably better.  This is no destination restaurant, but if I found myself driving up and down Charleston again, I'd happily eat here again.Tip: If it's your first time here, don't try to big-time it and act like you've been here before.  If they learn you're a virgin to Carrabba's, you get free fried zucchini sticks!  (I might be a virgin every time! - Ladies, don't try that at home.)

Review Text :
Oh Joy! - Ben Thanh is a treasure!  Let me explain.  Years ago I started eating at Lang Van when it was just a  few weeks into a hasty neighborhood pharmacy renovation.  I got to know No Duong and her wonderful husband Robert and became a long and loyal fan.   For years it was the only Vietnamese restaurant in town for me.  Let me emphasize that it is still a very nice restaurant with good food and a great crowd (emphasize crowd lol!).  Then they sold out and moved to California and I was sad to find that Robert had had a serious stroke.   Now nearly twenty  years later and quite by accident I stumbled into Ben Thanh and there was Mai Duong,  sister of  No.  During this visit to Charlotte I have been here to Ben Thanh twice.  First I was amazed to see many of the old North Charlotte Art, Music, and Poetry crowd.  Mai is now all grown up with a great husband and wonderful children and owns the restaurant.  The food was excellent.  The first visit I had perfectly prepared shrimp and squid Pho. Actually to be proper this was the rice noodle variety called Hu Tieu Hai San. (#34 on menu)  It was fantastic!  On the next visit, this time with friends and old Lang Van pioneers, we had Curry Lemon Grass with shrimp and squid. (#78-81on the menu)   Very spicy and absolutely perfect.  Not over cooked so the squid was not the least bit rubbery.  I had my usual sparkling water and one of my friends had her traditional 33 Vietnamese  beer.  I hope I have time to go back for one of their Hot Pots. ( Tom, Buc, Bo and Lau, Thap Cam Chaua Cay to be proper.  # 82 and 83 on menu). This is a great dish in which you are served a great  bowl of noodles and broth along with a platter of assorted chicken, squid, beef, etc. that you add to the very hot  broth (it has it's own little heater).  This is accompanied by a large plate of greens, peppers, bean sprouts etc (as in Pho dishes).  It is a wonderful do- it yourself-at-your-own-table delight that is plenty for two people.  Check it out on their web site menu.  But the best tip I can give you is to ask Mai to just recommend something.  After a brief examination of your preferences regarding spice, noodles, rice, etc. She will make a perfect suggestion.  You can't go wrong.  All and all this place is just wonderful - the ghost of Lang Van past as it were and it will surly  be my new favorite when I come to Charlotte.Six yelp stars Fantastic! !  !  *** ***Like a significant first date I was here for the first time in September 2010.  A friend took me here and he ordered what he usually got  #40. Bun tom, Thit Nuong, Cha Gio (until this meal).  I ordered the Lemongrass Curry with Beef (having no idea if I would like it).  My friends dish came out first and I took one bite and said "wow I wish I would have ordered what you got"!  He said something like "I told you how good this place is".  Then my dish came out and I think the next several times we both ordered the Lemongrass Curry with Beep though it is very tasty with Chicken too. More than half of the time I get the Lemongrass Curry and my second Favorite is # 41. Bun Tom Nem Nuong Cha Gio: Grilled Pork, BBQ Shrimp, Pork Meatball, Imperial Roll, Carrots, Minced Peanuts and Cilantro on top of Vermicelli Noodles, Mint, Cucumber, Bean Sprouts with a Fantastic Fish Sauce.About half on the time I also get the Wonton Soup!  The Canh Chua Ga (Sweet and Sour Soup with Chicken is also good though it is entree sized.  The Vietnamese style of serving Coffee with Sweetened Condensed Milk is my Favorite and Dessert I like here.The Service is Perfect!  The Decor is umm, some may call it a hole-in-the wall and OK maybe it is... Who Cares - The Food is Spectacular!The neighborhood used to make me want to write a fast song and wait to sing it in my car!Lemongrass Curry is a "Gateway" Curry so watch it!  EAT it and see for yourself!My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. This place is such a gem! As they offer a good selection, you take just about anyone here for lunch. We recently took my boyfriend's mother and she was so in love. The waiter got the hint that she was Laotian and tried translating some of the dishes to their Lao counterparts for her to know what they are.Best things to get are the Bun Bo Hue (spicy noodle soup) or the Hu Tieu Mi (egg noodles in pork broth). You can never go wrong with Pho Dac Biet (combination rice noodle soup) either.

Had lunch here today - was bummed to learn that whatsherbucket from Hell's Kitchen doesn't work here any more.  I wonder if the food would've been any more "wow" if she did.  The restaurant is lovely and the servers very helpful (although in the interest of full disclosure I should note that we were dining with hotel staff, so. . . ).The food was okay.  We started with an antipasti platter with olives the size of my head, giant blocks of parmesan the size of my torso, and roasted peppers and artichoke hearts (both standard sized).  I also had a yummy piece of bread with cheese and herbs baked on top dunked in oil and vinegar.  A simple mixed greens salad was nicely dressed up by chucking some of the items from the antipasti platter on top.  The pasta was okay, the chicken was okay, the greens were too bitter for my taste, but my fellow diners loved them (and the salmon).The tiramisu was seriously good, with a sticky consistency to the mascarpone cream that made it super easy for me to imagine how well it'll stick to my hips.  I only had three bites and I'm pretty sure I can see them right where I imagined them going with the rest of the carbs I carelessly wolfed down.What an underwhelming dining experience! This was my first time EVER stiffing a waitress, the service was SO crappy that I honestly felt she should tip me for putting up with her for my meal. We arrived at July 18th around 7:10pm. We were greeted by a not-so-smiley hostess and seated at an extremely wobbly table. We sat unacknowledged for at least 5-8 minutes without being offered a menu, water, bread, ect. Once we were greeted, we let our server know that we had an 8:30 pm movie to catch. She took our drink orders, 5 minutes went by and then she came back to let us know they were out of Glenlivet  12, 18 and Glenfiddich Scotch. Acceptable, she doesn't do the liquor order... We picked new drinks; but when I finally got my margarita I immediately told her that I couldn't taste anything but straight sweet & sour. She laughed, kind of rolled her eyes and said she would get me more tequila. SHE DID NOT MENTION SHE WAS CHARGING ME FOR A PREMIUM TEQUILA SHOT! I have been a bartender on the strip for awhile now, so I know what a margarita should taste like. At this point, I looked around the restaurant. I took note that the people next to us had A BLACK PIZZA. I decided to avoid that entree and I mentioned to my bf that maybe we should just leave because I didn't see this place as improving. My menu was also inserted backwards, my place setting didn't have a napkin and our waitress seemed not interested in waiting on us. So maybe they just suck? 25 minutes into our meal we FINALLY got water & bread. Our orders were taken and we were placed. We don't see our server for awhile... 8:10 pm rolls around (20 mins until our movie) and we finally see our waiter. We ask her whats up. We say we are probably going to just have to skip the movie and she says "what, its only like 8pm?" She then smirked and walked over to the hostess stand... Wouldn't the right thing to do be go check on our food??? At this point, we are kind of frustrated because we feel we gave them plenty of time to cook a salmon and a piece of veal. 8:15 our food FINALLY arrives. We try to eat it super quick... Not exactly how you want to eat dinner... The food was decent. I felt my spinach was slightly over salted, but I ate it. My boyfriend liked his dish. We may actually have given this place a second try if our waitress wasn't so snotty and slow! We didn't have time for an app or dessert, Although you think an hour and a half would be enough time for a casual italian place?? She didn't offer my bf another scotch even though his was clearly gone... The surprise came when we got the bill. Our waitress had charged us for an extra patron shot... I was pretty furious. Why? Not because we cant afford to have as many shots of patron as we want, but because my margarita was absolutely wrong in the first place! AND the extra shot cost $12, somehow more than the margarita itself ($11). We asked to talk to a manager because we thought maybe he may want to know his server wasn't up to par; she wouldn't bring him over. SO we left. I would feel horrible for her support staff for not tipping, but to be honest I didn't see a busser or anything. They actually didn't pre-bus our bread plates or our cheese plates at all. I WONT BE BACK! Worse $100+ meal I have had in Vegas, and trust me I have had a lot. We have better service at the yard house. Heck, the Pinks Hotdog place is probably a better choice because at least their staff has some pride.  If you MUST eat here, at least make sure you don't get a short girl with a brown ponytail (Michelle)  as your server. Check total: $130.80Check #: 9143471

Review Text :
I've been to The Vig a handful of times... for at least 4 lunches, a few times for just drinks / happy hour, and at least 2 dinners.  I think that is a fair amount of visits to justify the 4.5 star review rounded up to 5 stars that I am giving it now!I've always had friendly and attentive service, and I've never had a problem with the food or drinks I've ordered.  Granted, I've probably just ordered beer, iced tea, or water, but still :)I'm adding The Vig to my list of places to go for great sweet potato fries.  They also offer really yummy starters including the Vings (grilled wings), Grilled Veggie Platter, Hummus, and Ceviche.  At lunchtime, I recommend the Cobb salad although several friends of mine consistently order the Vig Azz Burger.  For dinner, I love their "Miso Hungry Salmon."  As mentioned in other reviews, their outdoor dining area and bocce court are just what Phoenix needs more of on a beautiful day or evening!  So much fun!If this beautiful weather continues, I'll be hanging out at The Vig again very soon!Nice.    I was thinking about writing a big long rant about how trendy/yuppy everyone at this place seemed to be but I thought "hey wait a second, I'm here too".Great food, great drinks, maybe just a bit pricey.  For a Wednesday night this place was packed.  Wonderful outdoor patio.Good thing you can park across the street so that way they can't see that you don't drive a Beemer and spit in your food.  There must be some sort of shuttle bus from North Scottsdale to this place every hour or something, or how else could you explain where all these beautiful people came from.Awful!  First, let me start by saying, I have waited nearly a week to cool down and write this.  In addition, I have worked in the restaurant industry for over six years.  I have cocktailed, managed, waited in fine dining and bartended.  This place is totally overrated, they need to shut down, hire new staff, and start over.  I went here last Friday night with some girlfriends for my birthday.  From the minute I walked in, I knew it was going to be a bad experience.  My party had already arrived and been sat, but I didn't know where and no thanks to the retarded hostesses that failed to greet me, took me 10 minutes just to find my party in the giant mess.  The place was WAY too crowded, the staff couldn't even get around and their sections were clearly too big for them. Once I found my friends on the patio, which is lovely, it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to greet us, and then another 10 for her to come back and take our drink order.  She then arrived with an appetizer my friends had ordered previous to my arrival but failed to bring silverware or plates.  Well, the spinach dip looked good, not sure how it tasted because by the time she remembered, it was cold.  After this it took another good 15 minutes just to order dinner and I figured I better get a drink in while I had the chance.  Food arrived, by now we actually had eating utensils.  The food was OK, nothing spectacular.  I had the shrimp appetizer and hummus, friends had the chicken sandwich, sweet potatoe fries and a cheese quesadilla (not many veggie options), oh and they charged her $9 for it.  The food was nothing to write home about.  After our meal was finished was when things got really bad.  A woman came up and asked for one of our chairs, we told her someone was sitting there, and her response was, "I just don't understand where all of our f-ing chairs went".  My immediate reaction was 1) you work here? 2) did you really just talk to a guest that way? and 3) I don't give a rats @$$ where your chairs are, stop interupting my birthday dinner and move along, that is not a problem for us to solve.  She started to step away, look around, and then had the audacity to return to the table, demand the chair from us and continue to argue with me.  I told her that my friend was in the restroom, she was still sitting there, which should have been evident by the fact that her dirty plate (along with all of ours) was still on the table, and her purse was in the chair and I demanded to speak to a manager.  Needless to say, she went away in a huff.  At this point we decided it was time to leave.  Waited another 10-15 minutes for the check, only to have a birthday brownie and candle arrive as I was standing up to leave.  Where was that 20 minutes ago when we were finished with dinner?  Oh, and by the way, bad waitress, you took all of my silverware away.  At this point I told the waitress about all of the issues, the manager never did appear, maybe they don't have one, it sure would explain a lot.  She did offer to comp one of our appetizers, but at this point I didn't care, she had already charged us our bill!  To top it all off, as I was leaving, the hostess and wine steward/manager/not sure but he was in a suit, were having a playful little fight in which they were slapping each others butts and bending over....great first impression, and last might I add, in the entry way.  After the girl almost slapped me I politely excused myself and walked around her to exit the place, NEVER to come back.  There are so many better places in the valley to go: Postino, Chelsea's, Radio Milano, Portlands, Barrio Cafe, La Grande Orange, Houston's, Merc Bar, Zen 32, Tarbell's, City Hall, Rokerji, Phoenix City Grill, Sierra Bonita, etc., all within a few miles, why would I bother coming to this yuppie place ever again?  Needless to say, the service was HORRIBLE and the food wasn't good enough to make up for it.  Oh, and the people that go here: I might as well stay up in North Scottsdale, it's the same yuppie, "I'm so important"/30K millionaire crowd that has taken over what used to be the great city of Scottsdale.  It's sad, I really wanted to like this place and it has the potential to be fabulous...if they just start over.Don't waste your time or your money.Dear Vig Hater,If you don't like going to places with snobby, "Scottsdale" patrons, don't pick a restaurant/bar that looks trendy, has trendy menu descriptions, and describes itself as a "modern tavern." If you want something more laidback, find yourself a local spot with a more casual feel and leave the Vig alone!ChristineDear Christine,It's definitely possible that a trendy place draws a crowd who either is or considers themselves trendy, but I have another problem with the Vig: it's in a sketchy neighborhood! I don't feel comfortable coming here at night or parking next to the check cashing place. Vig HaterDear Vig Hater, The area around the Vig borders Arcadia, considered one of the nicest neighborhoods in Phoenix. I wonder where you live that you consider this area "ghetto." If you have an aversion to check cashing joints and Circle Ks, I strongly suggest you never make the field trip to Pizza A Metro.ChristineDear Christine,But isn't the food at the Vig not that great?Vig HaterDear Vig Hater,There, I'm going to have to meet you in the middle. My veggie sandwich (called "The Vigan") with a side of sweet potato fries was really well-prepared, but I can see some of the other dishes being more amusingly-named than well-executed. Since this place is only two minutes from my office, I plan to go back for happy hour or dinner. I will definitely update when I do. ChristineTO BE CONTINUED...Dear Vig Hater,I went back to The Vig for happy hour a few weeks ago, and I'm going to have to officially declare my disagreement with you. Even thought it was ridiculously crowded (and we had to wait for a seat on the patio at a mere 5 p.m.!), I thought the happy hour scene was dynamic and exciting; people were having a lot of fun, and the whole place felt alive. Plus, the well drinks were really cheap and the duck & mushroom quesadilla I had was really well-executed and satisfying. I would return here for lunch or happy hour in a second, and that my friend, makes for a five-star experience. ChristineThe Vig has DEFINITELY become one of my very favorite spots, so I am doing an update. You absolutely have to sit out on the patio for the best experience! Especially this time of year (early spring). Try the artichoke dip and the Alfredo tortellini with a glass of the Kung Fu Girl Riesling. I'm serious. If you don't, you are making the worst mistake of your life! The service is always friendly and pretty quick. Pam, the manager, is normally bopping around making sure everything is running smooth. I don't mind walking across the street to park, and it is super cool that they have The Vig Rig ... a free van that will pick you up AND take you home, all for a tip! I have never taken the Rig, but I keep the card handy in my wallet should I ever have an insatiable need to visit the Vig once I am already imbibed. Or without vehicle. Also, it is worth a trip to the bathrooms. They are really cool and smell so great!When Jared suggested The Vig as a dinner option tonight, I jumped on it... I hadn't been there in ages and on a night like tonight with perfect weather, who wants to eat inside?  Not us!So we headed over there... and enjoyed another positive experience - for just $30 too!  Actually, it was $35 with Valet parking (my pet peeve).  We were seated outside right away and service was attentive... I was disappointed to see that the menu changed and my old standby favorite salmon entree was no more.  I decided to try the new salmon entree despite a totally different preparation (it went from teriyaki to a spicy achiote pepper rubbed grilled version).  It was ok - not great, but the side of corn cake it came with was uhmazing.  Jared had a grouper special that was tasty as well.  We used our will power and did not order the sweet potato fries tonight, but I am still kind of wishing we did!After dinner, we played a quick couple games of bocce ball - beware, there is a kitty cat that hangs out on the 'court.'  We mistook it for an injured rabbit for a moment, but were happy to see it was just resting!  I'm sure we won't wait so long to return to The Vig again soon!Okay Pro: the atmosphere on any spring sunday on the patio makes it worth five stars all by itself.Con: can't I get a well drink special on said sundays?Pro: half off all bottles of wine though!  even my favorite, sonoma cutrer.Con: the manager (who was named after a cooking spray, no more info than that for you) doesn't appreciate drunk stupidity.  I know this, because she doesn't appreciate me when I'm drunk and stupid--according to sources--and i am the very epitome of drunk stupidity.  Now, wouldn't you, if you were a bar manager, realize that the very life blood of your business is drunk ppl making bad decisions?  Come ON people?Sorry about the aside.  Pro: the quesadilla they have is goddamn good--it even has shrooms in it which I ordinarily avoid.  But solid food, drink, and atmosphere give this place 5 stars for me.  With a 1 star deduction:)If it is Sunday, I am at The Vig.I love Sunday at The Vig so much that I made my family come for Easter dinner.I can get a bottle of my favorite wine (Kung Fu Girl Riesling) for $15 and sit there drinking it all day on the patio whilst listening to covers of songs that my band also covers, except they sound so much better when 1) I'm drunk and 2) The Daelins are playing them.My only beef is that some of the douchettes that come got my squirt guns taken away. Next time I will just dump water on your head and you will shrivel up like the Wicked Witch of the West. Also, The Vig is singlehandledly going to fill up my new website: www.uradoosh.comUmmmmmmm. 32 douche bags in camouflage pants and an endless supply of cougars pretty much sums up my Thursday night at The Vig. I was wicked wicked excited to try this spot because everyone else seems to love it so much. Even though my first impression of the crowd wasn't the greatest, I too, am a fanFantastic wine options, many bottles were split amongst friends and no-one, not even my asshole connoisseur friend complained. If I weren't so intoxicated, I would be able to tell you what exactly it was, that I was drinking.. but I cant.. Carmen something? Their menu is awesome, lots of variety. The Double Down Hummus plate is the shit. Lovely outdoor seating area to boot. I hear Sundays are the best to come, mostly for their phenomenal drink specials. I could really see myself loving this place in late October.. not only because it is my favorite time of year, but also because there is nothing better than scarves and boots, wrapped in a shawl, enjoying the autumn air with a nice glass of Cabernet.g and i drive up and see the valet sign - $2. really? you offer no onsite parking except valet and you require me to pay for it? i will tip ... i always tip. but actually charge a fee? ugh. so not classy. that started things off on the wrong foot. g and i were the last to show up. our group of 6 was seated at a table on the patio that was clearly made for four, five at the most. i was smashed between  two others - i'm all for being the peanut butter, but this was absurd - i spent the meal dodging elbows. tables were too high or the seating was too low. either way, it made for an awkward and uncomfortable dinner. the staff had to notice the awkward arrangement - i don't know how you could miss it. anyway, onto the food ... well, it was fine. my caesar salad was fine, as one might expect - it is pretty hard to screw up caesar salad. g had the wings and the sauce was more bbq-y than buffalo-y. the menu seemed to be a bit pretentious: words like "deconstructed" and "dauphinoise" litter it. the energy was really, really strange. yes, it is a modern pub, but i kind of expected more. and yes, the valet situation and the place's creepy energy really irked me.One of my best friends sends me a text that she's having dinner with her mother and I should join them.  There was an hour wait, so I had plenty of time to throw something on and make myself look presentable.I show up and the place is packed.  Crazy busy.  Full of men.  The place is a meat market.   I spot my friend and her mom, who have known me since I was 12, in a dark corner below a TV screen.  I haven't been to dinner with my friend's mother since we were in high school.  It seems they have had a little wine, well my friend had a little and her mom apparently drank a whole bottle before she even got to the restaurant. I perused the menu while my friend's mom tells me that she doesn't want to date divorced men because there must be something wrong with them.  She herself is divorced and in her fifties- what else is there?  I decided on the gnocchi because good gnocchi is like crack to me.  It was rather delicious, but I would have swapped the edemame for peas.  Nobody like peas anymore except for me, I guess they're just not cool. I start to feel like I need some air.  There are so many damn people and I can't possibly scoot my chair in any further to let more by.  As soon as my gnocchi was no longer occupying my attention I felt like I just needed to get the fuck out of there.  Something about the atmosphere made me uncomfortable.  I'm not deducting a star because it could have been the awkward conversation with my friend's mother about how she would rather be alone than date someone another woman didn't want.  I don't know how that even makes sense, every woman has been with a man she doesn't want anymore.  It doesn't seem to bother my ex's new girl.   I would give this place five stars if it was a little less popular.  It won't keep me from coming back, but next time I'm sitting in a booth where random people won't be bumping into me or hanging over my table all night.  Although, that will probably only add to the wait time.I love The Vig. I've been on so many first dates at this place I've often worried that the staff was going to think I was receiving compensation for my...ahem.. "services". It's just easy, (unlike myself) truth be told, most of those first dates were last ones as well. :)The food is decent. Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken seems to be my meal of choice. It's quite good, even with my aversion to mixing fruit and meat. Half price bottles of wine on Sundays!! ... I really don't even need to continue the review at this point, but I will.The only things I don't like about The Vig are : (1)  the polished concrete floors. I've slipped and fallen (sober mind you) on more than one occasion. Yes, I wear 5" heels just about everywhere I go. So yes, partially my fault. (2) Men old enough to be my father coming on to me like they think I don't see the tack marks behind their ears from their nasty face lifts. It grosses me out. I can handle the young DB's, these guys make my skin crawl. If I'm avoiding eye contact with you or have a constipated look on my face this is NOT game on buddy...mmmkay I have few other complaints. Good music, interesting crowd, love the forced valet so I don't have to end any of those first dates awkwardly hovering at my car door like a 16 year old. Sweet deal if you ask me!Every time I visit AZ, I find myself at The Vig following an evening of hardcore Scottsdaling, and this trip was no different. Although I have missed out on the Sunday Fundayness of The Vig, I can easily understand how it gets hoppin'!  The outdoor patio is spectacular for lounging, glass clinking and chatting, and when you add music, you can see how the place would just light up.My experiences have been less rock n roll and more just rock-esque, but wonderful nonetheless. This past time we were waiting for a friend to join us and we were starving (read: hung over), so I asked the gentleman filling up my lemonade (refreshing and just enough tart for my taste buds) if he could bring us some bread (which I don't believe is customary), but ask and you shall receive must be The Vig's motto, because that is exactly what happened. It wasn't a half-ass attempt either, it was a country loaf with a butter marmalade spread in the middle. Delightful!Then came my Hot Chick (which I ordered for obvious reasons) - their version of a sensational toasted sandwich (grilled chicken breast, arugula, roasted tomato and smoked mozzarella served with spicy avocado spread on ciabatta). I only ate half because of the generous portion of vig rings accompanying the 'wich. They were so well prepared and struck the perfect balance of onion and ring!Another exceptional dining sesh at The Vig. One of these days I will go for just their cocktails (this eating thing is getting out of control)!We met friends for a 7pm dinner tonight (Wednesday) at The Vig... We sat outside and Cesar was our waiter.  There was a live jazz trio playing and we were also paid a visit from our kitty cat friend.The menu changed since my last visit which was some time ago.  I recognized many Old Standby items, but some new ones too... We started with drinks - I had a glass of Malbec, the boys each had beer, and our pregnant friend had a virgin mojito.  And while the five spice edamame appetizer was missing a spice or three, we still managed to eat most of it.  For main courses, I went for the Veggie Korma, J had the decomposed fish tacos, Jeremy had the Steak Salad and Johanna enjoyed the chicken sandwich.Next time I'll hope to try the new Vig, but this one is super close, convenient, and fun.  I still highly recommend it after all of these years!I went to my monthly philosophical gathering last Friday...we examine, ponder and discuss some of the more esoteric aspects of life!I had so much fun!It's 2-3 hours of defining, questioning, cussing, discussing, opining, agreeing, disagreeing...well, you get the drift...last week's topic was "What is Art?"I did not know that people felt as passionately about art and artistic expression as they do...and that includes me:)Normally, I would try to have a couple of pops before a discussion like this (that's to honor Socrates, Aristotle, Plato and their students...their sessions were often drunken debauches and the last man standing was the "winner" in the philosophical debate of the evening...good times:)But I didn't ...I was stone cold sober for this discussion...I might have even made sense! After we finished our discussion, several of us decided that a cocktail was a very good idea and headed to the Vig...I know, you thought it was hip nightspot, but it's really renowned throughout the Valley of the Sun as a philosopher's hangout.Nice place...all concretey from the outside, all wood and fabric and leathery inside...pretty...even "artistic":)When we got to the Vig, the scholarly discussions were occurring at full volume all around us:)* "Gimme a cig"* "DUDE!!!!"* "Don't look...it's Cindy and Darrel"* "Hey Baby...wanna go see my (car, house, dog, condo, wiener, etc.)"And much, much more...accompanied by enormous clouds of cigarette smoke (another aid to a good philosophical discussion).We sat and chatted and had a couple of pops...and I would have said that The Vig was A-OK...except for one minor philosophical disagreement...you, Mr. Waitperson, don't get to unilaterally upgrade my order to something far more expensive!I had no idea who was going to be buying (although it turned out to be me) and I ordered J&B with a cube and a splash (I didn't want to put the hurt on my philosophically minded buddies by ordering the expensive stuff:)...but when the waiter brought my drink, I knew instantly that this wasn't J&B...it was Macallan 12!And while I do love it so, it was almost 3 times as expensive as the J&B...I asked the waiter why he didn't bring what I ordered and he said...and I quote..."quote"..."The bartender is a scotch guy and said this is better"...end quote.No sh*t!I quietly said "I didn't order the Macallan...are you saying this is going to be the same price as the J&B?Oh no...it wasn't:(But as my waitperson said..."It's already poured...what do you want me to do about it?"I could have made a scene, caused a problem, left a $0.10 tip...but I didn't...this was philosophy night...I was in a philosophical mood!And my philosophy is this...I have a giant problem with any establishment that pulls this kind of crap...it may only be an isolated incident, but it could also be systemic....how many drunks check their tabs?I know, you're saying "well, Donald, it's only the difference between $5.50 and $14.00 for that drink", and you would be right...I spill more than that most days:)But I get to decide what I spill it on...not the bartender and waitperson at The Vig. At best it's corrupt and at worst, it's, well...worse than corrupt.From what I've heard, The Vig is quite the hot spot for bronzed local youngsters to collaborate over food, fun, and the occasional dabble in over-imbibing on Sunday Funday. While I can't say I've had the opportunity to day drink in this lovely venue, I can attest that they don't do a bad job with the food + fun part.Popped in last night for a little post-work snack, and it's pretty clear that the place is a veritable who's who with enough good looking people milling about to to fill an auditorium of extras for the set of Bring It On 3 (was there even a pt. 2?). In addition to smiling 20-somethings with Adonis DNA, the food was also pretty interesting and had options for just about every type of eater (carnivorous, health conscious, vegan, et al.). Because I've been on a bit of a plant kick as of late, I went with the Vigan (very clever working in the name of the establishment with the sandwich itself), and while I did have to ask to remove the Mozzarella cheese to make it a truly vegan entree, the sauteed portabella mushrooms, squash, red peppers and caramelized onions sandwiched between soft, rectangular focaccia with a side of onion rings was enough to leave me satisfied while wading in unknown dining waters. They also featured a pretty impressive 5-spice edamame appetizer, but their guacamole left a little to be desired. I take my whipped avocado seriously being that I hail from the avocado capital of the world, and while it's much like pizza in that even bad guacamole is still pretty good, it certainly fell somewhere towards the bottom end of the bland spectrum.On a nice night in Phoenix, something I experience very, very rarely in San Francisco, I can't imagine there are many better places that offer up a sprawling patio like theirs to soak up a warm evening in the city. In the immortal words of Charlie Sheen, "Winner!"It makes me sad to have to write this update... Almost.  Let me just start by saying that I am not all that difficult to please, although my bf may disagree.  But seriously, I waitressed and cocktailed my way through college, both in bars and fine dining restaurants which makes me almost TOO forgiving when it comes to poor service since I know how many things can go wrong that aren't particularly the wait staff's fault.  This was not the case here.    We arrived on a Monday evening to meet some friends for dinner and drinks.  We chose the spot expressly for the fact that both my friend and I had purchased Care Cards that benefit charity while giving you a 20% discount at participating retailers during Oct 14 - 23.  The Vig claimed to be one of these businesses.  Our party turned into about 7, and I had been seated for 15 minutes before our server came over to ask if I was thirsty.  I ordered a bottle of beer.  I see her next about 10 min later when she is delivering food to the table, although my beer is no where in sight.  She asks my companion if they want another, I politely let her know that I still had not received my first.  ANOTHER 10 minutes goes by, and my beer is finally delivered to the table.  In the meantime, my food had arrived.  They changed the menu and took my beloved seared sea scallops off and replaced them with Pad Thai (WTF?! there is no shortage of Thai offerings in the neighborhood) but they did add a few more healthy salads which is nice so I ordered a deconstructed fish taco salad.  This was the standout of the evening, and the reason for the 2nd star.  It is one of the best salads (healthy) I have had in recent memory.  Huge piece of perfectly grilled fish, crunchy salad with cilantro, salsa, guac, and black beans and cute little hot corn tortillas on the side.  As the evening winds down, we ask for the check.  My friend had presented her Care Card when she first arrived with her husband, yet when the waitress brought the bill, there was no discount taken off.  Fine.  We see her about 5 min later and remind her.  10 min later she comes back with a revised bill with a whole $4.20 taken off.  Our check was $200.  I was no math major, but come now. After another 5 minute wait, I asked her why only $4 was taken off, she informed me bc only what the Care Card holder ordered had been discounted.  This was also bullsh!t because my friend ordered more indeed.  I asked to speak to the manager, and informed her that I also had a card.  Nowhere on the exclusions did it say: will only discount on the items the card holder orders (the nerve!).  We are all one party, with one check - and if you are participating in a charity benefit- effing do so!  They are providing you with free advertising and 7 customers you would not have had otherwise on a Monday night!  I have to use the restroom, so my friend says she will speak to the manager.  I walk back to the table to see a brown haired dude (the manager) rolling his eyes as he walks away assuring my friend he will "take some more off".  We wait another 10 minutes.  I wish I was joking.  She comes back and presents the bill with $15 taken off the total.  I have never experienced such poor service and attitudes.  Sadly, this was not the first time this has happened in the year that I have lived down the street and probably frequented this place 2-3 times a week at my peak infatuation with the Vig.  But just like most relationships, what starts out all champagne and roses eventually turns into complacency and laziness which is why I am dumping the Vig.  It's not me, it's you.  You may look cute on the outside, but your personality sucks and I certainly won't introduce you to anymore of my friends.  I will never date you again, and I vow the only time I will ever contact you  in the future is if I'm already drunk and decide to meet up with you late night, but it won't mean anything.Came here last night with a fellow yelper and it was both of our first times here.  I've heard great things about the Vig in the past, and have been meaning to stop in for some time.The Vig is really a great little spot.  Plenty of seating, with a full bar and menu.  Staff here is awesome, and I love the way the place is decorated.  Enormous patio, decent bar seating, and plenty of great people watching.  Menu has a variety of options, and we went with the Artichoke dip with chips.  I stuck with a resling wine, and it was great.  There's TV's at the bar, along with plenty of space to move about.Place has a great feel, and I would gladly return in the future.  The parking here is a bit tight, and I did valet for only $3.  If you don't want to do valet, you can park across the street in the lot and stroll across.The Vig boasts one heck of a patio. Imagine sitting on an enclosed patio with friends, live music and twinkle lights. This is how it feels at The Vig. The Vig reminds me of a friend's home who has a great patio. It's easy to spend hours sitting on the patio and enjoying some good food and drinks. Plus on the weekends, you'll most likely enjoy live music as well! First of all, I love that they have freshly squeezed cocktails, including a delicious greyhound with fresh squeezed grapefruit! Their food here is delicious as well and I especially love their sandwiches and sweet potato fries. On a healthy day, I opt for the deconstructed fish taco which is fish and all the toppings that you can pick and choose to eat from. All in all, the reviews speak for themselves. The Valley could use more Vig's around town!Came here the other day with a few friends for lunch. I have never been to this location before only the one on 16th street.Same type of deal here. To park in their lot you must Valet. Which is free at lunch, but costs @ Dinner.Any way 3 of us were lined up,they must of been a little over whelmed 11:30am. We had our cars parked and proceeded inside.Nice restaurant, very cozy inside despite the Concrete walls. I see it as very 60's modern and I love it!. We were seated where inside meets outside, the patio is wonderful. It is my favorite part of the setting.Food was very good,awesome actually.  The entire party really enjoyed what they got. Our server was nice, but he was on a very slow mode. I know we waited over 30 min for our food to come out. There was 4 of us and it was lunch time. But, I really think they need more servers. Because, they really seemed over whelmed. Luckily we had a lot of time for a long leisurely lunch.But, had we of been on a schedule it would not of been cool.Bathrooms are clean ,nicely designed ,but very dark. Yes I looked good in the mirror, but reality was it was sunny outside, and I was not going to look so good out there! Oh well! HeeheeI  will diffidently come back. I like the atmosphere and the Food is good.Though you spend a little more than you would may have planned because, then you have to tip the valet a few $$. So be prepared for that.I was lucky I had some cash with me. More and more I never carry cash.Oh Vig, you simply sucked!!! Such a waste of time and money. The food and service here was awful, all except for the girl at the door the night we were there, which was on February 16th she was pretty nice. She was they only exception though, the guy at the bar was such a flirt, but in a very uncomfortable way. Then after waiting for our party at the bar we decided to move to a table and enjoy our drinks there. Then we come to realize that our server was a real stuck up and rude girl, that was nowhere to be found when needed and that took forever to come back to our table for assistance or further request! I don't think that's acceptable, we had to get other servers attention to get things for our table. Then after all that hassle, we stumble upon the nastiest nachos ever and okay drinks and wine, this was just plain awful and not worthy of your time nor mine!! Never again, never again!!!!!happy hour! they have a pretty darn good one. 1/2 off happy hour prices on their specific menu...we opted for the fish tacos....4 small tacos with a side of a rather spicy hot and delicious guacamole style sauce. excellent!i had 2 kiltlifters at 2 bucks off the standard menu. the wife and her friend had 2 premium cocktails for the same price. there are plenty of options for food and drink and their happy hour prices are top notch. the place itself is very cool. we sat outside, and yes, it was a tad bit warm. it's all shaded and misted but it was still warm. no matter as the food and beverages cooled us down. service was good. our water glasses stayed completely filled the entire time and our server was prompt and courteous, without being overbearing. but valet...i swear, i could live my whole life and not ever use valet. i understand the concept when dealing with small parking lots where numerous people park and/or you can get ticketed for parking in another properties lot, but i hate it. especially mandatory valet. well, i guess it's not mandatory, but anyway....i really enjoyed this place!If you like to gamble, and by gamble I mean serious sports betting, then you're all too familiar with the term vig. (short for vigorish)Which is why I've avoided this place for so long, the name simply repulsed me. No wait. It didn't repulse me. It dredged up bad (really bad) images of Super Bowl 36, where that piece of shit Tom Brady staged a last minute comeback, killing my point spread. This is about the time you learn what a vig is, and how much it means to a bookie.Fuck. I digress, sorry.The Vig is full of good looking people, so the ambiance gets high praise.Food is well above average, try the Thai Chili Chicken Wings. Coors Banquet served in old fashioned 12 ounce bottles had me fantasizing I was a cattle rustler in the old west. Crowded on a Wednesday night, our crew sat on the patio. It was hot out and I got a bad case of swamp ass. Luckily, I carry a small ziplock of gold bond mentholated powder which resembles about $10,000 worth of coke. The guy in the men's room who saw me putting it on my butt thought I was crazy. I told him coke on your sack is quite the experience if you can afford it.  After that, my ass felt like it was smoking Newports throughout dinner, enjoying my  Vig experience for the first time since Super Bowl 2002.Anyway, I like this place and you probably will too. Wait till the weather cools off if you're going to sit on the patio, or else have some mentholated butt powder handy.I have been to Vig for many an afternoon, happy hour, lunch and dinner. I live not far from there and I can promise this: The Vig is very, very popular. The Basics:+ Casual (like 85% of Phoenix). There are TVs inside.+ HH is M-F 3-6pm. ($2 off cocktails, $1.5 off drafts, $1 off domestic beer & well drinks)+ 1/2 priced wine on Sundays+ Elvis Before Noon plays on Sunday (time varies depending season, 6pm in summer, earlier when it's not god awful hot.) Great cover band. If you come once you'll know the rotation. + The Vig Rig will scoop up Arcadia residents. (Free!) 602-722-5976. Fr/Sa 5pm-2am. Su 2pm-10pm.+ Parking is tight. Bring cash for the valet. Otherwise play Frogger and park across 40th street. Far enough from Mamma Mia that no one gets upset.)+ And yes. That is a Vig cat you see leisurely making rounds. Don't pet him if you're allergic to cats. Stop complaining about it.+ Follow them on Facebook to catch specials. (A current summer special is $4 Titos Vodka for the summer.)+ Additionally look at their website calendar for deals. (Ex: Twenty-Twosdays = 1 app + a bottle of wine.)SEATINGMisters abound outside. Fireplace in the winter. Lighting almost makes you feel like you're in someone's backyard. Booths line one wall inside that seat four.People really want to sit outside. ESPECIALLY when Elvis Before Noon plays. If you have any interest in nabbing a seat on Sunday come early. It's ridiculous. Otherwise there is a bar setup in the back. People have been known to dance in the middle of everything. Kind of like watching someone shimmy at a wedding. You don't want to watch, but you can't help stare, in open fascination with your mouth open.FOODPretty good. And plenty of options for vegetarians and individuals who eat healthy. The sides are excellent to nibble on. (I'm a fan of sweet potatoes.) Can't go wrong with the guac and chips or "double down" hummus. Salads are delicious. My favorite is the prickly pear. Sharing is fun with the smoked salmon or deconstructed fish tacos. I've never met a daily flat bread I didn't like. (Note: These can be made vegetarian. The Vig will just remove meat. No additional customizations.) I've shared the banana bread pudding more times than I can count. (Shh!)MISCThis is a popular first date spot. I've run into other first dates here. I have NO idea why so many men want to take women here. Seating might be tough and you'll be hovering in the aisle trying to get a drink. Alternatively, you'll be seated up front waiting for a booth to open. (The Vig unfortunately doesn't have little beepers to hand out.) This place is kid friendly. But only in the way people bring tiny human beings and sprinkle them in with a bar crowd. I have no idea why this happens.And that's The Vig!The Vig has four locations:Arcadia, Fillmore, McCormick Ranch, UptownThis was my first visit to The Vig Arcadia. I had to meet a friend for lunch and he chose The Vig. I had heard a lot of great things about The Vig Arcadia, so I had high hopes.Although the atmosphere is super cute and intimate, it borders on too closet-y tiny when the restaurant starts filling up. I got there early, so I sat at the bar and decided to check my phone. My battery was very low, so I asked the bartender to point out the closest outlet, or I suggested she could take my phone, so she could charge it behind the bar. Unfortunately, the self-proclaimed "staff manager" was rude and positional beyond belief, which are literally the only 2 qualities a server doesn't need to have.Me: "Hi! I'm m waiting for a friend for lunch, do you mind plugging my phone and I'll have a greyhound."- We don't have outlets. Me: "Well, that isn't exactly the true, because everything in this bar is using electricity, including the blender you just used, so what you're really saying is that you can help me, you just don't want to. I find it shocking that an upscale restaurant in Scottsdale doesn't have outlets."- This is Arcadia, not Scottsdale. At that point, as she was completely rambling about the difference between Scottsdale and Arcadia, as well as the status of the electrical systems and a fierce desire to convince me that an upscale establishment doesn't have outlets. "Obviously, there are outlets in restaurant. Clearly, you just don't WANT to plug in my phone."I asked to speak to the manager, which apparently they didn't have one of those either or she wasn't allowing me access to him. I did still had hope that she might serve me that greyhound. Anyway, my friend arrived and we moved from the bar to a table. Then, the second part seems almost like were at another bar altogether. A new waitress cheerily gave us waters, told us the specials, said she would give us a minute, and was gone. She came back a minute later and took our order. All the appetizers arrived in minutes. The food was delicious. The server was a delight. The Menu:AppetizersArtichoke Kale Jalapeño Dip (which I had)Steamed Edamame (which I had)Guacamole & Chips (which I had)FlatbreadsNachosHot WingsSaladsSandwiches BurgersMains:Vanilla Braised Short Rib Tacos (which I had)Fish TacosMan n CheeseGrilled SalmonPad ThaiDessertsI have to say the the vanilla braised short rib tacos are some of the best food I ever put in my mouth. It's a shame to see an owner and the chef putting so much effort into making the restaurant a success, lose an extreme amount of business just because of one argumentative server who can leave such a lasting impression on customers. There is limited parking out front. Valet service is available. Hours:Sat/Sun 10am - 2amMon - Thur 11am - 2amFor more information:thevig.usI give The Vig 1/5 stars for putting a hot head up front to deal with customersOVERALL, I 4/5 highly recommend The Vig Arcadia!

Yes another Filipino Food Buffet.Yes we ate a buffet with food we could have had here at home in SD.Yes WOWOWEE was on the tv and we watched while we ate.Yes, I know, why do all that in Vegas?Don't judge me.Food was good! You know why? Because they had SISIG!! Spicy too!! YUM!Masarap ang lutong ni Nanay Gloria! (Nanay Gloria's cooking is good). The food was pretty decent and nicely flavored. We were surprised at the selection- we were expecting to have maybe half the choices offered.From what I recall there was- mungo (mungbean with bittermelon and pork), - pretty okay, but I make it better since mine is very meaty/savorypaksiw baboy (pork slices in a sweet soy sauce), * - BF loved this. Sweet, sticky, but nice flavors. ginesang pusit (sauteed squid w/ chilies, and bellpepper), *- I really liked this. Right on with the flavors.pancit (thin glass noodles),- was okay sisig (chopped pork with vinegar, chilies and onion), *- made with the lechon kawali, lots of chilies, added more vinegar for a kickginetaang baboy (pork in coconut &shrimp paste sauce), *- this was good. I love coconut milk based disheslechon kawali (crispy fried or roasted pork belly), - good, crispy. Like always, big layer of fat, but at least you can pick it off it you're not a fat lover. lengua estofada (beef tongue slices in a tomato soy sauce)* - the tongue was really soft, but I like how they kept them in thick slices to keep it juicy inside. The sauce was good, but I scraped a lot off since I like tasting more of the lengua flavorafritada manok (chicken in a tomato sauce- has bellpepper, potatoes, carrot),- I didn't tryginisang (squash, shrimps, green beans, bittermelon sautee)- grabbed only some green beans, okayginisang ampalaya (bittermelon sauteed with eggs)- didnt tryseafood ginetaang (mixed seafood in coconut milk)- didnt trydiniguan (pork cooked in it's blood and spices)*- pretty decent for the standard style of doing diniguan. I do it in a different style which no restaurant makes and I feel is tons betterpalabok (thick rice noodles in a sortve "gravy" sauce)- mushy, didnt likepork afritada (pork tomato sauce stew- has peas, potatoes, hotdog, bellpeppers)- had a small bite only, decentNilaga Baka (beef broth soup with chunks of beef and veggies like bokchoy, cabbage, potato)- didn't havekaldereta (beef stew)- pretty decent, but a bit more oily than I make itkare kare (oxtail, tripe, eggplants and green beans in a thick peanut sauce)- no oxtails to be found, way too oily, but the tripe was nice in it.beef steak (sliced beef and onions in soy sauce)- this was okay...it was straight soy...lacking that signature sauce lemony/soy/beefy flavor fried salmon- didnt tryfried bangus/milkfish*- pretty good! my favorite fish and it was fresh. pata na paksiw (pork leg/hocks cooked in soy and banana flowers)- didnt try, I dont really like the fatty leg rimsginetang (warm coconut milk dessert with sweet yams and tapioca)- too full to have dessertbanana que (bananas fried with sugar) - too full to have dessertfresh fruit bar- watermelon, oranges, pineapple, etc. - looked freshThe * are some of our favorites. BF really loved the paksiw- tender and nice flavor, I love the lengua the best. There are some extras you can buy but we were hella full to grab them. They have chicken empanadas, crispy pata (deep fried pork leg), sweets like polvoron (powdered milk "cookie"), pastillas (chewy milk candies), cashew tarts, tamarind candy, turon (fried banana and jackfruit "eggroll" cooked with a coating of sugar on the wrapper), kuchinta (steamed rice cake), pichi-pichi (rice and cassava cake rolled in grated coconut).  BTW- they are CASH ONLY. Lucky I had cash today, I normally don't roll with much more than a few bucks for tips and my cards. Simply put- compared to the Filipino a-la-carte places nearby, this is better in terms of quality and flavor and freshness (they have decent traffic so it doesn't sit forever). Add in the kicker that you can eat all you want for $7!. Some items were a miss like the palabok was mushy, but most were decent to good, spot on flavors. I can't complain since I can pick and choose what I want to eat and can skip out on the a-ok items and pig on the things I love. Yes, there's a bit of fat, a bit of grease, but nothing that you can't scoop out. It's kinda part of the culture...Flipinos enjoy their fat. It's not  really more than say other greasy cuisines like diner food, chinese, soul food, etc.. It's why I don't eat out all the time though is so I can savor these when I do decide to eat something greasy and homey.  I think that's partly why MY mother's food is best to me- she tends to buy only higher end, leaner meats, but cooks with all the love and flavor. I got used to my moms health conscious, yet still flavorful Filipino, but she's no where close so I'll take something 2nd best to moms cooking....specially since I don't cook my own cultures food on a regular at home (for shame, I know and I call myself a "cook"). Will definitely be back!I give it a 3 1/2 stars.My Pilipino Peeps say Nanay Gloria's is great!  "Hoi nakong, you will bee pull!  Da beep-stek is delicious!" I was told by an older patron, which I think thought I was one of her relatives.  Oh well, we do what we do!  Be respectful and tell nanay 'salamat'.  Nanay Gloria's is a Filipino eatery, they do either choices with rice and soup, or you can go for the gusto and do the all-you-can-eat-especially-if-you-love-pork option for about $7.50.  Do the buffet folks!  It's worth it if you have the time and are familiar with a lot of the dishes offered.  Which day to day will differ, but it's a good thing especially if you don't mind change.  We manage to always miss breakfast at Nanay Gloria's.  Some say it is probably the best meal they serve.  Rice, eggs, tocino, tomatoes, sweet longanisa (oh how I relish those potent loganisa burps), what's not to like?  And for a buffet?  Even better!  And with the breakfast buffet usually the lunch items are already mixed in there as well.  Brunch if you will.  All for the same price!  If you're gonna go, go BIG I say.We usually get here for lunch and there's often a crowd.  It can get busy between late breakfast and early lunch.  Seating is pretty limited, but at least there is a dining area on the opposite side of the buffet line.  But be aware when you go to Nanay Gloria's, the rooms are warm!  Even with the AC on I was still sweatin' a bit.  I don't know if they are just trying to save money by keeping the thermostat at the 80s or folks working there want to feel like they are back home in the islands...hot and humid!  Bring a fan to cool yourself down just in case.  The food?  Overall not bad.  Everything there goes lovely with white rice (which they server plenty of).  If you're into the carb and gluten-free life proceed with caution.  Hell, if you're watching your cholesterol proceed with caution!  Nanay Gloria's is some down home, stick-to-your-ribs food, and is often sitting in 'juice'...aka 'grease'...aka 'fat=flavor'.  Don't nobody be draining the fat!  Bastos!I like my crispy pata.  I like my bistek.  I like my adobo.  I like my bangus.  I like my sinigang.  I like it all over my rice.  Trust me, there are a number of pork dishes available at Nanay Gloria's, but I stick with my basic favorites.  Just hook me up a plate of food with a side of vinegar and garlic for dipping, some jufran, and a bottle of all-purpose sauce...and I'm set.  Let the battle begin!  We literally cannot go there more than once every couple of months.  It just takes a lot out of you!  Cholesterol and salt content must be monitored!  And extra runs on the treadmill help too.  But oh do I like the food.So the next time you want some pretty authentic Filipino food and you're on a budget, hit up Nanay Gloria's.  You will be greeted with a smile and and empty plate.  Fill that sucker up!Nanay Gloria's serves authentic Filipino dishes buffet-style. What you should expect from here is an abundance of food that sticks close to traditional Filipino culture. The food reminds me of the things made by your titas or lolas. I'm the type of person who really likes eating at places like this because it reminds me of the Filipino home cooking from my family that I truly miss.They have two rooms: a room with the buffet line and tables with chairs and the other room with booths and a water dispenser. They did not have a soda fountain, so all the drinks have to be purchased from their mini-market section next to the register. All the staple dishes are there: kaldereta, kare-kare, sisig, fried bangus, etc. I don't think they have a set menu, either. So you might not see some of the things I listed, but I'm pretty sure the popularly requested ones are always put out. Try their chicken tinola or the chicken adobo if you just want a common cultural dish. I was skeptical about their sisig at first, but when you try it I'm pretty sure it'll wow your tastebuds like it did mine. If you have an appreciation for true Filipino cooking, then this is the place for you. Don't expect anything but the full cultural flavor from the Philippines.Thanks to Yelpers, we found a solid Filipino lunch buffet in Vegas.  Unlike where I live (Sacramento), Vegas has plenty of Filipino restaurants to choose from.  Most averaged 3 stars, so really, I chose Nanay Gloria's based on the close proximity to our hotel (The Orleans) and I-15.  For $8/person, you can fill up on about a dozen entrees.  Their selection was satisfying enough for my family.  I was sad they didn't have any lumpia or any type of desserts except for fresh fruit, but overall, everything tasted pretty good.  There's a few shelves of dry goods from the Philippines and also a refrigerated section that sells salted red eggs and Eden cheese, amongst other items.  The mom and pop (Nanay Gloria and husband?) who run the place were very nice and humble people.  They had one busser who worked his butt off clearing plates and wiping down tables.  They seem to do a big takeout business.  My mom got some stuff for our mirienda ("snack") on the drive back home to Sac.Thanks, Nanay Gloria!

Friendly Staff, huge portions, Nontraditional "3.5 Star" Mexican FoodDrink Strength, Dessert, and Service gave them the extra half star.I understand how someone could have a bad experience here.  When the tortilla chips and salsa's were delivered to the table they looked lovely, but lacked in flavor, texture, and were watery. Their blue corn tortilla chips were excellent but they only made up 10% of the chips in the basket, and the corn tortilla chips did not compare. Waiting and snacking on this appetizer doesn't put you in the right frame of mind - thinking that the rest of the food will be great.   Two limes, some salt, and a bottle of cholula sauce later,    our Main dishes arrived and these seasonings saved the day.  We started with the Potato Portobello Mushroom tacos.  The tacos were in theory a great idea, my Uncle loved them, but all I could taste was potato.  The flavor had a lot more potential.  They could easily be improved by cutting the Portobello thicker, and marinating the mushrooms before they're cooked.  Perhaps grilling some white onions cut long and thin would enhance the flavor profile too.On the upside the Margaritas were pretty big, and reasonably priced for their size.  :-) This makes most Yelpers very happy. Well done Agave.Our second dish that arrived was the Filet Mignon Steak Fajitas.  Priced at $16 this dish is incredible; the quality of the meat alone and the amount included warranted a much higher price. Rice, beans, and  fresh tortillas (the tortillas were delicious), definitely helped. These guys do not over season and I doubt they add salt.  So you're probably going to want to ask ahead of time for lime, something spicy, and some salt.  After I doctored up the Fajitas they were delicious.  They had potential, but didn't  quite live up to it.In theory this restaurant is awesome.  Huge high ceilings, spacious booths, long wrap around bar, nice staff, fair prices, and all around plenty of parking in the shopping center they are in.  Really enjoyed our meal here.  I really wanted to give them a fourth star, but the flavors here just fell a little short. Now that's not to say that I wouldn't be back.  I will definitely come here again when I'm in the mood for Steak Fajitas.Unreal Dessert.  5 Stars for their Coconut & Espresso Flan.  3 Stars overall for food.5 Stars for portion Size.Date Rating: 7Pick up Scale: 1Strong Suggestion: Ask for hot sauce, lime, and salt.  Definitely helpful.Was here recently to meet up with some friends.  The weather was great, so we ate on the patio.  The heat lamps and fire pits were on, so the slight chill didn't bother us too much.We had the Chicken Quesadilla and Duck Quesadilla....both were simply amazing!  Of course, we ate too much Chips and Salsa (complimentary).....but who doesn't?  We topped it off with several rounds of Pacifico.Overall, it was a great experience.....the service was awesome.  I highly recommend the patio area during the warmer months.Return Factor - 90%I have never paid more than $80 for Mexican food in my life.  This place was very expensive and the food was decent.  I posted pictures for you to see.  My favorite thing was the Civiche.  They did make strong Margarita's.  The average meal price was $12-18.  My Cheese Enchiladas were $13.00!The one thing Agave has going for them is their ambiance and patio.  The patio has 4 fire places and the option to sit at the fireplaces (couches) or tables.  The service is less than average.  We waited for a host to show up to seat us for 5 minutes.  The server continually forgot to check on us and we had to ask twice for waters.  And when we asked when he recommends he said "everything."  I wanted to get up and leave right when he said that.I will not be returning.So I've been here two more times since my previous review and I think, unfortunately, this is going to be my LAST review of this place and the last time I ever come here.Agave and I came out to a rough start when it first opened many years ago and it seems that it has reached its pinnacle a year ago and it's down hill.  Very quickly.My wife and I visited on a Thursday night to make use of a Groupon that I purchased a month ago.  I called and made a reservation for 8:45pm and that went off without a hitch.When I got there, it went downhill from there.It was like they only had one waiter for the ENTIRE restaurant.  We waited forever for our drinks, our chip refills, our order.Rock Lobster Guacamole for an appetizer to complement the chips was good.  The chips ran out and we waited 10 minutes for more.Our main entrees were OK.  Refills never happened.  After waiting patiently for 30 minutes for our waiter to return, we went and talked to an employee - who was the hostess (hopping around merrily and fraternizing with her friends) while service just went down, down dooooown hill.Well, we were talking to the hostest saying our waiter was nowhere to be found and she condescendingly says "he's been helping you!  He's at your table."  (and he wasn't.)  Then when we walked back to the table I saw her giving my wife a very dirty look.I'm done with this place.  Agave needs to seriously look at how they're treating their customers.  It is a shame that this restaurant is taking up space in Summerlin when a restaurant that cares to give customer service and EARN their money could be here instead.Arrived at 8:45pm.  Got our check at 9:55pm.  Be prepared to waste an entire night if you dare venture here.

We've been to so many different dim sum places in Vegas we thought we'd give yet another one a try. Boy the wait is hella long during lunch time. We waited about 40 minutes! However, once we were seated, things started to roll rather quickly. They asked what kind of tea we wanted and it was brought out really fast. The carts started to roll our way and it had most of the stuff we were wanting to eat so that was a plus.The har gaw was slightly above average (compared to the rest of Vegas) and the soy sheet rolls weren't bad at all. My fave was the fact that they had 'ma lai go' and it was the authentic kind -- tan brown in color rather than sponge cake yellow.Like what the other reviewers have mentioned it's dirty and the bathrooms are filthy. However, pee before you leave your hotel and go early so you don't have a wait -- avoid having to go to the bathroom at all and you'll have a good meal. Very cheap dim sum I'd say!I must say that Dim Sum in Vegas is definitely an adventure. One has to find a balance between good quality and value. The best authentic dim sum place? I would definitely say Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine. The problem? Its pricey. The worst? I would say Harbor Palace. I would not ever go back there again. The middle ground? Orchid's Garden. Dont get me wrong. This place is definitely not a five star kinda place... but it gets the job done. If I'm going, I always (and I mean ALWAYS) go on a Saturday morning around 11-Noon. I think the food is the freshest and the wait staff is most tolerable. On Sundays, I feel the food is recycled from the day before and the workers try to rush you in and out like cattle.They have the normal dim sum fare. Nothing too spectacular. The food is pretty consistent and I know what I'm in store for. The cart pushing ladies are pretty nice to me now since I'm a familiar face. What I mean by that is now they dont try to force dishes on my table or recommend stuff that is catered towards the novice.If I had friends in town, I would most likely bring them someplace nicer. If its just me and my buddies, this place is fine. Why go to Changs and pay up to double for a slightly higher quality when you can go to Orchids Garden and possibly taste a few extra dishes instead?To put it in layman's terms, Changs is like a Wynn/Bellagio Buffet while Orchid's Garden would be a Planet Hollywood/Mirage Buffet. Easy enough?Dim Sum is a traditional Chinese cuisine in which small portions of a variety of foods, including an assortment of steamed or fried dumplings, are served in succession.  Easter Sunday and it was my cousin Manny, my mother and I eating out for lunch.  Usually Easter is dominated by hotels, casinos offering the standard higher priced brunch  However, we decided on Dim Sum (not a tradition) but I was willing to try it because it will please my mother and I am the one visiting Vegas.  The place itself is in northwest of the strip on Sahara and was not really far from where my mom and Manny lived (if there was no traffic) we got there in plenty of time to get a number and wait.  The proportion of Chinese speaking patrons were probably  90 to 1 to non Chinese.  The newspapers outside the lobby was chinese, all the writing on the menu board is chinese..  The good thing about dim sum is point and taste.  If you picked something you didn't like then you are fine to eat something else.So steamed or fried.  Most of the items we did get were steamed (not as in angry) but were in a metal or wood container, it's like lunch a la carte but they move the food around and ask you if you want something (sometimes the same thing several times).  Of course if you like it, then you can get more of the same.  We picked a range of food from simple short ribs, pork roast, pork and shrimp dumplings.  But Manny my cousin was apt for the challenge, he said I like chicken feet so we ordered it.  In all my experiences in eating Chinese or Asian food, chicken feet has never touched this lips.  However convinced by my cousin to try this slightly battered (coating not beat up) chicken feet.  I tried it, it was not as bad as I thought.  It was gelatinous and easy to eat and spit.  Now I can say I ate chicken feet but would I try it again, maybe next time when its deep fried and I have had several beers.Overally service was hectic but good.  The only caveat is the long wait for the check to be completed.  We thought they would rush us out but because the restaurant had slowed down since we came in, the new customers were getting the attention, we were just waiting.  Always drink tea when you are eating dim sum, it helps with the greasy food you are ingesting.  Oh, we did eat chinese broccoli, the designated vegetable.  We also had some smelt, my mom' s favorite (not crunchy or seasoned enough for me)The ultimate surprise which I always try to look for dim sum is the tofu.  This is not the tofu you buy in the supermarket, this is one is silky and warm and with a little syrup and was delicious - taho in the Philippines.Overall, for the clientele who believe this is good enough for them and good enough for us.  It cost us about 60 bucks which is 20 per person (no I didn't make my Mom pay - Manny and I split it)..  I had a good and new experience in Las Vegas away from the strip and the namebrand chef cuisine.Dim sum is the best hangover cure, and nothing screams Vegas like all day dim sum.Orchids Garden serves dim sum from 10:30 AM until 10:30 PM, every day.Called for lunch reservations at a friend's recommendation, then took a taxi over. Didn't wait long for our table. The Saturday we were there, the main dining room was chock full of families, locals, and those who probably taxied over. (Yes, all good eats are off Strip.) Orchids Garden is ready for crowds: they have a large parking lot and a second high-capacity dining room purposed for lunch, dinner, and banquets.We feasted on chicken feet, delicious green peppers with shrimp, tender tripe, tasty siu mai, pork buns, flour rice sheets, and fried shrimp balls wrapped about sugar canes - my favorite of the morning. Plates were strewn about, chopsticks flew. Servers constantly came by to clear our dishes and to ask if we wanted more food which was always appreciated. Drinks-wise, we skipped alcohol and sipped chrysanthemum and jasmine tea.The bill was reasonable, especially split amongst friends. I'll be back!Took a buddy here for lunch the other week.  I had never been here before and we were both starving.  Little did I know how ridiculously aggressive the dim sum servers were.  Do they work on commission or something?  Man.  We had 7 plates on our table within 3 minutes of sitting down because our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.  The servers annoyed my friend to no end but I actually found it pretty comical.  All the usual suspects for dim sum here and all done well.  I'll definitely be back.As usual, this place serves quality dim-sum and at a great price. Personally, there are only two decent dim sum restaurants in town and this is one. Overall, the food is great, service is on par and the prices fair. Some of my personal favorite dishes include the calamari, shrimp noodle and sesame bun with red bean.... Yumm..... Actually just typing that makes me want to go back. With regards to dim sum, I can only speak with regards to lunch. And yes... I will be back again, again and again. Good times Orchid Garden!Superior dim sum all day and every day!!!! What a BIG surprise!Who could ever expect this place to be in Las Vegas? Well, that's a factor in my opinion why reviewers trip out on Orchids. I rate my restaurants based on flavor more than any perceived authenticity and this place serves really tasty food!!!!I've been to a really decent place in the San Gabriel Valley (SGV) called Ocean Star which is pretty much the best true dim sum I've had and I much prefer Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant. Let me also say that Ocean Star is one of the top four dim sum places in the SGV according to Yelpers. I also went to a really, really bad dim sum place in Las Vegas too. If you look at the Elite reviews for Orchids you will see that they are mostly three and four star ratings! Few dim sum places in the SGV do better than 3.5 stars overall! Trust me, Orchids is great!!!!Lately, my BF and I have been to a bunch of places that do not serve Chinese brocoli - but they've got it here! We love our Chinese brocoli too! Just as in Los Angeles the dim sum arrives in carts. There is a great variety of items to eat and they were all good. My BF loves the seaweed wrapped stuffed rice here and he's really picky! All of the shrimp was fresh as can be! I really liked the dim sum sauces here. Another great thing about Orchids is that the dumplings do not fall apart nor ar they too sticky! They are alsonice and juicy! Not as great as Din Tai Fung in Los Angeles, but heck, few things are as great as Din Tai Fung haha! The tea was well steeped too! I really take my tea seriously and sometimes places serve yellowish and flavorless water. Not here!The place is packed with a mixed crowd! Service was a little better than in Los Angeles SGV places! Lots of free parking!3.5 stars, rounding up to 4. Partially because, lets get real, there are limited dim sum options here in Las Vegas. I was introduced to dim sum when I lived in the Bay area, so my standards are a little higher than your average bear.Came in for an early dinner at about 6PM.Love how they have the cart ladies circulating around with goodies- so many places in SF simply have you order from the menu and only have carts on Sundays or lunch service. Here you can do carts and also order menu dishes if you want.We got probably half the menu, including shrimp shu mai (tasty), shark dumplings (have to try), shrimp noodle roll (personal fave), fried shrimp ball (BF's fave), crab ball (star of the night, at $7/a pair), steamed pork bun (mediocre), chinese broccoli (must-have) and duck (which we didn't need at all but was tasty- especially with the sauce).Made the mistake of ordering the soup dumplings, which they said would take 10 minutes- and we waited and waited and waited. And my eyes are bigger than my stomach, so I got steamed pork buns while I waited (way too sweet, did not even finish one).  The lady told us they were "coming right out" four times. Eventually it was a solid half hour to get our three soup dumplings- and they weren't very good, and only had about a sip of soup inside of them. Underwhelming, would not get again.We spent just shy of $50, which is absurd for dim sum, but predictable for our over-ordering habits. It's probably also why we only have dim sum once every month or two. Dining room is nice, much larger than expected though you san see it's a large place from the outside. Service was friendly and attentive throughout, other than that ridiculous wait for the soup dumplings.Having done dim sum at many different spots around time, I am surprised it has taken me this long to give Orchids Garden a chance. They serve dim sum all day. The carts come around and it was relatively busy. Obliviously, it s better for freshness if they are pretty busy so the food can be replenished often. Most of the items we tried were decent. Obviously some had been sitting on the carts a little longer than was optimal. I can't say any one item was a standout but for the price it was good and filling. I'd be interested in giving them another go during a busy weekend morning to see how they hold up.2015 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 058/100Solid dim sum restaurant in Vegas!My boyfriend wanted to get dim sum while we in Vegas, so we did a little Yelping and found this to be one of the better places in the area. NOTE: If you do not have a car and are staying around the Strip area, this may be hard for you to get to. It is about a 10-15 min drive away from the Strip in a random shopping center.We came this past Sunday a little after noon and the place was packed. However, we must have only waited 5-10 min. tops before being seated!I love dim sum places where they push around all of the different dishes on little carts. There's something satisfying about being able to see your options and pick and choose what you want, and having it brought straight to your table rather than selecting from a menu book of pictures of all the different dishes. This place had a great selection of dim sum! We got a TON of different dishes. From what I can remember, I saw:ha/har gowsiu maiwu gokcha siu bao (baked + steamed)cheong fanlo baak goufung zaodaan taatjin deuido fu falai wong bauWe got lucky and were seated right by the kitchen, which was awesome because we basically got first dibs on all of the hot and fresh food that came out of there! I also liked how frequent the women pushing the carts came by. I felt like I was constantly checking out the carts and the dishes, and there was always a decent amount of food on our table. I've been at other dim sum places where it seems like you have to wait forever for another person to come by with a different cart. They were on top of their game here!Overall, I had a great experience at Orchids Garden. Would definitely return whenever I'm back in Vegas. Worth visiting if you love dim sum!I've been here twice during the day and twice at night. I definitely prefer dining during the day since the restaurant is much busier, so the food is fresh and there's a better selection. Unfortunately, I get a hankering for dim sum and we can only visit for dinner. I'm sure it's fine during dinner if it's busy, but I seem to keep missing the crowd. During our last dinner visit, the dim sum was cold and had obviously been out for some time. I didn't mind terribly, but I would hate to have that situation again.What continues to draw me back here is the service. It's much, much better than service I've received at other dim sum establishments. I'm not ignored and the carts visit often. Also, they're very accommodating when I ask for a dish and it's not available on the carts. They even inform you of how long it'll be for the dish to come out.The food is all right. It's not the best dim sum I've had, but most of the dishes are decent and still hits the spot when I'm really craving it.Group A ($2.40)Steamed BBQ Pork BunPan Fried Daikon CakeDeep Fried Meat BallGroup B ($3.20)Baked BBQ Pork BunSteamed Pork SpareribsSteamed Chicken FeetBaked Sweet Cream BunSteamed Pork Shiu MaiSteamed Shrimp DumplingShrimp Har GowPork PorridgeSteamed Beef BallBean Curd Skin RollShrimp Pasted EggplantBaked Egg TartSteamed Soup DumplingMushroom Shiu MaiChiu-Chow Style DumplingGroup C ($4.25)Fried Shrimp BallFried Shrimp PuffSticky Rice in Lotus LeafShrimp Rice NoodleBeef Rice NoodleGroup D ($6.25)Chinese Broccoli Pan Fried XO NoodleI like the Pan Fried Daikon Cake, Deep Fried Meat Ball, Baked BBQ Pork Bun, Steamed Pork Shiu Mai, Shrimp Har Gow, Bean Curd Skin Roll, Fried Shrimp Puff, Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf, Shrimp Rice Noodle, Beef Rice Noodle, and Pan Fried XO Noodle.I don't mind their other dumplings, but they're just okay. Not the best skin, but good fillings. Daikon (Turnip) Cake is one of my favorite dim sum and although I'll still eat theirs, it's doesn't have the best texture and it's slightly mushy. I like the flavor of their Pork Spareribs, but there is so, so much fat in relation to how much actual meat is available. I also don't like their Steamed BBQ Pork Bun as it's really dry. Stick to their baked version if you want Char Siu Bao. The only dish that I really don't care for is the Steamed Beef Ball; it's such a weird texture. We spent a little over $50 for two people (including tax and tip). You tend to spend less money with groups of 3-4 since you're sharing more and tend to get less food overall. Also, most plates come with 3-4 pieces.

Restaurant name  Thai Original BBQ Restaurant

Review Text :
This joint might be the shit, but I'll never know.I am confident in my formula for a good thai place: a grungy, ghetto-fied exterior with a clean and tidy interior packed with actual thai folk.Excited by the nasty, dirty exterior of the building and its sketchy location, I was disappointed to find the inside to be less than spotless.I was quickly, if nonchalantly, greeted and seated with a menu, among about 2-3 other full tables.After sitting over 10 minutes with nary a glass of water or a peep out of the staff, I had hope that the approaching server was on the way to take my order.Alas, my hopes were dashed when the server went to the table that was already busy enjoying their meal and proceeded to take a To-Go order from them, so that it could be ready when they left.Seeing that the other two tables hadn't received food yet, and had been there long enough to deplete their thai teas completely, I was very upset to know that I would be sitting starving, waiting for my food to be cooked AFTER these folks who were already eating their food had their To-Go order cooked.  Uh uh.  I left the menu I'd nearly memorized by this point and my non-existent glass of water on the table and skeedaddled.

Review Text :
I had a pretty good large Kobe Beef Pastrami Cheeseburger with side salad and Cheese Fries here.  But the meat did not taste better than normal Angus beef, and though promised a medium-rare burger, what I received was more medium than medium rare.  The Cheese Fries were clotted with Cheddar Cheese, and while still tasty, the cheese had largely hardened, causing the fries to become stuck together.  Diane's Aloha Fish and Fries were good on the inside but overcooked on the outside.  For me the surprise standout of the meal was the Onion Rings.  They were heavily battered but delicious.Our server was friendly, but not very attentive.  The laid-back casual island ambiance was nice for a relaxing meal along the Miracle Mile.XXX-1/2 overall!

Review Text :
Inside tip- ask for a "Claire Enchilada"- beans and avocado for a refreshing and one-of-a kind flavor.  The crumbled cheese is a fresher, healthier, and more flavor full way to prepare Mexican food- I will forever prefer this cheese over the gooey, slimy, fatty stuff used by other Mexican places.  For desert, be sure to request them to set aside a flan for you (otherwise they tend to run out on busier nights).  It is a secret family recipe that the woman who makes it for them refuses to ever divulge.  Again, this is unlike any flan you've ever experienced before.  Happy eating!Warmly,Kirin :)

Restaurant name  Shuseki

Review Text :
Since our little jaunt to San Diego, yakitori has been on our mind.  Seeing the sign for Shuseki for the first time, the menu fit right into what we were looking for.  Their menu offers along the similar lines of other izakayas and yakitori-type places.We tried a little of everything: (All their skewered stuff comes in an order of one.)* Takowasabi ($3.99) "raw octopus in wasabi dressing" - A slimy texture mixed in with the heat from the wasabi.  It was an interesting dish, although I can understand why others may not enjoy it.  Eaten in moderation with other food is necessary.* Torihatsu ($1.00) "chicken hearts" - I like the taste of crunchy-like texture of chicken hearts done yakitori-style.  Plus, it had a nice taste to it with a fresh squeeze of lemon and salt.* Gyutan ($2.50) "beef tongue" - Again, pretty tasty stuff.  Speckled with sesame seeds too.* Sunagimo ($1.00) "chicken gizzard" - I like the texture of chicken gizzard as well, although the Big F wasn't as impressed.  It reminded him more like liver this time, so he passed after the first piece.* Tontoro ($1.50) "pork" - Pork on skewers are just good, period.  When the fat hits the grill, it's just  brings out the flavors that only pork can provide.* Kurobuta Sausage ($1.50) - I was afraid this was going to taste like a hot dog, but it actually had a lot more flavor than a hot dog.  It was pretty good.* Yakitori Chicken ($1.50) - Nothing special about this, tasted like chicken with teriyaki sauce.  It was probably they least enjoyed out of all we ate.* Buta Kakuni ($4.99) "stewed pork belly" - Fatty chunks of pork belly stewed in a soy sauce concoction along with a hard-boiled egg.  You should probably order some white rice with this dish 'cuz of the strong taste.  (The Big F said my version at home was a lot better.)* Sashimi Salad ($7.99) - Their sashimi salad was a combo of raw seafood that included kani, ebi, maguro, tako, masago, seared albacore and saba on a bed of field greens, cucumbers and daikon.  The sauce they used was pretty good, although I could always do without the imitation crab meat.  There might have been some other fish in there as well.They have a bunch of other dishes that range from your basic sushi rolls to unique dishes (sea snails with kimchee sauce, bang bang chicken, simmered guts in miso) and ramen bowls (which we noticed other diners gorging on).  They have a lot of seating room, and a few tables in the back for sitting on pillows.Like other yelpers said, it's not a bad alternative to Ichiza.  They even sell Honey Toast for $6.50!  We definitely would like to go back and order a few other things off their menu.(Pics posted!)Couldn't get same day reservations at Ichiza, so hit up Shuseki again.This time we didn't go all out, but did have a few bites:* Ankimo "Monkfish liver" ($7.99) - I love this stuff, the creaminess of the liver is just divine on the tongue!* Okura Ika "Okra and Squid" ($3.99) - I like when squid is cut up in strips, and the okra gives a bit of slime feature on the bottom of the dish.  * Shishamo "Grilled Shishamo" ($5.99)* Agedashi Tofu "Deep-fried Tofu" ($4.99)* Tontoro "pork" ($1.50) - We ordered three skewers so we each could have one. * Buta Kakuni "Stewed Pork Belly" ($4.99)* Sushi Rice Bowl topped with Salmon and Salmon Roe ($10.99)Service was slacking...they were just so busy and couldn't handle the flow of customers.  The place was packed despite it being a weekday night.  Nearby tables were left waiting a long time just to get the check.  It was a good thing we were too busy enjoying the company to really notice that much.3.5 stars for this visit.(Pics posted!)Why do people still go to Ichiza when they can come here instead? This place is four times bigger than Ichiza, so you don't have to wait 45 minutes for a seat.  The menu isn't written in Kanji on the back of pieces of cereal boxes and scotch taped all over the walls. The seats are padded and comfortable unlike Ichiza who has wooden benches for chairs. This place doesn't smell like a public restroom like Ichiza does. And best of all, you don't have a psycho old man working here. Why not come to SHUSEKI instead?I walked by here and saw a sign that read Rauman instead of Ramen. It could have been a spelling error, or it could have meant that this place serves Yokohama style Rauman(a Chinese influenced variation which no other place in Las Vegas has).  I decided to gamble and walked in. I looked at the menu, and noticed that it literally had over 200 items on it.  I immediately noticed that they had Tan Tan Men. That's an extremely rare Chinese dish which is unrealistically popular in Japan! I've been to every famous Ramen house on the Westcoast, and there might have been only about 8-10 restaurants that serves authentic style Tan Tan Men. So the fact they had it here is a big deal for me! I decided to order the Tan Tan Men, Miso Rauman, and Karage Chicken. You might think that's a lot of food for one person, but because my body fat is less than 4% and I run anywhere from 8-15 miles a day, my body literally never gets full. When the Miso Rauman came, I couldn't believe how big the bowl was. I thought Anime Ramen had gigantic portions, but this place was actually maybe 20% larger than Anime's bowl which is already double the size of Monta and Sora.  Yes, this is a gigantic bowl of Ramen!!  I immediately tasted the broth and I couldn't believe it. Yes, it really is a Yokohama Style Rauman. FINALLY! Finally, they have Yokohama style Ramen in Las Vegas. They got a Sapporo style(Sora), a Tokyo style(Monta), and a fusion style(Anime), and now finally a Yokohama style. Ironically, Shin-Yokohama is the city where they have the world famous Ramen Museum. I heard it's like being in a chocolate factory, but with Ramen instead.  They use rib meat for charsiu here. Why hasn't anyone else ever thought of that? I still think that Sora and most Sapporo style Ramen houses have the best tasting charsiu, but the uniqueness of using rib meat made this Ramen very enjoyable. Off course Monta has the worst charsiu, they cook it ahead of time, keep it cold in a refrigerator, then while it's still cold they just drop it into your Ramen and serve. SHUSEKI, Sora, Anime, and Yagyu all have far superior charsiu to the overrated Monta. The Ramen also comes with egg, corn, large portions of bamboo, bean sprouts, ground pork, shredded onions, and extremely straight noodles. Yokohama Chinatown Dan Dan noodles are always straight and so pure white that they are almost transparent. The Tan Tan Men was just as good as what I used to get at the restaurants that were operated by ethnically Chinese residents of Japan.  Of course it could never compare to the extra thick Tan Tan Men of Chin Ma-Ya in Little Toyko, but it was still the best thing on the menu and of course the best Tan Tan Men in LV.  Also, remember that Yokohama has possibly the largest Chinatown in Japan. So the vast majority of Yokohama Ramen-Yas are going to be Chinese variations. The honey toast here is far better than Ichiza's and it's actually taller and they give more ice cream. It's only like 6 bucks too!The Karage Chicken was perfect.  It came plain with no dipping sauce. They use dark meat, and give you a slice of lemon. The meat was very juicy and tender. You know, everyone always says that Monta is the best Ramen house in Las Vegas, and Monta has these fanatic fan boys that give 1-star ratings to all of the competing Ramen houses. Last time I was at Monta, I overheard a boyfriend and girlfriend talking about how they never ate at Anime Ramen but gave the place 1-star, and made up a fake review all because it was Monta's rival. So, Monta does have a psychotic fanbase. But, let me tell you: Monta is far from having the best Ramen in LV. Places like Yagyu, Anime, Sora, and even SHUSEKI have a far superior style of Ramen.   While I was leaving, I spoke with one of the owners who is an ethnically Chinese man who was born and raised in the Tokyo area. He informed me that he ran a restaurant in Japan for over 15 years before coming to Las Vegas. We Las Vegas Ramen fans are very privileged to have a restaurant in town that serves the cuisine of the Chinese immigrants of Japan. These places are very hard to come by. BTW, he also said he might start serving a variation of jajangmyeon in the future. 5-Stars, and one of my top 10 favorite restaurants in LVYeah..I am one of them easily offended Japanese guys who is overly sensitive and gets disgusted when people order Ramen the wrong way. In Japan there is actually a proper protocol to order Ramen that has existed for thousands of years. Click on this link here to see the traditional Japanese way to order Ramen.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwGql-FyXjE&feature=youtu.beNot long ago my Dad told me a story about how he went to Ichiza to eat because everyone kept telling him it was "authentic Japanese food". Immediately when he walked in, the crazy old man ran up to him and said something to him in Japanese. Even though my Dad is 100% Japanese, he does not speak the language since his family came to America in the 1800s. So, my Dad was like: "what the f*ck are you trying to say to me?". And then the  old man informed him that he could only eat for 40 minutes and then have to leave... but he did not say this to any of the "western" customers. I didn't believe this story when my Dad told it to me because I thought it was exaggerated. My Dad tends to talk a lot of sh!t on people and pick fights so I assumed the old man had to have asked him to leave on account of his bad behavior. Well, in the last 2 months I had a conversation with my favorite Japanese sushi chef and he told me the exact same story. The old man had singled him out for being Japanese and given him a time limit. This makes me believe that Ichiza is trying to market themselves towards "western" customers, and they really don't wanna see our faces there anymore. You won't get sh!t like that at SHUSEKI.   I have probably eaten at SHUSEKI more time then I have eaten at Fukumimi, Monta, Sora, and Anime all combined. Mainly because they are happy to  stay open when I show up after midnight. I work 12-16 hour days and usually SHUSEKI is the only Ramen-Ya still open after 11PM. We all hate how Japanese businesses usually close very early....but, SHUSEKI is actually owned and operated by an ethnically Chinese resident of Japan, so he is willing to allow his business to open later.  When you walk into SHUSEKI, you will most likely recognize a person eating here who works for another Japanese Restaurant.  The evil old man from Ichiza frequents this place. The girls at INABA can be seen here. The legendary Hiro-San(the former fugu sushi chef who is semi-retired and working at Sushi on Rainbow now) can also be found here and he actually tells me that this is his favorite Ramen-Ya.  So, it does tend to be popular amongst the LV Japanese community even though they see it as a Chinese restaurant. Because this place is operated by an ethnically Chinese man who was born and raised in Japan, it's gonna have Tan Tan Men on the menu. The Tan Tan Men here at SHUSEKI is more of a Chinese style with a miso broth.  At Los Angeles Ramen-Yas they would actually have this on the menu as "Tan Tan Style Ramen" instead of Tan Tan Men. Well, I guess due to some of the negative comments by yelpers, the cook here at SHUSEKI has decided to modify the Tan Tan Men a bit.  I'm a little disappointed because some days I'm actually in the mood for a more traditional Chinese variation. I like the service here.  Ryan is my personal favorite worker. If he is working, he will make sure you get your ramen the way you want it. For example, Ryan can actually get the cooks to make me a bowl of Ramen that is so spicy that I just can't finish it. Last time he made me a Spicy Miso that was hotter than Orochon's. He also can get the cook to make the noodles more firm or soft depending on your preferences.  The girls who work the late night shift are really nice, but tend to be on the super shy side. Unfortunately, only Jen and Ryan speak perfect English and it's difficult to communicate with the other workers. My recommendation is to get the Tan Tan Ramen with a side of Karage and Gyoza. Why? Because I command you to do so...What can I say, I'm a big fan of Shuseki. Yeah, I know the fish isn't the freshest I can find in the valley and the menu doesn't really set itself apart from the other Japanese spots... But hey, I rarely have anything to complain about when I hit this place up. Not a fan of the loud and boisterous vibe of other tapas places? Looking for a place to come and dine and have a casual conversation without shouting over your tapas? Then Shuseki has got you covered. I am a big fan of a relaxed, chill dining experience and Shuseki is low-key enough to coax me back for multiple visits of the same expectation; a big plus in my book. Also, the servers are always nice and friendly so that's additional cool points that I'm throwing their way.Some of my favorite grubs here include the sashimi plate, the grilled whole squid, and the garlic tuna sashimi cuts with avocado on the side. However my usual go to plates are the Japanese fried rice omelet, the okonomiyaki, or the oyako don (the latter being my favorite). I could go on and on with all the other dishes, but these are the few that I find I order the most. The thing I love most about this place is the price. For example, the oyako don (my favorite) is big enough to ease my belly into satiety as it comes with a big bowl of chicken with an egg on top and a flavorful bowl of miso soup. Surprisingly enough, it's only $7.99 and I somehow find a way to take some home as leftovers. When you have an appetite like I do, the fact that I can take home some leftovers is just.. Wow. Even when I'm with the lady, we usually never hit the $30 mark when we are just grubbing and have no intention of getting involved with libations. Now that's what I'm talking about. Like I said, some people prefer the loud and exciting atmosphere of the other Japanese Tapas bars in the area but Shuseki hits the spot better for me. Price is good, food is grubbing, and the atmosphere is nice and comfy.DON'T EVER EAT HERE!  OWNER STOLE MONEY FROM US!  My family and I have been going to this joint for years.  One can say "we're regulars," even my daughter got excited each time we went there.  Few yrs ago, we decided to purchase a gift-certificate for our daughter since she loved eating there.  We were re-assured that the certificate will not expire.  Fast forward to tonight.  We decided to dine there tonight and finally use the gift-certificate.  Upon paying, we were all shocked that the OWNER REFUSE TO HONOR the certificate!  He claims: "it's not my signature."  What?  We BOUGHT THIS CERTIFICATE AT HIS ESTABLISHMENT.  Not only he refused to honor it, he also refused to give us a refund for buying HIS RESTAURANT'S certificate.  After all these years of being a patron to his restaurant with lots of fond memories of dining there with friends and family, even during the holidays (Christmas, New Years) and birthdays - this is how we are treated!    We paid for tonight's dinner regardless (awful memory = awful taste); however, I felt it was WRONG FOR THE OWNER TO TREAT US THAT WAY.  We've already file a complaint to BBB and considering legal action.

Review Text :
Okay, I was in Vegas a couple of weeks ago for the biggest gathering of nerds, techies, rocket scientists and geeks on the planet.  And yes, I admit, I'm one of them, and yes, we are HOT.Anyways, it was time to make a decision for dinner. The choice was to either have dinner with my fellow co-workers from out-of-town at this place or eat by myself at another hotel buffet (ugh, not another...).So, simple enough, join the group.The view is indeed spectacular and the service, attentive.  But, and a BIG BUT, the menu was predictable and boring consisting of your typical red-meat Black Angus Schmangus shit, salmon, and sea bass (woohoo) and pairing it with sides like garlic mashed potatoes (good gawd),  asparagus (yippee), plus salads (Caesar's, told you they're predictable), and soup (lobster bisque, oh come on), desserts (creme brulee....lord almighty)I got the lamb chops which was, ehh, okay but cooked a bit too rare.It's a revolving restaurant, so please, do yourself a favor and mind how much you drink  because I don't want to pick you 1,000 feet down, your pea brain splattered all over the sidewalk, nor smell your fucking puke in the elevator 104 floors up!  And don't get lost going around in circles trying to find the restroom. It's always been on the same spot, it's the table where you're seated that's moving, dumbass.Good thing it's on company expense because I'm not going to spend this much money on this place. Minus 1 more star for the looong ass way getting to this restaurant. And stop frisking me already, I'm not going to bomb Stratosphere, you TSA wannabe!The space elevator already exists. Ride it.  When I took the Stratosphere Tower Tour five years ago, I knew that the next time we went to Vegas we had to have a meal in the Top of the World Restaurant.  So, with a month's advance booking, we enjoyed a Saturday lunch here.  Looking out over the desert, no wait, out over the city, no wait, out toward the mountains ... from this rotating restaurant we saw the expanse of The Meadows as never before.  We could see the runways at Nellis.  We could see the red rocks.  We could see an entire train, all 4 engines and 100 cars, in one sweeping view below us.  Oh, how about 8 helicopters flying below us?  Yes, from 1,000 feet up, everything looks different.  Daytime or nighttime, it's a spectacular view.  Yes, we ate.  Let's see ... iced tea ... no, you know it was fantastic!  Here:  an appetizer of salmon with salsa, cream, and homemade chips, you had to be there to believe it, but go ahead and look at the pictures.  A Caesar salad that was not so Caesar, but an interesting mix of things.  Surf & turf.  You bet.  More salmon, on a bed of asparagus, or some such thing.  House champagne, which is why my notes were less than perfect.   OK, I forgot to photograph the entrees, what am I, a columnist?  No, I'm a guy who was having a great time in the sky.  Oh, yeah.  Stratosphere chocolate for dessert.   A variety dish, with 3 desserts on it.  Hey, I got a shot of that one! OK, so lunch for 2 was $109.18 + tip.  If you need to work up the nerve to go there, try the Stratosphere Tower Tour first.  Then, when you want to impress Your Lady, take her to this "romantic experience" restaurant.  You won't be sorry.Still coming off of my 'Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crabs' dinner, I was weary of what meal was ahead of us.  We decide to check out Top of The World for lunch. I really enjoyed our meal here.  My husband and I both choose the premiere tasting menu ($36).  We both enjoyed salads as starters instead of the lobster bisque.  The salad was delicious. Light, flavorful, crisp, and well portioned.  For our second course I opt for the steak and crab cakes; my husband gets the steak with the lobster tail.  We really enjoyed the crab cakes and lobster, but our steak was not cooked to our liking.  We both ordered them 'medium', and got them at medium-well.  And they're pretty tricky by sitting it on top of a mini portabella...making me think I have more meat than I really do.  Lastly the dessert.  Excellent array of raspberry mousse, bread pudding, and chocolate cake.The service at Top of the World was excellent.  One thing I found amusing was our host had under his name: Compton Hills, CA (all employees have a notation of where they're from).  Compton Hills, CA.....highly suspect. Haha.  The view is spectacular, and the food is good.  I wouldn't put it on my list of 'must-haves' in Vegas, but maybe 'must try at least once'.I think about 50% of the bill is going towards the atmosphere.  The food is not outstanding.  We went with the 5 course tasting menu since I couldn't justify paying $60+ for an a la carte steak when I could just go to Carnevino down the street.We still had a fun time and the service was excellent.  The jazz band was a nice touch and it was great watching people do the sky jump.  Definitely a tourist trap though.  Restaurant.com coupon helped the bill hurt less.  But I'm pretty sure this will be the only/last time I eat here.  Dinner some place else and then the bar here all the way next time.Top of the World or Vegas world at least.  At the last moment, my eating companions decided to eat here versus somewhere else.  It was off the strip but was told well worth the cab ride and the view is spectacular.Yep, despite the location away from the strip, I would have to agree that this place is great for the breathtaking views and their food.  Located in The Stratosphere tower, you have to make your way up to the 106 floor to this lounge/restaurant.  I am told that it takes approximately 120 min to go around the valley of Vegas.  The views are great during your dining experience with no obstructing view for your enjoyment.  Though the menu is a little pricey, you get good food and view.  We bought our own bottle of wine so it saved us a bit for the food.  For our appetizers, I got the tuna tartare. That was ok. Kinda fishy.  The oysters were good along with the foie gras.  Better eat them while you can before California's law goes into effect in July. No foie grae. Ugh!!!!Again, I decided to order the Muscovy duck with a light glazed with asian bok choy and lightly seasoned salad on the side.  It was asian fusion-like that was quite good, surprisingly.  While my other companion decided to go with steak, lamb chops and more foie gras.  The food was quite good.  I would come here for the food more so than the view.  I can't take the view home but I certainly can take the food home.  In my belly. LolThe service was attentive and I have to give it to our waitress who did an excellent job to accomodate our palates. Again, it was an expensive dining experience, but for the view along witht the food, you can  not put a pricetag on such.Had lunch with my brother and sister here, we didn't have reservation but were seated shortly.Service was 5 stars-Even when we didn't look much, we were still taken care of with 5 star treatment. The waitress was very nice and didn't hold it against us that we were not in our Sunday's best.Food 4 1/2 stars-We ordered from the lunch menu, they had the 2 specials, my brother got the burger and sister went for the crab cakes. Both were great. I had the salad which was scrumptious too. We shared a petit four of desserts. Unbelievably moist chocolate cake, the other 3 were good too but I was too blown away by the chocolate cake that I can not imagine talking about them.  Ambiance 5 stars-Whilst you sit enjoying the food, the restaurant imperceptibly revolve, thus you are afforded a spectacular 360 view of Las Vegas. Every so often you witness some bad @$$ bungee jump off the side of the building. Talk about extreme!One of a kind experience and only in Vegas!I'm so incredibly disappointed in this place. I was so excited to come here for my birthday. We made reservations months ago. I'll admit, the view is breathtaking. You get panoramic views of Las Vegas, and at night the lights make it even more gorgeous. If you get motion sickness like me, you had better come prepared. The restaurant rotates and even though they say you hardly notice, I'll have to say that you really do notice. I came here with a group of six. My sister joined us, even though she's on an extremely strict diet and would only be ordering a plain salad. That's when it all went downhill. Our server treated us like we were poor folk venturing out to a fancy city meal. We hardly saw her. She didn't explain the menu, and I was so sad because all the servers around us were being so friendly.  She, was not friendly. And honestly, if I'm paying they much money for food, I expect a certain level of service. The bill for 6 people was just under $400. We however left unhappy.The food wasn't spectacular, and I think it was really overpriced for that it was.  I got the ribeye, and it didn't have any flavor. My boyfriend got the salmon, and it was decent. I won't be going back here, I was so upset. If you want the view, they have a lounge. Check that out instead.

Review Text :
This place is now on my list of, "I don't care if I ate this earlier this week, I'll eat this again tonight!" foods.  Yes, I know, that's not a very memorable or catchy list, but it gets the point across!  I think I have to get my sukiyaki fix every couple weeks, or else I start to crave it!When ordering your meal you're presented with several options: the type of meat/chicken/seafood, the portion size and shabu shabu or sukiyaki style.  Once those details are out of the way, food is brought to you almost immediately.  The waitress gets your stove going for you, and you're off!  Your choice of meat is brought out to you, along with an assortment of vegetables that include onions, green onions, asparagus, carrots, mushrooms and cabbage.  You also get some udon noodles and a bowl of rice.  Additional condiments are chili paste, radish and green onion that you can add to your broth.I've had the shabu shabu here before, but it wasn't something that I'll be eating again anytime soon.  The broth seemed quite plain and didn't seem to do much more than boil my veggies and meat.  The sukiyaki however, has won me over.  I love the sweet/soy sauce flavor of the broth itself, as well as the fact that the veggies and meat do take on the flavor of the sauce.  Bonus Tip: Checkout the front table by the entrance that has business cards and newspapers.  One of the newspapers is a Korean newspaper, and on the cover there is a coupon for Swish that gets you 10% off your meal! ;)So i've a little confession, I'm a groupon addict. I bought the $15 for $30 coupon to come here, and let me tell you I was impressed.  From the minute I walked in, the aroma of yummy goodness filled my nose sending my stomach into a raging fit.  The interior decoration was pretty simple and low key, which I did like.  The lights are dimmed out, almost seemingly romantic if you ask me.  Upon entering we were immediately greeted by the hostess, which quickly seated us to our seats.  From there she handed us a thin menu, which seems to still be in the works I presume? Regardless of that, me and my friend both confessed to never ever doing shabu-shabu before.  The waitress was kind enough to explain what it is, and what she recommended. In my eyes, that was great customer service.  She recommended that we try "sukiyaki" mix if we weren't too familiar with the shabu-shabu flavor, since it does have more taste.  My friend and I skimmed through the menu and came to the decision of trying their prime beef and the garlic chicken.  As soon as the waitress collected our menu, our food was out within the next 10 mins. I was merely impressed with how fast they worked to keep their customers happy, and not waiting.  The garlic chicken was amazing, crispy and fried to perfection.  The sauce was just I imagined it to be, if you're from Hawaii and had the Mitsuken garlic chicken.....lemme tell you, this is almost an exact replica.  The meat came out for the sukiyaki portion, and yes, it was amazing too. The taste of the broth was uncanning almost like an outter body experience.  I loved the udon noodles they gave, and the nappa cabbage.  Honestly, just eating that in your broth makes the meal amazing....adding the meat is just a plus.  I indeed shall give this place another try.  Their appetizers looked to enticing to say no, if you're ever in the neighborhood come by and give it a try. I promise you, you won't regret it.Yet another Groupon alert. I've been to the Swish on Sahara on quite a few occasions (usually when I scrounge up a coupon or two), but had never tried the newer location on Spring Mountain. When the Groupon popped up a few months ago, I snatched some up and have been planning my trip. We ordered the Kobe large portion Sukiyaki and the mushroom party Shabu Shabu to share. I'm not a big fan of cooking food myself. I will often make the sacrifice for some AYCE Korean BBQ or Shabu Shabu and this was one such occasion. My fella had never tried Shabu Shabu or Sukiyaki, but I knew he'd love it. What's not to love flavorful meat, rice, veggies and noodles. The staff was friendly and attentive. The place was really empty for a Friday evening around 9, though. There are so many great places to try on Spring Mountain, I know there's a lot of competition for them, but I highly recommend this place, especially with a coupon. Excellent deal!The place was very dead when we went on a Monday around 2pm. We were literally the only customers there for a good 30 minutes or so. Then the regulars/friends came in and started eating. I figure more people come here for dinner though. The ambiance was dark and intimate. There is a bar area where you can sit or many tables that seat about 2-4 people. When we sat down at a table for two, the waiter asked me if a wanted a chair for my purse. Let me repeat that...A CHAIR FOR MY PURSE. Well f*ck yes my purse would love a chair! I don't think I've ever been asked that in my whole history of dining. My boyfriend and I were both a little taken aback when he asked me that. We started off with the Crispy Garlic Chicken ($7.95), which was phenomenal. The chicken was crispy, juicy and garlicky and the sauce was just oozing with all sorts of flavors. We were originally going to get the calamari, but if there's one thing we love more than calamari, it's garlic. After being schooled on the difference between Sukiyaki and Shabu Shabu, I opted for  healthy size (6oz) prime rib-Eye Sukiyaki ($14.95) and my boyfriend got hungry size (8oz) prime rib-Eye Shabu Shabu ($18.95) in their new Spicy Miso broth. These both came with a small bowl of rice and a plate of veggies, udon, and tofu. This was actually my first time ever having Sukiyaki, so I don't have much to base it off of, but I still found it to be pretty damn delicious. My boyfriend actually enjoyed the Sukiyaki more than the Shabu Shabu because it was just so flavorful, although a lot less healthy than the Shabu. The waiter told us to wait until the sauce got a little thick because it would make it have more flavor, so everytime I took out the cooked meat, it was drenched with all kids of goodness. The Shabu Shabu was okay, but just boring compared to the Sukiyaki. I'm sure if I tried the Shabu first, I would've liked it more, but my taste buds were spoiled from he awesome Sukiyaki. *Tips-Ask them what flavors they have for their Shabu Shabu broth. When we went they had Spicy Miso and for an extra buck, you could also get soy.-Lately, there have been a lot of Groupon Now deals for this place, so you should definitely check that out before arriving. We got a Groupon a few months ago, so our bill only came out to $17 for all that!Will the real Swish Shabu Shabu please stand up??So I had some issues with the faux Swish in another location, and was invited here after that epic Groupon fiasco but never got around to it until today. Well I am so sorry that I waited. This Swish is absolutely fabulous! (It also helps that I can go down the street for a Trader Joe's run afterward...) My husband and I both ordered the vegetarian platter and shared an order of edamame. The young woman who was serving us was very helpful and personable, and I loved that they brought all the condiments to you so you can more into the hot pot to your liking. She gave me a very healthy dose of garlic so I refrained from adding anything else. This vegetarian dish was HUGE! It was one gigantic plate filled with lettuce, mushrooms, baby corn, carrots, noodles, a little tofu, onion, and green onion. Although it was bountiful, I would have personally liked maybe some zucchini, some extra tofu and a bit more mushrooms than the extreme amount of lettuce on top. Just my preference ;) It was really good though and I liked that the hot pot was right on the table and was in very easy reach. This also came with white rice which was deliciously sticky. I would have preferred brown, but white was good too. The edamame we had as a side dish was tasty. I cannot even begin to tell you just how full I was - well, am! It's been a few hours since eating and I am still pleasantly stuffed to the brim! Our server was attentive, and to have a ridiculously filling and healthy meal for two for under $30 was a great deal. I will definitely be back to THIS location and no others.My family and I come here often for shabu shabu. It's tucked away in the same plaza of SF market and right underneath Bazic. The layout of the restaurant is somewhat off. All the tables are scattered everywhere, but it's nice to be able to sit at a 8-top table when it's only the three of us. Service can be a hit or miss. The times we've been there, it's been a miss. The place was busy and attentiveness lacked so much that we got up to get our own condiments that we asked a few times for. Sometimes, even getting a menu could take a awhile. There was also a time when they forgot about our rice and I waved my hand in the air, but the staff that looked dead at me just didn't care. I was like damn he's faking the funk game is stuuurdy, real sturdy. It can get frustrating at times. When the service is a hit.. it's a wonderful experience here. Everything comes all at once, drinks are refilled, rice is given without being asked. So it's all about chance here.We usually get the Kobe Chuck, hungry portion that comes with a small amount of sliced white onion, mushroom, tofu, cabbage, broccoli, green onion, and udon noodles. I love their dipping sauces which are a ponzu-based sauce for your veggies/noodles and the goma sesame-based sauce for your meat. I add the minced daikon, garlic, and green onion from the condiments selection to my ponzu sauce to intensify the flavor. I also add garlic and green onion to my goma sauce to give my meat the same effect. Delicious. If you don't get your white rice or condiments by the time your meat and veggies are done.. Ask for it! I highly suggest to avoid the soy milk broth. There isn't any flavor whatsoever and it's so translucent that it's almost all seaweed broth with a sake shot of soy milk. I was looking for more of a heavy cream based broth as in all soy milk not half or a shot of. I stick with the Spicy Miso Broth, which has the most flavor from the three of Seaweed, Spicy Miso, and Soy Milk. The technique for shabu shabu is to you its own. I prefer to use half my tofu/cabbage/mushroom/broccoli portion, all my white onion/green onion, and save the udon noodles at the very end. While the veggies are almost done, I swish one by one my Kobe Chuck slice, then dip it in the goma sauce and get a veggie.. dip it in my ponzu, then combine both (meat/veggie) with my white rice and there you have the magic of shabu shabu. Lastly, I save my udon noodles for the broth that had everything boiled in it. Think seasoning the broth for a soup ;)Shabu shabu is soul food at its best. I always leave here with a smile on my face. It's therapeutic, yet fun at the same time. Love the music they play here. Top 90's, Reggae, and some old school like Sinatra got me movin' while I'm swishing away. Keith Sweat - I'll Give All My Love To You... Ready For The World - Love You Down just to name a few. Dining here with music that I love is a plusplusplus!Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall.. I can always go for Shabu Shabu whenever. That's how much I love it. It's one of my favorite cuisine! And Swish is our Family's favorite place for it.I went here with a bunch of people. The place was not busy at all. Service was not consistent. It would good for a minute then they forget about us for a while. I was almost done with my meal and my friend's shrimp still hasn't gotten to the table.We tried: steak, shrimp; miso, spicy miso, seaweed broth; sukiyaki. I enjoyed the sukiyaki. I don't remember being offered more veggies so, I'm not sure if they have unlimited veggies or not.One thing we all noticed was the bizarre playlist. Tupac, Biggie, Enya, Whitney Houston...This place isn't bad but I've had better.

OMG! They have Gluten-Free Pizza & Beer! This might not mean anything to 99% of you reading this, but for people like me who can't eat anything with wheat in it and thus can't eat normal things like pizza, beer, bread, etc...this place is heaven on earth! They have a great variety of pizza combo's to choose from (both normal and the gluten free variety) and the staff is really up on their gluten-free product knowledge and go to great lengths to avoid cross-contamination. You can build your own personal pizza for around $6-7 bucks and they have weekday specials and happy hours.They carry Redbridge Gluten Free Beer and also have gf desserts in addition to all the regular staples you would find at a great neighborhood pizza bistro. My husband really likes their pizza and a friend of mine tried the pasta and ravioli and really liked it.Check this place out if you have the chance. It's right next to Trader Joe's.

Review Text :
10/16Stumbled upon Pink Pepper as I was heading towards a second Thai option when my first option, owned by a coworker and his children, was rented out for a reception Friday evening.  I've wanted to visit PP for years, but never had a chance.  Darol (RIP), an ex-coworker, and I would exchange foodie stories of our fave places, and PP was the only place he'd go when he had a craving for Thai.  (He resided in Thailand for a few years and considered himself well-versed in the cuisine.)  So, en route to my second choice, I spotted the Pink Pepper logo in the distance and said, "Why the hell not?"  "Today's the day!"It was very dead in there.  (Ya, not just dead.  VERY dead!  LOL.)  Besides me, I spotted my server, who must've been the owner, and an elderly woman rolling up silverware in cloth napkins.  Granted, it was around 3, 330'ish in the afternoon, and lunch had just ended at 2:30p.  (The buffet pans were still emitting heat as they cooled down.)  But I'm not one to let empty rooms sway me away, so I asked for a table.  I liked the ambience- warm, inviting, w/ lovely colors.  Loved the floral salad plates that sat at the table, which I've spotted at Sur La Table before.  Made me wish I'd splurged and bought them then.  Apparently, these plates are only used for show, bec. they were removed moments after I sat down.  Chose to skip the app course and ordered green curry w/ chicken (came w/ rice).  At $9.50,  I thought that this entree better be good!  While I waited, I checked out the rest of the menu and liked what I saw.  If the dish turned out great, I'll be coming back to check the rest out soon enough.  I also spotted a cocktails menu on the table that had quite a few good-tasting options to choose from.  My entree arrived after about 10 to 15 minutes.  The portion was smaller than I'm used to seeing for the price, so I was really hoping that I was getting a very tasty meal.  I shouldn't have worried!  Pink Pepper's green curry has placed Pink Pepper Thai pretty high on my list of places for green curry!!  (Try that for a tongue-twister!)  The coconut curry sauce was thick and super-creamy, and medium heat was just perfect for me!  I also loved the variety of veggies used- there was an extra item there that wasn't listed on the menu.  (Thank goodness I did not have any adverse reactions.)  It took all of my will AND the thought of ordering dessert to keep me from finishing the entire order!  Looking back, I could've squeezed three decent servings out of that meal, especially knowing what I know now... that Pink Pepper's homemade coconut ice cream is freaking AMAZING!  Those w/ a peanut allergy should know to alert the server of this fact, bec. this not overly-sweet sweet comes w/ a generous topping of peanuts.  Ohhh... I just got the shivers up and down my spine (the good kind!) recalling how great my meal ended! Service was friendly and efficient, if a little lonely.  I'm going to assume it was bec. he was by himself in the front.  Perhaps w/ busier hours it'll be easier to flag someone down.  One low point was the restroom visit- the temperature was significantly warmer at that part of the building.  Consider yourself warned.Today I had lunch at Pink Pepper and I couldn't help remembering my history with this restaurant. Pink Pepper is a family run business that originally opened in 1983. I remember when I first moved to Phoenix to attend ASU and went on my first date with my first boyfriend to Pink Pepper. When it was first starting out, Pink Pepper was a visual and taste sensation. There was no other Thai restaurant like it in the valley. The only way to get a seat was by reservation only. Now, Pink Pepper has mostly the same cute decor from back then and could probably use a little updating, but the service is always perfect and the food remains impeccable. There is a full menu including appetizers, Thai curry, soups/salads, seafoods, entrees and desserts and a full bar, and lately they have the regular full lunch buffet for $8.95. (see pics)The all you can eat lunch buffet is one of the best deals in town which includes appetizers, salads, fruits, soups and a good variety of entrees. (see pics)I've been coming here since college and it's always nice to see the same friendly faces and to always be able to count on guaranteed good food with every visit.Hours:11:00am - 2:30pm, 4:30pm - 10pm DailyI 4/5 highly recommend Pink Pepper!

I don't know what to say about this restaurant. I can see the ones who gives good ratings are either locals or tourists. If you live in L.A, do skip this sorry ass Korean BBQ restaurant, you will be disappointed. First of all, the customer service sucks balls! We purchased this Groupon deal, asked the waitree if we can use it towards the "All you can eat" option, she rudely said no. We need asked for a few minutes to decide what we want that the Groupon covers, which is nothing because we really wanted some BBQ. Oh, their regular price BBQ plates are $20+ per plate, and you must order at least 2 orders. Seriously what the fuck?! Why do I HAVE to order 2 orders if we only want 1? Anyways, we decided to just pay for the all you can eat deal for $21.95 per person. The waitree came back and I told her we want the all you can eat option, she then snatched the advertisement from the table and said, "Your groupon will not cover it." I rudely said, "We can't just fucking pay for it?" She then put the advertisement back. I was so pissed then, told my boyfriend (right in front of the waitree) "Fuck this place, let's go." We then left. She brought out water already but that's too bad for her. Restaurants like this doesn't deserve any customers period. She also said something about the menu how "There's the L.A style". I wanted to say, your restaurant will not survive in L.A. Like I said, if you are from L.A, skip it because its a total ripoff and the service sucks Llama balls.After two visits in the last six months, I remain totally unaware of their a la carte offerings.  It's like a small bolt of electricity triggers my brain to point at the picture of the AYCE deal (now $25) and tell the server in what feels like slow motion to say "I'll......have......this.".  This incurable auto reaction would even prompt me to order AYCE KBBQ if I saw it on Denny's menu. With quite a few popular restaurants in this plaza now, Jin Mee feels like a forgotten place.  The space is big and looks like it could easily fit a crowd of 100+.  I wonder if those banquet tables to the rear of the restaurant ever get used anymore. It doesn't take a lot for me to enjoy spots like this.  As long as there's pork belly, bulgogi, the other usual offerings and they are of reasonable freshness, I am a happy man.  But there are a few things that make this place a standout.  My wife loooooves the spicy marinated raw crab.  I am not sure if anywhere else offers this but it's pretty awesome.  You gotta get all barbaric with it and just break the shells in your mouth to get those glorious slithers of spicy crab. Then they bring out a ton of other dishes before the meat comes out.  You get a large plate of salad, a bowl of steamed egg, a hearty tofu soup with beans and potato, and then 8 dishes of banchan.  A very impressive Korean feast indeed!!  I look at it all as a clever trap.  If customers stuff their faces with this, they'll eat less meat.  Everything I mentioned above probably costs them less than $4 in ingredients.  All tasty and worth sampling for sure, but keep your eyes on the prize!  Kind of like the salad bar at Texas de Brazil.  Trap!!!!The owner, Chu, was there during my last visit.  He said he was a good golfer and gave me his card saying we should golf sometime.  I hit my friend with a golf ball in the leg after a ridiculous slice 30 feet away the last time I golfed and dutifully informed Chu of this.  He decided to quickly change the subject by offering some grilled shrimp on the house.  That's only on the more expensive AYCE package that includes choices of several kinds of seafood and ribeye.  The shrimp were delicious and unusually sweet.  Nice guy.The table grills were decently ventilated meaning I wasn't wearing full on BBQ cologne afterwards.  I am a fan!

If you are looking for a simple, moderately priced, fresh place to eat where parking is not too much of an issue at lunchtime, this is a good bet... The staff is friendly and open to you altering the menu items.  The salads and sandwiches are tasty and portion sizes are just right.  I am excited to go back for breakfast sometime soon.  Just one warning... the atmosphere is not much.  Acacia Cafe is located in a strip mall and it's clean, but not too much unique inside.  Go for the food if you are looking for something fresh and simple - do not go for the atmosphere or with extremely high expectations...Finally got around to trying this place out for breakfast Saturday morning and loved it - shared the veggie scramble sandwich and cinnamon french toast, both of which were delicious, and reasonably priced. Kind of a limited menu selection, but if everything else is just as good, that's not necessarily a negative thing. Extremely friendly staff - and they've got frequent customer cards, which I totally dig - my wallet's full of 'em. Most of them I don't ever get around to filling up or cashing in, but it's the thought that counts, you know - that promise of the free food reward at some point in the indefinite future... This one, though, I have a good feeling about - I might just cash this one in.Four stars because I've only been here once, when I return a few more times I'm sure they get the final star.This place reminds me of a European cafe. No frills, simple decor, and pleasant staff willing to help you make a decision.I had a breakfast burrito, forgot what it was called, it looked a little small on the plate but by the time I finished I was full and satisfied. Yummy.I wish this place had a bit more of a patio/landscaping, just my 2 cents.

Review Text :
I'm in Las Vegas with my father for one night (don't ask, we're not getting married or any sick Red state shit like that) and I refuse to eat where we are staying because as much as I love me some free room service, I cannot handle when my only choice on the menu is a STEAMED VEGETABLE PLATTER.  that is right.  it is a platter of steamed vegetables and a scoop of white rice.  just typing that sentence makes me want to get sick all over this computer.  now, you might be thinking, "Laura, aren't you on Weight Watchers?" and to that I say, "Fuck you."  So anyway, I decide we're going to be adventurous and take a trip off the strip to a mostly vegetarian restaurant that I've been to before called Long Life Vege.  It's about a ten minute cab ride away, it's cheap and they have delicious fake meat.  Delicious.  While my dad may hate fake meat product, there is nothing the man loves more than cheap (the dude likes to be told how much you spent on his birthday present and if it's under $10 he will be all, "HIGH FIVE!" Once, my sister got him a pair of toe nail clippers from Mac Frugal's (RIP) for 99 cents and the man shed a tear.  HE CRIED, HE WAS SO PROUD) so we were in a cab faster than you can say, "faux chicken chow mein."  Well, our cabbie was a delightful chap from Somalia who was very affable and talkative and when he asked why we were going to a vegetarian restaurant, my dad said, "Because this one's a VEGAN!  Hahaha!' and they laughed and laughed.  Good one, you guys!  It IS hilarious when someone is vegan!  HAR DEE FUCKING HAR HAR.we pull up to Long Life Vege and the motherfucker is closed.  GODDAMMIT.  we ask our cabbie for restaurant recommendations and he suggests Merkato since it is nearby and he is a regular.  We get to Merkato and as we are getting out of the cab, both my dad and I realize that we forgot our wallets.  Well, actually, my dad forgot his wallet and I "forgot" mine, you dig?  I ain't paying when money bags is around!  I wrangle dogs for a living and my father gets hundred dollar bills poured on his head just for waking up.  Plus, there will be no social security left for me when i'm old and I gotta save NOW!  and by save NOW!, i mean buy that new ipod phone because it's SWEET!  do you think it comes in pink??We take a cab back to the hotel, my dad get his wallet, takes out another $100 from the ATM and we drive back to Merkato.  The cab is $45 at this point so my dad gives the guy what he thinks is $70 because he has put up with our insanity for the evening.  You're saying to yourself, "Who gives a fuck, Laura?" And to that I say, "Wait for it. You will get a mild satisfaction at the end but it's probably still not worth reading the whole long ass review."We walk into Merkato and are the only non-Ethiopian people in the place and it's crazy crowded.  Both VERY good signs for potential deliciousness.  I order the veggie combo (which was a very typical veggie combo: yellow lentils, red lentils, mustard greens, enjera salad, etc) and it was MAGNIFICENT.  One of the best i've had and I've had A LOT.  my dad got the dead lambert and said the flavor was fantastic but there was too much fat and gristle.  now, contrary to popular belief, i haven't always been vegan.  i used to eat meat and let me tell you, i liked the grossest meat.  tendons and gristle and marrow...i mean, i would CLEAN a chicken bone and then use a splinter to pick my teef.  i was a hardcore red neck of an obese 9 year-old until i figured out i was eating bambi.  ANYWAY, if you are currently like i was when i was 9 years-old, then get the lamb and when you're done, have your cholesterol checked because i'm pretty sure you're gonna drop dead at any moment.  So, we finish our fantastic meal about 15 hours after we first walked in (that's how they roll in Ethiopia.  Slowly.  But friendly.  Like this review.) and as he's paying, my dad realizes that instead of the $30 tip he thought he left our lovable cabbie, he gave him $115 tip.  MY DAD'S BAD!  we also realized that we had no way back to the hotel. luckily when i asked our waitress to call us a cab, she was all, "hold on" and disappears.  two minutes later, a guy who was eating a few tables over has us in his cab, headed back to the hotel.  Major bonus.In the end, we're dealing with:Cab rides: $135.  Dinner: $25 (for two HUGE plates plus two beers and tea)Average Cost of Dinner for Two People in Las Vegas in Some Cheesy Rip Off Restaurant On The Strip: $200.  So anyway, I think we still did good.  And there's a cab driver (Yasin!  Holla!) who is high rolling tonight.  Or, you know, sending money back to his family in his war torn country.  As my dad put it, his company is paying and screw those jerkwads, the better man (Yasin! Holla!) wins tonight!  I love my dad.  I am finally done, you can rest your eyes.  Get up, stretch, do some squats, get the blood flowing...you've been here awhile.Finally made it here just recently!  First experience with Ethiopian food and we are already contemplating going back the next day haha.  We went with an Ethiopian friend of ours which made the experience SO much better because he explained everything in detail, reasons why things are done a certain way and he had a great rapport with the owners and many customers in the place.  We felt like we were on a tour or something..it was great!We all shared the vegetarian dish with the beef tibs.  Oohhh the beef...soooo tasty!  Everything was delicious right down to the Amoeba water which is their version of Pellegrino.  Planning to do the raw beef dish next time.COMPETITIONThis is the best of a trio of Ethiopian restaurants within about 1000 yards of each other. The other two are (1) Lali-Bela is one street north and (2) Axum (across the street). A fourth restaurant named Meskerem is in front of the convention center.MANNERSEat with only your right hand. Very important! BEST ENTREEI had the Kitfo "Ethiopian version of steak tartar, raw red chopped beef" ($8)  and an Ethiopian beer for $3.50 and sat at the bar. For $8 you couldn't finish the food and it is very tasty. Take a chance on the raw meat! If you are scared stick with lamb tibs.SERVICEVery friendly people, nice service, excellent cuisine and rock bottom prices. Waitresses are very attractive.  They speak in a very quiet vernacular of British-African English which can be difficult to hear.DIRECTIONSThe strip mall is pretty seedy , and half the stores are empty. BUS: route #203 you catch on the Palazzo side under the overpass to the Wynn. Your 24 hour Deuce pass is also good for 24 hours on local buses. Try to be there on the half hour interval 15 minutes before or 15 minutes past the hour.DRIVE: Less than 2 miles from this intersection, plenty of parkingWALK: Questionable at night, OK in the day. It is a half mile from the southern back entrance to the convention center. Head south on Swensen and make a left at the 7-11.   If you walk between the Venetian and the Wynn you will follow the monorail route until you get to Paradise Ave. After you cross Paradise, Sands Avenue turns into Twain avenue and you begin passing McDonald's, gas stations and Latino themed strip malls, and apartments. The restaurant is about 1000 yards past Paradise Ave after you cross Swenson . There is a 7-11 on the end of the strip mall. The windows of Merkato are very dark, but it's near the corner of the L shaped building.I do not enjoy giving bad reviews, but based on principle, I have to give Merkato one star.First, I should state that the dining experience itself was good. We enjoyed the food. Being Filipino, we grew up eating with our hands. The prices are cheap. We went with a combination sampler plate for $15, which gave us a great introduction to their cuisine. We also ordered their whole fish dish for $10. It actually came with two nice sized fish and a large plate of rice with tasty sauce.If you want, you can stop reading here and head on over to try their food. You'll probably enjoy it.Everything was going well until it came time to settle the bill. I had a TownHog certificate for $30. I had mentioned it before we ordered, but suddenly the server said she didn't know what to do with it. She tried calling the owners but was unable to reach them after several attempts. Strangely enough, when she had me call using my phone, they picked up right away.To cut to the chase, the owner said he would not honor the coupon. He said he had called the company back in June and told them he no longer wanted to participate. So after sitting there for a long time, we ended up paying and leaving with a very bitter taste in our mouths.I just got off the phone with TownHog. The representative said that because Merkato has already been paid, she would have to call them to confirm that they refused the coupon before I can get a refund. They've already been paid? That just makes the situation worse. It's just not right. You agreed to sell these coupons in order to get people into your restaurant. That's exactly the reason I was even there in the first place. It's essentially marketing and it worked. It got me into your shop.It's really a shame because we did enjoy the food. But there's no way I can return based on that ordeal. Luckily, there are other Ethiopian joints around town with similarly good reviews.I -really- wanted to enjoy myself at Merkato Ethiopian Cafe.  I've never had Ethipian food and my companion had only enjoyed once so we decided to go to the highest rated place in Vegas that was the cheapest - Merkato seemed to be a great choice.We have been doing 30 days of vegetarianism so we decided on the pastries with lentils as an appetizer and the vegetarian combo that most people on Yelp rave about. I found it a bit strange when the vegetarian combo came out without the pastries/lentils - but figured that they would bring it out later or forgot to get it. She spooned a red chili-consistency food onto the sponge-bread plate that was the vegetarian combo. At this point I had finished my water before beginning to eat. Everything tasted good; the Injera (spongey bread) went well with everything but I found that it might have tasted better if it was warm instead of cold (not a beef with the restaurant). My companion took a bite and pulled something out of her mouth. This is where things took a turn for the worse.She showed me a small black rock that was in the yellow food that looked like mashed corn. I thought it might be a seed, and she dropped it on her plate - making a loud chink sound. I felt it and we definitely agreed it was a rock. A rock in our food? Really? A waitress never adressed if we were doing okay; but to be fair they were busy chatting with each other ALONE at the bar instead of helping their customers. My water was empty the whole dinner and was never refilled. I had to walk to the waitresses and ask them for the check. This is when the second strike happened.The check read a vegetarian platter and then an $8 appetizer that we did not order. Instead of giving us the pastry, they had given us a more expensive appetizer that they had scooped on to the plate. However, there was no way we could have known this during dinner because 1.) nothing was ever explained to us what each thing was and 2.) they appetizer apparently came at the same time as the vegetarian platter (and the description of the vegetarian platter is vague on the menu). I asked if they could take some of the cost off of the appetizer - I acknowledged  that maybe there could have been more communication, but it really was a mistake on the waitresses part for taking down our order wrong. She said "Oh no, because that's good stuff and you're taking it to-go." to which I responded "I don't want to waste your food, if you want to throw it away and take some of the charge off i'm okay with that;" She said she couldn't do anything and was completely unreceptive and unapologetic. Her view was that we should have told the waiter that we had received the wrong appetizer. My companion told her and showed the the black rock that was found in the food. No emotion. No apology. She just said "Oh..." Are you kidding me? We were astounded by how terrible the service was.Poor communication takes two parties, but they really dropped the ball on this one.Poor waiting service because I had to get up to ask for the check and no one came to check on us - they weren't busy with anything else but conversing with each other.Poor kitchen - there was a rock in the food. A rock.I'm very upset. I'm very sad that I'm writing a poor review; before this my companion always joked that I always have a great time and enjoy all dining experiences. That streak is over. Thanks a lot Merkato; avoid this place at all costs just in principle of the way they treat their customers.Restaurants that care more about money than sharing an experience with their customers don't deserve to be open - there are too many passionate and loving business owners/workers that are struggling to support an operation like Merkato.

I had high hopes for this restaurant as I was directed to it by my friend and fellow Yelper, Donald S., and oh...my...God...was the squash ravioli at Tomasos AWESOME!  It was perfect.  It arrived quickly, was presented well, was a good portion for lunch, and geezuz, the sauce was to die for!  It was a bit expensive for lunch, but those of you who know me, know that I say that at almost every meal.  I'm cheap, what can I say?Oh, I forgot the bread!  It was perfectly baked and came with the most wonderful herb butter.  For bread lovers, this will be on the top of your list!I highly recommend this restaurant, and I can't wait to try it for dinner!

I know I really busted balls with this place the first go round but hell I'm a paying customer and I expect a little decency. So 1st go round I just left & never ate so to be fair I ordered for take-out some pork & rice with some little egg roll/taquitos Im not quite sure what they were other than overdone. The meat was pretty decent-real tender and looked good but not any flavor and the dipping stuff was kinda orange marmalade stuff. The jasmine rice was really dry and just flavorless which i guess most rice is but i like some soy or sweet n sour with mine. It cost me $9.50 and I was still hungry after eating this. Not good Not bad just plain and a little pricy.What's not to love about a tower of beer the size of me? Throw in a couple of fried-grilled-baked-appetizers along with some good company and you have yourself a fantastic time. I can't wait for the temperature to warm up a bit and I'm going to this Happy Hour spot for Tuesday Karaoke Fight Night. The owner Jayson is actually very personable which makes my review even more biased because I only ate 2 items on their menu. Chicken wings and Satay were delicious! But any joint where the owner puts their sweat and soul into the food (minus real sweat) is a good joint for me. I really hope this spot will be busier than Firefly because I love both in this plaza. Next visit :sit on patio, order everything on happy menu,  and beer tower.

Review Text :
I ~heart~ Gelato Spot!  Yum yum, it only took me 3 samples to make my choice.  The hazelnut was nutty goodness, the pistachio was delis, but I went with the passion fruit.  Great location, I love the heated patio.  I didn't even mind the smell of exhaust fumes from traffic, the gelato was that good!Im putting the same review on the 2 listing because My expeirence involved both locations. One location should not be isolated.I wrote an email to the director of quality control. I have pasted the conversation for you all!Hey,I love your gelato and I eat there once a week. It is expensive, do you have any programs like a punch card or something to give loyal customers a reward once in a while or like a free b-day gelato? Most websites have a place you can sign up for news and deals. I didnt see that on your site. I also wanted to say thanks for not using hydrogenated oil, I would reccomend and love if you considered removing it from your cones, or using a vendor that does not add it. It is becoming increasingly taboo. Plus the gelato is for the most part natural so Why stuff it in a cone that has oil banned in the entire state of California and on th ballot to be removed at tons of major citys.Lindsay,Thanks for contacting us regarding your concerns and praises.  Thank you very much for the kind words.  Please send me your address and I will send you some free coupons for being a loyal customer.  It's funny you brought up having a loyalty card for the gelato spot because this week I put the order in to have a electronic combo card.  It will have both features loyalty and gift card.  It will be similar to a Starbucks card but with more rewards.  It will be at least 1 month before this feature will become active since it interfaces with our Point of sale system it is a complicated process to integrate everything.  Also I did look at the ingredients for our cones and you are right about having partially hydrogenated oils in the mix being taboo these days.  I will look for another alternative to this problem quickly.  I will definitely let you know when I find new product. Unfortunately we do not make the cones from scratch like our gelato so I will have to do some research on possible making our own waffle mix.  Feel free to contact me anytime.  Thanks for hitting the gelato spot. Thomas PlatoDirector of Quality ControlThe Gelato Spotthomasp@gelatospot.comI love you Gelato Spot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So, it happens to be quite WARM here in Arizona. Like, ya know...105 degrees. Only. Psssh. That's all you got desert!? Bring it on. I want to cook my eggs on the pavement. Ok, I don't really. And if it gets any hotter here, I'll quite possibly melt. I'm just not cut out for extreme heat, unless the pendulum swings the other way and it's 25 below zero. Layers. Many, many layers. I'm way off track. So, it's hot. That means, we must eat cold stuff. Like gelato. And the world (and my body temp) was righted by a small peanut butter gelato with a cute little chocolate stick. Super cool (pun intended) cafe, funky furniture, creative coffee concoctions, free wifi, friendly people...Chillllllllll. I like. Dessert in the desert.I needed some caffeine to get me going this morning, so I met Jared at this G Spot location.  Who knew they were open for coffee and breakfast from 7am - 10:30am?  I had no clue - but I do now!  The coffee did it's job and kept me going all day... and Jared's breakfast sandwich looked awesome!  Fresh yogurt, fruit, granola, pastries, and muffins were available as well.  Since it's right around the corner from our new place, I am sure I'll be back soon... It's actually tempting to go back for an afternoon snack - I've been thinking about their 'pumpkin pie' gelato flavor of the month since hearing so much about it from the Yelp Birthday pARTy!  Is that bad to visit the G Spot twice in one day?!It's twofer Friday in the review column (I know, it should be 2-fer Tuesday, but that's just not how things worked out).After lunch at Stax, my daughter and I took a short stroll down Scottsdale Rd. to the G-spot. I have had coffee there in the morning few times, but I had not been in the mood for gelato at 7:10 am, while walking our pup.So today, in spite of the freezing temperatures outside, we had a gelato.Really good gelato! These guys are the real deal and the gelato is, I think, comparable to pretty much anything you'll find in Italy. I'm pretty pedestrian, and to me it's almost impossible to beat good old vanilla bean (I did taste the strawberry, too, and it was also delightful). The gelato was smooth and creamy, not too sweet, just great stuff!Whitney, my daughter had something chocolate and italian, which, try as I might, I can't remember the name of. She has more gelato experience than I do, and also thought hers was great.So, why 4 stars instead of 5? The 2 people (kids?) behind the counter. They could barely be bothered to respond to us, and appeared to very clearly not want to be there. I wouldn't go so far as to say the service was bad, but when I say "thank you" to someone or ask a question, I would like to get a response.So good coffee and gelato, with a little attitude on the side, at the G-Spot.In keeping with the Italian theme today, I decided gelato would make nice sweet treat after my delightful experience at Best of Italy (see how I interweave these things together...but wait, there's more!).In a rare "daily double" I am able to interweave National Pizza Party Day (come on...pizza is mostly Italian) with National Strawberry Month...That's right...strawberry Gelato!!!!There has been much less attitude and better  service by the staff on my recent visits to the G-Spot, and for that they get my thanks and my gelato dollars.It's funny, ever since Gabi posted the thread about strawberries...I've had a bit of a craving.G-Spot...you scratched my itch very nicely today:)Love some of their flavors here- coffee, roche (if you're familiar w/ Ferrero Rocher's chocolates, then you know what this selection will taste like), peanut butter, and now cheesecake!  My latest purchase was a combo of coffee and cheesecake... a must-try!I've tried some of the sorbets here a long time ago and liked them, but since it's been awhile, I'll have to make it a point to try them again to make a formal review.  With the weather heating up very fast, this task won't be very hard to do!   ;)Homemade gelato, Pascucci coffee, and now delicious salads, panini and wood-fired pizzas... this G spot really has it all!I was hesitant when I learned that the Gelato Spot in Old Town was coming out with pizzas and salads, but after my lunch there today, I'm completely sold!  I was there with Lindsey F, so I have a feeling she'll be updating her review soon too, but I wanted to beat her to it, so here it is.We shared the chicken louie wedge salad (iceberg wedge, chicken breast, cherry tomatoes, diced cucumbers, bacon, chives, avocado, champagne vinegarette, blue cheese crumbles, louie dressing, grana padano) although opted to get it minus the chives and blue cheese, and the american pizza (di napoli Tomato sauce, mozzarella fior di latte, italian sausage, spicy pepperoni, tuscan olive oil, grana padano) with mushrooms.  Both were delicious!  Seriously, the quality of the ingredients in both the salad and the pizza was evident... I cleaned the salad plate and ate my fair share of pizza too... We learned that this type of pizza is an art, and the pizza chef came from another well-known wood burning pizza place in town.  It was cooked just right and we were told it's best right out of the oven, so plan on dining in if you can.  Warning - the pepperoni really does have a kick!  I love the fast-casual ordering system (order at the counter and then your food will be brought to you).  Prices are reasonable ($9 for our huge salad and $10 for the pizza).  I may have to go for a panini next visit as they look pretty awesome too, and there is a huge selection with hot and cold choices ranging from Italian grilled cheese, veggie, sausage & peppers, turkey, tuna, and more!I enjoyed my  lunch so much that I forgot to save room for gelato, so I suggest saving a spot in your belly (a g-spot so to speak) when you go.  Buon Appetito! ;)get on their text club to save 20 percent!So very, very, very good. I'm staying at a hotel down the street and really wanted pizza for dinner (and also wanted to take a little walk!) so the Gelato Spot it was. When I saw "gelato and wood fired pizza" together on my Yelp app, I knew it was going to be a win-win situation.I have NEVER seen a place with this many gelato flavors. Holy cow! Any flavor you've ever wanted is here, and I was trying to decide which one I wanted to go with, when I laid my eyes on the sign... for gelato shakes. Gelato? Shakes? Gelato in a shake? I had to try it, and went with the small which meant I got to choose two flavors. Yellow cake batter and cookies and cream, it turns out, make quite a nice pair. They put them both in a blender with milk, and voilà! Something tells me I'll be visiting this place later in the week for another genius flavor concoction.For my pizza, I ordered the marinara, which comes with Di Napoli tomato sauce, fresh garlic, fresh basil, oregano, and Tuscan olive oil. I also added cheese to it. I carried it for about fifteen minutes back to my hotel and I was surprised at how well it held up! The pizza was so good, and the flavors all blended together perfectly. I really enjoyed the thin and chewy crust, and you could tell that the ingredients were high quality.I hear they have amazing coffee here and I want to try that next time... but if I had to choose one thing from this place, it's the gelato shake. Go try one for yourself and find out!"Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, you know? I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it? Unfortunately, in my case, it was only one woman for her.Joey: What are you talking about? One woman? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing. Cherry Vanilla. You could get them with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream. This is the best thing that ever happened to you. You got married, you were, what, eight? Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.Ross: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny."I find myself with a similar conflict at the G spot. And Ross hadn't even begun to explore the world of gelato yet. Wood fired pizza AND gelato in the same place should be illegal. There is just way too much happiness occurring all in one experience. And did I mention they are about to have cocktails as well? You know how after you experience your first orgasm, you want to just hide in your room and experience it again and again? Well, that's how I feel about the G Spot. They named it that for a reason, after all.SO-SO gelato in downtown Scottsdale!I was in the area of Scottsdale's little art-walk village and needed a little snack. The Gelato Spot sounded really good for an afternoon fix and so I went to check it out with my fellow travelers. Known for their homemade gelato and many flavors, I thought this place was going to be a hit, but unfortunately it was the opposite.Popular flavors recommended from the employees: Tiramisu*, Chocolate Caramel Brownie*, Almond Snickers and Coffee(note: * = what I ordered)- You can order a small, medium or large. - Prices range from $3.50-$5.50 per cup. - If you order a medium, you can have 2 flavors in your cup. - If you order a large, you can have 3 flavors in your cup. - Unfortunately, only the small can have one flavor. I ordered the a medium and tried the tiramisu and chocolate caramel brownie. The gelato was UBER sugary! I thought gelato was a bit too much in sugar and not enough in the flavor. I sorta kinda tasted a banana flavor in my tiramisu gelato. Not sure if the spoon that was used to scoop my flavor was mixed up with another. The chocolate caramel brownie was rich, but was probably a better choice than the tiramisu. Topped with a triangle cut piece of waffle cone and a cylinder chocolate swirl cookie, you can imagine this is sugar overload!I did have a chance to sample my grubber's coffee, almond snickers and pistachio flavors. I thought the coffee was the best out of all the flavors I had tried. Service was decent. No complaints there. It's nice that you were able to sample the different flavors prior to you making a final decision. Parking is within the downtown Scottsdale Art Village area.Not sure if I'd come back to this gelato spot. And to be honest, I've had better. I do have a sweet tooth, but unfortunately I was not impressed by the over-sweet gelato that was offered. I may have ordered the wrong flavors, but not sure if it's compelling enough for me to come back and re-challenge other items on their menu. I do hope that in the future - they don't make the gelato as sugary as I had during my visit. Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #267/27/113.5 stars.Took Mom here for her first visit and tried a couple of gelato dishes**.  The first was a "sundae" that consisted of two mini-scoops of roche and mango, with a chocolate crackle topping and some crushed almonds. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-gelato-spot-scottsdale-4?select=uFQNSuTdlIVr0JknTh8YZQ#uFQNSuTdlIVr0JknTh8YZQ  D'lish!  The second dish was a warmed brownie sundae, with a scoop of bacio gelato (chocolate-hazelnut gelato with chunks of dark chocolate).  Also quite good, but was made too rich with the addition of the chocolate syrup.  (I prefer rich and ever-so-slightly bitter ganache, or hot fudge as a topping, rather than sickeningly sweet and runny chocolate syrup.)  **I stopped going to Gelato Spot when I noticed I was getting allergy symptoms afterwards (rashes, stomach aches, and worse symptoms, of which I will spare you the details- you're welcome).Yummmers... the gelatos were looking perfect in their display and presentation was on point. So many flavors to choose from, many friendly staff to help you. I'm more of a fruity person so I always opt for a fruity option. When I was in Italy I went on a gelato eating spree- breakfast, lunch and dinner. And this place reminded me of why I wanted gelato because it's oh so delicious. I went for the some kind of berry mix (as usual) and it was delicious! My friend got the thin mints gelato and that was OMG good! It was a perfect balance between the actual thin mints and the vanilla. One thing was I felt the portions were smaller for the price. I believe it was like $4 ish and the scoop of gelato was stingier than others I've been too. It was deceiving because it looks round and full at the top but there's nothing down in the bottom ... boohoo. Oh another thing I liked about this place was you can sit on the patio and people watch, they have misters so you won't get hot. Also one of the few gelato places that is actually well ventilated.

Roberto's is a chain thats been popping up all over the Las Vegas valley. What do they serve? Good cheap mexican food. The burritos here are a little different from the ones I had back in Cali. Usually I'm used to having rice and beans in my burrito but the ones here only come with meat, sour cream, guac, and some pico di gallo... Not that I'm complaining or anything. What I usually end up getting is either the Carne Asada Nachos or the Carnitas Burrito. They have a huge menu with tons of other things but I stay loyal to my choices. Another thing thats good about this place is the consistency. I've eaten at Baha Fresh several times and each time its pretty hit or miss. Roberto's is guaranteed to fill you up and/or give you some comfort food to cure your hangover.So the next time you're hankering for some good cheap mexican food at 5am after a night of drinking and partying... GO TO ROBERTO'S! The kicker? You can go there when your not drunk either and its still good!Check out the picture I posted. I guarantee it will make you HUNGRY!Who can really complain about mexican food. Always come here whenever I want a quick bite in the random hours of the night.The 5 rolled tacos with extra cheese The Carne asada fries after a nice workoutThe California burrito to hit the spotAnd the breakfast burrito to eat half and save for when I wake up.Finally refreshing Jamaica to wash it all downThat's my story when it comes to robertos. The cashiers are always funny and cooks always hook it up when I ask for that extra queso! Like whopping handful of it!There is a need for a place like Roberto's in just about every city. Cheap, greasy, open late at night Mexican food should practically be a god given right. Food baby seekers look no further, just about anything from Roberto's is coma inducing (food and more) , and is the promised land for Mexican munchie heaven.I heard through the grapevine (read: drunk guy waiting in line to order) that this first ever Roberto's to open in Vegas. While I can't be sure of how true that is, I am certain the place practically looks it. A total dive with a handful of tables and a counter for ordering, along with suspect odors permeating the air that make you question if that's food or just the bathroom door left ajar. I've been to much nicer Roberto's before, but the dodginess of the strip mall and shady parking lot are charming enough to keep me coming back.Be it burritos, rolled tacos, or their infamous carne asada fries, all options here are a guarantee for satiating that hunger. The wet burritos are of worthy consideration and the enchiladas are plenty saucy, not to mention cheesy. Not to be confused with rich textural Mexican platos, Roberto's is more akin to junk food 2.0 with a little Mexican flair. Beware of too much crema, the back of your pants might just start whistling.Over the years, the prices haven't changed much. Most items are in the $4-7 range unless you decide to go baller status and throw in a few camerones (shrimp) dishes which are as much as $12. Seafood isn't cheap in LV and Roberto's is no exception. Thank goodness they accept credit cards.While I can't say I would recommend the tamales (dry, a bit of YMMV), I am definitely a sucker for their breakfast burrito. It's not too big, but it's hearty enough to pass for any sub 1,000 caloric breakfast item. Eggs are usually fluffy, the meat is solid, and the spiced out potatoes give an extra kick. For those of you who are back and forth with the meat selection, just know that machaca (shredded beef) is the way to go.Open 24 hours. Gracias to all who made this happen.

Review Text :
I'm so happy something locally owned open up in the shopping center closest to my house! Overall this place is pretty damn perfect - and a place I will be frequenting often when I'm eating carbs, or need a cake for a special occasion, or I feel like I'm not fat enough (it could happen, right?).The space is clean and bright and modern. Right up my alley there. I've been for breakfast a few times now and tried many many things. They have all been AWESOME. From the blueberry breakfast cake, to the cranberry scones (and I normally hate scones!) to the bacon egg bake, I really do love their baked things. So much yummier than panera or any other chain type place. I recently ordered a cake for a coworker's bday (the Boston Cream cake!) and it was really great. It was moist and covered in dark chocolate ganache so it wasn't too sweet. I highly recommend their cakes - especially if you are tired of the overly processed, too sweet garbage ones from the grocery store. A few things of note:*They don't do Vegan - a huge plus to me! I like to support places commited to a more natural way of baking. The idea of a vegan bakery is rather freaky in my book, so I'm pleased these guys do things the right way. *They do organic as much as possible - sugar, eggs, flour, all organic!!*All their egg bakes have tons and tons of veggies. I pick around most of them, but it's hard to find veggie free savory items for my husband here. *You do have to bus your own stuff. I find this really akward and annoying - if I wanted to do dishes I'd just eat at home and not spend $7.99 on a sandwich.Layers used to be next to Trader Joes on Sunset and Green Valley, I went a couple of times and was blown away by their pastries and the wonderful atmosphere in the place, so I was very excited to learn that they were relocating their store down the street from us. Unfortunately since the new location has been open there have been many minor disappointments adding up. For starters they've expanded their menu to include sandwiches, salads and soups. The atmosphere is now that of an eatery, cold and uninviting and the savory food is overpriced and deeply mediocre. They are clearly brilliant at preparing baked goods, and perhaps they should have stuck with what they are good at. I've had several of the sandwiches, all are greasy and overly heavy. I have a very adventurous palette and I always appreciate more experimental cooking, when it's done right. Unfortunately, the flavor and texture combinations here are bizzare and inappropriate at best. There is a chicken sandwich with smoked cheddar served on heavily buttered oatmeal molasses bread with bacon, caramelized apple and overly sweet caramelized onions. The description claimed that it would be served with bbq sauce, which could have alleviated the bland heavy sameness of the flavors, but what we got instead was something closer to mole, with definite hints of cinnamon and cocoa. The sauce by itself was interesting but it had no business on that sandwich. I've also had their meatloaf the flavor of which is good in itself, but is again, served on overly buttered bread with nothing to give the palette a rest from all that heaviness.The truth is that their baked goods are still fantastic and they have what I think is the best coffee in town. I could just not have lunch there and focus on the positive, right? Well... the customer service is chaotic and disorganized, and borders on rude, orders get forgotten and no thought is given to little things like if you get your coffee and your pastry first, and the pastry is heated up and sits on the table while you get through lunch it's going to be hard as a rock by the time you get to it.  At any given time there are 4 or 5 people behind the counter at what is a fairly small establishment, so being overwhelmed is not an excuse. Also, for the price, you would think that the food could at least be brought to your table. This place is not cheap. All minor things that make it a less than stellar experience. It pains me to write this review, I am always very excited about mom and pop places, and I want them to succeed. I wanted to like this place. The last straw came this past week when Layers posted a discussion on Facebook about a customer that complained about the taste of an order and expected an exchange or refund. It seems that they feel that their food is above reproach and that the basic rules of customer service don't apply to them. Blaming the customer for having bad taste when they don't like your product is not a smart approach, and in this case it succeeded in turning off at least two additional customers (my BF and myself) that were trying very hard to give this place a chance. I won't be returning any time soon.yes i do believe in giving a place a second chance, so i went in to layers with my nephew to get him a cookie and i got one. after we finished our cookies i did get a dozen cookies to go, the dozen did cost around 21 bucks so not the cheapest cookies but hay they were good. i do have to say their pastries are good even though their customer service and lunch options bite. i was actually not going to write this review and was going to continue stopping in for pastries but after the rude comment the owner themselves left on my last review i was prompted to make it knows that i will NOT ever set foot in the place again. the fact that they cant take simple criticism and respond to it childish and rudely is very sad. the fact is the place ain't worth a penny you drop at the place. LEARN SOME MANNERSThe stars are for the food.Zero stars for the owners. Why do you have to be so unpleasant? You are in the service industry remember? If you are trying to be funny stick to baking.Not great....In fact, I can't understand  the glowing reviews of this location.  Perhaps, as the owners so charmingly posted in a previous review, I just "don't get it".  I thought that the rather "charming" experience I had at Layers was simply the result of the owner or employee having a bad day but now I can see it is just part of the culture of this company. I came to this location with my child, who is rather rambunctious I can attest...but who was treated a bit more like he had some kind of airborne disease.  A look at their website will show you the kind of attitude that they seem to have towards the family oriented customer.  What's the charm in a place that treats its customers poorly?  I cannot believe that you suggested that a customer bring back their child's cake so that you could tell them what was wrong with it...or more accurately I imagine that you would tell them what was wrong with "them".  Not friendly, not spectacular food and horrible customer service skills.Keeping it real.That's what their sign says as you enter their parking lot from the corner of Green Valley Parkway & Horizon. After multiple visits to this wonderfully cute bakery, I'm now convinced they are doing just that, keeping it real yummy!Layers is a mom & pops bakery, serving made-from scratch comfort goodies. They use all-natural ingredients in every cookie, cake, quiche, salad, sandwich and loaf of bread.  All our dairy, fruits, vegetables, nuts, meats and cheeses are organic, and their menus change seasonally.Why do I love Layers?- They'll modify their menu items upon request to fit any dietary need. Allergic to nuts, gluten-free, no soy? No problem.- Great bakery selections. Cupcakes, brownies, cheesecakes, pastries, etc. So many delicious looking goodies!- Custom cakes. Good flavors, some can even be made gluten-free. I ordered a carrot cake for a birthday. Hands down, the BEST CARROT CAKE I EVER HAD. And I've had a lot!- Great service. All employees have been very helpful, friendly, efficient, and most of all, smiling!That awesome carrot cake I talked about? I was running late and I showed up at 5:25pm to pick it up. They closed at 5pm. They gladly let me in, took their time, made sure the cake was to my liking. They probably didn't have to, but they did, which won big points with me! Pay them a visit and see for yourself!I'd heard about this bakery from other Yelp friends for a while, so we met up here on a rainy Saturday afternoon so I could try it for myself.  First of all, it's not just a bakery, but a cafe, too.  Bright and cheery, there were quite a few customers here at 2:00pm.  Greg, the owner, started off well, impressing me by greeting friends Shirley and Tracy by name; they either come here all the time and/or Greg has a great memory and knows his customers.  I really wanted to try the Godzilla bar that Shirley had described, but they were out of them.  There were a lot more baked goods to choose from, though.  I settled on the Cinnamon Walnut Breakfast Cake with a small almond milk latte; yes, they have almond milk, another plus! I love cinnamon desserts and the breakfast cake did not disappoint; Greg warmed it up for me and it paired well with the hot latte, a delicious duo.  The cafe had a steady stream of customers the whole time we were there, even for the late afternoon hour.  Service was excellent and I look forward to my next visit to try that Godzilla bar.Another great place for breakfast/lunch in the Henderson area!One of my friends always brought their baked goods to our office, but I recently decided to try their actually food items!BIG plus for the organic, all natural, gluten free, nitrate free items they use for their food! Their Bacon & Egg Pie is to die for! Moist, succulent quiches with bacon, spinach, onion and cheeses! I've also had their Cafe Croissant - one time with gluten free bread and another with the actual croissant! The gluten free bread has a hard crust but soft middle, yet still tasty. The croissant has the light, buttery goodness to it! The sandwich comes with nitrate free turkey breast, white cheddar, honey mustard, bacon and greens!An almost guilt-free lunch if I must say!I have yet to return and try the other yummy items on the menu!Go in. Do this...- Check-in on Yelp and get a free small iced coffee. - Then get the banana bread with walnuts and chocolate chips. - Look at the chocolate covered bacon with confusion and wonderment. - Sip coffee. - Chew your insanely moist banana bread. - Think about going to Target. - Don't go to Target.- Finish snack and feel energized. - Write Yelp review about your experience. - Smile awkwardly. ProTip: The Wi-Fi is nonexistent. Hope your 4G is tops govna! Cherio!

Review Text :
Some say the first time is always the best and, in my case, I found that true. In between politicians kissing ass for my vote in DC, I went to my first Capital Grille just down from the Capital Building (no kidding) because it looked like a nice bar. And it was. Crammed chock full of political memorabilia, cigar smoke and wine, they also made a killer martini. Since I wore a short skirt, the martini's were free. What got me eating was the curious slabs of beef hanging in the window. "Dry Aged" is what they call it. This is not a new way of curing a steak but the very first way, pre-refrigeration, allowing the connective tissues to naturally decompose creating a very tender meat. I had what they call the Kona-Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin (or something like that) and it was fabulous! The meat melted in my mouth. Definitely a must return-to place. Then, I took a girlfriend to the Vegas one and down went the opinion polls even though I ordered the very same thing. Maybe it was the pretentious, lah-di-dah crowd waving $100 bills (newly-minted rubes from down in the holler?), the mall we had to wind through to get here fighting off aggressive Israeli "Red Sea" salt-crystal venders, or the over-the-top waiter ("Eh, gulls, I killa fa yew") and so-so steak (it obviously wasn't made for Ted Kennedy's gluttonous taste ) but that'll be an Aye vote for DC and a Nay vote for Vegas. Maybe the climate will change in '08...I stopped by here yesterday for dinner and ordered the french onion soup, rib-eye steak, creamed spinach, truffled fries.The onion soup was strong with huge amounts of cheese.....great flavor except the soup was so hot that it burned my mouth:(The steak was super, super tasty.The fries and creamed spinach were super good...perfect sides!!THE VIEW and furnished interior is OUTFUCKING STANDING..........!!One of the most beautiful restauants that I have been in.....love the seats....love the sights of the strip!.Very romantic.....Today, I have to raise my review of Capital Grille from 4 to 5 star.  Here is what is going on.....1.  I eat here at least 6 -8 times a year for dinner, with clients. Easy choice due to my last review details of class, extraordinary service, food quality and reservations.2.  Last night, I was in "trouble" because we were taking my son out for dinner for his 18th birthday with his friends. I was feeling a bit generous as he is doing so well in school, his friends are great and so, we wanted to have something special.3.  Special meant, on the strip, good view, great food, feeling pampered and special.4.  I made reservations at the last minute, 5:00 pm for a 7:30 pm dinner. Why, because i needed class and where we were going wasn't special enough.5.  I asked for a window seat due to my son's birthday. They did not promise, however, they said they would request.6.  Here is what we got...a.  Best table seat in the whole restaurant. Right in the corner with great views.b.  A birthday card with a nice touch, a wax seal envelope, that wished my kid happy birthday and thanking him for dining with them.c.  The service was beyond extraordinary. It was simply staggeringly special.d.  The food, was beyond really good. It was just right.  We had the Delmonico (bone in rib eye), the Porcini rubbed Delmonico (dry rubbed porcini finished with a 12 year balsamic dressing), sliced Filet Migon, Calamari, and Prosciutto wrapped Mozzarella as starters.  For sides, we had the Lobster Mac and Cheese, the Au Gratin Potatoes, Truffle Fries and Creamed Spinach.I guess, when all said and done, the best review is from the young men..."Best Steak ever".  OK, while we know that they haven't been to all the best steak places in LV to qualify, the fact is that it was great and I have been to many  steak places in the world.People, when you are looking for an experience, this is the place.  Kudos to Tiffany for taking my reservation and making it special.  Kudos for Eric who helped us make decisions, and made for a great evening.Thanks Capital Grill for making our night so great.  It doesn't get better in my book and Happy Birthday son!Before a show at Wynn, I came here for dinner.  I was early but it was OK and I was seated at a window table with the marvelous third floor view of the boulevard and the Wynn/Encore towers.I was brought bread, ice water, and iced tea quickly.  My server, Eric, was top notch!  He explained various things on the menu since it was my first visit to the restaurant.  He then left me to mull the choices before coming back to see if I had any questions or was ready to order.I ordered a cup of potato leek soup, the bone in Kona crusted sirloin and the parmesan truffle fries for a side.  Everything was very, very good.  The potato leek soup was creamy and served with a few very thin, slightly deep fried fingerling potato slices.  The soup was rich and very enjoyable.I ordered the steak blue and that's just the way it came.  It was very good and I almost picked up the bone to gnaw before I let them take the plate.  The parmesan truffle fries were addictive.  If anyone from the FDA comes to this restaurant, the fries will be listed as a Class xx addictive drug.  I hated to finish only a small amount but I didn't want to overdo it.For dessert, I got the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  It was very rich and had a good dark chocolate/coffee flavor--strong but not overpowering.  I gave my compliments to Eric for the staff on such a good meal.  It was a great start to the evening.  The view through those windows along with the excellent food and service make the Capital Grille a real winner.

Review Text :
OK, so I don't normally blog like this, but I've just gotta write about this place.  Yasu Sushi Bistro.  The most amazing resturaunt experience I've had in a long time and probably my new favorite place.  Hiding in a strip mall in PV (53rd St & Cactus) is this brand new, upscale little sushi/sumibiyaki joint.  Introduced to me by my wonderful friend Eric.  I met Ryan Kim who showed us the best of the best they have.  First off, atmosphere was great, dim light but not too dark, interesting but delightful music selection, eclectic but themed art selections hanging.  Small patio area outside and just a handful of tables inside.  I passed up the delightful list of sake for the night and started off with edamame, very fresh tasting with just the right amount of salt.  Eric had the miso, which looked quite good for just soup, I hear it's all made from scratch, so no wonder.  We ordered the Power and Phoenix rolls after Ryan explained what was what (my Japanese isn't much of anything yet).  Also after reading the New Times review I was eagerly looking for the Washu.  Ryan also informed us that they have quit stocking it and went for a higher grade, Wagyu. I was now anticipating this even more after hearing how this is the most tender meat in the world, right above Kobe.  The beef was the first to arrive, on a long neat platter served with garlic chips, cut into small cubes, and lightly sea salted.  Alongside the tray came a small bincho-tan fed ceramic grill.  I'm still trying ti find the name of the grill, so please anyone knowledgeable, fill me in. The bincho-tan being imported from Japan along with the grill itself and the beef just made for an immensly unique experience, at least here in the states. The warmth of the grill and pleasant aroma of the charcoal was just the beginning.  Using our chopsticks, we grill the meat tabletop to perfection.  We were told that we're just the second people to try the new menu item so the staff was watching for reactions.  After being built up to this moment, it was surprising to find that it really was everything they said and more than I was expecting.  The look on my face was all head chef Yasu needed to know to understand how satisfied I was.  Words cannot describe it, but this was the best tasting meat I've ever had, so tender, juicy, melt in your mouth amzing flavor.  Yasu even stepped out from behind the counter, brought a small bowl of lemons and told us to just drip a bit on the cooking meat to flare up the charcoal and get more flavor from the smoke.  Wow!!! Again, even better, I was in heaven.  Our rolls arrived alonside and order of calamari.  Each roll had such unique flavor and distinction from every other place I've been.  You can tell what care has been given into making each item.  The calamari was not rubbery or tough unlike others.  Normally it's just a side, but now it made me stop and revel in it's taste as well.  Just when we thought we couldn't go any further though, Ryan suggested dessert.  Ok, I thought, why not.  Red Bean/Banana spring rolls sounded good, but with their opinion we also tried the new item, green tea cheesecake fondue.  I was glad for the second, a small burner with a combo of white/milk chocolate came paired with skewers of soft green cheesecake for dipping.  Crumbled nuts and bananas on the tray just enhanced the flavor as this truly was a dessert I would not have wanted to miss.I know my words are not those of a food critic, but just trust me, you HAVE to try this place to understand how remarkable and different it is.  By far not just another sushi joint (which I barely got in to but saw other plates go by and wanted them too, nigiri and sashimi).  I cannot wait to return and will accompany anyone who wants to make the trip.Well, hate to join the bandwagon, but this place is the real deal! I went here based on Yelp reviews, which after almost a dozen, averaged 5 stars! But several were from newbies to sushi, so I was skeptical, even with a recent ROTD. Had to try for myself.Yasu's is in the Target/REI mall on the corner of East Cactus and Paradise Valley Parkway West, on the edge of Scottsdale and PV, adjacent the Army Recruiting office! The restaurant is immediately recognizable as Japanese owned, by its tasteful and elegant decor in subdued natural tones of wood and stone colors. Clean, modern, with understated class and attention to detail. It isn't large, with only 10 tables inside, 8 4s, a cozy 2 by the sushi bar, and a 6 in front of it, with a small L shaped stool bar next to the sushi bar which only has 2 benches seating 2 each. Outside are 3 more tables in a fenced patio with Tiki lamps aburning. There is a hostess, a Japanese floor manager, several youthful Eurasian servers, and a mostly Latino kitchen staff. Yasu and Takeshi do all the sushi behind the sushi bar, and pace each diner well. They specialize in a daily special menu. Samples for a Friday night included:- Kampachi (baby yellowtail) $12- Kumamoto Oysters (half shel or Sumibi) $10- Aji (Spanish Mackerel) or Striped Jack sushi or sashimi ($5.5/$12 and $7.5/$16 respectively)- Whole Black Snapper (from the Sumibi Yaki Grill) $20- Saikyo Beef Tongue ($8)- Grilled Pike ($8.5)- Grilled Squid Surume ($13.5)- 5 oz Wagyu ($75)- Cornflake Shrimp w/Tartar Sauce ($8.5)- Karaage Black Snapper ($22)- Sake or Miso Steamed Manila Clams ($8.5/$9)- Foie Gras w/ Japanese Eggplant $13.5 Obviously from other reviews, many of these are standard faire daily. Sushi is moderately priced, with basic Nigiri from $4.5 - $5; Exceptions are sweet shrimp ($8), Crab Leg ($6.5) Uni and Mirugai ($7.5). Sashimi are reasonable from $7.5 - $10. Rolls from $4 (Maki type) up to $12 max (hand styled). I went for a $50 Omakase (I count on you, chef) and Takeshi went to work. 1. Duo Cherrystone Clams on half shell atop its own caligraphy covered ceramic charcoal hotpot, garnished with minced green onions, fresh ginger and a dab of spicy tuna mix, doused with Ponzu sauce, taken to a boil in front of you. OMG! AYKM? ($7.5)2. Crystal white Himame (Fluke) fish garnished with minced green onions, morsels of katsuyaboshi (bonita shavings), ponzu, and shaped and decorated to look like a mini sperm whale with eyes and gills ($5.5)3. Hard to find Striped Jack (Shimajii) red striped white fish au natural ($7.5)4. Saba (Mackerel) served without garnish ($4.5)5. Seki-Saba (special mackerel only bought in 2 places in Japan, just arrived today) $6 (smoothest, melt like butter Mackerel you will find!)6. Sake (Salmon) Yasu Style: Scored, seared on the Sumibi Yaki Grill for a smokey flavor, sprinked with ponzu sauce (don't dip into shoyu/wasabi!). Best tasting salmon I have had! Soft and flavorful! ($4.5)7. 4 inch long narrow hand roll filled with buttery Uni and a hint of spice ($7.5)Total with $6 large Asahi Super Dry: $49.I waited 20 minutes for the sushi bar, and as it happens that I was a single, another single came nearly simultaneously, and we talked, shared sushi, and with Japanese politeness, poured each other's drinks. I shared sushi, and they shared Seared Scallop Carpaccio, which were about 8 small sand dollar sized scallop slices, very tender and white, garnished with minced negi, katsuyoboshi, and ponzu.I complimented Takeshi (Umai, Oishikatta, Subarashii!) and left him a $20 bill because I was so happy! (I tipped the wait staff, too)Anything Asian with "Bistro" in the name makes me a bit nervous that it is some convaluted Fusion Crap joint trying too hard to be Hip and Chic. Not the case here!Yasu's rivals other sushi-ya in LA, SD, SF, LV and Seattle, and costs less than ones of equal quality and creativity. I highly recommend it!I live in what might possibly be one of the finest cities for sushi in the US....yep, Los Angeles (Feel free to argue or debate this point with me and then tell me where to go, cuz I am a sushi ho!). Specifically, I live in Studio City; the home of sushi row, the land of sashimi wonderment and the prime pallate real estate that holds faves like Asanebo, Nozawa and Iroha. So imagine the pressure my co-worker, Gabi K, was under to find a sushi place worthy of my snobby and know-it-all sushi taste buds.She chose Yasu and dammit, she chose well! I thoroughly enjoyed the tasty treats we had here last night and I would definitely come back if I lived here. I really liked the hamachi with jalapeno. It was a little light on the ginger sauce, but still very good. We also tried the tuna carpaccio that mixed walnuts with it. Very different and very good. We also tried one of the featured scallop specials that was good, but a little too heavy on the scallions for my taste. I wanna taste the scallops and they got a little lost in the onion madness. We also tried the shishito peppers, good, but a really small portion and the eggplant. Oh and I can't forget to mention the miso-marinated black cod. Very deelish.Definitely check it out. The atmosphere is nice and charming, the service is attentive and helpful and they serve a nice Pinot Grigio to boot. Good times :)This seriously is one of the best sushi places I've ever been to - and I love me some sushi so have had alot.I went here with your PHX yelper Nadia C. - we were in town visiting for the weekend and she was excited to take me to Yasu since she knows a) I love sushi, and b) I love great food.  I was blown away by how great this place was - and it's in a STRIP MALL!  I would have never picked it out unless i lived in the neighborhood.  We had sooooo much food.  We ordered several apps, oysters, rolls - and were so impressed by the chef that when we wanted to add more, we told the waitress to have him surprise us.  Their special rolls are inventive and unique - the Red Roll was my favorite.  The sashimi was incredibly fresh and high quality.  We were visiting for a long weekend, and loved it so much we ended up going back again 2 nights later.  Had to get my Yasu fix while I could!  I will definitely be going back the next time I'm in Phoenix.They say the middle of the road is a good place to get hit, but that's where I am with this place.   The Bad: 1. We were seated at the smallest table ever to be in a restaurant, I think the Guinness Book sticker was on the side of it. 2. Then we were handed two large "book style" menus, a sushi menu, a drink menu, and a sinner special menu.    Just shuffling all that paper made us a little crazy.  SIMPLIFY PEOPLE!3. One of the items we order was brought to us on a plate that was so large that it hung over the side of the tiny table. Very dumb because there was no reason other than "looking cool" in the kitchen when they made it.4. A little pricey for what you get.The Good:1. The bacon wrapped scallops (only 2 for $8.50) were awesome. The best I've ever had.2. The waiter was very helpful with drink and food suggestions. (Keep in mind that he seemed to see we were having a tough time flipping through all FOUR menus.)3. The Red roll was out of this world.4. The place itself is as nice as your gonna find in any strip mall in AZ.See, 4 good points and 4 not so good points.  This one is up to you to check out and see for yourself.This is my first review on Yelp so here you go...I love Yasu!!  This is by far the best sushi and authentic japanese restaurant in Phoenix.  I have been there numerous times and it never disappoints.  You have to try their Sumibiyaki which are items cooked over Japanese charcoal, last time I was there I had the beef tongue..sounds weird but its so goodNigiri/sashimi are a must.  They always have the best selection and daily special, most important...its always fresh...this is definately important!!  The sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order, you will find the fish is sliced with great execution.  Request fresh chopped wasabi, you will never eat sushi with out it again!  Love this place!!I personally have no clue why the amazing reviews. For one they have 4 menus, its bizarre and unnessasarry. Then they like got one of the menus in off white with like highlighter print and you cant even see the writing. Dinner service is slow as it gets. It took me an hour and a half to get 2 rolls and the last time 2 hrs for like 3. The fish itself is fresh, I had things there that were good and stuff that was not at all good. Whoever cuts the fish has no experience clearly. The slices are thick and cut in odd places. The scallop carrpaccio was realy good and the yellow tail carpaccio was kinda gross and in huge thick chunks. If you can combine all four of your menus hire a few more servers or kitchen help, andtrain the dude who cuts blocks of fish this place has a solid foundation for success its just a few things that keep me un interested. If I was invited here by a friend I might come back but I would not reccomend or elect to come back with out influence. I dont talk like that??Yasu is usually one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of being in. It consistently wows, with inventive dishes and a definitive style that always have me wishing I was walking back in when I'm finally heading out. Yasu himself is charming and helpful and they have one wonderful, awesome waiter- an American with a suspiciously Japanese name who goes out of his way to help. We did not get him. On a Sunday at 7pm myself and 5 friends met for our reservation. We are all repeat customers. HEAVY repeat customers. We ordered drinks and about the time they finally showed up, a cool 25 minutes later, we were informed they were all out of tuna. Wrr? We all sighed and said... ok and ticked off an awful lot of other sushi options which we then turned in.  A few minutes later, our waitress (emphasis on the 'wait') returned and said that the wait was 35 minutes for sushi and would we care to order from the kitchen? We reluctantly said ok and placed a few orders. So imagine our surprise when moments later our sushi began to arrive. Well. Sort of. Our waitress appeared with 3 uni shots instead of 6. All 6 of us eyed them, wondering who we'd have to take out to get one, and I calmly ask the waitress to retrieve our other uni shots "expedited, perhaps"?  Instead our waitress walked around the restaurant puzzedly WITH the uni shots like a nomad until she returned 5 minutes later to say there was no more uni.  A nice bunch, we all surrendered our shots until the three smartest amongst us grabbed them and then crowed about their taste.  The waitress offered us 3 oyster shots instead. They sucked. So it was odd when oysters showed up WITH uni on them (though we should say we did order them with uni) a bit later. 5 of them. For the six of us. It is now an hour into our meal. We have already begun texting sweet republic, begging them to stay open. Or atleast bring us ice cream, because were hungry, damnit. A process is established. Every 30 minutes or so a single dish of sushi or something arrives. We each eat one piece, compliment it, and then spend 30 minutes digesting. Halfway through a waiter or waitress will appear to let us know something we ordered is out. But they have "everything else".  We have stopped being quiet and are now openly hysterical. And hungry.  At some point management approaches and we instruct him to turn around and go away until he has good news. They are out of our sake, but are happy to suggest another that is 3x the price. One of the diners suggests they comp it. He laughs. After three hours, all still a wee bit hungry, but 80$ poorer and without a glimmer of hope for sweet republic, we depart. We've been comped nothing. Not an "I'm sorry". Not a "hey, have some edamame on us". Not a "we've knocked 10% off the bill".  We are a bit hysterical over the comical situation, but also not a little pissed. A 400$ bill for a bunch of regulars with a reservation?  Sigh.OFFENSIVE. Tonight I had the most offensive and unprofessional experience at Yasu; I will never ever go back and I would only recommend it to someone I hate.A group of four of us arrived at Yasu for our 6:30PM reservation and were seated promptly. We chatted for a while as water and other beverages were brought out and we went ahead and ordered the chef's choice menu so we could see the best of the best that Yasu had to offer. I've had great experiences with chef's choice at Yen, Pure, and a number of places in Boston so I expected the same from Yasu.We entertain ourselves for a while until the first course arrives. 8 kumamoto oysters with uni and roe. Great play of textures and flavors. Kudos. Plates are removed and now we are getting excited, sashimi must be coming next and we are ready for it! The special fish selections of the day looked fantastic.About 20 minutes goes by and we get our second course, red snapper carpaccio. it is seared and served at room temperature. One of my pieces had i don't know, tendon or something that made it unyielding to my chopsticks, and frankly, the temp of this dish was iffy. Flavors decent, but this is not the mass quantity of sashimi or nigiri I was anticipating.The restaurant starts filling up. I see a massive plate of rolls come out of the kitchen and I nearly squeal with glee...until I watch it come to rest at another table.  This starts happening at a regular pace, and then I realize it's been a full 30 minutes since we've had anything at our table. A server comes by so I ask when the next dish will arrive. She mumbles something about the chef's choice taking a little longer than other orders and walks away.Another cooked plate. A gross mushroom custard, a single shrimp on a skewer, an 1/8th of a cup of japanese eggplant in red miso sauce, a shard of spanish mackerel with some sort of puree, and two bits of jumbo clam. Everything tastes fine, but we are OVER the cooked plate situation.Yet ANOTHER 30 minutes goes by. No server, nor manager comes to apologize for the delay. We watch literally dozens of delicious looking rolls, nigiri and sashimi fly out of the kitchen to other tables. We also watch 4 other couples come in after us, eat loads of food, and leave before us. We are still hungry.Next course...Clams in miso broth. We are not offered spoons for the broth. We look at each other, thinking, "we ARE at a sushi restaurant, are we not?" but go ahead and eat the clams.  When the server comes by and asks how it is we tell her that we hope the next course will begin the actual SUSHI part of this dinner. She says yes, we are having live scallops.About 25 more minutes pass and I'm starting to vibrate with righteous indignation. We are clearly paying a fucking fortune for this meal and we are receiving terrible treatment. The "live scallops" are boiling in miso broth over a mini-charcoal grill. They are so over-cooked they are RUBBERY. We hurry to get them off the coals and into our mouths before they are completely ruined.Finally we tell the server that we are going to have to INSIST on getting some raw fish on the table. She says that's what's coming next. "Next" meaning ANOTHER 30 minutes later. We wait so long that finally we tell the server we are NOT going to continue with this absurdity and that we want the check. "oh your next course is ready!" "we don't want it. We want to leave" These are the exact words out of our mouths. Instead of bringing the check she brings the plates, telling us that Chef Yasu "wants us to have them." We all resist and the plates are set down anyway and finally our hunger makes us cave and we eat. We have now been at Yasu for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. We've had five courses that were not enough for two people, much less four.Another 15 minutes pass before the check arrives. In that time, the manager has come out, not to rectify the situation, or apologize, but to call us ignorant and classless. He literally looks at us and accuses, "Have you ever had omakase before? It is always slower." We look at him and tell him in all of our sushi eating years we have never had an experience akin to this. We also point out that we were expecting SUSHI, as in RAW FISH. He tells us we told the server we would eat 'anything'. I asked him if the name of his restaurant was Yen SUSHI Bistro and he looks at me, puzzled. Then I see that we have been charged $20 for the last course that we TWICE tried to send back. I speak to the manager who tells me "if Yasu wants to charge you for it, he will charge you for it." I kid you not. All in all each course was mercilessly over-worked, only average and Yasu is on a major ego trip. Don't waste your time and money here.There are few places that I make a decision to NEVER step foot into again. Yasu has earned this dubious distinction from me. First, let me give you my background with sushi since this came into question from the manager himself. I have been eating sushi for about 11 years. Some really bad sushi, some amazing sushi. I have mentioned in previous reviews that I have had sushi fresh off a boat in Hawaii. While I don't claim to have had ALL the sushi in the world, I know what good sushi and what good sushi service is. Second, let me tell you that I have had omakase (chef's menu) in several locales, so I know what it entails. I was with a group of friends on my highly anticipated visit to Yasu Sushi Bistro. We had made a reservation and were seated immediately. We quickly decided to indulge in the omakase menu. We wanted the best that Yasu Sushi Bistro had to offer! I always say "Hit me with your best shot!" Well... if you have nothing to do, and aren't hungry...you should do the omakase menu. It took Thirty Minutes between courses. And please don't think we were given platters full of food. This is more like 2 small oysters per person, A plate of 1 shrimp, a couple slices of King Claim, a dollop of Spanish mackerel tartar on a bone chip.... So think tiny gourmet food. So think how hungry and irritated I was Two HOURS later. In a 3.5 hour visit, we had consumed Four tiny dishes. I really tried to be patient, but this is absurd and unacceptable! I finally asked for the check as we wanted to leave and go eat elsewhere. I expressed my displeasure at the slowness of the meal. Now before you Yasu lovers roll your eyes and shake your fingers at me. Let me put it in perspective. At ANY restaurant, it is unacceptable to be the first table to arrive, watch subsequent tables seated, and fed, and watch them leave and you're still waiting to be fed... you would be ticked off too. Now add to that a condescending manager who comes over to talk to you and asks if you have ever had an omakase experience before and tries to piss in your pocket and tell you that it's raining. Unacceptable. Now, add to that the restaurant sending out another dish after you had already asked for the check and then CHARGING you for that dish even though you said you didn't want the dish. I have nothing against the food, though it wasn't very imaginative on the SUSHI level. What killed the entire visit was the slowness of the courses, the response of the management, and the lack of ethical treatment in regards to the check. I will never visit Yasu Sushi again and I bet my stress level will be all the better for it.A recent trip with my husband to Yasu  last Saturday night began with being ignored, followed by more ignoring, and ended with being ignored as we left. I was not even wearing my cloak of invisibility.We waited at the hostess stand for five minutes before being greeted (even though the hostess made several trips to the podium without any acknowledgement) and were then directed to the bar where we sat another five minutes without being greeted or offered a beverage. We did however, stare at the bartender while he ate something and ignored us.We went to Roka Akor.Yasu, Yasu, Yasu!! You are simply ADORABLE!!! :)The restaurant and the owner!! This place is delicious, ever so fresh and innovative!Plus, the service here is always five stars, the food and ingredients are the freshest ever. Service was great, our waiters have always been super friendly and informative of items and specials. I also love how well this place is decorated, it's dimmed and very private.   Awesome place to go to have a nice quiet dinner. :)

Review Text :
I stumbled upon this place on my way to Dicks Hideaway.. The sign outside, located just off 7th St. and Bethany Home drew me in.. I love Latin food and they do not let you down. I have since been there 3 times and overall my dining experience has been good.The place is hidden and only has about 10 tables inside the restaurant and there are a few patio tables also. The on my first visit I had the tropical shrimp martini for an app, then went with the special - a crab stuffed chili relleno. It was so good I was disappointed the second visit when it was no longer a feature.. I've also tried the tilapia and it was equally good. And their sangria is wonderful, I could drink a gallon, but it is pretty strong so maybe that is not the best idea :)The only drawbacks? On my third visits I sat on the patio, there is a dance studio next door and they play their music very loud while practicing routines. We had to listen to the same chorus line thought the entire meal, I think that song has been permanently engraved in my brain, and it was not a good song. Another disappointing thing was the pernil asado, I am big pork fan but what they served was a big, greasy and fatty mess, I will not try that entree again. Overall the food is pretty delicious and the place has a great ambience (if you are not sitting outside during dance class). You feel so cool discovering such a hidden and quaint spot you want to tell everyone about it.I had high hopes. Obama is our president...the Cardnials are one win away from the super bowl....things are looking good. I would have to say that Fuego didn't live up to the expectations. The prices are a bit high (20$ per plate) for the style of the place (casual) and for the food itself. It was good, but not great. We had the empanadas. Interesting...but try them at Mi Cocina Mi Pais (great!). Fuego's are good...but too much pastry...and a sauce that tasted like a wing sauce (like would be great on hot wings but overwhelmed the empanadas). The drinks were good but again not amazing. Mismatched glasses and plates (I mean that is sort of cute, but not for a nice dinner out).The Ropa and the Pernil were good. The corn was ok (not enough flavor) and the mashed potatoes were overpowered with chipotle flavor (which I usually like)Everyone was nice. Our server was a little too familar...but whatever. There was this really sad folksy music playing. For a cuban/latin place, get some freaking latin cuban music.   The music made the whole vibe a bit odd.  I felt I should go get high afterwards and think about the sadness in this world...:)   But (my wife is making me say this)...the singer was talented. Keep up the good work buddy, maybe at a different venue.Overall, it was ok. Not worth the drive and probably won't be coming back. With so many other great places in PHX, this one needs some fine tunning to be amoung the list.No place does a better job of transporting you from a nondescript commercial corner of central Phoenix to a quaint open air patio of San Juan better then Fuego.  It will utterly surprise you how comfortable that spot is.  It definitely eases you into a singular culinary experience.The menu is relatively small but that's not a problem.  Every dish is percolating with flavor.  The Cuban-southwestern fusion that they've got going on is enough to make Fidel wonder if he should foment a revolution out here....just so he could get closer to these dishes.  The pork dish is on par with the Barrio Cafe Cochinita Pibil in terms of bliss. But the nod goes to Fuego when you consider the incredible sides, namely the jalapeno creamed corn and mashed potatoes.  The tilapia is also an item worth the return visit.  A great restaurant, in my opinion, is a combination of several things namely food, service, and location.  The Fuego excels on all three counts.  Drop by and experience what it is like to escape Phoenix while still being in Phoenix.Fuego Bistro: This is what a bistro should be. Had it not been for a great deal on Groupon, I don't know if Robert M and I would have made it for dinner here. It's not that we hadn't thought about it, it's just that it's oddly located. But that's neither here nor there, because last night we dined--and we dined well. We started our date with sangria--Robert the white and I the red. Initially I thought I'd erred in my decision (the white was fruity and intense while the first taste of the red was merely okay). But then the complexity of the red unfolded, as spices piqued out and enveloped the glass. Either way, both are exceptional. Our first course was the empenadas. In a word: Magnificent! The perfectly flaky crust and the robust filling could be an entire meal of its own. I, however, would do away with the hot sauce served on the side. Just a preference, or if they had a house salsa that would be good. Main course was the Pollo Ajedrea for Robert and the daily special (chile rellenos stuffed with scallops, shrimp and tilapia) for me. Sides were chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes for both of us and black beans for Rob and green beans for myself. After sampling our own entrees, we tried each other's. To be honest, after being blown away by my dish, the chicken was a bit flat, and that by no means indicates it wasn't very good. It's just that I was so amazed by the chile rellenos. It was one of the things of which I dreamt last night. Those mashed potatoes were another thing dancing through my head. :dreamy eyes: It's located in a ballet studio complex, which is enchanting. There is also a lovely patio which some braved the cold last night on which to dine and be entertained by a local musician. Once the weather becomes more tolerable, I'll give it a go. Service was fantastic! Susan was genuinely friendly, as if we were regulars, and cemented the deal that we would be back again and again. Fuego Bistro has an incredible happy hour, from what I understand, that runs from 3-6 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. Yes, boys and girls, I said Saturday. They have about two dozen items from their menu for $5 (including those empenadas) and assorted cocktails. This could turn in to a sordid love affair, if I don't mind myself.My friend and I had such a wonderful happy hour here. After a whole day of driving around the Valley, it was so relaxing to go into the beautiful patio and indulge in made-from-scratch sangria. Our host and our server, who were a pleasure to talk to, guided us through the happy hour menu and we decided to have the ropa sliders, followed by the pernil asado sliders - both excellent.  We capped off the evening with the creamy decadence of their banana burrito, then headed out into the cool January night warmed by our pleasurable experience at this charming place.Consider this 3.5 stars. So here's the deal.  The service is great, the atmosphere is nice inside and out and the food is good.  The prices?  Not so great for good food.The sides were actually better than the main dish which is where they fall from 4 stars, especially considering that entrees are $20-25 bucks.I had a chicken breast that was panko breaded, smothered in tomatillo & cream sauce, topped with bacon, goat cheese, pico de gallo (fresh onion, tomato, cilantro, etc) and crispy tortilla strips.  Frankly I don't think I ever tasted the chicken.  Or the bacon.  Or the goat cheese.  Those are the things I was looking forward to.  That's what sold me on the dish.  But they were lost in the tomatillo, the cream, the salsa, the tortilla strips...this dish tried to do too much and suffered for it. This chicken was a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.The sides-cornbread casserole and spicy mashed potatoes-were very good.The bottom line?  Good but not great and if I'm paying $21 for a chicken breast I should be wowed.I went here tonight with the BF. We thought it was really meh, capital MEH. We had a reservation, but for some reason got sat inside. There were virtually no people eating inside and outside was lively and had a band playing... we couldn't even hear it inside... it was like silent. I would think they would at least open the doors, but nope. So that was a bad start. It took our waitress a long time to even come to our table, and when she came she asked if we wanted drinks and apps (which we didn't given the portion size) and we ordered dinner. The waitress seemed kind of short with us, and it may have been that she was busy or that she was mad we didn't order more items. Anyway, so I ordered the chicken and the bf ordered the pulled pork. Both were pretty lack luster. First off, the food came out really fast... like it was all premade fast... and it wasn't really hot, just kind of warm. Like other people have said, the chicken sounds really good but actually comes out kind of bland. The menu says the chicken is pounded but my chicken was like 2 inches thick, so that was weird. The breading wasn't really crispy and the whole thing just wasn't that good. The bf's pork was also kind of bland, even with the dipping sauce that came with it. The sides were alright (mashed potatoes, corn bread, carrots-these didn't have a ton of flavor). Despite the food being underwhelming, we did decide to order dessert. This is why I gave this restaurant 2 stars. The banana burrito was delicious! I wish I had just eaten this for dinner. So we get our check and I have a 30$ groupon. The bill comes back and only 20$ was taken off. We waited for about 6 minutes for the waitress to come back and she was good about it, she fixed it. It just seemed like a weird mistake. Anyway, for the two of us to get mains and split a dessert (no apps and no drinks) cost me a total of 45$ (would have been 60). This was way too much for what we got. I felt kind of ripped off. Maybe it was just my experience, but it was overall underwhelming.I found the service here attentive and timely, but have to share some sentiments with other unimpressed Yelpers about the mediocrity of the dining experience. I was introduced to Fuego Bistro by my roommate who had purchased a Groupon without knowing anything about the restaurant.It has a charming vibe, it's off the beaten path in a quirky courtyard bordered by a salon and dance studio. But the food was unremarkable... not by any means inedible, but rather forgettable. I felt the restaurant concept was a little confused given the choice of sides which don't necessarily pair well with every entree. I had the seared ahi tuna which was topped with a balsamic reduction and a mango/red pepper/avocado salsa. It was cooked properly but underseasoned except for the balsamic reduction which was nothing but sweet. Perhaps the blandness of this dish could be remedied with chili and lime and salt, but regardless, it did not deliver on taste. I chose to have the chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans as side dishes. The green beans were the best of the two, simple and tender, but the potatoes were lacking in flavor. Chipotle was only hinted at and the cheese was entirely understated. I know there has to be a way to elevate this food, but Fuego has fallen short. My roommate was in agreement that the meal was not a hit. Even the Key Lime Pie for dessert did not make the grade. I see potential in this restaurant, since the staff is friendly and helpful. But ultimately, it's about the food and I can't recommend it. The only saving grace was that we did not pay full price.I heard the summoning of my fellow yelpers confidence in past experiences of pure delight. Exotic pleasures upon my pallet were soon to come. If you simply can't choose for yourself on which meal to dine; their savory beef, flavorful chicken or succulent pork are sure to inspire. I experienced the "Cola and Pineapple Soy Braised Angus Short Rib Roast", "Signature Pernil Asado", and "Pernil BBQ Quesadilla"; all cooked to inspire moments of bliss. The Short Rib Roast; my favorite of the three, leaves no room for disappointed, and that's a personal guarantee ;)April and May are the perfect months to enjoy their outdoor patio, tucked inside the conspicuos hidden courtyard at the corner of 7th street and Palo Verde. As usual with many establishments I visit, snag a great deal by picking up a $25 off 2 entree's certificate from restaurant - com. With certificate in hand, you could walk out the door for close to $30 including tax and tip. During the hours of 3-6 pm (Tuesday - Saturday), try appetizer portions of most popular dishes for $5 - $7 each.Happy dining my friends!07/05/12 Had two Voice Daily Deals ($10 for $30) to use up before the 14th, so I asked my young cousin to meet me for dinner.  I'd never eaten here before, but I know from the reviews that it's popular for happy hour.  Indeed, the HH menu sounds fantastic, and so do the prices.  However, these certificates were only good for dinner, and so here we were.  But first, about the location-- it's tucked away a bit, away from the road, so don't blink, or you might miss it.  There are many parking spaces, so that's not an issue unless you're there for HH.  (If you are, then come early.)  FB has a small patio area that looks promising, if only it was decorated a little better.  I remember seeing two tables, but cousin remembers four.  I don't think there are misters to help keep cool.  Inside, it's even smaller.  I would say about six tables of two- and four-tops, and about five to six seats at the beautiful blue-tiled bar.  Sit here to maximize on atmosphere, have questions about the wines or cocktails, and if you want to be entertained by the staff.My cousin doesn't drink, so she had water, while I tried the guava mojito.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=pCA97HLAPYRN0bJTQUs1Pw#pCA97HLAPYRN0bJTQUs1Pw  It tasted like a regular mojito, but a bit sweeter.  It's alright- nothing fantastic.  Maybe I'll try a regular one, without the added flavorings, during HH one of these days.  After poring through the menu and asking our server Steve (who is also the bartender) about the dinner special (ribeye), I found I could only try ONE item, since everything else had allergens all over the entrees (shellfish, corn, guacamole, bell peppers, dijon reduction, etc.), instead of just added on top, and so I ordered the Natural Farm Chicken Breast, with tomatillo sauce, pico de gallo, goat cheese, and bacon. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=o8X2VwUplwqRZfvuQUunDA#o8X2VwUplwqRZfvuQUunDA  My cousin ordered the ribeye special, with mushrooms and a dijon reduction.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=fMtwu_Aw8ynU-gaOspzWWQ#fMtwu_Aw8ynU-gaOspzWWQ  Entrees come with your choice of two sides from the following choices: green chile cornbread casserole, jalapeno creamed corn, sauteed organic green beans, chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes, and maple-glazed carrots.  Cousin chose the cornbread and creamed corn, and I asked for the green beans and mashed potatoes.Cousin LOVED everything on her plate!  She especially liked the cornbread.  I enjoyed my dish, as well.  I liked how spicy it was, which may turn some people off, but I thought everything worked well together, especially the addition of the goat cheese, which helped to cut the spiciness.  I say add more cheese!  Loved the bacon bits, as well.  The green beans were sauteed to perfection-- nice green color and crisp, and not greasy.  We both thought the mashed potatoes were very tasty!  It's a good thing I liked the dish, since it's the only one I can order, unless they offer something new as a special.  We were too stuffed to order dessert, and it's a good thing, too, since out of the five choices (Ancho chocolate torte, Banana burrito, Kahlua creme brulee, Horchata bread pudding, and Homemade Key Lime pie), I could only have the brulee, and I wasn't feeling like creme brulee that evening.  Prices were too high for me to consider dining here for dinner without a discount.  Now, it's one thing if the menu is all-organic, but it isn't.  Service was attentive and friendly, so that's a plus.  Loved the intimate setting, but only if I can sit at the bar- we sat at a table.07/12/12Came back solo to use up the second certificate.  This time I sat at the lovely blue-tiled bar, even though the seat wasn't too comfortable, especially after leaving a massage session...  It was great fun speaking with bartender Steve and server Kevin.  "T-Bone" was nice, too -- he always made sure to open the door for guests.Had the chicken breast again http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=P_dIQjZufh2dJ6m_rjYmTA#P_dIQjZufh2dJ6m_rjYmTA, with a glass of sauvignon blanc, and the Kahlua creme brulee.  The chicken is as good as I remembered it, but this time there was even less goat cheese!  However, the creme brulee made up for it.  The best part of the dessert were the caramel and chocolate sauces that accompanied it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=tmq5bH42X_to8nG9fuT6yg#tmq5bH42X_to8nG9fuT6yg  Mmm!  I'd like to have these over ice cream, but not the Thrifty ice cream that accompanies many of the dessert plates offered here.  (Sorry, but I cannot have products that use corn syrup.  Besides, I'd rather have ice cream made from high-quality ingredients, and carrageenan and corn syrup, high fructose or otherwise, aren't.)Thanks for honoring the Voice Daily Deals, FB!  I'll be back with family and friends for happy hour, maybe.Had shrimp was really good and burnt but good Burnt like french food :) empanadas were good as well as the mussels. The waiter also gave us a sample potatoes which were different I hear their corn bread is good. I used a groupon so be on the look out for deals like that. Shout out to  Kevin and chewy thank you so much for jumping my dead car battery will be back :) Outdoor seating is nice as well since they have heaters ;) The place is small and intimateLast night my husband I went here for dinner.  We have eaten here before and we liked the food.  So, we thought we would try it again.   I'm kind of sad that our experience was not all that great this time. The waiter that we had was not very good.  Was not very helper and he never came around to see if we liked our food or if we needed anything.    Also the water guy was great, he came around and checked on us, to see if we liked our food or if we needed anything.  I wish we could have tipped him and not our waiter.  Now for the food, it was pretty good.  We ordered the Pineapple short rib roast and it came with mashed potatoes and creamy corn.   It is definitely an enough for two people.    Last and not least, the atmosphere of this restaurant is not all that great either.  It is in the middle of this little shopping center and you could hear the music for the dance studio that was right next to the patio seating. Happy yelping everyone!!!  If you decided to come here the food is not all that bad.  We in joyed it!!!Another Phoenix restaurant getting away w/ poor customer service, sub-par food, high prices and A HORRIBLE HOST.RESERVATIONS--I made reservations for my boyfriends sisters birthday last night (9/24/13). She had a Groupon and we've both been wanting to try out this restaurant for a while. I called to make reservations, no one answered during open hours. I called again, no answer. I went online and found a number to text your reservations. I got a response back very quickly "got it". When we arrived, we were seated at the table nearly in the entrance hallway. Probably the worst table. (People from the dance studio were sweeping the dust and dirt from the dance floor out their back door right next to our table--gross!) No one mentioned the birthday the whole dinner. Clearly a lack of communication w/ the reservation line.The worst part was when I mentioned our disappointment w/ our experience to the XL host at the front, he was not empathetic in the slightest way. I made a comment about having a Groupon and the host used it against me saying "well that's the type of service you get when you use a Groupon".--Oh REALLY? I couldn't believe he said that. Our service was actually good. It was him that was dreadful to communicate with..I mentioned something about the birthday, and he said "we don't do anything special for birthdays". I asked if they knew how to at least say happy birthday, and he snidely said "we'll happy birthday!" - I told him it wasn't my birthday, it was someone else's in our group.A group of people came up and he changed his attention to helping them so I walked away. He then yelled at me to come back that he wasn't done talking I me. I was done talking to him when he changed his focus to the other group--he clearly has no customer service skills.FOOD--the only thing they have right is taste. Total lack of attention to textures. Food comes out of the kitchen sloppy. Overcooked carrots, under-cooked cornbread. Cornbread was sitting in a puddle of juice from the carrots when I got my plate making it extra soggy. Empanadas were fantastic. Pulled pork was good, nothing special. Steak had lots of tendons/cartilage. Topping on the steak was great. Great classic margarita.I will NOT be going back. NOT worth the money.

Service wise: terrible! We made an 8:30 reservation as a back up plan but were able o arrive by 7:00. When we checked in with the host he proceed to give us a rundown of "how restaurant reservations work!" Begrudgingly he sat us 30 mins later. After being seated I asked the waitress what the name of the dessert was at the the table behind us was eating.  When she replied "mini desserts" I tried to clarify if that's what they are called on the menu. She brushed me off and said "I'll bring them out to you when it's time." She also hardly checked in with us and spilled water all over my friend's bread plate. HORRIBLE service!Ambiane: classy. High celings, classy decor, clean.Food: pretty good. The lemon chicken came with orzo and sweet potatoes that were great, and the side of grilled asparagus was delish.The service and they way they treat customers make this a 2 star place. I would not go back and support such a restaurant.For me, I think there's only one way to do Brio: sit at the bar.Why do I say this? Three words: Bar Plates Menu. It's only available during the week. Sorry weekenders. The BPM (why yes, I did decide to shorten it) has plates starting at $3.95, including a beef carpaccio that is delicious and a big size portion. You can't really go wrong with anything on this list for the price. I love the eggplant fries, too.If you don't feel like sitting at the bar, Brio does have a great patio. Like Desiree F said in an earlier review, I don't go here a whole lot. There are just a lot of great places in this area. I've always had good service here. The atmosphere is nice. My last visit I talked to the manager on duty for a long time. She was really sweet. Parking is annoying for me, but that's more because I don't come here a whole lot and all the decks look the same. Brio has a rewards program. You can get a card or download the app. After five visits, you can get $10 off your 6th.

Two stars for the guys hooking it up with coins! LOLConveniently close to home and what kid doesn't like going to Chuck E Cheese!?This location wreaks of gross smells upon walking in..Then soon as you walk in you can already tell how filthy the place is -- coin cups EVERYWHERE, pieces of broken tickets, foods, and random trash all over the floors.Another minus for this location is 60% of their machines were "not in service" or not working properly .. Always eating the coins or not producing the tickets.. Also, there has been the need to chase or wait a long time for an attendant to help you with anything, unacceptable on a slow night.There's not much to expect from a place like Chuck E Cheese but a little cleanliness and working machines would suffice.

The Wife and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner in a relaxed environment and she suggested we dine at Verandah.  Located in the Four Seasons @ Mandalay Bay, this restaurant is a great getaway where you don't feel like you're on the Las Vegas Strip.After browsing the menu, we decided to order:SaladCaprese - Beefsteak Tomato, Campania Buffalo Mozzarella, Pestohttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=KdUUseaYZ5I3jPuDCwhiWAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=FacNkTHkUVooJuqELmZs-gAragosta - Lobster, Frisee, Seasonal Vegetables, Truffle Vinaigrettehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=3OCmQkKjb43sK0JY_bC66wEntreesPenne Alla Arrabiata - Smoked Mozzarella, Spicy Roma Tomato Saucehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=aAoVdVRd0bvfZj5BTwEelABranzino - Striped Sea Bass, Citrus Crust, Fennel Saucehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=ccVqY3Qp-e3rdsqZ1GflzwSide DishesBaby Potatoes with Black Trufflehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=YeSoCAR3VCJwQ04tndVcYwMushrooms with Marsalahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=aQOaL6HcE3oGygKjOvxmywFor DessertWarm Italian Donuts, Lemon Curd, Chocolate GanacheI had the Caprese Salad and the Penne Alla Arrabiata.  Both were amazing!  The Penne Alla Arrabiata was made al dente, which is how I love my Pasta and the Arrabiata Sauce had a nice kick to it....just right.  The Caprese Salad was not overdone with Oil, unlike some restaurants.The Wife enjoyed her Lobster Salad and Striped Bass.  She passed on Dessert, but I couldn't resist the Warm Italian Doughnuts, so I went for it.....they were so good, I forgot to take a picture of them and they were gone by the time I remembered....:)The service was impeccable.  The servers were friendly and attentive.  They were also very knowledgable about the menu and had great ideas for dinner.Overall, it was an another awesome experience here.Return Factor - 100%As far as the old system of dining goes, Verandah would probably be considered a "5-star" restaurant. Fancy setting, high prices, impeccable service, etc. However in the new food era, it's not just all about being hoity-toity. To get high stars in my book you need to have good food, and provide some form of value proposition. Based on my breakfast at verandah, I'd have to say that A-OK is proper. From entry to exit here, the service is beyond impeccable. They ask your name at the desk and you're subsequently greeted by name by every server that approaches you. Coffee is kept full, and it's white-glove the whole way. The setting is very pleasant - outdoors next to the Mandalay pool system - very elegant. The food itself, however, leaves a bit to be desired. It's okay, but for the price it could be a lot better. I sampled a plate of huevos rancheros that cost about as much as a dinner entree would cost at a decent restaurant. $5 for drip coffee is beyond the pale. Overall it was up in the mid-$20's for a simple entree+coffee breakfast. I guess I'm not someone who is willing to pay all that extra for exclusivity. Coming from Portland I want the food to be exemplary at that price - especially for breakfast, which is notoriously easy to prepare. If you want a four-seasons experience, this is your place. If your main goal is good food, you may be able to do better.Located inside of the Four Seasons hotel, Verandah is an elegant hide-away from the noisy and crowded Mandalay Bay.  I came here with a few business friends for lunch...took the recommendation from the waiter and had the Seafood Insalate.  Lobster, crab, jumble shrimp, sliced boiled egg, tomatoes, greens.  Healthy, refreshing, Abundant.  I loved it except the price --$26.   Food in Vegas is insanely expensive these days.  For that price we get two entries in LA.  Wait staff is professional and friendly.Interior is stylish and beautiful.I will probably come back to try their signature items.While I love FS Spas, I am not a huge fan of the FS restaurants, ranging from Allium in Chicago, Blue Bar in Hong Kong, to Veranda in Vegas. I feel like a little kid getting all excited and am disappointed every time I dine at a FS restaurant. I decided never come back to Veranda, but why?1) The service was not on par with that of other FS restaurants - While the food at Allium and Blue Bar are mediocre, the waiters are friendly and helpful. On the other hand, the waiter at Veranda confused the orders of my friend and mine. She also forgot our requests for water. 2) The food was mediocre - Although I appreciated the parfait being less sweet, I was not happy that the ratio of the non-fat Greek yogurt and the granola was one to four. I ended up eating dry nuts most of the time. The orange juice that both of us had was not fresh and was slightly bitter. The juice was definitely two levels below that in MOzen at Mandarin Oriental. Although I enjoyed the view of the pool and the palm trees, I was disappointed by the overpriced mediocre food of Verandah. I would rather pay slightly more for the food and drinks at MOzen.Items selected:Lavazza Italian CoffeeRustic Cut Corned Beef and Pastrami Hash, Florentine Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise, ChilaquilesCinnamon Roll, Pain au Chocolate, Blueberry Cream Cheese Coffee Cake, Raspberry Coffee Cake, Bear Claw, Raspberry Tart, Blueberry Muffin, Cinnamon Oatmeal Bran MuffinTiramisu Croissant French Toast - Banana-Apple Compote, Citrus Mascarpone CreamChicken & Waffles - Sweet Basil Fried Chicken, Savory Bacon and Chive Waffles9-Grain Bread with Fresh Ground Peanut Butter and Strawberry Jam, Fresh Fruits, Apricots and Figs, Artisan Cheeses, Farro and Greek Yogurt Parfait with Almonds and Cranberry Compote, Chilled Red Quinoa Cereal - Whipped Almond Milk And Ricotta, Sliced AlmondsPumpkin Orange Ricotta Pancakes with Pure Maple Syrup, Mascarpone Cheese Blintz with Roasted Apple Glaze, Plain and Red Currant Scones with Lemon Curd, Cinnamon Panetonne French Toast with Berry CompoteBreakfast Potatoes with Onion Confit and Crispy Pancetta, Peppered Bacon, Candied Bacon, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Chicken and Apple Sausage, Pork Sausage Links, Breakfast PizzaMaple Pecan Sticky Bun, Fresh Made Donuts, Bread Pudding with Vanilla AnglaiseInvited to enjoy Veranda's weekend brunch by PR Director Erica Johnson-McElroy after requesting clarification of a confusing online menu via E-mail, it was with a friend that I sat down inside the newly renovated space at Four Seasons and with a collection of dishes served amidst refined environs paired to service that warrants Michelin stars the experience that followed was a nearly flawless celebration of my one year anniversary of dining as a resident of Las Vegas.Certainly more limited in selection than Bacchanal or other Strip-side all-you-can-eats the Veranda Brunch Buffet is offered on weekends only and with menu selections offered to compliment the five stations it was only the flavorless Florentine Benedict that proved less than delicious while at least a half-dozen items trumped most versions elsewhere, buffet or a la carte.  Taking an approach to volley savories and sweets course-for-course it was after a brief tour by the restaurant's GM that dining commenced and with the newly conceptualized hash a truly stunning blend of textures and flavors a plate of pastry soon followed, the moist bran muffin sweetened by honey and creamy blueberry coffee cake standing out ahead of the pack.  At this point opting for two menu-items both the crisply breaded brined bird as well as its accompanying mini-waffles were undoubtedly amongst the best in town but stealing the show was, predictably, the Tiramisu French Toast - a composition of buttered croissants soaked in custard with a golden sear beneath fresh fruit compote and light, tangy cheese.  Slightly underwhelmed by charcuterie selections while the fresh ground peanut butter and a Greek Yogurt Parfait impressed on buffet-plate three the fourth plate was a sinfully sweet quintet with fluffy seasonal pancakes and soft, buttered scones both benefitted by exemplary toppings while the blintzes bested those at Carnegie Deli with lovely autumnal apples and a far less impactful hit to the wallet.  Impressed moreso than usual by breakfast meats, particularly the candied bacon found on the optional  Bloody Mary Bar, it was expectedly in sweets that the meal called it a wrap and while drinking what might as well have been my twentieth cup of coffee the fresh-made mini donuts were indeed a treat, but not nearly as wowing as the exceptional bread pudding - a traditional preparation with a chocolate surprise at its base that was all the bettered by rich Anglaise, both items something I'd held off on until the very end because I knew that to indulge earlier would compromise my ability to pay due diligence to the rest.Having not yet experienced the Sterling Brunch at Bally's, the unlimited champagne feast carrying a tab more than double the price, Veranda is undoubtedly amongst the city's most refined brunch experiences while service never once leaves the diner for want.  Well culled in selection, with items from the menu offered on request, the $40 tab with additional costs for bottomless drinks is a pricey but well justified tally and with strong focus on seasonal ingredients a return visit will undoubtedly take place in the near future - a visit for dinner also on the agenda in order to experience what some have called some of the city's most underrated Italian cuisine.Note:  A friend was invited by the Director of Public Relations to come to brunch and bring a guest.  We were comped for our brunch by the General Manager of the restaurant.That being said, this has to be one of the best brunch options I have had in Las Vegas.  After being given a tour and an explanation of some of thew operations by the GM, we set out.  I got two of their hot mini pans to start.  I found the corned beef and pastrami hash to be outstanding.  Instead of the common mixture of meat and potatoes, this was a totally different take with thin potato sticks being interspersed with the meat.  It was a winner of a dish.  The chilaquiles, something they haven't offered before, was also very good and it had some nice spice to give the dish some character. My second plate consisted of one pumpkin orange ricotta pancake, some peppered bacon, Cinnamon Panetonne French toast, a mascarpone cheese blintz, and a red currant scone with some lemon curd.  The scone and the blintz were winners in this round but there was nothing here that wasn't very good.Next, I got a plate with some of the meats and cheese, a piece of breakfast pizza,  seasonal scrambled eggs. and one chicken and apple sausage.  The meat was the disappointment of the brunch.  There was a small selection and it was difficult the way the meat was folded to get a piece without destroying the way it was placed on the dish.  The cheese was better but the one was so flavorless we couldn't tell what it was.  At this time, I tasted some tiramisu French toast and some chicken from two items my friend ordered from the menu.  The French toast was amazing.  The chicken was moist and the coating was crispy and falling off the meat.No, I wasn't done yet.  I got a Farro and Greek yogurt parfait with almond and cranberry compote and the citrus panna cotta.  The farro was my favorite of these two.Time for some more sweetness in my morning and I got some bread pudding with a small amount of the vanilla Anglaise.  It was outstanding.  I didn't give away the surprise to my friend who learned later when you got to the bottom, there was some chocolate that just added to the whole dish.Finally, we got four mini doughnuts and split the flavors so we each had one each of the two flavors.  They were good.I have to rank this brunch with the best buffets/brunches in town.  Service was exceptional.  Each time we went to the food area, our napkins were folded and placed on the placemat.  Water was constantly being refilled and coffee was always replenished.I was able to get up and walk away from brunch--a feat I wasn't sure I could accomplish and it would turn out to be my only meal of the day!  The room has been completely remodeled and despite the fact that it was almost full when we left, it was a very quiet place--an atmosphere conducive to conversation and enjoying one's food.  A well deserved 5 stars.Review for Sunday Brunch. Had long been on my brunch list, was saving it for a nice time of year so we could sit outside. Upon walking in I immediately noticed a donut station. What! I've been on a donut kick lately and I'm usually not a fan. When we sat, our server went over the menu and told us we had the option of buffet or a la carte. I couldn't decide at first, there was a lemon ricotta pancake that had caught my eye on the a la carte menu, but the donut station sealed the deal for me.I was impressed with the different buffet station, lots of different parfaits and yogurts, an omelet station, and they had all small plates so you could sample a little bit of everything. They also had a pastry station with a spot to make your own homemade peanut butter. Everything we had was really good. I would bump this up to 5 stars if they offered a bottomless mimosa on the menu. They had a bloody mary bar, but not all of are fans. This brunch buffet was way better than the Country Club at the Wynn, almost half the price. I totally recommend.

Review Text :
Does the New Times have a better opinion than me?  That was the question I tried to answer when I went here to try out the wings.  The New Times Best of Phoenix declared this restaurant as having the best wings, so I had to check it out.*Side note* I used to regularly hang out at the Half Moon on Bell when I lived up in that big box/corporate chain infused section of town.  We went almost every weekend to partake in their real long island iced teas for $2.50 and enjoyed it despite it being a sports bar (we are not sports fans).  The food was pretty good and the booze even better.Back to the review - It's a nice sports bar that manages to accomodate a plethora of sports fans with an insane number of TVs.  The hostess even asks which team you are trying to watch so that she can seat you accordingly.  Because we were there for the food, and not the sports, we were seated immediately and without hassle.  Luckily, we happened to sit near the TVs playing the Bills, so we payed a little bit of attention.You can order the wings by poundage - 1/2, 1, or 2 - not by number of wings, which was a little confusing for us.  We're used to ordering a dozen per person if it's the meal, half for an appetizer.  Because neither of us were overly hungry ,we ordered 1 pound medium with a side of hot.  What we got was 9 wings without sauce and a side of "hot sauce" for $9. That's right, $1 per wing.  I already felt hosed, but I was willing to forgive the price for the allegedly best wings in Phoenix.No sauce on the wings.  They were cooked crispy as we asked them to be, and they were somewhat meaty.  The side of "hot sauce" was a small container of gelatinous chili sauce, like the stuff they give to you at Asian restaurants. No flavor, just hot.Luckily, the Long Island Iced Tea was just as tasty as I remember, otherwise I would have left very unhappy.  I wouldn't make a point of going here for wings.  They aren't even as adequate as the "good" wings I've found in Phoenix.  But for all of you non-purists, they do have BBQ, Thai Peanut and other flavors.Oh yeah, I forgot about the statement on the menu that claims that separate checks "MASSIVELY" slows down the service. Really? Seriously?  This isn't a problem at many restaurants at which I have attended with a large group.  This isn't really conducive to a sports bar, as far as I'm concerned.  Wouldn't it be wonderful to meet a bunch of friends to watch your favorite team and not have to worry about separate checks "MASSIVELY" slowing down your service?  Don't try it here, they warn you against it before you even order food.This place confuses me.  You walk in, and think that this is a pretty decent sports bar.  Then you get up to go the bathroom, and see all the hidden rooms and lounge areas.  I don't understand it, is it for the people who get bucket of beer service?  Why do you need to section it off?  Is it a club later at night?Food was pricier than it should have been for a half-assed sports bar.  And there was no creativity in the menu, which there should be for the prices!  This place gets a pass.How I write Yelp reviews, by Andrew K. Fromaz. (this IS my real name. my real nom de plume)I start out by identifying an establishment I vaguely want to try, and finding an occasion or reason to go there.  In this case, a fellow Yelper Christina P set up a special Happy Hour event on a Friday at Half Moon Sports Grill on Highland.  I'd been to Half Moon before, and it was not exactly on my list of places to hurry back to and try again, for reasons which will gradually become evident...I get to the restaurant, and go in, briefly (if at all) taking note of the decor, the attitude of the staff I encounter along the way, the crowd, the music playing, occasionally the lighting... anything that jars or that i happen to notice that i like.  This is how I (and anyone else fortunate enough to have full use of their five senses) determine the "vibe" of a place.  Half Moon seems like a typical upper-tier sports bar, pleasant hostess, apparently clean, lots of big TVs, small booths...  Nothing not to like, honestly.  The "vibe" is that this is a pretty nice place.  I sit down and look over the menu, searching for anything that particularly catches my interest.  I'm not a picky eater, so usually I have a hard time narrowing it down to one thing.  The first time I was here, I was pretty hungry, so the blue cheese burger caught my eye.  On a more recent visit, appetizers were on Happy Hour so I tried a few of those.  Here's the bottom line.  None of it was very good.  Like, I would actively avoid eating any of the food again.  The pretzel, which was recommended, was dry inside and oily outside - like it had been coated with some form of fake butter.  The burger was only ok.  The boneless wings were the only thing that I would order again (I think we got medium?)Anyway, over the course of the visit I put together all of these impressions and write a review, usually deciding whether or not I'll return.  Sorry, Half Moon, I want to love you, but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.We came to Half Moon Sports Grill to watch the UFC Fight. It's a nice big place, yet we had to get there early since it filled up quick. The place is fun, the girls wear short skirts and knee socks. They have a full list of local beers in bottles and on draft. They boast a monthly special, which July's is a burger for 1/2 price if you buy a drink. That's almost $4.50 for a giant burger with fries. Unfortunately I was full from lunch and did some light snacking with my beer drinking. First up, I wanted the Watermelon Wheat - Perfect for any hot Arizona day (which is most of them) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#MrdXI7O_NSKVvqgGTcIYOAThen, the Dirty Guera Blonde Ale, because I love blonde ales and cute names. It was great and encouraged us to visit Nimbus the next day! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#5nzmTTMOmGj_sVIxkTM51QIn between, we ordered a couple appetizers, a gigantic pretzel that was served with both queso and mustard. I love to dipp! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#lMQuuVAuKQAL-RKfEYkPWg And my guy ordered the Prime Rib Sliders (4) served with carmalized onions, french dip sauce and horseradish. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#seP7cR-l6f3xjnJtzFQIxA That was a meal in itself, really. For Dessert, I ordered the White Chocolate Ale which was by far the most dessert tasting beers I have ever tried. It was so much like a sweet white chcolate, you really need to savor every sip. If you see this anywhere, order it and thank me later. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#1jzaMBgdEa9YyVasa8rukQAfter all that, I needed a couple sugar free Red Bulls to snap myself back in action. We had a fight to watch and I was not going to be the first to TAP OUT.This review is a 2.5 rounded up to a 3 now.I've been to this location a hand full of times.  This review is heavily weighted on my most recent experience.  I came here last Friday for a Yelper UYE to watch the Kitchen Nightmares Finale.   I hate to complain because I wasn't the organizer of the event, but a reservation was made for a group of folks to come out and watch the season finale of a TV show.  One would think that the room that was reserved would have a door, that could be closed, to quiet the noise of the restaurant so that the group could do what it came to do to, watch AND LISTEN to the TV program.  Unfortunately, our group could barely here the television because the "room" (actually a 3-sided space) we were in was separated from the rest of the restaurant by a partition that didn't close off the entire walkway into the cubby-hole-like space.  I don't think any of the fellow Yelpers at that table were happy with the space.  I ordered the calamari and it was a downer for me, a never repeat again'er.  I was so hungry after not eating all day that  I ate that calamari and the entire time, I wondered why did I order THAT dish! the only upside and bright spot was my cocktail.  I think it was called a dirty blue martini.  That  thing was delicious.Would I go back here, only if someone else is organizing something at this location and I had no say or influence in moving the venue.UPDATE: Their management told me that in the future they will no longer reserve that space for people interested in watching and hearing a TV program.  It might be ok for a sports show though, but not for what we were there for.  They have a different space that is quieter and more appropriate for watching a TV program.  That room was booked before the UYE was booked.  Hats of to their management for reaching out to me.If you like sports and Chicago grub then this is your place, period. Upon walking in, I immediately noticed the plentiful flat screens everywhere I turned. I must have counted 40 flat screen TVs. There are several sections of Half Moon Sports Grill, including a back room with a stage that would make for a good private event. I truly is the perfect location for a sports game. Besides the massive amounts of TVs and plenty of seating, Half Moon Sports Grill also has good food! Owned by Chicago natives, this is your one-stop-shop for Windy City eats. I've enjoyed their pizza, Italian Beefs and sausages, all of which are flavorful and filling. It's perfect food to enjoy while watching a sporting event and enjoying a beer or three. They have a spacious bar and sit-down seating, so you could either come with your family or come with friends.

Review Text :
I just love Greek food and the Fat Greek has my favorite item - the Gryo Plate.  Theirs come with a good amount of meat and we chose rice and salad.  Unlike another spot we have been too Fat Greek gives you a hearty amount of rice and salad each packed in their own container.      We also got sides of Gyro meat and the ever popular Athena Fries.  The fries were a delight and were devoured quickly.  The combination of spices and the two cheeses was so good.  The rice was very tasty and the salad was really good.  Fresh Romaine lettuce tomatoes, cucumbers and lots of feta.     I have eaten in and now taken out.  I think I prefer take out.  The dining room is basic and although clean has a tired look about it.  The lady who has taken our order isn't very friendly and lacks in her customer service skills.  I didn't take it personally and think it is just her demeanor.     So far Fat Greek is the best Greek place for Gyro's that i have found in Vegas.  In comparison to Sharma Plus you get near twice as much food for the same cost.  One thing that also stands out is the Tzatziki sauce is very good and plentiful.  A great price for a plentiful Gryo Plate.  I will definitely be back for my next Gyro fix!

Oh, how I missed the tofu soup and bulgogi combo in this cold weather.  The best combo deal you will find in a Korean Restaurant.  They have excellent dishes that will warm your body and your tummy.   My other favorites are bibmbap in the hot stone pot,  Korean BBQ, Chap Chae,  Sul Lung Tang, Mandoo Gook, Katsu plate (huge), and seafood pancake ( it should be an entree instead of an appetizer).  They offer excellent lunch specials for less than $6.00.This place was great!! As soon as you step in through the door you get indulged by all the wonderful BBQ smells and you also hear how others' in their table are cooking up their own meats and veggies!! What a great little spot it is!! I highly recommend it to all those BBQ lovers and Panda express fans!! This is much better and healthier too!! It was a good full that we got after consuming all our food and not a fatty full!!This restaurant is somewhat hidden in a strip mall across the street from ASU West. In the daytime it is hard to tell if it is open or closed, because the heavy tinting of the glass in front makes it hard to see what's inside. Inside, it is a cozy dining place with quaint chairs with backrests of polished diagonal sections of tree trunks. The service is friendly, the food items priced par for the course for Korean food (moderate, not inexpensive), and the food quality is good. I really enjoy their kalbi and bulgogi, especially when made into ssam (lettuce wraps). The banchan is adequate and flavorful, though the kimchi is quite mild - perhaps the heat is toned down for American tastes. And their lunch specials are a good and relatively inexpensive way to get  fast food, Korean style.This restaurant continues to be my go to spot for Korean BBQ since my review a couple of years ago. Every time we go, the restaurant is steadily full with a wide variety of patrons. You can choose to cook at the table or have them cook for you. Usually we opt to cook at the table but a few nights ago, we decided to have them cook it for us. Same price. Usually, we opt for the $30 combo that has the daegi bulgogi, dalk gui, and the Kalbi. If I said it right, it is the spicy pork, chicken, and short ribs. That is more than plenty for the 3 of us...leftovers are the best! This last time, we each ordered a spicy pork plate at $13 each (my favorite and I don't really eat spicy food). I felt like we looked like gluttons when the food came out. Very good portions. I also love the panckak (sp?) they bring out with various items to enjoy with your meal. My 5 year old demolished the white radishes and I had to fight her over the bean sprouts. So good. As always the service is friendly and attentive. I have been to other Korean BBQs where if you aren't in the same culture, you aren't treated the same. Not so with CGJ. I always enjoy my meal here. Inexpensive and delicious food.Love this place. We've dined in several times for lunch/dinner and have also ordered takeout many, many times. Great selection of hot dishes (our go to is always the daeji bulgogi) appetizers and a wide variety of sushi offerings. Our faves include the sonoran roll, mango pop and the gangster. They have a decent sake (hot and cold) and beer selection. They also have happy hour specials that run all day during the week.If you dine in during lunch, take advantage of their amazing lunch specials. Two people can easily share a combo (choice of meat with sides and a 6 piece roll) and walk away happy. Also, the majority of tables have a grill in the center so you have the option of grilling your own meat if you'd like. Always fun for a date night or with a group of friends! They have a full bar (about 10 stools) and a sushi bar (both with televisions) and can accommodate large parties. Staff has always been friendly and helpful in explaining the menu (much of which is in korean).Best thing about this place is they are open late. Real late. 1 am M-Th 2am Fri and Sat and 11 pm on Sunday. Need a late night fix? This is the spot. And again, get the daeji bulgogi. You will not be disappointed.

Review Text :
When someone says brunch, I'm expecting a combination of breakfast and lunch items.  No such luck here.  I found no breakfast items awaiting me.  The only redeeming factor...prime rib.  You don't have to wait til 4pm when the dinner crowd start to wander in.  You can have it early.  And you can have it the way you want it...rare, medium, thick, thin, etc.  Pair this with the spicy fresh horseradish and you've got a clear brunch winner.  Or have it with a side of bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and a grilled lamb steak...I did, along with a plate of peeled shrimp.Now jumping back to Las Vegas!  City of Sin!  (FOOD! FOOD! FOOD!)  Sometimes I do feel very guilty for eating all that food while I'm in town.... hmmmm....ok.. I'm over my guilt!  What's next?The next up is the Bayside Buffet in Mandalay bay!I'm sort of surprised by some of the so so reviews for this place because every time I've been here whether it's just 2 people or a party of 6+, we've always had great meals.  Although I can understand that buffets starts to look all the same after a while but still, you can taste if the food is done right or not and that should be the main focus of the reviews.  So here is what we've had... (it's a party of 5 this time around for lunch!)Salad:  Little disappointed this time around because they had the bomb spinach salad... it's now nowhere to be found but just make your own salad.  Oh well, that shouldn't be my main focus anyway.Pizza:  Decided to try the BBQ chicken.  Very comparable to CPK's BBQ except it doesn't have all the onions and other little veggie groups like CPK, but still it was tasty.  Hot meat section:  Unlike other buffets where eat stations are named differently, I don't recall there was a name to each of the areas but just simply a wrapped around line of food, so I'll call it the "hot meat section!"  Osso Buco was extremely tender and the flank steak was actually moist and soft!  No dry at all!  Then they had this thick piece of beef (can't recall what it was now) but it literally was so soft that by using you fork you can make it flake off from the entire piece of meat!  Everyone in the group was very much raving about this.  (I think it was part of the shank which is why it's so juicy and soft!)  Then the typical prime rib, ham, etc...Custom pasta station:  A chef is behind 4 stoves with all the toppings you would want on your pasta served with I believe 3 different sauces (Alfredo, Marinara, and olive oil)  Very fresh and delicious looking, but I passed on the carbs to move to bigger and better things... Hot Seafood Section:  Some typical Salmon, fried shrimp, steam halibut, etc.  Everything was decent and tasty, but nothing to get too crazy about except for the battered shrimp.  It was fried to perfection and each of them are XXL sized shrimp!  So you really get to have the shrimp instead of having the breading just like many other places.Ethnic food section:  For some reason wasn't too into this today.... so passed on the Chinese/Mexican/Japanese fare with the exception of having couple pieces of sushi (California roll actually tasted good with fresh rice because some of the sushi in Vegas had Costco-like rice which is really nasty.. so it's refreshing to see at least this buffet is having good rice even though it's not a sushi restaurant)Dessert section:  My only gripe about this dessert is that it didn't offer much of a ice cream selection.  However, they did have this trio of sugar-free purees (tiramisu, Hazelnut, Pastachio)  All were absolutely wonderful tasting with right amount of creaminess and right amount of aroma infused into them.... since they were small so I had like 6 of them!  LOL!  But dessert could be little better than others on the strip for a hotel such as Mandalay bay hosting this buffet.Final Verdict:  Everyone still enjoyed this buffet and again I had no complaints.  I did however had less than usual because I took many small samples of it all and wasn't too hungry at that moment..  (I'm sure you all probably thinks I'm crazy now!  LOL!  Like.. what's up with this guy?  Does he have an endless stomach talkin' about that's not much food?  LOL!)  But Bayside Buffet is still one of the more enjoyable buffets on the strip if you ask me!  (Also, while you are at the casino, make sure you take a nice deep breath of coconut air!  Just stay away from the more smoky part of the casino.  It's actually pretty refreshing!)WATCH YOUR RECEIPT!!!Be wary about the receipt you leave at the table before getting your food as someone might take it and use it for themselves!This just happened to us this morning. 10AM 12-24-11 Table at the end of buffet line.After being seated, my wife and I went to get food and left our server copy receipt on the table. When we returned, we found another couple sitting at our table. I was polite and told them we were sitting there and we had spread the tablecloth and silverware out to make it look occupied. I had assumed the waiter took the receipt for our drinks and assumed a couple was sat at our table in error.Since I couldn't find the waiter, I had to find another waitress that someone was sitting in our seat and was told by said waitress that she needed to see my receipt. I told them I thought the waiter took it, was trying to find him, and that some couple was seated our table.While complaining to that waitress, my wife approaches our original table and is wondering why some other couple is sitting at our table. While trying to call me, she sees the lady at the table ripping up our receipt. My wife grabs it from her and the lady glares at her. I went back to try and take a picture of the couple, but they had already been asked to leave. Luckily, we got our receipt with our name and room number back. My wife and I assume that this is probably not the first time this couple has done this and that there are probably more that know about this and do it also. Next time we figured one of us would have to stay at the table, while the other got food. We thought the food was ok, but the ambiance was sucked. Food was definitely not worth having to quarrel and hassle over. In Vegas, it's just one of those hard luck stories. It's just that who woulda thought it would be at the buffet and not on the casino floor?Mehhhhhhhh is all I have to say about this place.I'm here on a Saturday brunch time and the place is kinda full but the food? I can say 95% of the food was bad. And the other 5% was DECENT. My goodness. I even went for foods that I normally don't eat in hopes that they would taste a little BETTER than the rest. Nope. Bad decision.I tried to give them another chance and went for the dessert section. I am a MAJOR dessert person, and there is no way that you can mess up COOKIES. yup. They did. Never stepping foot into here again. Even if it was a comped meal.I hate the word buffet and I really hate the concept of a buffet but sometime I get roped into attending one of the feeding frenzies, but it's never my first choice. I will admit this isn't you're typical buffet but there's still the possibility that you will over eat if you don't show a little restraint. So what exactly does $32.95 get you, for one it gives you a choice to choose wisely or just be plain stupid. I usually like to do a tour before making my selections, the first thing I noticed was that all the serving dishes are small this is an added measure taken to protect the interest of The Bayside Buffet's owners but also protects you from yourself. I always go for the carving stations and this buffet not only had plenty of those options but the quality was pretty good as well. My first plate held my prime rib, sliced turkey and a fried chicken breast and to be honest I loved every bite and could have stopped there but the trays of food were calling my name even though I chose to sit at a table as far away from the mounts of food as possible. My second plate was for the sushi and a few steamed dumplings and a few pieces of cheese. The most satisfying part of attending this buffet was the fact that I was able to avoid the cakes, pies, and cookies and even walked away from the donuts.FOOD: A-ok food. Ox tail was good. Chicken noodle soup had no chicken and no noodles! Broth was good I admit but only had celery and carrots. Mashed potatoes tasted weird I would pass on that. Corn on Cobb tasted very watery overcooked. DESSERTS: Desserts we're ok they have some sugar free options and soft serve frozen yogurt machine.PAYMENT: Best part was when you walk in you can pay with credit card at a self serve kiosk! What a great idea to help make the line move faster. We were there it had no line so I'm sure the kiosks helped with that. You can choose to add tip when you pay or choose to leave tip at the table. STAFF: Staff come by and clear away your plates in a timely manner so your table stays clean for the most part.

Review Text :
Pekara's got a hippie sort of charm that I'm down for, and some DELICIOUS sandwiches.  Yes, the caps are necessary.  The best part?  They serve coffee in a series of mismatched store-owned mugs.  That makes me very happy, and it's far less wasteful than say a Starbucks which would just make a thousand disposable goods.I did get elbowed aside by a pushy older Caucasian gentleman who then glared at me for half of my coffee experience, but his class privilege is not the fault of Pekara (or is it....!?), so no stars lost there.I like you Pekara, and I see you and I having a delicious sandwichy future.Pekara has recently become my go-to spot if I want to spend a few hours sitting downtown. The coffee is good, the service is friendly, and there's a great selection of food whether you are looking for a snack, a meal, or something sweet.The crepes and the omelets here are outstanding! Especially the vegetarian options. And all the pastries and baked-good I've had are delicious.There are a few tables out front and a patio in the back if you want to sit outside. In the back, they have a couch and an armchair and a taller table that works well for small groups.The only weird thing is that they don't bring cutlery out when you order the food so unless you think ahead, you have to walk back over to the counter. Not a big deal, but it would be a nice thing for them to do.

Review Text :
Around the corner and down the road from my new place is the bestest sushi place!! Very mom and pop... if mom and pop were into lime green and sleek contemporary decor. Very clean and kinda ackwardly set up, Cafe Wasabi reminds me of Subway... except this is really fresh! I've had the Hawaiian Roll and the Rainbow Roll - both were really good as was the Orange shrimp roll. The nigiri is good - but then again, nigiri is always good. :) Along the counter's sneeze guard are pictures and descriptions of the various rolls available. Some look too exotic to try and others are regular standbys. I can see first timers getting squeemish when they see them on display. One cool touch is the maaaany empty sake bottles that are decorated by the lucky souls that drank them. I have yet to try one myself - but the bottles on the shelves and counter sure look cute.The sushi is good, I never had any stomach problems after eating there and I always leave there happy I came and promising myself that next time I'll try the green tea ice cream... i would - but I'm always too full!!

Review Text :
3.5 starsI thought I'd treat my man to Sensi because we're both represented on the menu. They've got a little bit of Italian, a little bit of Asian, and a little bit of American. Oh, and they've got seafood too, which we both love.While everything on the menu sounded amazing, we decided to go for the pan roasted halibut and Sensi's braised beef short ribs. Presentation was beautiful, but I wasn't completely blown away. For $$$$, I was expecting to have the best foodgasm ever, but I didn't even have one. Service was top notch, and everything else about this place was exquisite. And what a gorgeous place! The open kitchen is the center of attention here. We were seated near the lobster tank, but thankfully, I didn't see or hear any lobsters being cooked. If I come back again, I'll give their prix-fixe menu a try. Seems that would be the best way to go here.This pertains to the Restaurant Week 2010 menu.The Skinny: great fusion asian cuisine and lovin' the bread service (4) service: efficient, prompt and friendly - I want to take the naan guy home!(4.5) value: for 50.10, it's not bad for a fine dining experience but the ethnic food is likely cheaper somewhere else(3).We've been wanting to try Sensi ever since we had their tasting at Taste of the Nation. My hubby was hesitant - he's not that into East Indian, Vietnamese and Thai flavours (except Pad see-uw... excuse the spelling).We love the dining room here. The view of the kitchens accompanied by flowing water everywhere, the design is truly lovely.Anyway, we ordered fried shrimp with citrus, market mixed green salad, butter chicken, skirtsteak with green papaya salad.But first, let's start out with bread service. Bread service consists of papadums and handmade naan out of a two real clay ovens installed in the kitchens. Although it didn't have quite the same elasticity and crispiness of the best naan I've ever had, it was still pretty darn good. Adding the tomato chutney, I just wanted to take the lovely East Indian naan-making gentleman home with me. (He's really nice - when we made hand signals of how much we like his naan - he sent out another fresh basket for us!)The fried shrimp was satisfyingly crisp and well seasoned. The market salad was equally pleasurable with the hint of bitterness of the lettuces and acidity from the citrus. Very well balanced dishes.I thoroughly enjoyed the grilled marinated skirtsteak (right amount of char) and nicely spiced accompanying green papaya salad. The green papaya was shaved so delicately, it looked like glass noodles. Wonderful flavour and textures. The butter chicken was nice along with the rice but it wasn't extraordinary.Dessert was okay but not exceptional. The chocolate temptation dessert was overly sweet while the caramel ice cream had a very heavy burnt sugar flavouring to it. The tapioca pudding was rather flavourless when paired with that wonderful mango lassi and coconut ice cream.Value wise, you can likely find each individual components for less else where (I'm sure you can get a decent butter chicken or green papaya salad for less than $50/person). However the service is wonderful and the ambience is amazing.I would say normally, this place would deserve a 3.5 star. However in light of the exceptional bread service, I'm bumping it up to a 4 star review.The Better Half and I decided to give this joint a try.  We'd heard about it and saw the favorable reviews on Yelp.  Unfortunately, the experience didn't match our expectations.  Here's why:- The waiter took forever to take our drink order....we seriously could have drank a glass of Wine in the amount of time it took him to come by.  One thing I hate is having to wait for my Wine!- He screwed up our order and forgot my side order of Bacon Fried Rice.  I was looking forward to trying it because it sounded sooo good.  But when it didn't come out with the entrees, I didn't want to have to eat it by itself.- The serving of the Salad was mistimed and the entrees came out before we were finished with our Salad and Appetizers.....we felt rushed.We ordered:SONOMA FOIE GRASCHERRY PRESERVE, $25http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A?select=2VpoayF-8SBISGf7cIwHpwPECORINO GNOCCHISACRAMENTO DELTA ASPARAGUS.

I enjoyed the Gnocchi very much and the Filet was juicy and cooked just right.  I tried a bit of TBH's Pad Thai, and it was pretty good.Overall, the food was great, but the service sucked.  We watched other tables and noticed slow service as well with the other servers.  This place has a long way to go.Return Factor - 50%We had an amazing one year anniversary dinner here!  I made reservations a few months in advance, since the Virtuoso Conference was taking place at Bellagio this week, and the restaurant closes for renovations next week.  Sporting my new necklace, aptly named the Showstopper, Eric R. escorted me to the beautiful Sensi restaurant.  We had Chef Ellamar's food before at a Project Dinner Table a few years ago, but had never been in the restaurant.  I also knew before ever entering that this is one of the most beautiful restaurants in terms of design.  We were seated in a beautiful room at a table facing the glass kitchen - what a great view!Immediately, Sanae, the Head Sommelier, brought us Gruet champagne as a celebratory gesture for our anniversary.  We almost had visited Gruet winery in Albuquerque on Monday, but ran out of time!  I decided to go with the tasting menu, and Eric R. decided to go a la carte.  He ordered the Roll Call appetizer, with a sample of each sushi roll (trout, salmon, tuna, and lobster), and the halibut with corn risotto and charred tomato vinaigrette.  My selections on the tasting menu included the kusshi oyster with ponzu and sriracha, roasted octopus, the Thai diver scallop with jasmine rice and bok choy, kalbi marinated kobe flat iron steak with bone marrow and kimchi with mashed potato, and strawberry shortcake with basil.Our server (I believe his name is Lawrence) was great.  He promised to alternate my courses with Eric's so we could have food at all times and sample each other's.  First, we received the famous bread basket with naan, papadums, cucumber raita, and tomato chutney.  As I anticipated from Misti Y.'s and Bobby Y.'s reviews, we were addicted to the tomato chutney...and refilled the chutney and the basket!  Then, the chef generously sent out oysters for each of us though only I was supposed to get one.  The kusshi are small and flavorful and the sauce was perfect!  Who doesn't love ponzu?  So fresh!  Sanae helped us choose a wine for the meal.  We split a glass of white from Santorini Greece that she recommended, and it was flavorful and easy to drink.Then Eric received his roll call.  He let me try a bite of one with ikura but I wanted him to enjoy his appetizer, which he definitely did.  He loved the tuna roll.  Next, I received my roasted octopus, adorned with fried capers, roasted red pepper, roasted potatoes, and strands of radicchio.  I love grilled octopus and roasted did not disappoint.  The restaurant generously provided potstickers also, which Eric enjoyed.  Then I received my scallop, which had a chile paste flavor (which I love), delicious charred haricort vert, and bok choy with radish sprouts.  The scallop was HUGE and perfectly cooked.  Then, Eric received his halbut (perfectly cooked also) and it was delicious and moist.Next I got my steak which was presented beautifully and secretly pre-sliced which made my life easier!  It was very tasty.  We were so full so we got what was left to go, knowing dessert was next.  Besides my shortcake, the restaurant gave us three other treats: donuts, raspberry-rhubarb mousse, and a chocolate caramel dessert.  Wow!  We were so full.  Then our server gave us chocolates and told us the meal was taken care of already by someone else!  It turns out my parents arranged with Sensi to surprise us!  It was such a shock - we were so surprised.  What a delicious and special experience to cap off a year of wedded bliss!  Thanks to Sensi, especially the manager, sommelier Sanae, our server Lawrence, and Chef Ellamar...and my parents!The best dining experience during my last trip to Las Vegas was here at Sensi.  Everything from the food, service, and ambiance was just simply awesome!Sensi is a little hard to spot inside Bellagio.  You don't really notice any signage for it on the casino floor and I even asked one waitress where it was and she had no idea!  Just keep walking past the Conservatory of Flowers and Jean Phillippe Patisserie and you'll find it!The layout of the restaurant is pretty cool in that all of the kitchen stations are visible in the middle of the dining room showing all diners all the action behind the kitchen.http://bit.ly/11E6B4CI've done some research before my trip and already knew what I was getting, which were the Roll Call, which is a sampler of all their Sensi Rolls, and their Famous Wok LobsterRoll Call - Sensi Roll Sampler -- http://bit.ly/ZgsTuzTataki Roll - seared spicy tuna roll, tuna tartare, miso ponzuTLC Roll - tempura lobster & crab, whipped avocado, chili aioliIda Roll - smoked idaho trout, horseradish white soyGreen Roll - jumbo asparagus, roasted shiitakes.I totally enjoyed each roll but I'd have to say my fave was definitely the Tataki Roll.  It was so creamy and delicate and had a nice solid flavor with the tuna and ponzu.  This made for a great appetizer and is a great offering if you can't decide which Sensi Roll to get.  Each piece is a pretty substantial size.Famous Wok Lobster --  http://bit.ly/11dulIcChili & licorice glaze, baby bok choy, fried shallots.OMG!!  It was exactly like the how the pictures were with the interesting plating of the lobster.  This was amazing and the lobster was cooked perfectly.I wasn't too sure if I was going to order dessert but after seeing their dessert menu on their iPad, I was definitely tempted and settled with their Signature Tapioca Puddinghttp://bit.ly/14RPb2dSignature Tapioca Pudding with Mango Lassi and Coconut Sorbet -- http://bit.ly/11duonkThis was a pretty heavy dessert with a lot going on.  And everything was delicious!  Probably the best part though was the Coconut Sorbet.  It was so good!  This was a good dessert to finish off my meal since it had right amount of sweetness to counter the savory lobster taste.After an awesome experience like this, I'm definitely going to consider coming back here again.  It certainly lives up to the high standards of Bellagio's restaurant collection.CELEBRATINGFor the past three birthday celebrations, it has been at Sensi with Executive Royden Ellamar ( Hilo). I normally let him do his thing. This time it's his tasting menu with the following:- Oyster with ponzu sauce (extraordinary)- Heirloom Tomato,heirloom melon, burrata cheese with balsamic vinegar- Shrimp two ways (sorry bad photo)- Chimichurri with ponzu sauce (afterwards nothing but a clean plate)- Octopus salad with aioli (sexy and delicious)- Ricotta cheese ravioli with bacon and peas sauce with butter (delightful)- Halibut with shellfish risotto (moist and perfection)- Miso based salmon with vegetables (PNW connection)- Goat with Polenta (slow cooked and viciously eaten)- Lamp Chop with vegetables (lamb lover's dream)Dessert (no dessert tree this time)- Ice Bubble filled with Lemon, Coconut and Mango - Peaches and Creams- Coffee Mousses and Donuts (Malasadas)Congratulations to Chef Ellamar who is not only one LAS top ten best chef but also achieved national acclaim by winning top chef award on food network's "Chopped" February 2013. Didn't realize that Sensi traditionally closes for vacation for fourteen days during the latter half of August plus the last week of November into the first week of December. It so happens that our dinner is during the first day back from vacation.  Unfortunately, Yu-go chauffeur's BD is on a day they'll be closed during the first part of December.I was thinking this review needed a title, but I couldn't decide on just one.  Instead, pick your favorite of the following two:"My Evening at Sensi"    --- or ---"Attack of the Insane Drunk Ladies"Now that I have that squared away, onto the review!  I had reservations for 1 on Saturday night at Sensi at the Bellagio.  Since I was flying solo, I decided to sit at the bar, which was stylish and contemporary, with lots of granite and dark woods and a waterfall.  Unfortunately, in contrast to the other high-end restaurants in the Bellagio, Sensi doesn't have any walls or doors or other barriers separating the interior of the restaurant from the foot traffic and general pandemonium happening in the common areas -- so my hopes for a serene dinner were dashed before I even started eating.After ordering a Sauvignon blanc (excellent!) and noshing on the complementary breadbasket of naan and curry-flavored chips, I decided dinner would be the "Taste of Sensi" tasting menu.  Here's the rundown:AMUSE BOUCHESalmon cracker with nori crisps, kaffir smoked salmon, and wasabi avocado.  Lovely presentation, but far too salty/briny for my taste.  Not enjoyable.COURSE #1Roasted octopus with chorizo, fingerling potatoes, arugula salad, egg yolk, and squid ink aioli.  Similar to the amuse bouche, this dish was beautiful to look at, but all I could taste was salt.  I picked it at, but didn't finish it.COURSE #2Alaskan halibut with fennel, sweet corn, broken rice, asparagus, and peas.  Hands down my favorite dish of the night.  The halibut was cooked to perfection, and I loved the texture of the intermingled broken rice, corn, and peas.COURSE #3"Tongue & Cheek" -- braised veal cheeks, smoked Wagyu beef tongue, potato puree, and red wine reduction.  Great flavors and beautifully cooked meats, but I was a bit blind-sided by the enormous portion of very rich ingredients, which seemed out of place in a tasting menu sequence.  I guess I can't complain about too much of a good thing, right?DESSERTGreek yogurt panna cotta with honey gelee and blackberry coulis.  SIlky smooth but overwhelmingly sweet.  A few bites and the sugar rush became too much to handle.While the food was a mixed bag, the real "highlight" of the evening (if you can call it that) was being accosted by a pair of insane drunk ladies** (IDLs) who stumbled in from the casino, sat down next to me, GRABBED MY UTENSILS OUT OF MY HANDS, and helped themselves to my food.  Jeeeeeezus H. Christ!I begged and pleaded with the bartender to do something about the IDLs, but he shrugged and did a whole lot of nothing.  Eventually the IDLs got bored of me and moved on to greener pastures...but my appetite was mostly ruined at that point.  I was hoping the bartender could comp at least part of my meal that had been rendered inedible by the IDLs' creeper-germs, but he refused.  Instead, he poured me a free glass of Sauvignon blanc in a to-go cup, which was a nice gesture, but nowhere near enough to make up for a spoiled dinner.  Needless to say, I quickly paid my check and got the hell out of there.And thus ends my tale of Sensi -- possibly the strangest and randomest experience I've ever had as a solo diner in Vegas (or anywhere else).  -----**Footnote: I didn't call them ladies at the time.  I used a much less family-friendly term... You can probably guess what it was.We recently celebrated our anniversary and spur of the moment picked Sensi as our dining destination of the night. I've had this establishment bookmarked for quite some time, and it appears there was a time during which this place was missing the mark. I am glad that it wasn't the case in this instance. We had a reservation for 9:15pm, arrived a bit early and sat at the bar while waiting for our table. As far as Vegas fine dining goes, I was not overly impressed by the design or the decor of this place. I like simplistic, but this was overly so and it looked like the furniture needed some updating. We were seated at 9pm and had a great view of the open kitchen. It reminded me of a fish tank.We opted for the chef's tasting menu ($85 per person) which is is very reasonable, especially for the quality of the food. Our server was great... he was like Beetlejuice -- appeared when we needed him, left us alone otherwise. We started off with a bread basket and two dipping sauces, one being of spicier variety to go with the naan bread that was served. It was a bit confusing to me and I wasn't sure how naan was tied into the whole theme of the menu, but I digress.My husband and I each ordered different things off the chef's tasting menu so that we can sample everything on it. In addition, we ordered half a dozen oysters and also Octopus Crostini which for me was by far the most underwhelming part of the meal. I thoroughly enjoyed the cauliflower soup, the scallop was cooked to PERFECTION and to me scallops are the ultimate test of one's culinary prowess, Tongue & Cheek was packed with flavor and the Hanger Steak was juicy and cooked to perfection.My only complaint is that toward the end of the evening, the meal spacing became way too long and I was starting to feel too full to enjoy my dessert (Greek Yogurt panna cotta). I think we were getting antsy to get dinner over with and continue on with our night.The bill was reasonable and the food as well as the service both hit the mark. I would highly recommend the chef's tasting menu.

Restaurant name  Lahaina Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
What happened Lahaina?Lahaina definitely took a step down since the last time I've been here.  I use to think Lahaina had some of the best food with decent prices.  The prices have since changed.  This place use to sport a 50% all day Happy Hour.  Now, it's only 10%.  I had their Yellow Tail Nigiri, Salmon Nigiri, Tempura Shrimp Roll, and Spicy Tuna Hand Roll.  I didn't think the food was that great.  Both nigiris were small and the fish didn't taste as fresh as other sushi joints out here.  The Tempura Shrimp Roll was actually ordered on accident.  I didn't realize that this was a deep fried roll.  I thought it had too much tempura, which took over the taste of the actual roll.  As for their hand roll, this was the only thing that was fairly sized, but the tuna had a paste type texture.  Taste wasn't that great either.  If there was anything good about the food, it's probably just the price.  Even though Lahaina no longer has the 50% Happy Hour, the prices for everything is still pretty cheap. One hand roll, two sushi rolls, and four nigiris cost about $30.  This is not bad at all.It's the ambiance of the place that takes the biggest plunge.  After 11 PM, this place becomes a 21 and over hang out.  I thought everyone looked and acted even younger to the point that Lahaina reminded me of a teen club.  The music is dialed up so loud that I could barely hear the conversation that I was having with my friend. Because of all this, Lahaina now attracts a bunch of the young cats that were up to no good.  While outside, I was even approached at least three times and asked if I was a cop.  I guess I have that look, but it's more paranoia from this kids if you ask me.  Overall, I can no longer suggest this place to friends or family.  In the past, this is where I shipped them.  Now with all the other options in Las Vegas, Lahaina sits at the bottom.  The one thing going for Lahaina is their bar and hours.  Other than that, I think I will pass on Lahaina.Went here for all-you-can-eat sushi, and the food was alright (but nothing to write home about). The service, however, was not up to par. The waitress was messy, spilling water on our sushi rolls and the sauce from the sushi onto me/my clothes and NOT apologizing after. She also forgot a majority of my orders (even though there was no one in the dining area) and really didn't do anything to make sure I got them.If I were you, I'd go to a different sushi bar or Hawaiian food place to get slightly better food and better service. It's a shame because the establishment looks pretty decent inside...

Review Text :
We wanted to stop somewhere close to the freeway to eat as we were about to leave Las Vegas on our way home to Los Angeles, We decided to head to the Palms assuming that they would have a good buffet to eat at. We discovered the Bistro Buffet, and decided to give it a try. The restaurant has a very nice look to it. It is modern in appearance, and has an upscale cafeteria feel about it. It is one of the smallest buffets that I have been to in Las Vegas, but getting seated was not an issue. The food was not very good. Most of it was cold, and tasted as though it had been sitting around for hours. Condiments were very hard to find, and the whole setup in general seemed disorganized. The one highlight from the food selection was the crab legs. They were fairly big and pre-cut to make them easier to peel open and eat. The other highlight of eating here was that the service was excellent. Our waiter kept our cups filled and cleared our dishes whenever we finished a plate. He was very accommodating and was able to help us with whatever we needed. The service made up a little bit for the food being sub par. Overall, the Bistro Buffet was a disappointment. The food just wasn't good. With so many other options in Vegas, I can't see any reason for me to eat here again.Let me tell you I am a huge fan of crab legs and like it a certain way.  I know there is a lot of lazy people out there that want to enjoy food with very little effort needed.  So let me just get this off my chest, I HATE WHEN BUFFETS CUT THE LEGS IN HALF.  Not only is the meat cold by the time you get back to the table but they are dried up.  The only way to eat crab legs is keeping them whole and cracking them yourself.  I know what people are thinking......"I hate cold crab legs and that is the only time they are whole".  WRONG.  AT the bistro buffet you get the whole cold crab legs and hand them to the cook.  He then will steam them for about 1 minute and the result.....perfect hot crab legs that I miss so much.  Well done bistro buffet. In addition to the crab legs all the other food is amazing and cooked perfect.  The selection is huge and I would highly recommend this buffet before some of the other expensive ones.On a side note, always be aware of your surroundings for dangerous crab leg crackers.  Its very easy to get shot in the face by some crab meat.  Its happened to me many times.  My girlfriend has gotten the best distance I've ever seen.  She cracked a leg and meat shot sideways over this guys head about 5 feet and he had no idea this happened.  I spit my wine out of my mouth because it was so funny.  SEE it can be so much fun eating food :)Per Mandi L.'s suggestion we purchased a Travel Zoo voucher good for 2 people for $35 for any night of the week at the Bistro Buffet.. She had raved about the crab legs so we made sure to come hungry! No wait on a Saturday at 6pm so in we went to join her table... The buffet is small and so the selections are few compared to other buffets but man I was impressed with the seafood selection.. They have shrimp, oysters and cold crab legs in the salad section.. The line may look long but it moves pretty fast.. While waiting in line the chefs offer the option of hot crab legs.. I definitely recommend this because they do not skimp on the amount of yummy crab legs they fill your plate with and it saves you the time of having to sort through the cold crab legs. They also have crawfish, mussels, salmon and many other seafood options.. AYCD beer and wine are also included with your meal and we definitely took advantage of the white wine!Con: Dessert section is limited.. HOT TIP: Fridays and Saturdays are their seafood nightsYou like to drink? How about unlimited mimosas and crab legs? Cheap food for a cheap price, this is exactly what is advertised. At $21.99, you get what you pay : unlimited mimosas, crab legs and omelettes made to order. The rest of the food was ok, but some of it was really bland. The desserts were so pretty, but again, they didn't taste great. The buffet's Chinese food was good and cauliflower cheese bake was delicious! Service was superb because they were very nice, and they kept the drinks rolling. They were happy to take photos for us and do it with making us smile. If you want high-quality food you came to the wrong buffet. Those buffets are usually $40-$50 and can be found at places like Bellagio or Caesars Palace. However, this was perfect for us because the price was cheap and they provided exactly what we wanted, basic buffet food and some sweet drinks. If this buffet was priced any higher, it wouldn't have been worth it.

I came for happy hour and I love their happy hour menu! Certain menu items and sushi is 50% and 30% off. And on Sundays the happy hour goes on from open until closing. They also have buy 2 get 1 free sake or beer.The decor is pretty cute,  and I really think the service is ok. It's a hit or miss sometimes here (I just don't think talking politics to your customers is professional.)I love most of their specialty rolls here are good. They're not as fresh as some of the other restaurants I've been to. Here are my suggestions for sushi choices:RAINBOW ROLLHAPPY ENDING ROLLWET DREAM ROLLJALAPENO ROLL007 ROLLTIGER ROLL**most of these are offered during HH. Also, don't forget to have an order of muscles while you're there! As far as AYCE sushi though, I'd pass on it. I'd prefer to spend my AYCE time on a more extensive menu (and a bigger dessert menu).

5 plus stars for decor ..I am a sucker for that whole post modern retro  vintage look...  Love it. I  love the John Deer Tractor in the dining room and the old wood everywhere , I love that it still looks like a store front and has a rich red paint on the inside .I love the cafeteria style serving with the old fashioned look to it. I even adore the old retro sodas in a tin. But I have to say 3 stars for food . The ribs did not have the flavor that I crave  with ribs. I  see  and smell the smokiness,but there was almost too much sweetness with the overbearing sauce, it was nice but not delicious.  The coleslaw tasted like they ran down to Smart and Final and bought the big bag of coleslaw mix and the jar of coleslaw dressing ..boring and bland.  The mac and cheese however was super  yummo. Baked with a cheesy crunchy top that made it  comfort food. I also really like the cornbread, not too sweet not too bland  and honey butter very delish. We also had an interesting dessert Sweet potato crunch that I am still pondering  a mash of sweet potato with a creamy texture with a bit of nuts and brown sugar. Ice Cream cut the richness . I want to adore Joes ,I want to say it's an all around winner . i want to sit in the restaurant and enjoy the decor, but maybe I 'll go for the cornbread. Hey Parents--The kids menu is a rib sandwich ...which wouldn't have been a hit with my kiddo....I really wanted BBQ last night, and wanted to try something new and different. Came on Yelp and found this place.  Its in a cute little part of Gilbert, and around several other resturants in a nice part of town. Parked my car and went inside.  I loved the decor!!  OMG!  HUGE, spacious, very open and pleasantly decorated.  Plenty of seating!  Menu is front and center, and very easy to read and make sense of.  You have several options and dishes to chose from...I went for the small selection of the Beef Brisket in sauce, with 2 sides.  I did the beans and corn.  They also have a little station in the middle with BBQ sauce, onions, peppers and such.  The line itself kind of has a boston market feel to it.  You grab a tray, and place your order with the gal behind the glass.  She scoops your food for you, and passes it underneath the glass.  Take your food to the end of the line, pay, and there you are.  They have 3 different seating areas.  In the resturant they have seating, with booths and benches.  The second seating area is picnic tables in an air conditioned garage type area.  You actually have to go through a set of doors and sort of leave the resturant to get to this part.  The third seating area is picnic tables competely outside....no covering, no AC.  yea.  Not for me.  I like eating indoors!I would return to this place, but my only true complaint is the drink station.  In order to refill your drink, you must cut back into the line to get to the drink station.  BAD IDEA!  I can see people getting fussy and annoyed and think your taking cuts when your really just trying to get more Dr. Pepper.   They need to have a second station somewhere so people can refill their beverages and NOT cut back into the food line to do so!  Big pain in the butt, and I docked them a full star for it.  This place is plenty big enough to throw a second beverage station somewhere in the layout of the store.I will return here for eating again, as I did enjoy my experience.

I dunno if I have horrible taste or if everyone else is wrong, but the decor in this place is RIGHT UP MY ALLEY!  It's a cross between trips to grandma's house for some cookies, and... well... a trip to my OTHER grandma's house for some cookies. Except, you see, they don't ONLY have cookies. Oh No! They have sammiches!  Mass varieties of them. Types of sammiches your granny wouldn't dare to build for you on a sunday afternoon.My buddy, Groovy P, and myself have been here on two separate occasions, and I also took my wife here once! I know, I know... I spoil her sometimes. Let me tell you, if you want to taste some of the BEST pasta salad on this good brown earth, order the seafood pasta salad.  You won't be sorry.  That is, of course, unless you are allergic to seafood.The roast beef sammich is sometimes on special here, so that is what I usually get.  Watch out! If you underestimate this one you WILL be sorry. A single bite into this unearthly delight and I lose all control of myself.Pair these two items with a drink and a pickle and you will be going back to work a pleasure ravaged ball of contentment. Hey! Grammy never gave me a pickle with my sammich! What was I missing!P.S. They have drive thru!After driving by Pugzies numerous times over the past few years, and hearing about their tuna salad from Sarah G, I finally made my way inside this family-owned institution for lunch with friends earlier this week...I checked it out online first and learned that Pugzie's has been in business since 1981 - they must be doing something right!  Pretty impressive...When I arrived, I debated on what to get... I ended up doing a lunch combo with a half turkey sandwich on 12grain bread - (it's prepared to order but comes with provolone cheese, mayonnaise, tomatoes, lettuce, sprouts and I added avocado for an extra 50 cents) and a cup of tomato soup.  It came with a pickle as well.  With a bottle of water, my total bill was around $9 - not bad.The staff at Pugzie's were friendly and quick.  It's cafeteria style but their food is fresh and much more appealing than an actual cafeteria... I'll have to go back to try some of their other menu items and perhaps keep them in mind for catering in the future as well.It may not be much on atmosphere, but go to Pugzie's for a quality, affordable lunch and support this long time local business!Time for an update...I must've been in a generous mood when I wrote my original Pugzie's review.  I've been back a couple of times, and I'm still a fan - it's "A-OK" or worthy of 3 stars in Yelp terms.All 3 of those stars are for the food... the ambiance, bathrooms, service, etc... are just eh.This is not a gourmet eatery... it's more the place you would go to when in a hurry or just need some nourishment of sorts and don't care much about atmosphere.  I'm sure I'll be back, but it's for sure not making my top ten favorite lunch place list anytime soon!  But kudos to Pugzie's for their history (they've been in business since 1981) - and as I said, I'll for sure return on occasion - it just won't be a regular in my lunchtime rotation!I don't like sandwiches.  It's not that I don't want the carbs from the bread.  I mean, if you do this thing called exercise, a sandwich once a month isn't going to kill you.Anyway, they get a star simply by having a vegetarian option.  It's made with feta, which added another star.  It's nothing spectacular, though.  Lettuce, tomato and chopped mushrooms with a light ranch dressing.  Meh.  The other star was for having 12-grain bread.  Hard to come by.It's pretty expensive for a freaking sandwich.  With tax, I paid $6.73.  For a sandwich.  No chips, no drink.  Just a sandwich.It's so close to work that I'll be back, just not often and not because I really crave Pugzie's.  It just beats Subway or Chompie's or Blimpie's is all.I feel sad to say this...because I know it is locally owned by a small family...but yucko!  I went there to lunch hesitantly, but my friend wanted to go there.  The place felt old and dirty, too big for too few people and too quiet.I had the egg salad sandwich.  It was bland and boring and served between two slices of stale white bread.My friend got a chicken salad and I could tell it was disgusting...she barely made her way through it.The ice tea was ok....but it was really disappointing and I fear it is on it's last leg unless some changes are made:(

Review Text :
I remember when they first opened years ago and I liked this place. They've expanded and remodeled the place. Along with that was a decline in the quality of their food. My friend and I shared a medium half everything, half pepperoni pizza and rainbow cookies. Pizza:What the heck happened to their crust? It was like eating a cracker - pale and flavorless. What the heck happened to the pizza? It's just not as good as the last time I've been here. I had to fix it by dousing it with hot sauce. 2/5Rainbow Cookies:When I think of rainbows, I think happy thoughts. I tried their rainbow cookies and I was hoping my trip to New York was soon enough so I can get the real deal. This brought me great disappointment. It was dry and tasted so artificial. Never again will I try rainbow cookies from this town if it's not from Bagel Cafe. 1/5I know all of the Rocco's around town get confused by other people thinking they are all the same restaurant and owners. They aren't. Please don't confuse this Rocco's with the one on Buffalo near Charleston because they don't have anything to do with each other. Walking in I noticed they have 2 sides. The right of the restaurant is for customers that are dining inside (they have an all you can eat buffet all day for $8.49 plus tax) and the left side is for placing and picking up to-go orders. The people working were very friendly. The lady who helped me went over the specials and told me what was most popular. I ordered the 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink special and waited for my order. The guy making pizzas took some slices and put them in the oven for reheating. He asked me how I was and was courteous. After he boxed up my slices I was on my way. 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink ($6.49) - The price threw me off a bit at first. It's kind of high compared to the average $4.99 - $5.99 cost for this type of common special at other pizza joints around town. Then I saw how big the pizza slices were and figured the price was actually on point so long as the pizza tasted good. Too bad the pizza didn't taste good. Yes, the slices are huge and I was impressed  by that, but just because the slices are huge doesn't mean the pizza is going to taste good. There was a good amount of cheese however it tasted rubbery and when I took the second bite all of the cheese came right off the top. The pizza lacked flavor and I didn't even eat the second slice. I gave this place a try and while the people working inside are very friendly, I have definitely experienced better pizza elsewhere.

Review Text :
Dick's has that special something - the allure of the secret spot, your proximity to food coaxed by open flame, the forced intimacy, the darkness on the edge of visibility... and booze.It's the food of Richardson's within a speakeasy atmosphere. Quirky rustic  ambiance served with a meaty, habanero kick. Great for an adventurous early date where you want to see if the other person "gets it", and to "get some" later if they do get it. And of course, an old reliable that you suddenly perk up and remember when you think you've run out of options for a great casual meal.Also, the private room/wine cellar is a great option for smallish family gatherings, company events and holiday parties. The reservation fee completely applies to the tab and the enivronment itself keeps the conversation moving.Don't ever change Dick's! (does that need a comma somewhere?)It's dark in there!Honestly, I walked in last Saturday and it was like trying to see where you are going right after you turn out the bathroom light at 2:00 am:)The last time I was at one of the Burning Embers/Richarsdson's Family of Restaurant offerings (Richardson's, Rokerij and Dick's Hideaway, as I understand it), I told myself I wouldn't be returning...I had listened to the boss (the owner?) screaming at an employee, over some error, for a solid 3-4 minutes as the Beautiful Carin and I tried to eat a nice dinner at Richardson's:(It was like watching Hell's Kitchen, up close and personal.And not what I expect in a dinner house, quasi fine dining establishment.However, I got roped into a post squash tournament group brunch/retox with my buddies from the Village.They all wanted to go to Dick's, so I was outvoted...I could have gone home, but that would have been impolite and no fun:)As I stumbled over the threshold trying to adjust my eyes from the arc welder intensity of the Phoenix noon hour, to the eerie dark wood, leather and no light world that is the Hideway, I told myself "well, I didn't darken their door again...the door was already darkened":)Would I have gone back on my own...even to score a coveted review for Yelp? I'm going to have to say "No"...Much as I love the spicy food and the New Mexican style of cooking, I was pretty sure that I would rather drive to Santa Fe for New Mexican style food than have dinner disturbed by a Gordon Ramsey wanna be again:(But you know something...I am not one to hold a grudge or to be "Donnie Downer" so let's start with some positives from the brunch the other day:* There was no screaming, whatsoever:)* The service was outstanding...no really, our server was excellent  and friendly, as well as knowledgeable and competent:)* They know how to make a pretty good vodka martini:)* They sure know where to find the peppers in the kitchen:)* The menu is reasonably creative:)On the other hand (oh, you knew it was coming...two stars...it couldn't be that everything was great)* The Carne Adovada and Eggs (the "signature" dish, as I understand it) was mediocre...the pork was pretty dry, the potatoes were a bit undercooked and I was frankly glad for the eggs and beans to put a little moisture back in the dish...the flavors were good, though and if the pork hadn't been dry and if the potatoes were done, I could see this dish being a solid choice:)* $25 for two vodka martini's on a Saturday afternoon...really? I don't like to complain about prices, generally, but this seems to be a stretch...these things were  1/2 the size of the marti's at oh, say AZ88, yet they cost more. That doesn't make me happy:(I just haven't had the best of luck with places named "Dick's" anything...Dickey's BBQ is just a pit and Dickie's Dog's apparently fed the wrong person a crappy hot dog one too many times and got fire bombs thrown through their front window for their trouble.The Richardson's Family of Restaurants has already had enough trouble along the fire front, so I certainly wish them the best with their restaurant activities.But I probably won't be back until the next time one of my buddies wants to drag me here again...or if I miss an episode of Hell's Kitchen and want to catch up:)Make whatever jokes you want about the name as if you're a homophobic 7th grade boy, but Dick's Hideaway has really got a great menu of American food.  Might not be a burger, fry, and shake diner, but New Mexican cuisine is American all the way, and as a matter of fact, among their many southwestern tinged dishes, they've got a superb thick, juicy burger, grilled up on an open flame right in front of you as you sit at the bar, with some great fries AND a nice full plate of dark green salad for somewhere around 11 bucks-ish (last I was aware).Probably my favorite breakfast spot. Depending on my mood, this is how it's done, eggs are either over easy or poached:Shrimp enchiladas -- red and green chileHuevos Rancheros  -- red and green chileCarne Adovada  -- red only Lately, it's been a lot of enchilada, though I feel the huevos rancheros starting a resurgence!Breakfast entrees are about $10 -12 and worth every penny.This review will reveal itself in...5....4....3...2...1...Consider finding this review the equivalent of finding the front door to Dick's Hideaway. This restaurant definitely lives up to its name. Everything about it is hidden! The front door? Don't look for a sign. The true regulars know what door leads them to Dick's. The back entrance? Don't expect direction. Those who need to know where the back entrance do, and those who don't will walk around aimlessly until they find the front door. How about the bathroom lock? Don't worry, you won't have to go with an unlocked door, but it will take you time to find it...hint: it looks like a metal rod that's a part of the door. One thing Dick's doesn't hide from you is the quality of their food. Completely delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. The enchiladas melt in your mouth, the chips and guac are good (ask for the flour chips-- thanks Aileen!) I went for the New Mexico Platter and all I can say is how! I was given a rellenao, chicken burro and tamale to try. Yes, it all kind of blended together but only because every bite was just as delicious as the next. It's spicy, it's cheesy, it's creamy, it's sassy (yes, I said sassy!)...it's just delicious. I tried my hardest to finish the meal but I only got maybe half way through (maybe less). It's a LOT of food and you could easily share. Now be warned before you visit, this is a hideaway and that means, it's not big. Originally, there used to be maybe room for 15 people total. But now they have a room that fits about 30 more and it's perfect for a large group, but be sure to make a reservation!So hidden that they don't even have a sign.  You either know this place by word or your bestest friend Yelp.  Tehee. :-DTex-mex is the name of the game at Dick's.  Don't expect authentic Mexican but come with an open mind that you will indulge in good tasting dishes.  Aside the main entree, what stood out to me were their rice and beans.  They were cooked al dente and full of flavor.  The grains were firm but not hard.On my last visit with Fia R and Daniel L (first timers), I ordered their red tamales.  It wasn't the best I had but it was on a decent level.  I came here once for a CMYE and I had one of the enchilada dishes and it was melty good.  The cheese was like molting lava all over the dish which screamed: "eat me now."All their dishes come on these cool, silvery industrial looking iron plates ensuring your dishes will remain hot while you get down and dirty.  The only caveat would be that its a compact place--you have the main bar and the couple of tables by it (seats 4).  To that, there's a more spacious dining room for larger parties, but probably needs a reservation.You will find the decor appealing due to its dimly, dark setting like you went into hiding.  The lighting and furnishing were all high-end looking, no less.If you are craving some Tex-Mex in the central PHX area, this is the spot to get some.  They purposely try to be a "hidden gem." :-pBreakfast at Dick's Hideaway is an experience you'll never forget. Well, OK when you're 90 and sitting in a rocking chair telling your life story to your great grandchildren it might not come up, but it is something you will tell your friends and coworkers about - but only if you do it right.Dick's offers some standard breakfast dishes like eggs, pancakes and french toast. But you can get those dishes at just about any place that's open at 7am.  You really want to give their New Mexican dishes a try.  A personal favorite is the carne adovada and eggs but I don't think you can wrong with any of the dishes. Go on, be adventurous.Bear in mind, this isn't a big restaurant and seating is limited - it's worth the wait.Wow, I can't believe I haven't been here in years.  I should keep this place in my rotation more often, it is really awesome, however be aware it is really small.  They have pretty good wines on their list, but their margaritas are amazing.  The food is really spicy, my husband was in heaven.  I had the carne adovada sliders, so delicious and my husband had the pork, shrimp and beef enchiladas.  I had a taste of each of them, they were so yummy.  They also have a room for private parties, you can reserve it with $500, that will towards the bill that night, so it is a pretty good deal if you have a large group and you want to enjoy their food and drinks. Hmmm, my birthday is coming up pretty soon!It is refreshing to come to a venue that offers something different. Not only it si secluded and somewhat exclusive, when one has managed to get a seat in a small booth-like table with no space - but I like it. It makes me feel like I am in a place that is not a franchise (if it is, I don't want to know). This establishment is austere without being uncouth in any way, like a diamond in the rough that you do not want to polish. The servers are amazing. Personable and friendly. On top of their shit, and not too busy to squeeze in a joke here and there. The beer list is not extensive, but it works. The food menu is nice. Overall this is my kind of place. I would come here often if I didn't have a decent drive associated with it. The bathroom is one coed bathroom located in the kitchen. This is good and bad, it feels odd walking into the kitchen - but I like that you can walk into the kitchen. A feel of transparency to see what is going on in here. What I bring home from my visit is the service, and the feel of the place. Both are top notch. Yes, there are things that I could suggest that would improve my experience - but i'd rather not. I want to leave this place as I found it and hope that they do not change.Dick's Hideaway... it was an adventure here!So technically we made two stops in here on Friday night.  When we first walked in, it was crowded!  So we made our way across the street for a drink before popping back in because after having a great Bloody Mary with dinner and seeing how this place boasts about having a "top rated Bloody Mary in the valley," I couldn't stop thinking about Dick's!  Plus the Persian with us wanted a crème brûlée so we came back.  The bartender even recognized us!While we awkwardly stood around waiting for some chairs or a table to free up, the bartender came by and asked us what we wanted.  A Bloody Mary and a crème brûlée was ordered and I was soon handed my lovely drink along with a small glass of Hair of the Dog beer on the house.  Sweet!  After being bullied into chugging this tasty and smooth brew, I was buzzed.  Even though I might have been a little intoxicated, I still found myself underwhelmed by this "top rated" Bloody Mary.  Whaaat!?  I had a much better Bloody Mary like one review ago.  Get on their level!Kazi H. and I were soon to be escorted to two stools at the bar while the gentlemen we were with still stood awkwardly by the door.  What were they talking about?  My love and I cracked into a nicely caramelized shell and dug into a creamy custard.  While not the best crème brûlée ever, I still found myself stealing more and more bites of her abandoned brûlée.  More for me, yay!  And then some more stools freed up and our crew came to sit with us.So the adventure?  Kazi and I stumbled into the private, dark, adjoining dining room to use the restroom.  Let's just say that two girls entered a bathroom with a shower included.  Much shenanigans.  As we made our way back to the bar with her iPhone lighting thew way, we were told that there was another bathroom.  Oops.  Thinking about Dick's makes me smile.  :)Ok. I'll be the first to say that the food is good and in the Summer, it's nice, dark and cool inside. However, here is what the 1star rating is about. I have eaten in there and ordered food to go a number of times!! I'm done. They (Rokrij, Dick's Hideaway and Richardson's) are a Phoenix institution and they know it. The staff really couldn't care less that you are there because they feel entitled to business. They give off the attitude that THEY are doing YOU a favor!The final straw was that a person in our party really didn't like their meal and asked nicely for a replacement. (The description on the menu wasn't enough and granted, she could have asked questions, but the waiter/'bartender' wasn't attentive, and would have been annoyed.) SO at ANY OTHER ESTABLISHMENT they would have taken the meal and gladly replaced it. Not Dick's! (Aptly named!) They groaned, made a new dish and charged her for BOTH!!! Also, I had ordered a cocktail off of THEIR cocktail menu. The waiter/'bartender' had no idea how to make it and just winged it! 11.00 or so for a 1st try, reading ingredients off the menu cocktail?! Not exceptable. Please see my review of Richardson's for yet another crazy example of their entitlement mentality! In a city of literally thousands of good restaurants, and more opening every week; why would you subject yourself to this?

Review Text :
US Egg is a place I can count on for Sunday brunch near home when I don't feel like waiting at Breakfast Joynt or dealing with the crowds / tough parking at LGO... and I don't want anything fancy - just good 'ol breakfast food!I've never had to wait at US Egg, and they always deliver exactly what I'm in the mood for whether it be oatmeal, protein pancakes, fruit, or an omelette.  I went today with Sarah P (all the way from MSP) in between running errands to get ready for the OYE.  I had an egg white omelette with cheese, spinach and mushrooms, an english muffin, and sliced tomato.  Sarah had what US Egg calls "the border." It's an open faced omelette with spicy chorizo, onions, Monterey jack and cheddar cheese topped with salsa, and sour cream.  Served with warm tortilla and potatoes.  We were both happy with our orders.Service was attentive and fast - just what I was looking for.When you're looking for a no-nonsense breakfast, head over to US Egg.  They serve lunch too, but I recommend going for breakfast - no matter what time of day!Wow... time flies when you're having fun.  I just realized I haven't updated my review for U.S. Egg in over two years, so the below is long overdue.  And just because I'm feeling creative today, here's a little something I wrote in honor of U.S. Egg:U - ultimate place to go for a delicious breakfastS - super friendly staffE - eggs, pancakes, waffles, and so much more!G - giant portionsG - grateful... that's how I feel about having this place so close to home!I was reminded of how much I enjoy this place after our delightful breakfast this morning.  There was a less than five minute wait to sit down, but the hostess brought me an OJ while I waited which made me very happy!  Once seated, our waitress came over to help us navigate the menu... it had been awhile since our last visit.  Per her recommendation, I went with a half order of the blueberry whole wheat pancakes and a side of egg whites.  A half order is plenty for one person fyi - it comes with a pancake as big as your plate!  It was delicious! J had coffee and a 2 egg breakfast with english muffin and hashbrowns. I love that they leave a pitcher of water and a carafe of coffee at your table... and fyi this place has plenty of lunch options as well.  If you're looking for a casual place that is consistently good, head over to U.S. Egg... I have to remember to do so more often!Holy Pancakes!!! What a meal we had. We were in the area and decided we needed a BIG breakfast. I looked through the pictures on YELP and couldn't decide what looked more satisfying. We get there around 1130, NO WAIT at all. Perfect for me because I was getting pretty "Hangry". Looking through this delicious menu I wanted everything, but this waitress wasn't going to wait forever, as patient as she was. I'm down to try new things but I know what I like and the ITALY OMELETTE was calling my name. Mushrooms, sausage, mozzarella cheese, marinara and pepperoni on top. What omelette can beat that? Yeah I couldn't think of one either haha. But why stop there? I'm a girl with a sweet tooth so I ordered powered sugar french toast off of the kids menu (pretty filling) and added bananas on top. A little extra charge but who cares when you're hungry right? Just go bananas you'll thank yourself later!!! I also had the pleasure of eating off of my boyfriends plate. He kept it simple & light and ordered a sirloin steak with broccoli. I rather indulge in the good, "yet not so good for you" food, but then again that's just me! He splurged a little and got their famous protein pancake. Good for you carb and calorie counters. It was massive, filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and almonds. Simply delicious. Now that I have your mouth watering I think it's time you come in and taste for yourself. Remember: Go Bananas!

Review Text :
Spring Restaurant Week 2013 review.This place was a nightmare to get into, not one person crossing the driveway would let me through, so when I finally got through I was happy they had valet. This was my first time eating here, so I had no expectations, only thing I knew about this place was the Beef Wellington they're known for. When we were seated the first thing I noticed was the wainscoting had old food particles all over it. Disgusting. It appeared no one has wiped down the area in years. I had to scoot away because I didn't want someone else's food from last year on my arm. For dinner, I started out with the Wollensky Salad, this was soaked in salad dressing, there was a pile of it at the bottom of the dish, I love a good salad and this was nothing special. I tried the Deconstructed Beef Wellington, I ordered it medium well and it came out tartare, it was bright red in the middle, all the way through. I have a huge fear of returning food, so I tried my best to eat this but just could not get it down. It was smothered in foie gras & mushrooms. So overwhelming. Ended it with the coconut cake, I took 2 bites and was done. It tasted old like it had been made days before. This was by far the most disappointing Restaurant Week meal I had. I would never return.So, today, my parents were going to a wine tasting that was being held here. This restaurant has a 'valet', but because I wasn't valeting, I went around the parked car, to go into the lot to drop off my parents.One of the valet guys started running after my car, and screaming..... Yes, screaming at us.I rolled down my window and asked if there was a problem... He very rudely stated that I needed to valet my car and demanded that we do so. My mom and I then explained to him that I was just dropping off my parents. He then told us that he was just "doing his job".Hire a more classy valet. Who runs and screams after a car.... ? I wasn't even going that fast.Zero stars for the valet, and his attitude.Buy my parents said they had a lot of fun at the event.I was more excited to try this place than Delmonico's! I've been wanting to come here for decades & when Restaurant Week featured this restaurant as one of their participants.. I smiled & jumped on the opportunity to finally dine here. The valet attendant was prompt in taking my car in & directed us to the entrance. As my Father & I walked in, we were greeted instantly by two friendly hostesses & sat us right away to a nice booth as requested.Now here is where things went downhill. Our server, an older Caucasian male seem to be taking care of the back section of the room, came over & handed us our menus. We ordered a Acqua Panna bottle & when he came back with it.. I asked him about the baked potato side dish if it was served for one or two guests.. he told me that's only for one person. I told him we're here for Restaurant Week & we're ready to order. At that exact moment of saying those words, we became nonexistence to him. Service went from 100 to zero in a split second. He acted like he didn't know what I was talking about & then said.. Oh the Restaurant Week menu.. I'll go get that.. I guess you won't be needing these & took the regular menus with him. When he came back with the RW menus, he took off when I was half way letting him know we were ready to order. WOW really?! He passed by not once, but eight times without even acknowledging us. I finally waved my hand as he was passing by & said we're ready to order & he puts his index finger in the air, noting to me to wait. We watched this rude server walk back & forth taking his time to other tables, probably not participating in RW, giving them the kind of service we never received. My blood began to boil, because this wasn't an ordinary outing. My only day off & I took my Father here to celebrate a belated Father's Day. I would think I chose a great place to make him feel special in this nice steakhouse that's been here forever, but I was completely wrong. WE felt like nobodys after I said we're here for Restaurant Week. If you're a participant for this wonderful program of giving back to our community that needs it more than anything, why are you not wanting to share it with your guests or even supporting a great cause?! In return, we were treated like a peasant for wanting to give back & share a good meal together. At that very moment, I had enough. As soon as I saw the next staff member, I told him I want to talk to your manager right now. The rude server that was in the next room probably heard me, since he came over after I said that & acted all nonchalant with.. so you ready to order? My look at his face.. I wish someone was there to take a picture. I told him.. Actually no, I'm going to talk to your manager first. And look who's behind him.. the manager. I explained to the manager what happened and told him straightforwardly.. I want a different server immediately. As soon as those words came out of my mouth, the manager unhesitatingly took care of this matter and like a shot.. here came Jinho. There's the one star comeback. His service was 100x better. Like night and day compared to the rude server we had. So welcoming & attentive.. he read our minds with what we wanted to ask for without even having to ask! Now that's the kind of service every restaurant should provide, especially being a well known steakhouse here in Las Vegas. When he asked if we would like any side dishes, I mentioned the baked potato and on the double he goes.. that's a good choice.. it's a big portion that both of you can share. Rude, greedy server of "no that's only for one person" to this server letting me know we can share it. It was more of a self serve kind of place, poured my Father some more water as well as myself. Or maybe that's just for RW guests.Appetizer of Tomato Carpaccio with Burrata was decent. Nothing spectacular. Food runner dropped off a few Ribeyes and sides that were for the table in front of us. I told the runner, this isn't our order. He looked at it, then looked at the table in front of us and flat-out took everything back to the cariton. The table in front of us saw what happened and we, both shared a laugh. Then a few seconds later our food came out and the runner goes.. let's try this again, it's like a deja vu. My filet mignon on one side was completely burnt to a black crisp. I had to cut it off and discard it. The baked potato was simply what it was, but good toppings of butter, sour cream, bacon bits, and cheddar cheese. NY Cheesecake was light and soft. The star of the night.. Chocolate Cake was DELICIOUS! We took it home. My Mother ate a few bites and said.. this is the best tasting cake I ever had. I have to agree.. I couldn't stop eating it!!!One star for the valet that had my car parked and ready for me when I came out, another star for the prompt action of the manager in getting me another server, and our server, Jinho for making up for the lack of another. Minus two stars for the rude server that treated us cold as winter.

Absolutely unimpressed.The frat boys yelling and carrying on Saturday nights when I'm walking past don't make for good advertisements, guys, especially when one shouts, "Look at the fool with the fro" and points.  ugh.Still, I decided to give Guido's a shot.  I went for dinner after studying one night with some friends.The waitress was polite but chronically forgetful, and had to be asked multiple times for anything from water to silverware to condiments.  The burger was...okay.  The fries were disappointing.  The crab cakes were dry and icky.I'm not coming back.  And I'm certainly having my headphones in each time I pass the ever scintillating crowd on the weekends.This place seemed to be the fun college hang out bar. The place where the frat boys come to hang out and scan the ladies up and down. I, am not a frat boy. I did not come here to hit on ladies. I felt old here. Though the bartender was nice and offered some suggestions to my friend on where he could meet some ladies to hook up with. Mercifully, I got to go back to the hotel and get myself to bed.guidos has really good french fries. REALLY REALLY GOOD. like sneak them off your husband's plate when he's in the bathroom even though you already have your own good......but remember all those people you hated in high-school? the ones you figured would join a fraternity or sorority to try and legitimize the fact that they are drunk, mentally disturbed, and semi-literate? remember how you thought they'd all still be acting like jack-asses in their thirties? well, you were right, and i promise you, they are hanging out at guidos right now with five hundred of their best friends.

Restaurant name  Pita Jungle

Review Text :
Since I'm a regular at this location of the Jungle lately, I only feel it fair to review this one too... (I reviewed the Indian School location back in January).This Jungle is still one of our regular restaurants on the rotation - it's cheap, healthy, casual, and huge portions.  Still consistent and I've never had a bad meal at any of the jungles.  I pretty much order the macro platter every visit, but on occasion I'll mix it up with a salad, wrap, or pizza.  Most recently, I really mixed it up since I was feeling adventurous.  I ordered us an appetizer of 1/2 hummus and 1/2 garlic dip.  I really liked it!    The texture was smooth and it went well with both the pita and cucumbers we requested.  Call me crazy, but I mixed it up even more and ordered the spinach pasta salad and added tofu to it for my entree - and again, delicious!  As a matter of fact, so good that I didn't even add my normal squeeze of sracha sauce!If you haven't been to Pita Jungle, go soon - don't expect a fancy schmancy place; just go in with moderate expectations for good food that comes in big portions.  Speaking of big portions, I'm off to eat my leftovers... :)I'm moved to write a limerick instead of a haiku...this time:)        We stopped at the Jungle at lunchtime,     The Hummus and Schwarma were both fine,     The food is all scrumptious,     The service is bumptious,     All in all, though, we had a good time:)I just noticed that I wrote an entire limerick without a single reference to Nantucket...a first for me:)A solid 4 stars:)

Restaurant name  Guy Savoy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I ate at Guy Savoy in Oct 2006. The overall feeling is modern and spare; furniture is plain and functional. This is the kind of style I tend to like, but somehow I didn't find it attractive.    Service was friendly and efficient.  The restaurant is managed by Guy Savoy's son Frank.  He seemed to be everywhere, introducing himself to guests and always making sure that things were running smoothly.  There was always someone nearby to take care of my every need.Before the meal, there were a number of items.  First, an amuse bouche: a fingernail sized sandwich of thin slices of toast and foie gras, meltingly rich.  Excellent!Sometime around this point, I ordered dinner - the 10 course Menu Prestige, with bread pairings for each course.  While I was digesting all of this information, some additional amuses bouche (if that's how you make it plural) arrived: a potato cake, a piece of quail breast, and a third item I forgot to write down.  All were very good.A little while later, yet another amuse bouche arrived:  a tiny cup of carrot and pumpkin soup, with fennel, bacon, and popped wild rice.  It was very good, and came with a surprise.  The cup was actually two cups, fused together.  One cup held the soup, the other cup was upside down.  When I was finished with the soup, I lifted the two cup combo off the plate, and under the upside down cup was a little pumpkin risotto.  It was even better than the soup.I'd been eating for at least a half hour, but now the meal officially began.  The courses were:    * Oyster in Ice Gelee.  Good briny flavor. Paired with seaweed bread.    * Tomato Tartar, Young Vegetables and "Seaweed-Lemon" Granite.  In addition to chopped tomato, there were bits of micro green beans, egg white and yolk, yellow tomato puree, gelee, and other ingredients. Surprisingly good.    * Colors of Caviar.  Layers of: vinaigrette of caviar; cream of caviar; string bean puree; Iranian golden Osetra caviar; warm Saboyan. Each contributed strong flavor, although they masked the caviar just a bit.  Still, very good.    * Slow Cooked Wild King Salmon.  A nice piece of fish, with fennel, anise, and vegetables.  I should have taken more notes, as it was my favorite of the first four courses - very simple, but very tasty.    * Sauteed Baby Chanterelles, Prosciutto, Crisp Potato Galette and Snow Peas.  Paired with excellent bacon bread.  This was another complex dish, with a number of items in addition to those mentioned. Excellent; my favorite course.    * Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup, Toasted Mushroom Brioche with Black Truffle Butter.  The soup was creamy, with a pronounced artichoke flavor.  Four slices of truffle floated on top, along with equally sized slices of parmesan cheese.  Almost as good as the previous course.    * Degustation of Veal.  There were four different veal preparations; overall, very good.    * Selection de Fromages Affines.  I don't much care for fancy cheeses, and in any case wouldn't know what to order.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The cheese steward described the general categories (strong vs mild, cow vs sheep, etc).  He asked me my preferences, and made recommendations.  The entire experience was very relaxed and a lot of fun. Some that I tried:          o Aged Muenster. Aged to the point where it was soft and strongly flavored.  Very good!          o Goat Blue Cheese.  The cheese steward recommended this variety. Made from goat's milk, it was very unusual and very special; my favorite.          o Salers.  A firm cheese, not so strong.  Pretty good.    * palate cleanser.    * The Peach.  A peach half, with baked or fried shredded phyllo dough, and lavender ice cream.  The peach was flavorful, soft and chewy - an odd but pleasing combination.  The entire dessert sounds a bit strange, but was very good - one of my favorite non-chocolate desserts in recent memory.    * Chocolate Fondant, Crunchy Praline, Chicory Cream.  Layers of gianduja-like paste and chocolate ganache; very, very thick/dense. Cut a little piece of the dessert, and dip it in the chicory cream.  I'm having trouble giving a good description, but it was excellent!Still to come were mignardises - a few extra sweets to end the meal.  There was also some incredible lemon sage sorbet.  It tasted like solid lemon juice - overwhelmingly sour; I love this kind of stuff.This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas, second only to that at Joel Robuchon.  The food was excellent, the service was excellent, and just as importantly it was a lot of fun.  Given the prices, I'm not likely to return any time soon, but I'll remember my meal for a long time to come.The bill: the menu prestige is $290.  A small, quicker (90 minute) tasting menu is $190.  A three course la carte meal will run between $150 and $250.  To these prices, add drinks, tax and tip.  One nice touch: bottled water is free.I ate at this establishment on November 10th, 2007.  I know about Chef Guy Savoy (Pronounced Gee- Sa-Vuah).  I know about his restaurants in Paris, France and all the accolades he has received.  Including having received three Michelin Stars.  This restaurant in Las Vegas is his first restaurant here in the U.S.A. It is located on the second floor of the Augustus Tower at the Caesar's Palace Hotel and Casino.With all this in mind, I decided what the heck, let's see if this guy, Guy Savoy, is all he is cracked up to be.  When I arrived, all I saw was two gigantic doors leading into the restaurant.  As I neared the door, a beautiful young woman opened the door and greeted my friend and I.  They ushered us into the cocktail lounge and asked if we wanted to have a cocktail while we waited.  Since I had planned on having the Chef's tasting menu with the wine pairings, I opted to wait for my table.  The decor was very simple yet elegant.After a few minutes of waiting, our table was ready.  They asked if we wanted to have some wine or a cocktail.  I informed them that we were going to enjoy the Chef's Tasting Menu-which is called, "Menu Prestige" with the wine pairings.  It almost seemed like the waiter, some guy with a french accent, got a smirk on his face.  He then asked if we had any time constraints.  Time constraints?--are you kidding me.  "Uh, no.  We don't have any time constraints.  We are here to enjoy this dining experience to the fullest."  He said, "Excellent, then we shall begin."It was at this point when our three (3) hour dining experience began.   Okay, let's move on to the good stuff---the food.  They started the meal with a tiny little skewer with bread and Foie Gras, their AmuseBouche. First of all, if you go here.  When they walk the little bread cart to your table you will be overwhelmed with the different varieties of bread you can get.  Ignore all of it and just ask for the Bacon Bread.  It is to die for.  The only other place I have ever had bacon bread was at Joel Robuchon at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino here in Las Vegas as well--that's another review.Here is what we ate:Oysters in Ice Gele-- (A good way to start the meal.  It was very flavorful a nice little bite)   Hamachi Carpaccio, Golden Oscetra Caviar, Cauliflower, Caviar Sabayon-- (The Hamachi was awesome and the flavors interacted with each other nicely, it wasn't over the top)Maine Lobster, Carrots, Orange and Star Anis-- (they served this and added some sauce on our plate as they were explaining what it was-It truly was something else.  I can't say I have ever had anything like this.  The flavors melded perfectly)  John Dory with a Crust of Walnut and Chive, Watercress and Salsify, Roasted Jus-- (This is a fish that is not commonly found on menus. Not very easy to get.  Nonetheless, we had it here and it was beautifully prepared.  I am not a big fan of Watercress but it worked well with this dish--truly impressed)Roasted Foie Gras "en Cocotte", Cardamom Infused Duck Bouillon, Glazed Chestnuts and Galette Grand Caraque--(Foie Gras--I am getting hungry just writing about it--In one word, Awesome)Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup, Toasted Mushroom Brioche, and Black Truffle Butter ( I did not expect the soup to taste as good as it did.  The presentation was good with Black Truffle and Parmessan Cheese Shavings on the top)Poussin   la Broche , Black Truffle, Fingerling Potatoes and Chanterelles--(This was a roasted chicken. They brought out the entire chicken for us to see, presentation was nice. The taste was simple, as simple as you can get with Black Truffle, but so good) Slection de Fromages Affins-- (We got to choose from a variety of different cheeses.  In the end, we had a little bit of every single cheese. You could truly taste the quality of the cheeses)Pear--( This was a dessert of items made out of Pear. Pear Sorbet and Roasted Pear. It wasn't too sweet. It was just right and the pear wasn't overly cooked it was still crisp)Chocolate Fondant, Crunchy Praline, Chicory Cream--(Speaks for itself) After this, they brought out a cart with some Petit Fours and different kinds of sweets. I enjoyed a rasberry lollipop made in house. I had to ask for another one it was that good.The food was truly exceptional. The service was just as good. I noticed that Franck Savoy, the Chef's son, who happens to run the place was actively participating in serving and making us feel at home. I have to admit, I was a little surprised to see, "the Boss", working and not just pointing his finger and bossing his people around. This told me a lot about the philosophy of this particular restaurant. Did I mention, they were just awarded two (2) Michelin Stars for this restaurant this month. A very huge accomplishment--they are one of only three restaurants with two stars in Las Vegas. I have pictures of the plates and a copy of the menu. Email me if interested. Very Expensive but worth it!I'm not sure why I've hesitated writing this.  I just adore Franck Savoy, Guy's darling son.  He runs the restaurant with his wife, but I've not had the opportunity to meet her yet.  One of the culinary highlights of our life in Vegas was dinner here -- sadly, it wasn't with my husband but with my Mother (who adored every sip, every taste) -- but I look forward to returning with my husband just the two of us.  We went one night after a show, in hopes of simply enjoying a perfect glass of champagne in the bar since it was so late -- but instead, we were treated to -- yep - a fully comped tasting menu with seemingly bottomless glasses of champagne.  Such a surprise -- and such a delight -- every bite.  The evening's only ? was having to deal with Paris Hilton and Cris Angel who wouldn't stop smoking in the bar -- they were attending Elton's birthday party in the PDR but for some reason thought leaving the party was appropriate...oh well. The original Maitre d' at Spago Hollywood, Bernard Erpicum originally officiated over the champagne bar -- the tales he can tell -- and he's known my husband for years, so we were well cared for.  Since then, however, Bernard has moved on and is now at Aureole, if memory serves.  I've been a fan of Monsieur Savoy's since my first trip to Paris twenty years ago.  So having him come to Vegas now so regularly, and having the opportunity to visit (damn, I wish my French was better) with him, instead of simply being another mouth to feed, is a dream come true.  He should be so proud of Franck, who's such a talent, such a lovely host.  But mostly I love how good he is to my husband and that he regularly dines at my husband's restaurant so that the two of them can visit.  We wish them all the best -- and look forward to many meals with them for years to come.The evening of May 7th, 2009 will be one I will remember forever! It was the night of the Master's Series Dinner at Restaurant Guy Savoy. One of the kick off events of Vegas Uncorked. The evening started with Champagne and some of those little Foie Burgers I loved so much my first visit. I was soon escorted to my table and introduced to my tablemates; Angelo and fellow yelper, Mary Ellen. I am so used to dining solo that I had almost forgotten how enjoyable intelligent and humorous conversation can be. Thanks guys! Now on to the food. 1st Course Asparagus Soup with Fried Asparagus. Just a nice small treat to begin the evening. 2nd Course Lobster Raw "Cooked" in Cold Steam. Sweet Carpaccio of Lobster was served on a vented plate that hid some dry ice. When a Soy based sauce was poured over the Lobster, "steam" rose through the vents. Quite a show! Served with Veuve Ciiquot Rose Champagne. 3rd Course Turbot with Black Pepper Sabayon and Young Leeks. Mild, delicate fish, with a nicely spiced, peppery sauce and sweet grilled leeks. Paired with a 2007 Chateau La Nerthe Blanc. 4th Course Cannons of Vegetables Stuffed with Escargots, Mushrooms, Herbs, Mushroom Emulsion. This dish looked beautiful. The Vegetables were wonderfully cooked and sweet. The Mushroom emulsion was deep earthy and full of Mushroom flavor, but the stuffing didn't really excite me. The Escargots should have been the star, but really got lost in the other components of the stuffing. Served with a 2006 Newton Unfiltered Chardonnay. 5th Course Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup. This is a classic Savoy dish and was just as good as I remembered! Served with a 2006 Domaine Chandon Pinot Noir. This was my favorite pairing of the evening. 6th Course Truffle Loin of Veal, Black Truffle Potato Puree, Spring Vegetables. Perfectly cooked, decadently studded with Truffles. The potatoes were so good they reminded me of Robuchons. Served with a 2005 Ceretto, Bricco Asili, Barbaresco. 7th Course White Sphere A white chocolate sphere that, when a sauce was poured over revealed a hidden raspberry mousse. Quite an impressive show. Paired with a 2004 Domaine de Coyeux, Muscat de Beaumes de Venise. 8th Course The Famous Dessert Cart! One of the high points of the night was the opportunity to meet Chef Guy Savoy himself! This was an amazing evening of food, wine and friendship.After 3 times in this Gastronomic Temple Finally I get the top PRESTIGE MENU (($290) sounds a lot of money but believe it's worth it! this was a Solo Experience my table was ready and this is the story of Sunday October 4 8:30 pm when the amazing doors opened I saw Franck Savoy with his charm and elegance then in my table the amuse bouche was a little burger and a foie gras sandwich AMAZING, the champagne cart just arrived so I started with Rosé ($22) when the menu was shown I decided for the prestige with has the most famous signature dishes of Master Chef Guy Savoy So what to do? go for it!!!! Alain Alpe was my server very efficient and pro! the Prestige began! 1) Oyster in Ice Gelee fantastic fresh oyster perfect with the rosé 2) Lobster Salad I loved it! fantastic fine delicious raw cooked 3)Crispy Sea Bass for me this was the star of the night the flavour of vanilla balanced with the spices makes a superb experience 4) Foie-gras en papillote very good but I prefer terrine foie 5) Artichoke and black truffle soup I tried it many times but this one was the best and the brioche I take a little piece of it and dunk it in the soup WOW amazing!!! At this point I asked for a glass of Bordeaux Margaux was fantastic ($35) 6)Roasted Veal Chop I like it the black truffle potato purée adds a lot to the veal they presented before being carved very nice touch! 7)Fromages AH!!!! if you love french food you love french fromages so the server Adrian made a fantastic selection of firm cheese including Beaufort Comte I enjoyed it a lot. 8) Coconut in six ways it was nice but I love chocolate so the next one was the star 9)Chocolate fondant same as in Paris fine exquisite delicate balanced simply quite PERFECT!!! ONE OF THE BEST EXPERIENCES IN MY LIFE AFTER ALL $510 WORTH IT I Drank 3 glasses of Rosé and the BordeauxFull review in Blog.  Some highlights below.Arriving approximately 15 minutes early at The Palace I made my way to the Augustus Tower and took some pictures before entering the restaurant - doors held open for me by a pair of young ladies and greeted - literally - by Mr. Savoy, a bright smile, and a "Doctor U. I presume?"  Somewhat taken aback by such a warm greeting I confirmed my name and shook the managers hand before being escorted to my table in the main dining room.With my menu presented and myself settled in for a great experience the meal began with a pair of Canapes - both signature trademarks of Guy Savoy's restaurant both here and overseas.  The first dish, entitled "French club" consisted of alternating layers of duck foie gras, truffles, and brioche - now that is how you start a meal.  No bigger than the distal part of my thumb the dish was excellent with the buttery bread and earthy truffle providing the first flavor and fragrance but later giving way to the intensely creamy foie gras that lingered on the palate it its signature manner.  Without trying to sound too gluttonous I could've (and would've) eaten at least 50 of these given the chance.  Kicking off the official portion of the tasting menu I was brought a dish entitled Mosaic of Milk Fed Poularde, Foie Gras, Artichoke with Black Truffle Jus (Bread pairing Toasted Country Bread.)  Featuring layers of pounded and roasted chicken that was on par with the version at The French Laundy interspersed with creamy and unctuous moularde duck foie gras and a pureed artichoke the dish was one of the best mixed terrines I've ever tasted with the creamy foie, savory chicken, and smooth artichoke each standing separate yet also blending effortlessly to form a uniform taste that somewhat resembled mushroom - all of this was of course brought to an even more potent effect by the addition of a salty and earthy jus that tasted like the very essence of a black truffle and clung to the palate.  Pairing well with the warmed bread I spread each bite thin and savored this dish a great deal.Extremely happy with the meal thus far I was next greeted by one of Monsieur Savoy's most famous dishes - the Colors of Caviar (Bread pairing Plain Ciabatta.)  A multilayered "parfait" of sorts this dish was described at length but essentially consisted of multiple layers of caviar - a chilled caviar creme, a hot egg caviar sabayon, a caviar gelee, a smooth and salty green bean puree,  and a thick layer of cool Ossetra egg - eaten with a mother of pearl spoon.  Instructed to eat bites of each layer all at once I dug into the dish slowly and let the amalgam dissolve slowly in my mouth; unreal.  While I cannot say what the exact overarching flavor of the dish was, the feel of the dish was tremendous with a progression of flavors, textures, temperatures, and densities - a true "study" of the food.  Interestingly because of its presentation each bite actually offered a different sensation and progression due to the way the concoction came out on the spoon.  At $90 (off menu price) this is the most expensive single dish I've ever tasted and had it not been on the menu I'd likely not have indulged - but I'm certainly glad I did.  The bread served with this dish was clearly meant to do nothing but allow the caviar to shine - a plain and boring ciabatta that I tasted and discarded the rest of.Diverting from the classics to something I love the next dish was Radis-Foie, or Foie-Gras "en Papillote" and Radish Bouillon (Bread pairing Caramelized Onion Ciabatta.)  Having had my first truly amazing cooked Foie a few weeks earlier at Blackbird (a roasted prep) and L2O (first seared then roasted and served in a cotton candy shell) I was very intrigued by this dish and its novel method of preparation - first seared and then cooked not-exactly "en Papillote" or parchment, but rather steamed in sherry vinegar with pink and white radishes in a plastic bag which is presented tableside before being opened up and returned to the kitchen for plating.  Shying away from traditional accoutrements like fruit and nuts the kitchen at Guy Savoy instead chooses to temper their foie with bitter as opposed to sweet utilizing the bitter radish leafs and mild yet spicy radishes to further balance the foie's characteristic unctuous and buttery body.  While I personally love the majority of sweet Foie Gras preparations I've experienced I have to say this prep was an eye opener for me and a true showing of Guy's brilliance.  Speaking later with the Chef du cuisine during my tour of the kitchen it was actually this dish that garnered the majority of our discussion - apparently the use of bitters and spices to temper the liver is much more commonplace in France and Italy than in the United States due to their larger consumption of the dish and "American's have a sweet tooth."  While I'll not argue with my love of sweets I will say that this dish is one of the best Foie Gras preps I've had.As good as it gets. You may have heard of this place, but it's the only location in the US outside of France. It's run by Guy Savoy's son Franck at the Vegas location. The decor is simple, warm and inviting. But all the effort goes into the food. Sat in the bubble bar area near the fireplace. It's very casual here. The chairs are so small and delicate, I kept slipping off. Maybe it was the wine. In any case, tasted a few of the appetizers and it's divine. The restaurant does feature a really cool dining area inside the kitchen. It's glass encased, so you can see the chef and the cooks at work. There's also a Krug Champagne room. Back to the menu: It's all about tastings, small plates enough for one bite. From the signature artichoke and black truffle soup to spiced crispy sea bass the flavors are well balanced and textured. I felt like a judge on Iron Chef. There is a 10 course Menu Prestige which is probably going to cost you what some people pay in rent. You can take a different route though and choose items from the a la carte menu. There is also a dessert cart that comes after you're done eating. It's all in little portions including the much talked about pudding in a jar. Bon Appetit listed this place one the country's hottest restaurants.***First of all: This was the best meal of our lives.*** I would give it six stars, if allowed to. It was also one of the most expensive (by quite a bit).My wife and I had eaten at Guy Savoy's original restaurant in Paris and thoroughly enjoyed it, so we had high hopes for the Las Vegas location. This location is in Caesar's Palace and is supervised by Guy's charming son. It is located in a quiet part of the place with an understated dining room from which a perfect view of the "Eiffel Tower" at Paris, Paris may be seen. It is oddly transporting in that bizarre Vegas sort of way. The seating density is VERY low, which is great. When loud talkers wearing gold chains and other bling chat, you really cannot hear them. The clientele is a mixture of gauche high rollers, foodies, and special occasion sorts.Quality and service here are impeccable. The meal starts with the champagne cart which has a dozen offerings by the glass. Where we live, you are lucky to find a basic champagne by the glass, much less an assortment of top tier houses. The bread cart has a dozen and half kinds of bread from walnut bread to a seaweed bread. There are two kinds of butter from Normandy: a salted and unsalted version.The menu is organized as a tasting menu or one may order ala carte. We chose ala cart and ordered three course, which included Guy's famous black truffle and artichoke soup. Everything was without flaw AND filled with passion.All well and good, but the service was the best part. Guy Savoy has the most gracious staff ever. If I had asked "what is chicken?", they would have immediately described it with no hint of talking down to the guest. Everyone was immensely kind and helpful, while staying professional. They also were invisible when they should be invisible and somehow present when they should be present. Half empty butter holders disappeared and were replenished without any disturbance in our conversation. All together impressively seamless. Guy's son watches over the well trained staff and visits each table with warm and genuine care.We were quite full after our three courses and decided to just have an espresso, passing on dessert. Our espresso was accompanied by three more gratis courses of sweets, including a cart of candies, pastries, ice creams, etc., then petit fours. This was the continuation of a pattern of several gratis mini-courses during the meal.As we departed, we were presented a beautifully packaged box of house-made chocolates. The bill was huge, BUT it was worth every penny. The value was there. If a person is planning on seeing a show in Vegas and getting great seats, you would pay about as much. Why not try a world-class restaurant for a few hours. You'll be amazed.I dislike this place and will never recommend it to anyone. Fine dining to me involves 1) Unique wonderful food 2) Immaculate service - this is why you pay so much more, which is why it's called fine dining.If you look, I usually like to only review places I LIKE. So people will go there. Why waste time to help advertise places I do not like. This is an exception.Here is the gist, my friend had left because she was hung over. She had ordered bread from the cart, prior to leaving. I did not. So she got her food in a box and left, while myself and 4 other friends stayed for the rest of the dinner. While we were enjoying our entrees I was eating HER bread. The bread was wheat bread, and I admit, was delicious. So the waiter (whom french accent sounded super unauthentic) seeing that she left, comes over to clean up and remove her place setting - which is normal. He reaches over and grabs the plate with the bread on it, which was next to me. I tell him "No no leave the bread, I am eating it". Now, what is the common sense  thing to do, if you were the waiter?Think about it... Common sense?!?!Answer: You put the plate down!!! walk away and let the customer enjoy the bread! Right????You do not even need to say anything, but of course, instead of doing this, he spoke back in condescending tone "But monsieur, that is the ladies bread" as if I broke some sort of natural law- Is it really unacceptable for me to eat someone else bread?If the same situation occurs at any other restaurant, I can *almost* guarantee you they will put the plate down and would probably even be glad to do so. So he grabs the plate (with my hand on the plate as well!) and said "I will bring you another bread". I totally recall thinking... Why is he arguing with me? So he takes off with the plate and this was when I was not too happy. He did come back with bread, but it was NOT the same type!! Obviously, I am not going to make call him out because it is not the same kind of bread but this added to my fury!!!!Alright, because this happen with bread, you may say "it's only bread" Well, lets substitute this situation with say.. soup. Your friend leaves so you are enjoying their clam chowder which was ordered. The waiter comes over to deny you of it, even though you ask to leave it there. He brings you a new bowl of soup, however when it arrives, its some cream of broccoli. I know most of you would say something about the soup!Anyways the food.. I ordered the Kobe Beef. I had six ounces of it, its sold by the ounce. It was not good. The above incident occurred during the main course, so I stopped eating. Left a couple ounces on the plate and did not allow anyone to touch it. Another one of my friend saw I was upset and so she said something to the manager (or owner, not sure) and he provided complementary glass of wine to everyone. I made sure nobody drank the wine they gave me. I do not need this crap and you do not either, hundred of places in Vegas to have a great dining experience. I walked out upset. it maybe a funny story with my friends and I now but at the moment, I was Pissssssed.Never again!Breakdown: 1-star for the manger who did something. 0 star of everything else.Guy Savoy was impressive, very impressive.  I have not even eaten here, but it does not really matter.  Guy Savoy is hospitality personified.  I came here for one reason, Krug.  I had called to see if a reservation was required to have some bubbly at the Bubble Bar (where they poured Krug by the glass) and was told that it was not necessary and that they look forward to having us.  When we arrived, we were told that the Bubble Bar was sold out for the evening.  The hostess was quite gracious and apologetic when I told her about the phone conversation I had regarding reservations.  She suggested we talk to the manager and then guided us to the restaurant.  I approached the manager who was at the front desk, informed him of the situation and without hesitation, he led us to their private patio. It was beautiful and romantic. The manager served us personally. He brought us two glasses of Krug and surprised us with three canapes.  They were delicious.  This is the mark of a great restaurant.  We were in Vegas, we wanted an experience at Guy Savoy, and without hesitation or pretense, they gave me exactly what I wanted and more. I will be back in a month or so to have dinner, I cannot wait.This restaurant is not like the other...Guy Savoy in Paris is an experience!  Unfortunately Guy Savoy in Las Vegas is just a meal, and an expensive one to boot.The ungracious experience begins as you walk through the doors and are barked at by the host and hostess who do not have the courtesy to allow guests to fully enter the doors before immediately questioning you about reservations.  The gate guards may not let you through without them. The entry is inviting as is the bar and lounge where a lovely fireplace glows.  Unfortunately, the dining room is severe and leaves much to be desired. The environment is not only cold, but is also quite stark with the feel of a dingy New York loft apartment on a gloomy day.  The high ceilings give the room a cavernous, mine shaft effect and the restaurant has no music whatsoever.  The lack of ambiance and music leave nothing but the waiters and food as your stage for enjoyment.  Unfortunately, the stress of the service afflicts and burdens the staff which, in turn, creates a stressful meal for the patrons.  I have enjoyed two splendid meals at Guy Savoy in Paris and was truly excited to experience this restaurant, without having to take an international flight.  While the recipe's remain authentic, the experience is not one I never ever wish to repeat.  Our dinner for 2, all in including tip was over $800. This was without an expensive bottle of wine but with wine pairings, by the glass, poorly executed and selected by our "deer in headlights" sommelier.Dear Mr. Guy Savoy, I am heartily disappointed.  Perhaps it is time to take a greater hand in your US representation.  The meal, the experience, the dining room and ESPECIALLY the service were a complete miss - I should have NEVER gone here and should have gone right to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel to dine in Twist by Pierre Gagnaire.  My two reviews of the Paris Guy Savoy depict a truly wonderful experience that was totally worth every penny spent. This was not.An award winning dining experience that will leave you sated and infinitely satisfied!As soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the restaurant manager who proceeded to lead us to our seats by the window. Located inside the newly erected Augustus tower of Caesar's Palace, the restaurant embraced a contemporary elegance that was refined yet simple and unfussy.  With warm tones from the rich wood panels, ceilings that soared high up, and large glass paneled windows with a peek a boo view of the Bellagio fountains, the ambiance was nothing less than magnificent!  The sommelier was helpful and knowledgeable as he started us with some bubbly and as soon as I saw a bottle of vintage Krug, I knew I was in for a treat!The server was equally friendly and suggested The Chef's Signature Tasting Menu, which showcased the restaurant's acclaimed dishes.  Frankly, It goes without saying I went with the chef's signature tasting menu.  When in Rome, right folks?Amuse BouchesFoie gras with black truffleCrisp toastettes pierced together with creamy smooth foie gras and irresistible black truffle was a decadent play of flavors and textures in the mouth. Parmesan waffleLight fragrant and perfectly crisp and a delightful start to a sumptuous meal.Cold zuchini soup with diced Radish & celery seed powder - very refreshing with a pleasant bite from the diced radishesFingerling potatoes with cream cheese and ham and topped with watercress. A charming little surprise that came with the cold zucchini soup.  This accompaniment rounded out our amuse plates wonderfully but something was telling me it probably wasn't the last surprise of the evening!First CourseHeirloom tomatoes wedges with watermelon and tomato gelee - refreshing and vibrant! the addition of the frozen tomato added just enough saltiness to the sweet heirloom tomatoes and the addition of the crisp basil was surprisingly delightful!Surprise #2 A tomato tartar topped with a pomegranate gelee and  basil drops was lightly flavorful and beautifully plated.2nd dishColors of caviar - elegant and perfectly composed with layers of complex flavors and rich textures that paired beautifully with the champagne and meant to be savored slowly3rd dishFish with ratatouille - Perfectly cooked, and the fish was imported from the southeast of France...Si Bon! Presented with its natural jus foam, the flesh was supple and soft to the touch with my fork. The ratatouille added the perfect amount of rustic flavor to this light yet incredibly flavorful fish4th dishFoie Gras - Considering its recent ban in California, I have found my new mecca for foie gras...Vegas baby! Served with a side of duck jus in a shot glass steeped in chopped fresh beets, green tea with crispy rice, the foie gras was absolute perfection. It was decadently rich and the orange zest cleansed the palate perfectly! Without a doubt, one of my favorite dishes of the evening!5thBlack Truffle Soup - served with a warm buttery brioche that tasted like a flaky pastry. We were encouraged to dip the brioche into the velvety smooth soup. Infused with an incredibly rich depth of flavor imparted from the black truffle shavings and Parmesan flakes, this well composed soup was absolutely sublime and left my taste buds dancing long after i finished it!6th dishFilet mignon tenderloin with bone marrow was simply exquisite. The filet was insanely tender and very flavorful. The bone marrow that topped the filet was buttery soft and paired nicely with the filet. The shoulder cut of beef wrapped in delicate ribbons of carrot exhibited a briny flavor that added an earthy element to the dish, as well.DessertsDessert Amuse Bouche - Apricot sorbet and with diced apricot. Tart, refreshing, and an excellent palate cleanserCoconut 6 ways - An splendid little dessert with an interesting mix of textures that made it a sheer joy to eat!Chocolate ganache with praline cream. Divine & a chocolate lover's dream come true!Everything ended with a citrusy sorbet with creme fraiche as a final palate cleanser...But our sweet journey didn't end there!  A large dessert cart was then rolled out for us to choose to our heart's content. We went with a variety of the server's tempting suggestions and then came the cheese cart! Seriously, the dinner lasted over 3 hours, but i hardly felt the time pass because i was enjoying myself so much!At the end of the meal, we were greeted by the chef and left with complementary muffins to enjoy the following morning.In short, the wait staff was kind courteous and very informative. Food was brought out at a very good pace and we never felt rushed or felt like we waited forever between dishes.I would highly recommend Guy Savoy for any special occasion. It will leave you with an unforgettable experience that you will cherish for years to come.Happy Eats!We had an exchange student from France at our high school whose favorite top compliment was "formidable!"  You'd have to hear her say this with her delightful accent.  For my meal at Guy Savoy, I often thought of Christelle and silently said "formidable!"I got the Signature Menu, a multi-course meal of wonderfully prepared and plated food.  Dinner started with what could be called 3 amuse-bouches although only one was called the amuse-bouche.  Shortly after getting comfortable, a server brings you a metal skewer of foie-gras with black truffle.  In a bit, you're brought another morsel, a 2 piece waffle with parmesan cheese.  Then the "official" amuse-bouche arrives.  It's a small cup of zucchini soup with some pine nuts.  You brush the nuts into the soup.  My server, Kriste, suggested I check under the cup when I was done for something else.  Sure enough, there was a small piece of pork belly to enjoy when the main part was finished.The first course was the chestnut course.  There was chestnut purée, small whole chestnuts, sliced mushrooms, and chestnut soup.  It was marvelous.  I haven't eaten chestnuts since I was a teen.  The second course was called the Colors of Caviar--layers of caviar in different forms topped by a layer of caviar sabayon.  A server suggested inserting the flat spoon all the way down and getting some of each layer.  Very nice!During this time, I had one piece of lemon bread from the bread cart.  You're automatically brought two pieces of bread after being seated and I didn't want to fill up on bread.  I have to go again and try the sea weed bread.  They had a very nice selection.Course three was whole stuffed red mullet.  The head of the fish was discretely covered by a leaf of cooked spinach. The fish was stuffed with very thinly sliced mushrooms and spinach.  It was extraordinary!Course four was Foie-gras with a bitter infusion.  They bring a glass tea pot with a candle to your table.  In the tea pot, green tea is placed and consomée is added.  The foie-gras is prepared in the kitchen as the infusion heats.  Then the foie-gras arrives and the infusion is poured around the dish.  You're all given a small glass of the infusion to enjoy after each bite.  The foie-gras was perfectly seared on top.Course five was artichoke and black truffle soup served with a toasted mushroom brioche with black truffle butter.  The soup is completely water based--no cream or stock.  It's amazing how much flavor comes from the ingredients with just water!Course six was beef tenderloin (with bone marrow on top)--done according to your wishes when you order your meal--with a carrot paleron cannelloni.  The beef was so tender and flavorful. The carrot cannelloni was quite tasty and a very clever concept.Course seven was the cheese course.  There were many options on the cheese cart.  The cheeses were described very thoroughly.  I chose roquefort, a milder cheese from the Savoie region of France, and a more liquid, more full flavored cheese from the Loire Valley.  The plating is done in a way that the cheeses go from mildest to strongest or the other way around depending on where you start.  There's more bread here.  I got two slices, one of a fruit bread and one a nut bread.Then came a palate cleanser of chopped blackberry with fresh apple pieces and a small spoon of cinnamon crumb cubes.Course eight was the first dessert--Coconut six ways.  I can't remember all the ways but there was coconut soup, coconut granité, coconut soup, coconut tapioca, fresh coconut slices and one I don't remember.  Delightful!Course nine was the second dessert--chocolate fondant, crunchy praline, and a chicory cream.  Rich chocolate, a tasty cream to dip your fondant in, and the crunchy praline was superb!  A great ending--almost.Then the mignardises trolley was wheeled to the table.  There was such a large selection.  I made five choices, a stuffed grape, some jasmine marshmallow, a wonderful petit cheesecake, caramelized banana, and one other I don't remember.  I was on a food high!Service was extraordinary!  Kriste, the main server, was always attentive and there were two others.  Between the three, there was always an eye on my table to make sure I had anything I needed.  Near the end of the meal, Chef Chartron stopped by my table and introduced himself and asked about how the meal was.  This is always a nice touch.  Prior to dinner, Kriste gave me a tour of the restaurant including the Krug Room, one of only five in the world.  After dinner, she took me to the kitchen to speak with Chef Chartron and see the kitchen area.  Chef Chartron was working on a new menu and his chef's table had his papers on which he was writing his plans.  I found out there was a sub-kitchen two floors below and this is the finishing kitchen.  In summary, this was the most enjoyable meal I've had in Las Vegas.  Everything was exceptional--food, service, and surroundings!  This really deserves all five stars!***There are some great things about Guy Savoy like the lobster with beets in cold steam, the great service, and the nice dining room, but like other Las Vegas restaurants, it is very overpriced***Guy Savoy definitely reminds me of Joel Robuchon.  They both feature formal fine dining French cuisine from esteemed chefs and very expensive tasting menus and a la carte items as well as lavish bread carts and dessert trolleys.  The restaurants are quite different though.  Savoy has a minimalist and modern decor.  It feels much more elegant, comfortable and less distracting than the over-the-top and all over the place elegant decor at Robuchon.  Savoy also features much more personable service that is still professional and polite.In terms of the food, it is hard for me to compare Savoy to Robuchon because I had a few a la carte items at Savoy while I had a tasting menu with many, many courses at Robuchon.  In terms of bread, Robuchon is better.  Both feature a wide variety of bread, but I felt Robuchon's bread had better textures as well as much more distinct flavors (Robuchon's bread was warmer and felt fresher too).Robuchon's dessert trolley is significantly better than the one at Savoy.  Robuchon's lavish dessert trolley is an extravagant and over-the-top movable feast of sweets while Savoy is more of a small selection sweets on a nice tableside cart.  Variety is not the only reason why Robuchon is better.  The sweet treats at Robuchon have much better (and more interesting) flavors.In terms of the food, I had really good things at Robuchon and Savoy but nothing as good as what I have had at Bay Area fine dining spots like The French Laundry, Cyrus or Manresa.There were bright spots.  I really liked the lobster and jumbo lump crab with beets and cold steam from seaweed water.  There were great beet cups filled with creamy beet mousse and soft, fresh and moist crab.  There was also lobster carpaccio that was topped with minced golden beets; the beets had a great sweet flavor that was reminiscent of fruit.  There was also warm and nicely cooked lobster meat--fresh, moist and soft.There was even puff pastry topped with beet ribbons.  The finishing touch was great seaweed aroma from the cold steam that enveloped the food (cool effect and great fragrance).I also liked the mushroom brioche topped with black truffle butter.  The brioche was warm, buttery, crispy, and flaky (and the black truffle flavor was very prominent).  The accompanying black truffle and artichoke soup was just okay.The amuse of foie gras with brioche was good--rich, creamy and a great foie gras flavor.  The pumpkin soup amuse was good though surprisingly thin.Other courses were not as good.  The crab tart was just soggy and boring and I probably should have ordered the veal three ways as my entree.  They present the veal chop before they slice it and it was very nicely cooked--a great golden brown sear.My entree was a variety of game birds cooked in a pot.  The cooking in the pot yielded tender and moist meat, but there were no contrasts in textures so the meats were a little uninteresting.  I thought the pheasant was good.  I thought the squab was good too, but I prefer it when they achieve a crispy skin on squab.I was not a fan of the Mallard duck.  Like the squab, there was no crispy skin.  The flavor of the duck was very strong--interesting but not my favorite flavor.  The texture was off-putting.  The texture of the duck meat was squishy and a tad rubbery; it ended up being similar to the unique texture of squab.The garnishes were good though a tad rustic for such a fine dining spot.  There was some good sweet and sour cabbage and wild mushrooms.  There was also a nicely cooked, buttery and smooth foie gras.While the savory courses were a mix of good and average, I was not a fan of Savoy's desserts.  I ordered the coconut six ways and while I really liked the light and crispy coconut flakes and tapioca, I did not like the rest of the dish.  It was like various bland ingredients in water.The mignardises from the trolley were okay; the pate de fruit was kind of hard and overly sugared.  The dark chocolate ice cream was rich and good though and I liked the flavor of the earl grey sorbet with English cream and black pepper. As mentioned, service was good; prices were too high, but that is often the case with high-end Vegas restaurants.I did not love Robuchon, but I preferred it to Savoy.  There were some nice things about Savoy, but the food is just too expensive for just so many okay dishes.  I think your money would be much better spent on a dinner at an upscale Bay Area spot like Manresa.  If you do want a nice dinner in Vegas, I recommend the much more price friendly Picasso or L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (seasonal tasting menu).Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both free valet and self parking.Restaurant Guy Savoy serves French Cuisine & has 2 Michelin Stars. My love & I like French food, so we had to give it a try! "Restaurant Guy Savoy has been listed as one of the country's hottest restaurants by Bon Appetit, given a 3  1/2 (out of 4) star rating by Los Angeles Times food critic S. Irene Virbilla, called "the best restaurant in Las Vegas and one of the finest anywhere" by Newsweek and was a finalist for the James Beard Foundation's Best New Restaurant award." The ambience at Restaurant Guy Savoy was very intimate and romantic. The service was great, the staff was so pleasant, and the overall experience was very much enjoyable. We left all smiles and very satisfied, we even got a private tour of the Kitchen, and met with Guy Savoy's son. Splendid, Beautifully arranged Bread Carts for you to choose your freshly baked breads from.  Choice of unsalted or salted butter provided for you at the table. Amuse Bouche IFoie Gras  & Black Truffle Brioche Amuse II Parmesan Crusted WaffleAmuse III Soup w. a "surprise" underneath/ on the flip side. Special intricate attention was paid to everything they sent out. I thought the table set glasswares etc. were absolutely adorable! I'd like a set for myself! The colors were so subtle and elegant, and I loved the colored reflections off the glass. Pumpkin Soup Winter Flavor was delightful Steam Cod & Licorice Flavor- I must add that I am typically not fond of licorice, but found this dish quite nice. My love ordered a beautifully presented veal shank w. seasonal vegetables & potato puree that the server brought out to showcase to us prior to serving it. Dessert was Coconut served Six Ways --- so very pleasant & left me wanting more.  Posh Dessert/ Pastry Trolleys for us to choose from at the end of our meal served w. Coffee or Tea was very nice & tasteful! Overall, we had a great experience here, and plan to come here again. *On a side note, we receive Christmas/Happy New Year Cards from Restaurant Guy Savoy every year!This review is for my dining experience in January 2011Had the most amazing dining experience at Guy Savoy on a recent trip to Las Vegas. Not only is the food incredible, but the staff is attentive and they go out of there way to accommodate their guests. Don't feel like you have to order one of the tasting menus. You can get away with a selection of a la cart dishes, and be just fine. Some helpful hints if you're going to be splurging on a meal like this, that is of course assuming you're not accustomed to spending $400 per person on dinner). Oh, and if you want to see photos of everything we ate, so you know what you expect, you can see everything on my food website here: http://eatsporkjew.com/restaurants/guy-savoy-the-lost-art-of-storytelling/1.) don't plan on ordering dessert, and make sure you save room for it. As a "thank you" for dining at Guy Savoy, they roll out an entire dessert cart which has everything from cakes, to puddings, to mousses, to cookies, to ice cream, to candies, etc. And it's all complimentary and you can have as much as you'd like. 2.) Try to make a reservation on the earlier side of the evening. The reason for this is that you want to have access to all of their delicious fresh baked breads. They have a bread cart with a lot of different bread types, and apparently, their bacon bread is the most amazing carb-tastic bite you'll ever have. But they only make about 36 rolls a day, and they're not used to say "no" to their guests. By the time we got the bread cart for a 7:45pm reservation, all the bacon bread was gone. I wasn't too upset about this, but it's just something to think about. Believe me, you'll get plenty of delicious food to eat. 3.) If you're lucky, and I think you just need to ask, you can visit the kitchen and see the private dining table in the back. It was cool to do this. 4.) if you're a dinner party of two, order a la cart, and ask them to split each dish for serving. And this is a testament to how amazing the service is at a restaurant like this, but when they split the dishes, they actually serve you a little more of each one. A lesser restaurant would literally just split a single dish, and both people would miss out on the effect of a full plate with the fantastic presentation. Not at Guy Savoy!Michelin Stars #38-39Oh Vegas, such a perfect town for indulgence and gluttony. Guy Savoy (not pronounced how you'd think) was chosen as a nice special dinner for my wife and myself, for no reason other than to live it up. Being an old married couple and knowing dinner could be 3+ hours, we took the earliest reservation at 6pm. The space was grand and empty upon arrival and we were seated with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains to the south. The mostly white decor was only interrupted but the occasional ultra-bright piece of "art," all of which I loved. After a quick glance at the menu, the only option worth considering was the full Innovation menu with a shared wine pairing. And now on to the show!1. Foie and Toast Amuse: What's not to love about foie anything, truffles, and some crisp bread to add some texture. A perfect way to say hello while having your ear licked with taste.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#q-5nZctMRztBoHuzI-9IiA2. Waffle and Parmesan Amuse: Kind of a weird one but god damn if that wasn't one of the best bites of waffle I've ever had. Another wow bite. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#k-HfOiDwUHjQDk2yS_A-Ug3. The Bread Cart: Dude, they make this every single morning. I guess it's less impressive when you consider the small army of people in the bowels of these hotels that are there 24/7 doing everything. But somewhere down there is someone making over a dozen different types of artisanal bread just for Guy Savoy. We tried over half the selection over the course of dinner and they were all amazing and better.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#CeIpoN0mqYabwMCCuRhM2A4. Tomato Amuse:And the "ooos" and "aaahhs" just kept coming from us with this one. They must have made five or six different types of intricate tomato preparations just to combine into something that took two bites. Every area of tomato flavor was highlighted, from the sweet to the vinegar, and it was masterfully finished with a nibble of a tomato chip.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#kgqj-Czz4DtXuRe4HMI7wg5. "Concassé" of Oysters:Concasse is the French culinary word for crushed or ground up. Here it was a dish of oyster pieces topped with seaweed and an amazing lemon granite. Bite after bite was amazing, we couldn't get over how perfectly well the chopped oysters worked with the crunchy lemon ice. It was everything you could ever want from an oyster dish. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#gVFhIUDM1qU2dkxH3XxtsA6. Langoustine in Cold Steam:At this point we were sure they couldn't keep up with this level of amazing food, but they did and did so with one of the more over the top presentations I've seen;Click play - http://instagram.com/p/dsw_tpTRCa/Basically what you have here are two preparations of langoustine on a perforated plate, over a bowl of dry ice, that then has a nori broth poured into it creating the "steam" effect. What it really did do was to add a lovely and visible aroma to the place of amazingly delicate langoustine sashimi. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#HVKWHN7wRaciqzmZzUiHFw7.  Asparagus, Caviar and "Fresh" Cheese:The title of the dish pretty much gives it away. Though again, the presentation was beautiful, the flavors all wowed, and the cheese foam was closer to a meringue in texture. But hot damn, that was some damn fine caviar. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#5ubR8rXxh6w0WRwNHKzo2Q8. Salmon Iceberg:This is the first time I've ever had a chef "cook" something tableside on a block of dry ice;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#71j9M9W4E8w5KRyMX73O9wServed by head chef Mathieu Chartron, he graciously rattled off the thinking behind this unique preparation as he plated our ice cold salmon and proceeded to top it off with a very hot broth. The resulting hot/cold mixture was divine. Hard to say for certain if the dry ice treatment really did much, but it was very fun and ended in more oooos and aaahhs from us. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#wGN_mNDWyRB53ISlRUzaqg9. Lobster:I really need the before pic to show how this one played out. Basically a nice piece of lobster was presented with a few cylinder shaped veggies on the parameter. Then the servers went on to unwarp each of the veggie rolls and layer them atop the lobster, then topped it all with a wonderful smoked butter sabayon sauce. The result wasn't as pretty as the start, but the flavor combination worked its magic once again on us.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#3FQkZzS66MKZzfEnssoHkg***Second half of review is somewhere above or below this****REVIEW #400.Vegas' penultimate restaurant.  Hailing from Michelin three star pedigree, Restaurant Guy Savoy Paris, earning two on it's own before the Guide abandoned the city, is an experience to savor.  Dishes are innovative but prepared in a classic style (no molecular gastronomy or modernist cuisine) showing classic French refinement and restraint.  The progression of courses near perfect with the memory of a flavor from the previous dish enhancing or contrasting playfully with the next.  Beautiful plating with every ingredient contributing to the dish.  The ambiance, contemporary elegant.  The service, flawless but not stuffy.  A true Michelin star experience.Tip:  Opt for a multi course menu. The Innovation - Inspiration Menu ($348) is incredible.  Multiple amuses, ten innovative courses, and multiple desserts in a near perfect progression.  It features many of the signature dishes of the Paris restaurant including the incredible artichoke and black truffle soup.  Velvety smooth, rich from a touch of cream, brooding sweet vegetal flavor of artichokes perfumed by the unmistakable scent of shaved black truffle accented by shaved, aged parmesan.  A mushroom brioche spread with black truffle butter accompanies the soup.  Sensory overload.  Something more innovative?  Caviar with frozen celery root mousse.   A bite, the caviar flavor shines then a bite of the mousse, a hint of vegetal flavor then as the mousse thaws, an explosion of celery flavor that cleans the palette for the next bite.  Think drinking a frozen vodka shot.Dishes and menus are seasonal.  Be on the lookout for the "prestige" menus.  The current black truffle prestige ($420), outstanding.  A truffle prepared in many variations that it never gets boring.  From being the featured ingredient of an acidic winter marche salad to a background note in a duck consommé, sublime.Massive wine list with emphasis on France.  Very good vintage depth.  Very high Vegas resort pricing.  A cognac lounge features some of the rarest pours to be found including the 140 year aged Hardy Perfection and the ultra limited edition, Hennessy Ellipse.Only pet peeve, the restaurant should prohibit the use of mobiles and the taking of photos.  There is nothing more irritating than flashes going off in the dining room as guest take photos of their plate.A true foodie or balling out of control?  This place is for you.  Then again, if you consider a multi course menu in the Paris restaurant cost between €360 - €490 and the airfare another $6,500 ($1,000 supplement for Hawaii yeeps), you're getting 95 percent off.  What a bargain!!!This is one of the world's great restaurants. Yes it's expensive. If you have to choose between Guy Savoy and your rent, please pay your rent.  Also, don't let this be your first fine dining experience.  You'll never be able to calibrate dinner out again.  It would be much like flying premier or first class on your inaugural international flight. It becomes the standard you expect from all restaurants. We enjoyed the Innovation Tasting Menu and wine parings. Course after course of exquisite food. There were some things not to my liking such as the smoked quail. Using mesquite it's quite easy to over smoke the food even for the most skilled chef.  My palate was dented even though the course was paired with a stand out Cote Rotie.  However, the pan roasted quail was wonderful.You can view the Innovation Menu online.  Each course was meticulously prepared.  The food was outstanding.  I experienced flavor combinations that I could have never imagined.  Artichoke and black truffle.  Foie Gras and Quinoa with Bellota Ham infusion.  Sea Urchin and poached potato with lime and chili. Caviar with frozen pea mousse.  A5 Wagyu with some sort of savory sponge cake. Lobster with smoked butter sabayon.  The bread cart. Seaweed loaf. The simple baguette. Two butters were on the table along with flur de sel and cracked pepper. The cheese course was a treat. We were provided an accommodation of a little touch of Epoisses along with our ricotta herb menu item. I simply mentioned it and poof it happened. Desserts were fabulous. You can read about them elsewhere.  There is no other grade to give this restaurant other than a five.  It is fine dining. Service was attentive and professional. Not the typical French brigade. It was both formal and appropriately causal, pointedly professional but elegant and human. Staff was there to help and assist you enjoy the meal. Sommelier was knowledgeable and helpful.  Service was genuine not faux. If you are a foodie, prepare to become giddy.  Be sure your rent is paid in advance.Had the tasting menu here and enjoyed the presentation and taste of all the dishes. I found the cheese and dessert carts phenomenal! It was what I loved most about this restaurant as they had such a vast variety to choose from. However, I'm not sure if the masses can justify that it was "worth the money." Though I still constantly dream of the cheese cart and its superb selection of sweet accompaniments to enjoy with it.My husband and I came here for our anniversary a few weeks ago.  To be honest, I didn't think I'd be that stuffed at the end our meal due to some of the photos I saw on Yelp.  I was so so wrong.  We did the course menu that fit in best with our time.  We had a show to catch by 10 and our dinner was at 6.  What's great is that they ask you immediately if there are any time constraints you are under and let you know which course meals you should avoid.  The food was amazing.  Really.  Everything that came out was exceptional.  What made it even better was the service.  Everyone from the sommelier, the hostess and servers were top notch.  I'd love to return, and plan on coming back for another special night.Wowed by a first visit to Guy Savoy at Caesars Palace when Franck Savoy was still the man in charge, the reasons for a delayed return to the Augustus Tower temple of gastronomy are largely related to too little time and too much travel, but invited last minute to sit down for a few a la carte items after a particularly trying two-months and past 24 hours the timing proved perfect, nearly every bite absolutely superlative under the toque of Chef Mathieu Chartron.Still one of the most serene rooms in the city, the minimalistic art and white walls a strange departure from the more elaborate decorations found at the Paris namesake though the divided rooms and well adorned lounge reminisce of the space along the Seine, it was with Champagne and three signature canapes that the experience started, the bread cart soon parked tableside with no less than a dozen options from which to choose.Gilding supple loaves with smooth Echire butter that makes one regretful of times they have ever had to settle for less, it was with choices navigated that the night's amuse arrived - the newly hatched item straight from Innovation-Inspiration Menu thrilling with a creamy croquette of octopus and quinoa served atop a glass dome as the flavors of eggplant, capers, tomatoes, and peppers each came across full and robust alongside a plancha-finished tentacle clearly benefited by a previous slow poach and showy 'cold steam.'Progressing to starters there was clearly a differing focus between mine and the whims of my tablemate, yet as delicious as the seared slice of foie gras that I received was in a verbena broth reined in by the flavors of red cabbage it was my friend's salad that truly wowed both of us - the sizable bites of crustacean every bit as fresh as expected while the textural variations of vegetables and tapioca stabilized dressing were entirely enthralling, each bite offering something entirely different with the slightest bit of heat left to linger on each bite.Having debated the Dover Sole, but opining for other things in assuming the whole fish a bit much for two, a surprise visit from Chef Chartron saw us gifted two tasting-sized portions of the delicately roasted flesh and taking a path infrequently traveled by presenting the fish with pickled vegetables plus the bold taste of balsamic an entirely different side of a classic was seen, the light buttery notes  accentuated by the acid with just enough sweetness to offset a dusting of earthy mixed spice.Finding service a bit more serious than one might have preferred, particularly as we were seated in a side room separated from the majority of those present in the main dining area, entrees arrived paired to a second round of bread and with portions quite substantial it was here that my selection proved superior to that of my dining partner, the tender quails losing some of their definition amidst sabayon served straight from an eggshell and mushroom stuffed vegetables that trended a touch too bitter while rosy duck breast was succulence studded in peanuts, the crispy confit and stack of beets with cheese no less divine,Turning attention next to the cheese trolly, a somewhat limited selection that thankfully saw each option aged nicely along with honeycomb, blueberry confiture, and two additional varieties of bread it was with slow indulgence that a feature so rarely seen in Las Vegas was enjoyed and progressing to dessert with a long-lingering splash of Sauternes a second trolly was presented along with a pure-black plate entitled Noir, the dark chocolate fondant and sorbet dancing with a tinge of peppercorn while each of fifteen smaller sweets were as memorable as those from my first visit, the rice pudding perhaps the best in the city while the Vanilla Ice Cream rivals the best tasted to date.With world class ingredients and a Chef that continues to up the ante on top of a menu of classics that those unfamiliar are encouraged to experience if it is at all within their means, Guy Savoy remains one of Las Vegas' top tables for those serious about fine dining, though overly serious service at times fails to replicate the 'joie de vivre' seen at the flagship overseas.

Restaurant name  Osteria Papavero

Review Text :
How have I not written a review about my favorite Italian place in Madison?  Probably didn't want to get the word out but looking at the reviews, it is definitely out.  Small, rustic, no pretense but serving great food and drinks.  While the items on the menu are solid (pappardelle with wild boar is always a fave), I really think the restaurant shines through their specials.  My last visit was during lunch and I had an incredible gnocchi with braised lamb leg.  The housemade potato gnocchi was soft and pillowy and paired well with the rich and hearty lamb. I love that the restaurant serves as a blank canvas to the food and diners that come eat here.  It is just as comfortable for a business lunch as it is for a romantic dinner.My new favorite!For those of you that are keeping score, Papavero stole the number one spot from my former fave, Nostrano.Every dish. Every single appetizer, entree, cocktail, and dessert that I have tasted here has been spectacular. There are roughly 12 daily changing specials written on the chalkboard. Many of those specials are fresh seafood - hard to come by in Madison. I would tell you to stick to the specials because they're so fun and different, but lately I've been grateful that the braised boar papardelle was on the menu so I could come back for more of it.One tip:Ask for an Amaro as a digestif after your dinner! Your server can explain what it is if you've never heard of it.Putting in to words how much I adore Papavero is about as hard as I imagine it is for a server there to remember the countless specials they rattle off (which rotate) nightly.But ya know what, they seem to get through it, and so will I. The primary reason I'm at Osteria Papavero several times a month is the fact that the place is consistent beginning, middle to end. Despite the resto being obscenely busy when I've tried to snag a table, someone is able to greet me and give me an anticipated wait time within moments of walking in the door. It's that level of attentiveness that starts the experience off on the right note. From there, it just gets better. Whether you have to sit at the bar and imbibe and snack before a table is ready, or if you're lucky enough to snag seats right away, the cocktail menu is a must before you even consider savories and wine to sip. Im pretty partial to the Bugado Bianco (Koval Levant spelt whiskey, Cinzano Bianco,Bitter Cube cherry bark vanilla bitters), crisp, clean and absolutely perfect any time of year. Their barrel aged Boulevardier is also stellar if you're looking for something a bit more spirit food. When it comes to food, don't even open your menu until your server describes the specials in chalkboard. The level of detail they go into as they cover each is so rich, you'll want to order them as a thank you for summarizing them so well. Because I don't dig lactose, I can't say whether or not the cream based dishes or cheese filled pastas are good, but if it's on the chalkboard and if it's mostly dairy free, I've eaten it and I've loved it! Inside the menu the Zuppa di Funghi is unreal, it puts all other mushroom soups you've eaten to shame. Wild mushrooms (I can count at least 4 varietals), tomato and wine; that's it! It's a pricey way to start your meal coming in at $9, but the grilled bread served alongside it is worth at least $10. And you know what, I've tried to recreate the dish at home and it failed miserably, so I'm ok paying a premium for something stellar that I can't repeat. Antipasto di Mare (seafood) and Antipasto Misto di Verdure (veggie) are always spot on, and about the latter, Papavero knows how to turn veggie loathers into veggie lovers. These starters typically feature a variety of four smaller bites to share with the table or devour on your own. When talk turns to entrees, there's like more that needs to be said about the wild board papardelle than ORDER IT! And if you don't crave carbs or aren't wild about wild boar (but seriously, get this) the selection of grilled meats is magic. It's certainly not for those looking for something lighter, but if you're intrigued by the offerings (which rotate) the night you're there, split that meat! Turn the menu over if you dig dessert, there's usually about 6 different options. And while I know people go bananas for the budino, it's their honey and pine nut tart that tops a bowl of budino (which is still insanely awesome). The tart is nutty, not to sweet and the perfect size, a sliver of heaven, making me feel like I'm not indulging too much. And because it's packed with pine nuts, I've decided it's actually not dessert at all, but an after dinner savory. And while we're talking after dinner, sip (or shoot!) some Amaro, the Italian way, nay, the ONLY way to end an awesome meal. They have a plentiful collection and information about them all, so hit bartenders up for info and learn a little while you digest. Two other quickies I want to gush about:-Those that note the small space and feel it's not a stellar spot for groups, listen up! I was there one night when they brought tables together for 20 so it can be done! It was towards the end of dinner service, so if you're looking to dine in a large group, consider the time, and you may want to give a call and ask if there's space. While they don't take reservations they'll be able to tell you if they can accommodate your large party.-As I mentioned earlier, lactose and I aren't friends, so I ask for the Zuppa di Funghi sans sprinkling of cheese every time I go. Well check this out, last time they were so concerned about dairy and so willing to make accommodate that they brought out some vegan bread! It was unexpected but nothing like that grilled bread :) but I was so grateful for their effort!

Review Text :
Pretty, pretty good.  This place is tucked away behind The Bentley Projects just south of downtown Phoenix.  You can't see it from the street, and there's not really anything around except some empty lots and the gallery; apparently you just need to be in the know ... and you want to be in the know.  Nice outdoor seating, not too crowded, and great food.  It's a lunch place, and the menu was mostly upscale salads and sandwiches (brie, goat cheese, sundried tomatoes, etc.).  I just stuck with the turkey club on focaccia, and it was mmm, good.  It also came with a white bean salad that was really good.  Plus, the dessert and drinks looked/were fantastic.  I really want to try the banana pudding and the frozen hot chocolate (which I tried to order, but I think the waitress said they were out of chocolate, what?).  They had a bunch of crazy-but-amazing-sounding lattes, cute mini-cakes (I had the carrot cake, which was good, but a little too much on the frosting; I could barely taste the cake), and super-good looking cookies (I bought a cute bunny rabbit sugar cookie for my friend, and it was sitting on my desk all afternoon, its little bunny eyes taunting me and daring me to bite off one of its bunny ears).Downsides -- The service was slow, the indoor seating didn't look too great (the music inside was yuck), and it's not exactly cheap (cookies were three dollars, mini-cakes were five, and I think the cheapest sandwich was nine bucks).It's a good thing the bread is so tasty because they sure skimp on the goodies in the middle. My ham sandwich on baguette had the tiniest amount of meat I was sure it was a joke. Perhaps Alan Funt was waiting in back and soon I would hear "Smile. You're on Candid Camera." My friend John's roasted chicken sandwich, while tastier than mine, was also in the "more bread than meat" club. I could hear the late Clara Pelet from the Wendy's commercials saying "Where's the beef?" Thoroughly enjoyed the sparse modern decor and I love how it's tucked away behind the Bentley Projects. You feel cool just finding it. Hours are funky so make sure you call first. I'm sure I'll go back....perhaps for a salad next time!

Light!  Refreshing!    We tried Fresco (and bingsoo) for the first time Saturday night.  Did I mention it was light and refreshing?These folks take pride in the product they sell.  Light, refreshing (did I mention that yet) frozen yogurt and carefully sliced fresh fruit on top of finely shaved ice with a drizzle of mango glaze.  Light and refreshing and so much healthier than DQ.  We'll be back for more and to try the boba.

Review Text :
3.5 starsI guess you can say I have a little bit of chef-crush on Tom Colicchio.  I mean, he's not the only one.  I guess another one is Hubert Keller.  But I digress.Creeping in the shadows of his Las Vegas fine dining eatery, Craftsteak, is it's more laid back, little brother, 'Wichcraft.  Nice play on words, Tom, nice play.The layout and decor is pretty laid back and simple, which obviously is the point of a casual eatery.They have a decent variety of cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, paninis, salads, and a couple of soups, as well as a couple of sweet items.  I eventually decided on a panini that had roasted pork, coppa, pepper relish, and fontina cheese on country bread.  It came simply wrapped in parchment paper but did not include a side, no chips or anything.  Oh well, whatever.I opened up the paper and it appeared somewhat simple and smelled pretty good.  Upon first bite, the pork was pretty good and not dry and the fontina cheese was good.  The bread was not too crunchy, thus the top of my mouth was saved from being ripped to shreds.While it wasn't the best panini I've ever had, it was still pretty good and I hear the breakfast sandwiches/paninis are pretty good, so next time I'm in Vegas and find myself at the MGM, I would probably stop by again.Were my expectations high coming in here? Sure. But it's not like I was looking for Colicchio to get his shiny head all sweaty making me a sammy in the back. I simply thought they'd have an interesting menu of overpriced, but delicious 'wich's. Wrong. The menu is boring, the sammies are small and, as expected, the prices are high (peep the pic of my slow-roasted pork pressed 'wich). Bleh. I wouldn't be proud of that sammich if I made it in my own kitchen. Stumbling out of Wet Republic? You'll do just fine here. For everyone else, look elsewhere for good eats.

Review Text :
I love this place.  I have had only a couple poor experiences with food here. One was a veggie burrito, What the hell was I thinking?  It blew.  Everything else I have had here has been amazing.  My personal favorite is the Chicken Quesadilla it is a taste de force.  The tacos are all the bomb diggity.  They are exactly like street tacos you would get in Mexico or from a taco stand on the streets in Phoenix.Another good thing about this place, unlike other taco stand type places I have patronized, this one has never turned my GI tract into a Wal-Mart the day after thanksgiving. You know, lot's of traffic and little to show for it when the day is done.Another Yelper said that a "good looking family" owns Mi Casita.  I will translate this for you.  He really meant to say "The family that owns this place has a  smoking hot daughter."  I have stared into her eyes many time trying to remember what in the world I came in for.  She has eyes like the lady in the famous National Geographic cover photo.Go to this place.Mmm.... I am starving.

Restaurant name  Japonais
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Great bar located in atrium area of the Mirage Hotel and Casino. This bar has an indoor/outdoor feel to it because of the skylight and slightly elevated space just above the casino floor. The vibe is contemporary Japanese, with an elegant aesthetic and very uncomfortable seating. :)The signature drinks that we girls ordered were pretty disappointing (sake sangria and some cucumber martini), however the drinks the guys had were red bull vodkas and were mixed well. Japonaise serves food late, however I didn't bother to look at the menu because of the mind blowing dinner at Sushisamba (review to follow) we had beforehand. The bar is open until 2am and they have a few TV screens in the bar area and are viewable pretty much anywhere you sit.Restaurant Week has arrived in Vegas and what better opportunity to check out a few restaurants while helping a worthy cause?Japonais was among the many restaurants listed, but their menu was the most diverse with quite a few selections to choose from as well.Arriving for an early dinner on this Labor Day Monday, we were seated along the back after requesting a side by side seating.  We were both surprised with the interior of this restaurant and the sushi bar.For $50.08 per person, we had a three course dinner ahead of us.To start, appetizers to choose from included Crab Cakes, Lobster Spring Rolls, Hawaiian Hamachi, Ahi Tuna Ceviche, Spicy Tuna Maki, etc.  We both chose the "Kobe Carpaccio with soy, ginger, pearl onions and tempura shallots."  What a divine appetizer to start with!  Delicately sliced and presented on a rectangular plate, the crunchiness from the shallots and sweetness from the onions provided a perfect balance.  The Big F was in complete heaven!Entree choices ranged from Seafood Toban Yaki, Ahi Tuna Steak, Salmon Japonais, Chestnut Chicken, and Le Quack Japonais.  We both decided on the "Petite Filet Mignon with truffle potato puree, grilled asparagus and uni butter."  The 4 oz. filet was cooked perfectly rare with a very good flavor.  The uni butter was a nice touch, but the potato puree and thick syrupy sauce made the meal so decadent and rich.  Instead of the grilled asparagus, we substituted with grilled broccolini.  It provided a nice crunch and contrast to the silky smooth potato puree.Dessert was a "Trio of Chef's Specialties" that included their Kabocha Cheesecake "Japanese pumpkin cheesecake with an almond cookie crust", their "Chocolate Ginger Mousse Cake" with gold flecks, and vanilla bean ice cream.  A generous dessert after such a rich meal.  The mousse cake was light, but also quite dense with flavor and richness.  The cheesecake had a more unique flavor, especially with the nice crust.  And a scoop of good vanilla ice cream and fresh berries always complements a dessert well, and provides a nice finish.Service was great.  Our water was always refilled before it ever reached the half mark, and our waitress was thorough and friendly.  She came by often to check on us and let us know the status of our order.  Overall, we had a fabulous experience with great food and good service.  It's a bit pricey for their sushi since they sell their nigiri by the piece!  But the Big F enjoyed the meal so much that he'd be willing to go back again this week just to enjoy it again!Side notes:* Industry night: 50% off industry menu every Wednesday in their lounge.* Late Night Dining: Late night menu every Thursday, Friday, & Saturday until 1 am.(Pics of our dinner are posted!)Japonais was actually on my "to try" list....but in New York. I remember passing by it near Union Square and wondering if the fusion would be too coy for my taste...or maybe too koi? OK, I thought that was funny. Anyway, I don't have to waste a meal on my next trip to Manhattan since the owners opened an outpost here in the Mirage in Vegas. I can well imagine this place has the same, coolish vibe as its sister eateries in New York and Chicago. But you have to bear the ongoing hum of the casino and the unending stream of foot traffic passing by. The verdict on the food? Pretty good but kinda spartan on the portions. Jamie W. and I were at the Mirage to see the Cirque de Soleil show, this one an elaborate Beatles tribute called "Love" just right across the floor. The hotel concierge was pressing Japonais on us as a dining option, and our apathy made us cave. They offer a Lounge Dinner for Two for $45 - which allows you and a companion to eat at the bar and have two appetizers and then share an entree and a dessert. That's not really a terrible deal - but the meal did leave us hungry after the show. We tried the Lobster Spring Rolls and the Sweet and Sour Calamari for starters (see my photos). The three rolls were good and crunchy, though I honestly couldn't tell if they did contained lobster in them. However, the mango relish and blood orange vinaigrette were nice tropical accents. The calamari had nice texture and came clumped together in a sweet sauce undercut by a wasabi vinaigrette. Against all odds, it worked especially with the black sesame seeds sprinkled on top. For our entree, Jamie and I split the Chestnut Chicken which was nicely marinated in a lemon ginger sauce. It came with a shiitake rice casserole with corn and peas and some sauteed brocollini (see my photo). Tasty though hardly what I would call fusion. Just wish I got more than half a breast. For dessert, it was the Chocolate Indulgence, a little mousse cake heavy on chocolate and ginger (see my photo). We were probably out of the place in less than forty minutes, and I have to say the service was perfectly adequate. You could do a lot worse in Vegas. After all, what you eat in Vegas stays in Vegas, at least in their city sewage system. FOOD - 4 stars...pretty good for a lounge menu, but I would have paid more to be truly satisfied AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...coolish, trendy with lots of loud tourists around the bar SERVICE - 4 stars...never felt ignored, that's for sure TOTAL - 4 stars...still seems pricey for what you get, and splitting dishes in Vegas just seems so wrongAfter seeing the Beatles' show LOVE, we discovered Japonais in the Mirage. I LOVE Vegas food and this our meal at Japonais was one of the best I've ever had in Vegas. Now, if only I knew how to pronounce the name so I could recommend it more often without embarrassment... I think we ordered about everything on the menu. We wanted to try it all! We each chose a glass of yummy wine and then dove into the delicious food. We asked for the dishes to be delivered as they were ready. It seemed that with each new dish, the food got even better! Our server who brought out each dish was a sweet older lady too and so polite and thoughtful!The sushi rolls particularly stood out as so-incredibly-fresh (had this with periods before for affect but Yelp thought it was a URL!)! Every single sauce that accompanied a dish was incredible too. The food was all melt-in-your-mouth delicious!When I raved about Japonais, one of my friends told me she thinks there is one in NYC too. I wonder if it could possibly be as good as the Japonais at the Mirage?!Trying to decide where to dine in Vegas is like trying to decide what one item of clothing to take from the Vogue fashion closet.  Seriously.  On our first night in Vegas for convention we decided to stay at the hotel (Mirage) since we were pretty tired.  Japonais had a promising menu so we made reservations.Service was friendly and efficient.  I ordered two sushi rolls which were good.  The tempura app was also tasty.  I would have liked to have had time to sit in the lounge area pre- dinner, but I was a little busy engaging in some retail therapy.  ;)  All in all, Japonais is a nice place to grab a bite to eat.After leaving Sushisamba (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushisamba-las-vegas#hrid:1dxUEuHDmW5jPCEoH82cCA) hungry and disappointed, I decided to try my luck at Japonais. I sat at the bar close to the grill where the chef was prepping all the Robata (various foods skewered and grilled on Japanese charcoal bincho tan). The bartender promptly gave me a menu and was happy to explain the menu items that I had questions about. I ordered their Sake Martini (sake and shochu shaken with fresh cucumber) and sipped that deliciously refreshing cocktail while perusing my food options. For starters I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tartare topped with quail egg and caviar (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA?select=o2MJ5pijZGP0tMLBPgDSEg#EzU5HRGJcy15ctY6qinvMg). The presentation of the dish was beautiful and I loved that the chive sprigs on top had their ends wrapped in gold leaves. Nothing makes a woman feel more luxurious than some gold in her food! The thin cucumber slices added a nice crunch to the well seasoned, fresh tuna. I had never had Robata before, so I opted for the Shitake Mushrooms that were dashi marinated with some sea salt and the Red Snapper Kama - fish cheeks with sea salt and ponzu sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA?select=o2MJ5pijZGP0tMLBPgDSEg#o2MJ5pijZGP0tMLBPgDSEg). The mushrooms were juicy and had great texture. The fish cheeks were absolutely phenomenal. The amount of salt was perfect and the meat right off the cheek bone was simply divine. I don't recall ever having such tender, succulent grilled fish. The grill added some nice crunchy char marks on the outside. Although I was already full, I couldn't resist the Kabocha Cheesecake - Japanese pumpkin cheesecake served with five-spiced pineapple mousse and almond cookie crust. Heaven ensued. The pumpkin was not very apparent (just as the bartender had informed me), the spiced pineapple had the perfect sweet & spicy combo going on and all the ingredients just paired so well together.A lovely quick dinner experience at the bar - would definitely come back for the snapper cheeks and soem more sake martinis!!!Before seeing Al Pacino in the Terry Fator Showroom, I came to Japonais for something different.  I had studied the menu online and knew what I was getting before I even sat down.My server came quickly and took my drink order--some iced green tea.  We then talked about appetizers that wouldn't be too large.  I didn't want to order something meant for sharing.  I asked about the ahi tuna ceviche and he said that would be good for a single diner.  I ordered that and the Le Quack Japonais for my main course.I was brought the ahi ceviche as it was excellent.  The yuzu and white soy marinade was very good!  It was a 3 ounce serving and just perfect for a starter.Then same Le Quack.  The duck was fantastic!  It came with condiments for putting on the duck in the mushu wraps.  There were four items--a mango chutney with some red pepper, Japanese cabbage shreds, green onion ends also shredded and some spicy plum sauce. I was surprised that I ate all the wraps but one with my meal.  The toppings were so good and great accompaniments to the very good duck!Next up, dessert.  I asked my server about different desserts.  I opted for the most popular one, the Kabocha cheesecake.  It's a cheesecake with a crust made from crushed almond cookies, with a layer of Japanese pumpkin cheesecake, topped by a layer of five spice  pineapple mousse.  The cheesecake is not as creamy as some we're used to because of the circular pot in which it's baked.  But, take the spoon and go down through the pineapple mousse and grab some of the pumpkin and the combination is outstanding!  A real winner.Service throughout the evening was first rate!  It turned out that my server, David, was the captain.  He was polite, helpful, and friendly!  He gave me his business card with a small gift for the next time I'm at Japonais and I got the 20% locals discount MGM Resorts is offering Nevada residents at many of their restaurants for a limited time.  This dinner was a great way to start off a super evening at the Mirage.  Al Pacino was excellent!

These folks pour a DRINK for $3 on Saturdays! They have daily specials and the Saturday special is $3 SoCo or Three Olives. Saturdays also offer a turkey cheeseburger and fries for $5, but I didn't try it. You can see all their specials by hovering your cursor over the day of the week on their home page (http://www.16th.st/index.html)It was NOT crowded when we cruised in for the Sun Devil game this past weekend. We were greeted by a guest who asked if we had a reservation and then hollered to the waitress who said there may be a wait. At least they have a sense of humor!The advantage for us was we got to take our pick of the TV we wanted to view the game. There were two Texas Hold 'Em poker tables going (not my thing so I don't know specifics) and I saw pool tables in a separate area -- photos on the website make it look like there's shuffleboard too.Definitely looking forward to going back. It was a great place to watch a game. I'll have to try the food next time and maybe they'll get a bump to 4 stars (although, I observed their nachos are real cheese nachos, and I'm a fake cheese nacho girl so I'm gonna have to pick another game day food!)I can't understand why so many people give this place terrible reviews. Its a sports bar for shitsake, what do you expect? I don't care what anyone else says, this place makes the cut for any sports fan in need of a venue with massive TV's, greasy bar food and plenty of beer. Cheap beer I may add. They also have cheap drinks. $3 for a bloody Mary whose mix is comparable to my beloved Zing Zang.. I think YES. There is a covered outdoor patio, so even the smoker sports fans of America can fully enjoy themselves, without even being rained on should some fluke freaky ass storm miraculously make its way into the valley of the sun.. unlikely, but hey, im just throwing it out there.Their wings are delicious and meaty. Their nachos are nachos.. cant really eff that up. Their fried party platter thing is a heart attack on a plate, and nothing fancy, but goddamn delicious. The sandwiches are standard as well as the salads.. but come on people, this is where we go to get shnockered and watch some football, not to indulge in a gourmet meal. 16th St. Bar is A-O-Fn-K with me.. And one of the best parts is that there is a Sports Authority right down the street so when you get that urge to purchase a new baseball glove or junior size football because your hands are too small for the official size, you can go during halftime.Ka Pow!Great sports bar.  Lots of nice big TVs, yummy wings, good drink specials (w/ a great range of beers on draft, though the two don't typically intersect so I was drinking $3 Mirror Pond Ale from a bottle poured into an icy pint glass), enthusiastic if somewhat homer crowd (I guess I just insulted myself.  Well, at least I didn't loudly protest very obvious calls against the Cards like the table next to us).  Anyway don't expect great service, though I won't complain too loud - I guess under certain circumstances I can actually be patient.  Bathrooms - at least the men's room is pretty disgusting, but I survived.  Otherwise the place is pretty nice inside - our waitress gave everyone coasters.  One minor niggle: there were a couple kids there when we first got there.  The family left around halftime and the little babies were asleep most of the time, (and mercifully quiet the entire time) but this sort of thing is simply not appropriate.  Put up a sign.  "No firearms or children allowed."Went there yesterday to watch a postseason game with other Yelpers.  As far as watching TVs went, there wasn't a bad seat in the house.  For those that hate smoke there is a non smoking entrance in the back to the bar side but if you want to play pool or use the Men's room you still have to run the gauntlet of the smoking patio.  Speaking of the Men's room, I have seen worse but this one wasn't really kept up that well and it could use a mopping as my feet stuck to the floor by the urinal. They had plenty of good choices for beer on tap.  I was intending on a burger but table quantities of other stuff arrived.  The nachos were ok.  I don't normally care for hot wings because they are, well, hot.  These were grilled and while they left a slight after burn for me were really quite good.  I also had an onion ring, a potato skin and a cheese stick.  Good solid bar food without being Wow.  Service bounced between really good and "where did she go?".  They were out of stuff like iced tea, some brownies and some of the beers.  As a table we were buying enough drinks that those that mixed in glasses of water were not questioned.All in all a good solid neighborhood bar.

Good ol' Zodie's. When the smoking ban went into effect, this bar ditched their kitchen and mounted a GIANT sign with bold, red print, exclaiming, "SMOKERS WELCOME." I admit, the ban is probably a good idea. I will cover that statement with, "To each his own," everyone's opinion counts, etc. etc. etc. But I do admire the zeal with which they stood to their cause. Now, the decor in Zodie's didn't click in my gourd until very recently. Why? I don't know, because now that I get it, it's just so apparent. The place is scattered with zodiac symbols, sun catchers, and wind chimes. The lighting changes, too, depending on who's on shift. If it's Jim or Pete, the lights are at their fullest level. But if Charla is working, she'll turn the lights completely off, fill the joint with candle light, and talk to you about where your sun is and which planet is in your ... I can't ever follow, but it sure sounds nice. Everyone likes a scapegoat when their luck has run dry, yeah? I've also heard several accounts of the haunt who hangs out at Zodie's, which just adds to the place's appeal. For goofs like me, anyway. I guess he wears a white T shirt, and likes to play with the TVs and radio. I've never witnessed this, but I keep hoping.The drinks are good 'n strong. The prices are definitely affordable. I did, however, cringe a little when I selected the "Night Life" category, because every time we've been to Zodie's, the only other people at the bar are other employees. They do have a Golden Tee machine, and if you take a chance to get to know the bartenders, their stories can certainly be entertaining.It may not be for everyone, but this is one of my favorite places to go for a cocktail.

There's no shortage of options if you want Middle Eastern food in Tempe, especially around ASU. Luckily there's no confusion about which one is THE BEST.Not only is this the best Middle Eastern retaurant in The Valley, it's also MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN ALL OF TEMPE. The chicken Shwarma is delicious, and the hummus is the best in the state. For a cheap meal, try the "hommus deluxe" with chicken or lamb. It eats like a meal. Tack on a delightful staff, and a comfortable atmosphere, and what you have is probably the most underrated restaurant in Arizona."Best hummus", "best Middle Eastern food", "best restaurant in Tempe", "most underrated"...I know, that's a lot of superlatives - this place deserves each one.One day, as my friend Darius and I were trying to kill some time before going to class we came here for lunch. This was Darius' first time with Mediterranian cuisine and after reading all the glowing reviews for here - I knew this was the place to take him! :)We had some hummus as an appetizer, and oh em gee!! it was so great! I couldn't believe it was so creamy and perfectly garlicly!! Normally hummus is a lil too strong for me but this was great.I had the Gyro plate and it was a LOT of food! I enjoyed it very much, I just wish it came with more pita bread. Gyro meat was plated with some more hummus, basmati rice and fixins for awesome gyros. My friend had this dish with garbanzo beans and lamb. He really enjoyed it and said it the meat was tender. I didn't try it but it sure looked good. :)We closed our meal with some blaklavah - they have different varieties of the mediterranian staple, I had the walnut backlavah and he had the pistashio. I liked it but I've had better and it was WAY too sweet, I couldn't finish it! Over all, this is one of the best places I've discovered since moving to Tempe. I really enjoy it and look forward to finding more places! To my yelpers, I say: GO! The food is yummy, the decor is cute and clean, the service is more than decent and the location is mill but NOT mill.. gotta love it!

"Great place for dining solo!""Incredible food!""Friendly staff!""My go-to restaurant on the Camelback corridor."All of these are things that I've heard about Tarbell's time and time again over the years.  So, of course I had high expectations going in.  So when my friends Jared and Jane B suggested we do a double date at Tarbell's during the recent AZ Restaurant Week, I was totally game.Upon walking into Tarbell's, the hostess was incredibly friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere was warm and inviting while still being casual; my kind of place!  Nathan was our waiter and he was awesome.  He was patient with both my husband and our friend Jared as they went back and forth on what they wanted to order quite a few times.  He suggested a great bottle of wine for us also.I was the only one at the table who didn't order off of the restaurant week menu.  I went with a Caesar salad to start, the Salmon entree, and carrot cake for dessert.  I enjoyed the Caesar salad despite the lack of anchovies (I happen to love anchovies).  The salmon was a huge hit -- I think everyone at the table had order envy over it -- but I did share!  It was grilled to perfection, topped with a local molasses/lime/honey glaze and served on a crispy potato cake.  The carrot cake was good but not amazing.The restaurant week menu that everyone else ordered from had only one starter option: the pulled mozzarella.  However, I guess they ran out of it the night that we were there, so the manager came over and offered to substitute with other salad options.  This was a huge perk for everyone and much appreciated by our group.  Two people at our table had the Bolognese, but they said it was bland.  They were pleased with the other desserts (donuts and chocolate mousse).While I wasn't completely enamored with everything, our overall Tarbell's experience was a good one, and I definitely want to return to try more menu items in the future.  Double date or biz dinner, anyone?  Let me know!*My 200th Review*Tarbell's, you were a dream come true!This is what 5 stars is to me-The very best service. Every staff member was professional, personable, well groomed, prompt, and smiled often!The restaurant itself was simple and elegant. Definitely a place I would recommend for a date or special occasion or anytime you want to be fancy! The crowd was mostly retirees, but I took that as a sign that I was in the right place.  The other diners were very dapper and able bodied and seemed to clearly enjoy the finer things in life. The food. Mmmmmm yes!! I had the scallops, and they were the best I've ever had. It came with a potato cake and seasonal vegetables, each bite equally delicious. The salmon was also excellent and grilled to perfection. Even the grill marks were absolutely perfect, which I admire because I can not do that myself! It was accompanied by mixed greens with an amazing honey glaze dressing, and potatoes another way- similar to shoe string pik nik sticks but much fancier and salty and mouth watering. We shared the caramel cheesecake for dessert, and that was probably the low point of the meal. Kidding!! Omg, I rarely eat dessert and this was worth.every.calorie!! Perfection! Not to sweet, not too dense, not too light, so full of flavor! The caramel sauce! My, my! I really can't wait to go back. I am very curious about the spaghetti and meatballs! And the profiteroles! I want to try the whole menu, each time it changes! Thank you Tarbell's, for making my 30th birthday dinner amazing!Edit: I received a warm phone call from Ty 2 days after dining to inquire how my experience was. I can't say that has ever happened before even at other fine establishments. Very classy. Thanks Ty!

Let's get the boring bad  stuff out of the way so I can talk about the fun part.over-pricednot deliciousyou have two people waiting on you, but it's always slowbad water- seriously, not even a lemon can mask the disgusting flavor of their waterit's always coldhonestly, if this restaurant wasn't high up and spinning, i would never go here.i took my nieces ice skating at city scape so i figured this would be a fun place to have an over priced dinner since we were right up the street. When in Rome....or something.I ordered some curry chicken thing and my nieces had grilled cheese off the kids menu.  we also ordered a molten cake for dessert but there was no molten? whatever, no need to to hash it because i knew going in the food sorta sucks. Our bill was $70 but we seriously had a blast. The whole dinner was filled with gasps and excitement and sheer thrill about how fun this restaurant was.After reading some of the rips on the Compass Arizona Grill, I thought we should investigate the badness on our anniversary. We've been several times over the years and it's usually fine. If you've read anything I've written, you know I'm uncouth, ill-educated, lacking taste and manners. Consider also I usually write about remote rural spots serving iceberg lettuce salads, white bread, instant mashed potatoes,brown gravy from cans and chicken fried steak. I called our reservation in four days early, was asked if we'd dined before. We were in the database. I was asked if it was a special event. We couldn't get a 7:30 to 8:30 slot, so took 6:30. I was asked if I wanted anything special. I didn't think to ask for a bottle of Fre champagne or bottle of Navarro Gewürztraminer or Pinot Noir juice. We were greeted promptly, wished happy anniversary, and seated immediately. Nina served the water and appetizers, Jerry served drinks and food. Each course had its own plating and service.  Jerry's served here since the first 360 degree spin in 1976, so has some experience. The menu's southwest.  Subtle chile, cilantro and blue corn in menu items. The appetizer bread was cornbread with corn kernels and green chile added. Regular and honey butter were delivered along with sea salt crystals for dinner seasoning. That's good corn bread.  I had 2.5 tiny servings.  Our wines were Fre rosé and red, both on the Compass Grill list. Of our courses, the black bean soup with diced chile and cilantro sprouts and the rib eye steak were excellent. The crispy brie appetizer and salad were good. Being ill-mannered, House Salad springy field greens and tiny red tomatoes lubricated with house dressing elude my fork and knife. Fortunately, I shot no tomatoes across the room as frequently happens to me. The citrus vinaigrette under the brie was also excellent. I recommend a thorough swishing of cheese, arugula and candied pecan to get the most vinaigrette from the plate. One can get the last sweet-citrus streaks with the tiny tomato halves. I ordered the veggie entree, Seared balsamic glazed oyster mushroom and eggplant on a bed of quinoa and couscous with apricot. Cut the mushroom and eggplant, mix it with the harvest grains, and a good veggie meal's been served. Not as good eaten separately. Coffee and strawberry shortcake for dessert. Coffee much better than some highly touted Phoenix dineries. Strawberry shortcake an appropriately modern, 24th story serving. Along our 90 minute journey, we got 540 degrees of the Phoenix horizon, from daylight to night. The 21st century view is pretty cluttered up with bank towers and the calloused handed, big bicepped Freeport-McMoran corporate HQ. Rather than tall view-blocking bank towers, I'd have been lots happier with shorter ostentation, lower fees and higher interest on my hard-kept savings. Lots less than 75,000 bank-owned homes in Phoenix and more employees would also have been nice. Like I said, I'm uncouth, ill-educated, lacking taste and manners.We may all be in for mixed experiences here.Spinning and eating are not normally things I do together... Nor do I ever want to do it again. The only time I spin is after a heavy night of drinking ... And we all know how fun that is.So the shtick of this place is this: it's a restaurant on a relatively tall building in downtown Phoenix that spins, thus giving you a 360 degree view of the area around the hotel. But it spins just a tad too fast. You can hear and feel the gears of the place going, oftentimes creaking in certain areas. The central wall is painted one boring color of baby-crap brown and there's nothing on it but a hand rail (really?!) that looks like a relic from the 70s.And it was freezing! Uncomfortable so. The food was good. I had the salmon entree and it was delicious. Wonderfully cooked and a large portion. The appetizer was a pain in the ass. It was a pizza with cheese and mushrooms and truffle and so tasty, but the crust was too flimsy to hold the toppings, but cutting it was awkward and the share plates were too small. And there ain't no way I'm dropping oily mushrooms on this dress I'm wearing. I gave it up after the first slice. Overall, a weird experience. The place was practically empty on a Friday night and because the room is curved you can hear mystery voices of people you can't see... Can they hear me?!Even though I liked the dinner... I won't be back. Spinning around twice was enough for me.FYI- one rotation is almost exactly an hour long. And Arizona is damn boring more than once.

Review Text :
We discovered this place by accident.  We were walking around the Palace Station and could not ignore the smells coming from this tiny bar.  Customers had heaping bowls of what could only be yummy goodness in front of them, AND there was a line for this place.  We stood by and watched the cooks at work and took a look at the posted menu - pan roasts, gumbos, etouffes, oysters on the half shell, just lots of good stuff.  I had to ask those who were eating and those in line what to get  - and everyone was saying different things - but it all sounded wonderful!  We were sold!The following week, we made our first attempt to chow at the Oyster Bar and you can imagine the defeated look on The Husband's face when it had 'just' closed for the evening.  Darn!The next time we went early and on a weekday.  We didn't want to stand in line and we didn't want to get the stare down!  Haha!With three of us, we figure we could all share.  So this is what we got:* Palace Pan Roast "Served with steamed white rice." ($21.99) - This was my absolute favorite of the bunch.  It had the most flavor and I found myself hogging on this dish.  Customers weren't kidding when they said I had to get the pan roast!* House Gumbo "A tasty Creole chowder made with seafood, gumbo file, okra, and Andouille sausage.  Served with white rice."  ($19.49) - The gumbo was pretty good too, and chunky.  But I just craving the flavors of the pan roast more. * Etouffee " Shrimp, crab, and lobster with seasonings in this classic French Creole stew." ($17.99) - Their etouffe was good as well, but compared to the others, the pan roast and gumbo ranked higher.All in all, it was all good, hearty and fatty goodness!  Yes, they do arrive in large pho bowls (large for Vegas, average size for other places).  I think it's more than generous for one person.  We technically didn't have any leftovers because between the three of us, we picked out all the good bits and stuffed ourselves silly.  Come with an appetite!  Prices may seem steep, but when you see how much you get, it's okay.  And the cool part is watching your meal cooked right in front of you! Service was a bit slower with only two people working.  (They had three the previous weekends we passed by.)  It was okay though because we didn't have to wait and we sat far enough down the bar to not have to acknowledge those in line still.While you wait, they serve up warm sourdough bread and butter. I was starving and gobbled up two pieces before my order arrived.The best seafood jambalaya that I've ever had hands down! I must have died and went to heavan when I ate here! Who would have expected such a great find at the Palace Station? I really hate to give such a place up to the masses but isn't that what Yelp is about?My company ordered a combo pan roast and an oyster gumbo, both were great as well! Especially the pan roast! I would have to say that my seafood jambalaya was best of all of them! It had lobster tail, clams, mussels, oysters, crab, shrimp and other goodies! I had them give me a 7 spicy on a scale of 1-10 and it had quite a kick!I am comimg back for sure!If you didn't get the idea from the 200+ user reviews raving about this place, then yes, the Oyster Bar is delicious. "How delicious," you ask? "Very delicious," I say. When a place has me ogling over a pan roast more than a celebrity crush, it really means something (Actually, that might just mean that I'm a glutton. Never mind that though). Since there are already boatloads of praise from other wonderful Yelpers, I'll try not to be redundant. Thus, I'll leave you with a summation of tips, from one glutton to another:1. First visit? Order a pan roast. It's practically their signature item. Ordering other items could leave you happy, but not as happy as a pan roast would make you. You do like to be happy, don't you?2. Starving? Order a platter of fresh oysters too. They're some of the freshest oysters that I've had in Vegas.3. Pro-tip? Get an extra roll with your pan roast to use as a shoveling tool. Extras are free. You just have to ask for them.4. Pro-pro-tip? Friday and Saturday nights are their peak hours. You could be standing in line for 30 minutes to an hour. I've heard that it's gotten as long as 2.5 hours at the most busy of times. On a early Sunday afternoon, I got seated with a group of 4 instantly.5. Want to go there now? Call me. It's a date.After hearing about how bombdizzle Oyster Bar is from numerous friends, I hauled my ass over the first chance that I got. And whooo wheee, it's FANTASTIC. The chefs prepare everything to order and better yet, they prepare it in front of you so you can watch the magic happen!! For a first timer like me, I went the safe and easy route and ordered a half dozen oysters and the ever popular Combo Pan Roast to share. Oysters - superbly fresh. Comes with all your usual fixings--chunky horseradish, lemons, marinara sauce, and tobasco sauce (upon request). Prepare to your heart's desire and slurp on up!Combo Pan Roast - wow, this stuff is like crack. Even when my stomach was telling me, "No more, I'm stuffed!", my mouth would keep commanding, "More!". The best part of the meal isn't the plethora of seafood (a whole lobster tail, 4 halved crab legs, and a shit ton of shrimp) that crowds the dish, the best part is... wait for it......the broth!! The broth consists of a sweet creamy tomato broth mixed with various savory spices and brandy that will leave your tastebuds feeling a bit perplexed (but in a good way!) from the flavor complexity. My friend and I enjoyed this dish much like you would a curry dish rather than a soup, so we ordered an extra side of rice for it. The dish was large enough to overstuff the both of us. It's a pricey place overall, but well wort the price imo (and the portions are large so many of the dishes can be split between two people).  And here's the kicker.... all this awesomeness is available 24hrs a day!! So if you're wandering around the strip drunk at 5 am, and you want to get your fancy on.... I suggest you stumble on over to Oyster Bar at the Palace Station for their Pan Roast!After a long night in Vegas we headed to Oyster bar to fill up on tasty seafood. Following the cab ride that kept going and going we ultimately made it to Palace Station Hotel & Casino. The area is sketchy to say the least but after tons and tons of suggestions we had to try Oyster bar. Luckily there was no wait and we were seated instantly. We started with a round of Kirin followed by a dozen oysters and clams. I must admit I'm a sucker for oysters on the half shell, but these oysters left something to be desired. The oysters were not shucked properly making them difficult to eat. I was starting to get disappointed until the Pan Roast combo came out. That thing was HUGE and delicious, packed with shrimp, crab and lobster with a side of steam rice. Over all the Pan Roast was finger licking good with just enough spice to accent the seafood. Even though the area was totally sketchy and the hotel is less than nice this Oyster Bar is a diamond in the rough and a must try in Vegas.P.s. If you're coming from the strip its a $25-35 cab ride, depending on trafficI waited in line here with my coworker for an hour, to be behind 3-4 parties ahead of us. During that one hour, only 1 party was seated. This line would not budge, so we left. :*(But, that stirred up my curiosity and decided to come at an off-time (they're open 24 hours) after some Vegas debauchery. Ordered the combo (crab, lobster, shrimp) pan roast with level 7 spiciness (levels 1-10), which was a pretty mild spicy. I was intrigued by the old fashion boilers in front http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4hHMfa7H0Xf0-ChU5hg?select=i6GMotN-jpqlLc9gpmjgEw, as I saw the chef start off by cooking the fresh seafood medley in the boiler, then added the cajun seasoning, the broth, and finally kept adding the cream sauce base/roux. The pan roast had strong flavor, where I think adding extra rice or noodles ($1.99) is essential. I actually think this soup would make a really delicious pasta sauce. And then there were juicy and generous clumps of seafood, very yum. Service was attentive (you're sitting right in front of them) and the chef kept asking when would be the next time he'll be seeing me, and I assured him for breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday. (I wish)I definitely will be back to try the infamous gumbo, clam chowder, and (new york) oysters/shooters.Some people come to Las Vegas to get cheap eats and some come to eat at the all you can eat buffets!  For me I came to LV like a crazed hit man to knock off my Yelp bookmarks one by one. So here I am at The Palace Station Hotel & Casino to try the Oyster Bar. Having been to the Sunset Stations Oyster Bar so I knew that I was in for a treat again and I did not walk away disappointed from Palace Stations Oyster Bar.The dish ordered this time around was the Bouillabaisse Spicy with rice and a glass  of Chardonnay. The spicy soup base and the fresh seafood was everything I expected from a great Bouillabaisse. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oyster-bar-las-vegas-2?select=xr1v005ca9E5vKENRf6GdQ#xr1v005ca9E5vKENRf6GdQI love watch the chef making my dish while sipping one the cool glass of wine. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oyster-bar-las-vegas-2?select=X5MpbSZQf_lO_ywbO9BKkw#X5MpbSZQf_lO_ywbO9BKkwThe Oyster Bar is always one of my must go to places when in town.Friendly Helpful Service.My LV Trip Bookmark #6Who would have thought I'd find myself downtown at a rundown casino like Palace Station, but there I was on a late Sunday night enjoying one of the most satisfying dishes sin city had to offer! Yup, I'm talkin about the Pan Roast at Oyster Bar! Do yourself a huge favor and order the palace version with shrimp chicken andouille sausage and crab. I added lobster too. But either way, It's the bomb, cuz its all about that crazy good sauce! Keep in mind however, to truly enjoy this dish, you've gotta love your spice! Trust, each bite will be a scorching spoonful of fiery goodness! Chunks of meaty sausage, chicken and seafood in every bite and I bet you won't be able to put your spoon down! Well, except to wipe your forehead from the sweat cuz this bad boy is hot hot hot! But oooh soooo hot diggity good! I ordered a level 7 (1-10 being spiciest) and it was just right!We started with 1/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell, and that was an excellent intro to our fantastic meal! The oysters were fresh and went down the hatch nicely with a swig of cold frosty Kirin! We also ordered the shrimp scampi. It came served with loads of succulent tiger shrimp, a heaping serving of fresh chopped garlic and noodles swimming in a pool of buttery glory. Although it was tasty, it simply couldn't hold a candle to the signature pan roast IMO! I'm tellin ya, order the pan roast and enjoy! Your taste buds and tummy will thank you for it!Happy Eats!Someone had a bright idea and it took us completely off the strip. The Oyster Bar was located in Palace station, a hotel casino that pretty much kept it the same since who knows when. This was definitely a place unfamiliar to me and it almost felt did not have your typical Vegas aesthetic.We started with oysters and it was oyster heaven. Every slurp was fresh and decadence. We had oyster at Bacchanal buffet and it was no comparison! Follow it with a gulp of Kirin, I'm a happy guy!The Palace Pan Roast is exceptionally good. I mean after a weekend of decadence at E, Tableau and Bachannal... This dish still stood out. Absolutely Delicious!So... Oyster, Pan Roast, and Beer... That's all you need to know...especially after a night of debauchery.Extremely short short review, but probably the best review from me...Oyster Bar...  Here is what you MUST ORDER!--Combo Pan Roast!--Alaskan Chowder!That's it!!!  I need to say no more.......Small eatery with only about 18 seats... all things are cook to order in front of you... so expect a wait!  However, THE WAIT WILL BE WORTH IT!!!Expensive?  Slightly... was it delicious?  You beyond betcha!Would I come back?  I'm planning my next trip around Oyster Bar!~~~Hotel is old, smelly & ghetto. Restaurant was in an open area; it was weird I was expecting it to be in a normal restaurant setting, but I guess not. Clam chowder was so yummy 10 ptsCombo pan roast is to die for!! 11ptsFYI, if you split the dishes, they charge you an extra $5.The pan roast had me dreaming about it all night and day so I decided to reverse engineer it and I've gone it!! You don't get the experience of sitting at the Oyster Bar but will definitely get you through until your next visit. Or if you're just tired of that line (2 1/2 hours last time but still totally worth it in the end). This recipe is for cooks who know how to follow my not perfectly exact recipe (sorry!). Pan roast recipe2 table shallots2 table green onions4 garlic cloves1 tomatoBrandy to deglaze1 tea thyme1 tea paprika1/2 tea old bay1/2 tea butter1/4 tea saltPepper and white2 tea Worcestershire2 tea Tabasco2 tea cocktail sauce1/2 cup heavy cream1 bottle clam juice1/2 Onion1 celery stalkSautéed garlic, onions and shallots w olive oil, deglaze with butter.

Set asideSautéed celery and onions w olive oil. Add in shrimp and whatever seafood you want, deglaze w clam juice until cooked. Top off the brandy (2 teas per serving). Stir in bisque mixture, Serrano chili and chili flakes, tiny sprinkle of lemon juice. Bring To boil. Serve with parsley sprinkled on top like they do at the real deal. Makes 2 servings. Serve with jasmine riceThis is one of Vegas' hidden gems! I totally love this place!! Open 24 hours, we came here at 2am and waited in line for about 40mins to get seated. This is a bar inside the casino which could accomodate about 20 people max at a time. There's only two people working here, Chef EZ cooking and Steve serving, so expect to wait for your food to be ready. They have the steam kettles in front of you on the bar so you can watch how your food is prepared. Both these guys are so cool! They engage in conversation with you no matter how busy they are and it really makes for a more personal experience. Food here is AMAZING!! Probably the best oysters I've had, EVER! It's sooooo fresh, chunky, and succulent. I can still taste it in my mouth. Hmmmmmm... For half a dozen, it's normally $11.99 but from 1am-9am, you can get it for $8.99. Score!! PAN ROAST..what can I say? I'm still dreaming about this dish. I'm already planning my next trip to Vegas for more! Got the Combo Pan Roast which comes with lobster, shrimp, and crab. They're all sauteed with brandy, cream, and tomato then served with rice. You can opt to get the noodles for $1.99 extra which I did. I personally think it's a better match but you can taste and decide for yourself because they serve the rice with it on the side no matter what. It's a bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. Serving is big and you'll really see the actual seafood mixed in there. There were about 3 whole lobsters, 7 whole shrimps, and crab meat everywhere on my bowl! I shared this dish and we still had some leftovers. The Alaskan chowder smelled and looked so delicious!! I"ll have to try that on my next visit. Can't wait!!!"Please, please, please, no more fish liver, fish sperm, baby eels, crab innards,  shrimp brains, or live octopus.  I wanna pick where we eat today."  whines my Midwest poker bud to a group of three Asian guys."OK, OK, where we going?"  I ask choking back laughter at his whining."Oyster Bar.  Palace Station." is all he says."Cool".  Leaning towards my buds, "Did we really feed him fish sperm?"  Nodding of heads and an explosion of laughter settles the matter.Very Important:1.  There is always a line.  Expect a wait.2.  Don't go expecting perfectly cooked, diverse selection of the best seafood.  It's about flavorful dishes from the 1970's and 1980's made from everyday stuff.That said, fresh, nondescript oysters on the half shell with cocktail sauce and horseradish.  Overcooked but typical shrimp cocktail with an OK cocktail sauce (dump the horseradish in from the oysters to pump it up).  Chewy, but tasty, overcooked little necks.Mains are straightforward.  Pan roasts (shelled, over cooked lump crab, shrimp and lobster in an old school brandy infused tomato cream sauce) and Gumbos (same over cooked seafood with andouille sausage and okra thickened with a red brick roux) both served with everyday steamed rice are good eats for sure.   Along with the seafood jambalaya, plain ole good comfort food.Unfortunately the bouillabaisse and SF classic, Cioppino really miss the mark.  It's hard to enjoy dishes that have been perfected and widely available elsewhere.  Sorry but the use of previously frozen cod, over cooked clams, mussels, headless shrimp and previously steamed crab doesn't cut it.  The sweet, flavorful juices from the shrimp heads and crab are missing and heck, it's just more fun to pick at and suck seafood out of the shell.Straight forward, simple beer and wine list.  Inexpensive; 2x retail.  Efficient service.The food is only three stars.  A fourth awarded because this IS a Vegas institution (cheers Godzilla X.)Dear Oyster Bar,It's not very often that I fall in love at first bite, as a matter of fact, this was my first time. In Japanese we say "hatsukoi" which means first love. Though technically you aren't my first love, you are now. I must thank fellow Yelper Dave F., for bringing us together. If it wasn't for him suggesting I give you a try, we would've never met. My friends aren't Yelpers and when I told them about you, they weren't exactly thrilled. You see, they don't get the concept of Yelp. Which doesn't quite make much sense to me since they always ask me to jump on my app when they have no idea where to eat at. Of course the girl with the Yelp app to the rescue. After perusing some reviews and reading them out loud to them, they agreed to go. Don't tell but I skipped over the long wait part and only highlighted the good. I knew I had to remain mum about possible waits up to 2 hours. My one & only mission was to just get them there. When we arrived, the counter was full with 2 people in line. I was hopeful. There were 3 of us, we had left the others at the hotel since they were too hungover to join us. Totally well played. The best part was, as soon as we stepped in line, 5 people got up! We didn't have to wait a single minute! The stars, the moon, the universe, everything aligned perfectly. I ordered the Pan Roast Lobster and this is where my love affair began. The friendly waitress suggested the heat level at 6. Since it was busy, we probably waited about 20 mins, maybe a bit longer but it didn't seem long. I was fascinated with the lone cook who was creating dish after dish in front of me. He was like the energizer bunny, zipping around in that small space. When he finally placed the ginormous bowl in front of me, my eyes sparkled. Huge generous amounts of lobster were floating in my bowl. Then I took that first bite. My mouth exploded with flavors. I don't even think I can find the right words to convey how delicious my pan roast was. It was total perfection. From the level 6 heat to the scrumptious lobster to the lobster bisqué sauce even the scoop of white rice that was in my bowl. My eyes were now in the shape of hearts as I gazed at you. My heart fluttered, I was officially in love. My friend ordered the seafood pan roast and another the shrimp scampi (which came with pasta) and though we all tried each others. I can say unequivocally hands down, mine was the best. The portions were so generous that none of us could finish our meal. One friend suggested on our next visit there, we should share. Huh? Huh? What? Did I just hear that correctly? Was he skirting around the issue that Yelp and Dave F., is what brought us there? I must give kudos to your chef and waitress. Both were consistently busy taking orders, clearing off counter space, preparing each order, opening raw oysters or clams with such ease, and refilling drinks. All of this while engaging people in friendly conversation and a smile. I know some patrons complain about lack of counter space with only about 20 seats but I hope you don't expand. I love the ambiance and the intimacy. Even though you're in the casino with no walls separating you from the rest of the world, you wouldn't even know it since one is more focused on the activity in front of them and of course the delish food. When I go back to Vegas, believe me, I will definitely visit my first love. And to you sir Dave F., arigatou, merci beacoup, kamsanmida, gracious, danke. You are the bomb! P.S. I would wait in line a million years to eat here again. Don't let the wait put you off. It's so so worth it.This spot brings back memories. First tried their gumbo at home when my mom brought back leftovers and was obsessed. I would come here with my cousins ID before I turned 21 to be able to have the deliciousness served to me...you see you have to be 21 or over to eat at the oyster bar(they will card you). I actually spent my 21st birthday dinner here at midnight because I love it so much. Of course I celebrated with a beer and some oyster shooters. Crazy I know...The Oyster Bar is now open 24 hours which makes it so easy to try and a great place to go to when I get off of work at 5am. There usually is always a line since there is seating for only 15-18 people...but that doesn't deter people from waiting...their food is THAT GOOD. The chefs are usually always talking to the guests as he's cooking which makes the experience fun.My husband and I have been here before and LOVED the food. One star warranted because 1. The line is ridiculous. Even with 4 people in front of you, be prepared to wait over an hour &2. No one under 21 can eat here! WTF... Okay what? Like WHAT?This trip my husband, 13 year old daughter and I came ALL THE WAY OFF STRIP for this place... WAITED in line for about 40 minutes, which hadn't moved in the 40 minutes we were standing there, when someone came and told us we'd have to leave because you have to be 21 to eat there. YES. You read that correctly. Never going back WITH or WITHOUT my kids. Ever.Where have I been?  Oyster Bar gets a ton of great reviews from Yelp, some of my personal friends, and even my own parents.  Just Google Las Vegas Pan Roast and you get sent here to the Oyster Bar.  There's so many Yelp reviews about this place that my review is going to sound like a broken record.  So, I'll keep this one simple with bulletin points.-Service:  You read it and Yes, there's a wait. This is not because service is lacking.  This is because the Oyster Bar only seats about 15 and the food is as good as it gets.  Service is actually good here.  What takes a long time too is what I call "Linger Eaters".  These are people that take their sweet ol' time to eat.  The gf and I aren't "Linger Eaters" at all. However, if we are going to wait over an hour to eat, then we're going to take our time too.  -Pan Roast:  They're known for their Pan Roast.  My gf got this and allowed me sample it.  My goodness...everything that I read on these reviews were true.  Superb!!-Seafood Jambalaya:  This is what I got.  I haven't had Jambalaya in years and was in that mood, especially since the outside temps were dropping.  Overall...packed with mussels, clams, crab, lobster, shrimp, and rice.  Your taste buds will be confused with what it's tasting, but won't be confused whether it's good or not.  My taste buds just voted...pretty damn good.  -Clam Chowder:  Just about average, but you don't come here for chowder.  -Hours:  All Day, Everyday-Prices:  You get what you pay for.  Most dishes are about or over $20.  Okay, I didn't keep this review too simple.  But it's still bulletin pointed. Oyster Bar is one of those places that you have to try at least once.  Yes, the wait is long.  And Yes, it's in a smokey casino.  But if you're into gumbo, jambalaya, and overall good food, then Oyster Bar is your place. YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (497/500)**Disclaimer: I don't eat seafood so my review is based on the non-seafood items**Prepare to spend a good chunk of your life waiting to be seated here. I didn't mind too much as I had friends waiting in line as I played Wheel of Fortune. This place really is a "bar" so there are only about 20-25 seats, thus the wait. Everything is made to order right in front of you. My personal favorite is the pan roast which is tomato and cream based. You choose the level of spiciness from 1-10. They throw in habanero peppers if you order a 9 or 10. I had a taste of my friend's New England clam chowder (chowder part only) and it was pretty tasty.Aside from the occasional ridiculous wait time, this place is definitely worth trying at least once.The food is outstanding but you have to wait for it. Is it worth it?The Oyster Bar is inside the Palace Station Casino. The bar only has 18 seats. We got here at 8:30 pm on a Monday thinking we could avoid the infamous wait. No such luck, eleven people ahead of us in line. The line did not move for 40 minutes. When it finally moved, it went quick. At the one hour mark, we got seated. Yay. Well not so fast. After you're seated, you're given a sourdough roll and butter. Thank you, thank you thank you. We were starving and that helped a lot. A few minutes go by and they take our order. We waited so long I memorized what we wanted a half an hour ago lol. 40 minutes later our soup comes out. An hour & 15 minutes from being seated we got the oysters. At the two hour mark from being seated we got our entrees. 3 hour 15 minutes from waiting in line to finishing our meal. Was it worth it?Here's the rundown:New England Clam Chowder - Delicious. The bowl was full of clams and the soup was just outstanding. Oyster (a dozen) - was so so good. Cocktail sauce, horseradish and lemon accompanied the oysters. One of the best oysters I've ever had. The chef was having problems with one of the oysters (didn't want to stay in the shell) we were playfully teasing him about it and he was such a sport about it. We all had a good laugh and he put an extra oyster in for us. A bakers dozen, all delicious. Plaza Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausage. It's my first pan roast and it was delicious. The brandy and cream was a good combination. All the proteins were cooked perfectly. I specially liked the andouille sausage, a little hint of spiciness worked well with the broth.  I got a number 7 on the heat scale. It was not spicy for me at all. I could not finish my bowl, it was so rich and I had a lot of oysters. Lol. I will have a good lunch tomorrow for sure. I was also able to taste the following dishes. Combo Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab and lobster. My Mom's choice. Zero on the heat scale. It was as good as mine. Tasted the lobster and that was very good. Good amount of it too. Lol. Bouillabaisse - was so good. My brother's dish. 7 on the heat scale. It was spicy. Ouch. But it was really good. The broth was clean and very flavorful. It had shrimp, crab, lobster, mussels & clams. Great broth. I would get this next time. Service was excellent. The chef was friendly and entertaining. The wait. It didn't bother me at all. It was more entertaining than anything else. I got to talk to other people waiting in line and making fun of the situation we were in. I even got to meet a couple of local Yelpers and she told us about a Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant (Komex). The 3 hours went by really fast. It's an experience I won't soon forget and isn't that why we go to these places and go through all the hoops. LolWas it worth it?I say Yes!!We had great serviceWe had great food. We had great conversationsWe had a memorable night. I'll definitely be backI came. I saw. I conquered. I know I'm a late bloomer, but for some reason I kept hearing about their pan roast! So I had to see what the deal was. Located inside the Palace Station, this Oyster Bar seats only 20 people I think. With raving reviews, you would have to come prepared to wait an hour or so. Don't come starving, because you'll be waiting a while. Trust me. It is well worth the wait.We got the infamous PAN ROAST and we tried to change it up to try multiple dishes and also got the ETOUFFEE. Pan Roast. It's all about the Pan Roast. The chef described it on the dot. It is like a lobster bisque with shrimp, crab, and lobster. They also add some rice with it as well. Mhm, and I love me some lobster bisque. You can also choose your level of spice in both dishes which ranges from 1 to 10. 6 is pretty on the dot if you want a nice kick, but not too spicy. The etouffee was delicious as well, in which I also highly recommend if you don't want the pan roast. However, it's just not strong enough to outshine that pan roast. The etouffee also had the shrimp, crap, and lobster.Pan Roast was $19.99 and Etouffee $17.99.I commend the chef for all his hard work, cooking all those dishes at once, non stop, and still able to keep the quality of the dishes top notch. He's truly a master of his craft. I definitely recommend this to be a place to try at least once, but even just talking about it now makes me crave for some pan roast!Oyster Bar is a no doubt a hidden gem in Las Vegas, from what I heard there's an another location in Harrah's but price is higher and probably more crowded since is in the strip.  One thing I really hate is not the restaurant itself but the location. The casino cigarette smell is very strong and almost unbearable.Our group came here in a weeknight, there is only two group before us but the waiting was over 30 minutes long.  There are maybe around 20 seating at top of that the cooking expect to take another 20 or 30 minutes.  The bar setting is a kitchen like those in a ramen shop except you can see the whole kitchen.  Food was careful prepare and you see they not rushing make your food and really take their time and not to avoid short cuts.Pan Roast and some other dish there is a charge of $5 extra per person if the food is been shared, and you cannot do takeout either.  However, you can take back the food if can't finish it.  They gave you dining roll, which are warm and soft.  We only order two item, one is the full serving of Oyster and the second one is the Combo Pan Roast.The oyster was fresh and mouthwatering, juicy and you can really tasted the flavor.  It was day and night quality compare to the oyster found in Bacchanal Buffet. The Pan Roast was delicious and was well balance in term of the soup; it wasn't heavily tomato flavor, the soup come with lobster, crab, and shrimp.  There was little bit of lobster meat, and decent amount of crab, but the shrimp won me over, it was good quality.  The price is far cheaper than the Harrah location but with more limited selection.  What it matter is the quality of food is not compromise here.  So if you are tired of eating of buffet, this would gave you a totally different taste bud.  Just aware expect a wait and the atmosphere is not as pleasant.Linda S. does not wait in long lines for food...except today. Today was about subjecting my family to driving across town to a long wait inside a smoke filled casino which has surely stunted my daughter's growth...all in the name of PAN ROAST. I would have lived the rest of my life ignorant of such a dish, but I became aware of this PAN ROAST in my quest for clam chowder in Las Vegas. The name itself brought images of a sort of pot roast, and of course this is sooo not even close.I've been to Palace Station for conventions and would not have guessed I would be dragging my family here to eat on a Sunday afternoon. Crazy. I was hoping the line wouldn't be too bad, but we ended up waiting 1.50 hours to get our food. About 45 minutes into waiting, I noticed the 21 & over sign, so we inquired about take out since we had our daughter with us. They do offer take out but we would still have to wait. They only have about 18 seats at the bar. 18 seats plus 13 people ahead of us translated into about an hour to be seated.I was especially curious to see how they prepare the pan roast. They use special steam pans and the food is cooked right in front of you. The chef was very jovial and interacted with patrons. Maybe if he just cooked, it would go faster. But the customers seemed to enjoy it and the servers were very nice.I am terrible with remembering chronological order but here is my account anyway. If I missed anything, please feel free to let me know as I would like to attempt this recipe at home :) First came a scoop of butter, then garlic and chopped veges (looked like onions, celery and red peppers). Then I think he added the fresh seafood, followed by a ladle of clam juice. He let it cook until bubbly. Next came the sprinkle of chili powder to taste (1-10 level) and other seasoning...possibly celery seed. He let it cook some more. Then a splash of brandy and white wine. Finally a healthy ladle of a creamy red stock. Cooks it some more until hot and bubbling. The last step that put a smile on everyone's face was when he tips the pan into the bowl, puts a scoop of white rice and serves it up. The long wait is over :) Nom, nom, nom! Be careful not to burn your mouth as it comes out very hot.PAN ROAST is a delicious and creamy seafood stew full of flavor. The combo pan roast has shrimp, lobster and crabmeat. Not at all fishy and very satisfying. The broth is rich and so flavorful,  you won't believe that you finished the entire thing...I know I didn't.The CLAM CHOWDER  is one of the best I've had. Creamy but not heavy. Tender pieces of clams and small little chunks of potato (not too much). Another winning dish here.I am happy to say that I would venture another trip to the Oyster Bar for the PAN ROAST and Clam Chowder.We've been here twice now for the famous pan roast, and the second time I thought my stomach would literally explode.  Let me explain.  This place is #2 on Yelp's Best of Las Vegas restaurant list.  I never even knew what pan roast was until there was a Yelp Talk thread devoted to it.  Pan roast sounded like some kind of pot roast to me where beef or some meat was roasted in a pan, right?  Wrong.  Pan roast is actually like a giant bowl of lobster bisque with crab, lobster, and shrimp, if you order the combo pan roast, which is what I have gotten both times. And, with that giant bowl comes a giant spoon to eat with. Located inside the Palace Station, the Oyster Bar only seats about 16 people at a time because it is indeed a bar.  People line up patiently for their turn to be seated and served, watching their food being prepared in front of them.  The first time we went, we arrived at 3:00pm on a Friday afternoon and waited for 70 minutes.  Really.  The second time, we got there at 2:00pm on a Friday and waited about 30 minutes.  I've heard stories of people waiting for 2 hours or more.  We talked to a couple in line ahead of us who stay at the Palace Station when they visit just so they can eat at the Oyster Bar.  Service is always friendly and it's fun to speak to your fellow diners; everyone is in a good mood there, maybe because they're finally sitting down and getting their fix while other people wait in line behind them.  The bread and butter is good and so is the New England Clam Chowder.  Those are the only other items I've had there, but that's all you need to know, really.  If you've never had the pan roast, you should try it at least once so you can taste what all the fuss is about.  It's so good that you just keep eating it, even though you're full, hence the stomach-about-to-burst feeling.  Just try to go on a weekday in the mid-afternoon or some other odd time; they're open 24 hours.Summary: My SO and I like to dine at Ritter's Steam Kettle in Costa Mesa, California (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ritters-steam-kettle-cooking-santa-ana) and when we found out Oyster Bar was own by the same company we have to give it a try. The wait was long (1 hour 17 minute to be exact) we were behind 5 couples but it was worth it.Food: We had Cold Seafood Combination, New England Clam Chowder, and Combo Pan Roast. It was exquisite, the food tasted phenomenal. I don't know was it because of the long wait or not but at that moment I think it taste better than Ritter's. Service: The Chef was awesome, just watching him prep the pan roast and constantly making sure his patron were satisfied. Nick, the server/host was a tad unprofessional. So the Chef happen to place our dish at the wrong patron, no need to raise your voice at him. The Chef job is to prep and cook not serve. He was doing you a favor, helping you out and when he place my order to the people beside me, you shouldn't have snap at him. It still amaze me how the Chef just stay mellow and apologize to you. Not to mention when you were behind, he even step outside the counter to bust the table and seat the next group. Show some appreciation man. Overall: I always make it a habit to go to Egg & I (http://www.yelp.com/biz/egg-and-i-las-vegas) for breakfast  every time I visit Vegas and now Oyster Bar is a must also. I'm so glad Oyster Bar isn't located on the strip. Imagine if it was, I'm probably looking at half a day wait time. Then again, it is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So that's not bad.Usually I would question the seafood in Las Vegas because its so far from the ocean...but Oyster Bar never disappoints with its freshness! I must mention I lied when I said Bacchanal was the only place in Vegas I would wait in a line for; Oyster Bar inside Palace Station is the only other place I won't complain waiting in line for. Although, I do wish they'd buy up more space on the floor and put in a couple extra tables.. Everything they offer here is ahhmazing -both for the taste and view ;) As in their name, oysters, here are superb and a definite must order when eating here.  I highly suggest the combo pan roast which consists of shrimp, lobster, and crab. And (not or! lol) the gumbo. Just do it. You will not regret it my loves. They charge an extra $5 if you share entrees but its totally worth it because the portions are very generous. There are no take out orders -which although can be frustrating, I do appreciate it because that means your food is as fresh as possible. And for those of you who like to fill up on soft, buttery bread, they offer that while you wait :)Another thing I really enjoy is that you can watch the whole process of your delicious foods being prepared, cooked, plated/bowled right in front of you! The chefs are all so nice too. Makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable. Last, for those of you who are going with another person who can't quite handle the heat like you, you're always welcomed to adjust the level of spice in your dishes. But I'd suggest nudging the ones who can't handle the spice, to the plate ;P seafood is always more yummy when its spicy!I had no idea this place existed until my last couple of months of me living in Las Vegas. I was only able to experience the Oyster Bar one time- but Oh boy! So delicious. Me and my friend decided to go there after a night at the club. She had raved about this place so many times (she's lived in Las Vegas her whole life) so one night we decided to go. It was a week day, and I think we got there around 4 am. One would think this place wouldn't be busy so late (or so early in the morning) but we waited almost 2 hours to sit down. I kept telling my girlfriend. " this place better be good, to wait 2 hours" and after we sat down, and got our entrees- if was definitely worth the wait and was phenomenal!. We ordered the crab pan roast- and I even had enough left over to take home! This place is fabulous, fresh and a Vegas favorite!WORTH EVERY MINUTE IN LINE..Undoubtedly, this has got to be the Ramen Dojo of oyster bars!  Very limited seating around a semi-circle bar, leaving only 18 seats available to the most oyster driven consumer.  One can be left frustrated, but don't relinquish your place in line, as it will be worth the wait.  Give up immediately if you are under 21, as patrons must be 21 years and over to partake in the festivities.  Some encouraging words from my husband as we stood agonizing in line were, "This is the best Oyster Bar in Vegas.  It's worth the wait."  Okay, with that said, all I could do was smile...The afternoon started off with 14 people ahead of us in line; after an hour and twenty minutes, we were next to be called.  We took our seats on the most comfy bar seats ever to caress my derrière.  For you ladies, look under the counter for purse hooks.Today, there was only one cook and one server.  They were working swiftly and without pause.  I've never seen a two-man show move so quickly and efficiently, holding up the "nautical sails" of this oyster bar so effortlessly.Without hesitation and for the numbing effects of our long wait, I ordered a 23-oz Shock Top on tap.  In the rush of things, our server accidentally poured two 23-oz. Shock Tops.  Immediately upon realizing this, she just pushed both beers our way.  Hoorah!  Cheers and smiles flooded our faces, as well as that of our fellow diners; wishing that it had happened to them, they could only be happy for us in return.The fun is at the bar!  Welcome to the "sensory seat"!  Visualize two people gliding across the kitchen "stage" in perfect unison (no collisions today), food prepping, pots clanging, water running, steam rising, stations warming, ladles scooping, plates gliding, beer sliding...and then you can get a glimpse of this oyster bar chasm, cut from a small section in the Palace Station Hotel and Casino.  My hubby has been visiting this establishment for over 20 years!  Needless to say, I left the ordering to him.  We were famished.Here's our tummy bursting feast.  NOTE:  their potions are fairly large...*Oysters on the half shell ~ These were quite the mouthful.  If you prefer tiny ones, I would suggest not ordering these.  They were sizably squishy and yummy, and accompanied by a cocktail sauce with horseradish.*Combo Pan Roast ~ This is one of the dishes for which they are known.  The Combo includes a generous amount of shrimp, crab and lobster.  First boiled in water, then a special mix of sauces and seasonings are added to the seafood pot.  It only teases and entices as one sees it cooking right before their eyes.  The boiled seafood broth is richly savory.  It is accompanied by white rice.  State whether you would like it on top of your pan roast or on the side; I prefer it on the side.  *New England Clam Chowder ~ smooth and rich with pieces of decadent clams.One more note about the BEER.  The 23 oz. glass is yours to KEEP!  Refills are half price.  Refill it before you leave the bar, as you can carry it with you as you head out to gamble.  Enjoy the feeling of the moment.  In California, we just don't carry out our unfinished drinks.  It just doesn't happen!  Cheers!Hands down on their gumbo. Despite their long lines during lunch, dinner and late night craves, food is great!Here's a tip, don't wait until it's lunch time or dinner time when EVERYONE starts running to get in line, go in between those times so you don't have to wait. I would suggest if you are waiting in line with a group of people? Take turns go grab a drink, have a drink in hand or you better be buzzed at least while waiting in line, because it ain't going to be fun when you are sober, and that is when you will probably start complaining. Better drink up buddies!Ordered the Seafoodbouillabaisse  gumbo (enough to share with two) - wayyy good. Enjoyed watching them make it. Fresh seafood, cooked well and seasoned well. They will ask for how spicy you will like your food, so adjust your taste buds. Recommend oyster shooters and raw oysters! Always ask what kind they have, because it's always different. Don't forget to grab a beer while at it. You cannot eat seafood without a glass of your favorite beer. Don't recommend group since it's just a small bar area to eat, may have to wait longer. Do recommend coming here in the middle of the night, their late night specials are awesome! Clubbing late and crave for food and more drinks? This be the place, but beware of long lines. Cannot wait to come back to try the late happy hour.Omg this friggen place lol. So frustrating and yet... I couldn't get myself to lower the rating. Geezus, I have never waited so long for some food.So ya this place is open 24/7 which means that you have plenty of time to go...... but it doesn't matter cos apparently there's a line 24/7 lol. I didn't have a choice but to wait, I mean.. I'm not a Vegas native, I live in Cali, I would probably only be in Vegas on the weekends.... so YA no matter how I do this, I would have to wait in line. So I did. For 3 hours... and more waiting for food after we ordered lol.I went with my bf so he gambled a bit while I waited in line. He won like $550 sooooo I guess technically dinner was on the hotel! YAY!We ordered a pan roast EACH, and I suppose due to our frustration from waiting, we just decided we should order a f*ckload because we're not gonna be doing this very often. So 2 pan roasts, 1 Alaskan chowder, and 1 gumbo. For 2 people. That's right.So obviously I F**KING LOVED everything, or else I wouldn't have given it 5 stars. The pan roast was AMAZING. I ordered the combo (shrimp, crab, lobster) and an 8 on the spicy scale, which was deliciously spicy. I could've gone with a 9 or 10 probably and it would've been bomb also. It was perfect with the rice. Damn, it was seriously so good........... I dunno how else to explain. Now I get why people wait so damn long for this.The Alaskan chowder...... wow. No lie, it was probably the best chowder I've had lol. It's filled with not just clams, but SHRIMP, LOBSTER, and CRAB?! I mean come on, give the other chowders a chance! But no seriously, it will blow them all out of the water (pun alert). So tasty and seriously loaded with seafood. The gumbo was also ridiculously tasty. I personally LOVE gumbo, and this one might just be my new favorite. We ordered a 5 on the spicy scale so it wasn't as spicy as I'd like, but sooooooooo goood. You definitely need that rice with it also, cos it can get VERY... flavorful? lol. It's also filled with so much seafood - lobster, crab, etc. and sausages!The best part about these dishes is they don't skimp on the seafood. I was a little overwhelmed by how many FAT lobster pieces I found! Totally worth what they're charging.So obviously we had plenty of leftovers, and I was eating them for like... the next 4 days I think LOL. And dude, they were STILL extremely tasty. I thought I would be sick of it but I was truly sad when I had no more left.......... :(Wow I waited in line for like 1.5 hours, and I can't wait to come back for more. Am I out of my mind? Yes, yes I am. Because I actually went back and waited 2.5 hours for a second time. Usually I feel like waiting in line for such a long time is stupid, but the excruciating wait makes the pan roast taste just that much better when you get it. Like the feeling you get when hard work pays off. A boat load of spices and a mountain of seafood is doused in the tomato cream sauce to make the seafood pan roast. Loaded with big chunks of crab and lobster. This is one entree you MUST NOT divert from. You've already waited for such a long time, don't be a fool and not order the pan roast! It's the best pan roast I've ever had thus far.Heard there wouldn't be as long of a wait if you come during odd hours; This statement is false. You can always potentially hit a rush of some sort of rush and wait 2 hours due to limited seating.  Last time I was here at 3 am. and there was a family that came before us, ended up waiting nearly 2.5 hours. Here's a tip, give yourself ample time to wait in line, wait for your food too cook, time to eat the food, and time to get the check. It's usually just a 3 people crew, and they gotta do everything. So don't come here in a rush. You can thank me later.uno de mis restaurantes preferidos cuando quiefo comer Ostras o see food. Producto fresco, bien preparado y una atencion espectacular.Si vas porque pasabas por alli y a ver que tal, posiblemente te aburras esperando, pero si te puede la tentacion y te vas a echar unos dolares a las maquinas... ahh se sienteee que fue a sevilla perdio las ostras jejeje asi que si pueses trata de reservar o hazte amigo el simpatico cheff..Being drunk and hungry, boyfriend and I needed food asap. It's nice that this place is 24/7. From the morning we checked out, there was already a line forming so we thought we'd skip and wait until midnight-ish. After drinking and gambling, we come back at midnight to check on the line. HOLY POO! There's still a line forming. Whatever, I'll wait if it's this good. I think there was a line partly because there's only like 12 seats around the bar/kitchen. With 1 server and 1 cook. So picture it. I think we waited for almost 1 1/2 hour until we finally got seated. For this wait, heck yeah we are gonna indulge ourselves! Given its name, "Oyster Bar" we just had to have oysters. And then their infamous Pan Roast. He also ordered the cioppino, too. Oysters: Below average. Didn't seem fresh and very fishy taste. Good thing we only ordered half a dozen. Pan Roast: Solid 4 stars. I've only had Pan Roast at another place back at the Anaheim Packing District and that was bomb. This one was excellent, too. But the overpowering sauce made it very hard to eat the whole thing. They give you one scoop of rice, but please do get more rice because you'll need it! Cioppino: Average. Nothing really stood out. It was pretty spicy, so watch out you non-spicy eaters. Both the Pan Roast and Cioppino came with lots of seafood. Worth your buck. Cool concept and pretty nice experience as you get to sit and watch your food be prepared in front of you. Price is normal and not overpriced. Be patient because there WILL be a wait at anytime of the day. Tip: Come here and just get the Pan Roast, skip everything else :)Oyster Bar is more of a pilgrimage than a destination, and I finally managed to sit at the altar early this morning.After a fun, lengthy night catching up with friends, we decided to replenish our reserves at the vaunted Oyster Bar at Palace Station. I thought that I was "foodie" in our group not to have tried Oyster Bar yet. Fortunately, I was able to share my embarrassment with one other person..The wait in line was ~90 minutes starting at around 2 a.m. I was a little surprised because it was on the tail end of "Sunday" night, which isn't generally as busy as Friday or Saturday evening. We miraculously got our group of six seated simultaneously in six consecutive seats. Hooray! Service was a little bit on the slow side, but I got the impression that they just work at a particular pace (maybe impaired by the hour of the day, who knows) and pump out their product, and as long as the food is good, people will find other lapses acceptable.Some of us started with oysters (half dozen for $10 from 1-9 a.m., but a full dozen is always $19.99). Some were plumper (and therefore more delicious) than others, but they were at minimum pretty good. Definitely add some of the cocktail sauce / horseradish mixture and squeeze some lemon to complement the natural flavor.We each ordered the almost-synonymous product, pan roast. My particular choice was the combo pan roast ($23.99), which comes with shrimp, crab, and lobster. I was surprised that they ask for a 1-10 spicy level, and I picked my usual 3. I may have actually been able to handle a 4 this time. The thick, creamy soup had mainly savory and spicy flavors, not so much anything sweet or sour. Each protein was well-represented, and there was a reasonable amount of rice that I ended up stirring evenly into the bowl. The portion was large enough to take home some leftovers.I don't really have a point of comparison, so this could technically be the best pan roast that I've ever had. However, my general impression is that it was great... but it was less than mindblowing. I expected it to hit all the right notes, so it's hard to say objectively that the flavor components that I tasted add up to a 5-star combination. I will add that the leftovers seemed to taste a little better the next day, so maybe I was just out of it last night.It was certainly worth that first try, and I will gladly return with friends if the fancy strikes them.This place is pretty amazing. A 10-12 seat dining bar opened 24 hours. 5 of us were here at 5am and there was a line. Craziness!They have Moonlight Specials from 1am-9am. Half dozen oysters for $10? Yes please!Also the pan roast is a must-get. The Palace pan roast comes with shrimp, crab, chicken and sausage. The cook makes it in these customized pans right in front of your eyes. So cool! The portion is huge!Waiting to be seated takes a while. So does the food since it's made fresh. But all worth it.I'm very impatient and wait times could be as long as an hour or LONGER! It is insanely irritable.. BUT the food definitely makes up for it all!Service is a hit or miss. The times we've gone are usually between 1am to 3am the latest.. There's always ONE waiter, ONE cook, 5-6 kettles, and seating only about 12 people at a time! A couple of my favorites :*My go-to CRAB PAN ROAST - creamy, tomatoey, chunks of crab goodness served with steamed rice.*ALASKAN CHOWDER - New England Style with shrimp, crab and lobster.*OYSTERS are about $20 a dozen.This place is definitely a must try at least once in your life! And if you like it.. You'll be like me.. Finding yourself craving this type of seafood comfort food all the time!The high Yelp rating and the Cajun theme was good enough for me to want to try.  Then there was a line.  Only about 20 folks in it.  Didn't seem like a bad thing, until you realize there is only 20 seats.  No tables, just a bar.  We were warned that our wait would be over an hour.  That was enough for me to change my mind.  But the folks in front of us told us that it was worth the wait.  So we waited.  And we waited.  The line really didn't seem to move at all.  After a god long time, we finally got the front position and still had to wait another 15 minutes.  This place better be good.  OMG, it was.  Wait.  I'm not kidding, Wait.  It was super amazing  I have eaten in a lot of great places in Vegas.  A lot.  This may be on the top of my list.  I was truly blown out by the flavors.  We all ordered different dishes, so it gave me the ability to sample most of them.  They all were equally great.  I can't wait to return, even if I have to wait and hour and half again.I have no idea what the hype is about this place. They only have 18 seats around the counter. The wait time is horrendous. We waited for an hour and a half to be seated. Then, we waited for another half an hour for the food to come out after ordering. As I was waiting in line to be seated, I saw that they do takeout. I went up to the counter to order takeout, and was told that I still needed to wait in the same line as the seating line to do takeout. If that's the case, what's the sense in doing takeout, you're waiting the same amount of time.Almost everyone I know loves their pan roast. It was mediocre at best for me. I ordered the Lobster Pan Roast.  You get to pick the spiciness level from 1 to 10. I chose level four and it wasn't spicy at all. It came in a creamy tomato broth, which was really tasty. However, the seafood is not fresh as stated. I could tell from the texture of the lobster that it was frozen before being prepared. On top of that, I only got a few pieces of lobster, not worth the $21.99 I paid for it. It was interesting to see them prepare the food in front of you. They have these metal pots that they cook the food in. First, they cook the seafood. Then, they pour in the cooking wine. Last, they put in the sauce.My husband doesn't like seafood, so he ordered the Caesar salad. It was a large plate and the greens were fresh. I really liked the salad. The workers here were really nice. They didn't have a sense of urgency, though. They knew the line was long, and took their sweet time bussing the dishes and seating the people. They didn't really care if people left.5pm, 4am, 6am, 12pm,.. No matter what time you go there will be a wait. Extremely limited seating. First time I had it, it honestly was not that great. However the next couple of times, I'm definitely hooked on the pan roast. Another dish I recommend is the linguine with clams. It's light yet flavorful. Portions are pretty large so you can share among a few people.

Review Text :
My friends and I decided to come here for dinner. I ordered the Meatless Veggie Hoagie which contained grilled spinach, tomatoes, cheese, fried onions and mushrooms. I noticed that the chips tasted homemade which were quite tasty and crunchy fresh. My friends had meat items, so I didn't get to try their dishes. They did say that they enjoyed their meal, so no complaints there. Our server was very attentive and kept our glasses full and the entertainer was fabulous. There was an older gentleman that played the accordion the entire time we were there. My friends paid for everything which I am grateful for, so I didn't even see the bill.  Isn't that sweet? So I can't comment on how much it cost.01/19/11Didn't realize it's been a couple of years since my last visit to Vincitorio's until I decided to have dinner here this afternoon.  Arrived around 530p, and there were maybe one or two tables occupied.  I was seated at the first two-top near the front door, which put me right next to a young woman, and her acoustic guitar, who was to provide the live entertainment that would eventually start at 6p.  Her original work was pretty good, and she took special requests, as well.  (She later told me that she was going to be playing there again the next week.  I hope she's a recurring performer there, bec. I wouldn't mind hearing her voice and her guitar-playing again!)Tonight's dinner composed of great complimentary buttered garlic bread, a glass of Alois Lageder Riff pinot grigio 2008, and Roasted butternut squash ravioli, which came w/ choice of soup or salad (I chose the latter, w/ blue cheese crumbles and a side of house-made blue cheese dressing).  The salad was very fresh and crisp, and I loved it w/ just the blue cheese crumbles- no need for the dressing!  I enjoyed the bread and salad too much, I think-- I ate almost the whole salad and had to order a second batch of garlic bread!  The roasted butternut squash is one of eight handmade pasta entrees on their dinner menu and comes w/ an addicting four-cheese cream sauce composed of parmigiano, fontina, pecorino, and gorgonzola, which are among my top favorite cheeses!  Now, I will admit that this dish did not make a great visual first impression w/ me (check out the photos), but I knew better than to judge a book by its cover. Yes, it didn't look as appetizing as it could have, but I assure you, the aroma that emanated from this dish was intoxicating, and the butternut squash inside the oh-so-tender ravioli was cooked to perfection!  Its roasted sweetness and the lovely four-cheese cream sauce made a matchless pair!  It was difficult to curb my desire to eat all four pieces...  Mmm... I was in heaven!  As dinner rolled on, the restaurant started to get quite packed w/ what seemed to be regulars, and it's very easy to see why-- I hadn't finished w/ my meal yet, and I was already looking forward to returning the next week!  (Alas, I am forever in search for other great venues to try, so I postponed my next trip back- Valentine's Day, as it turned out!)Thank you, Vincitorio's, for a fantastic evening!3.5 stars with room to improve!Recently had a lovely dinner at VinciTorio's with Yelp pals Jim and Audrey W.  Although there was a problem with our reservation not being carried over from one notebook to another (huh?), it was easily corrected with a short (well maybe not so short) wait.  While waiting, I caught a glimpse of their patio which looks very promising for a future visit.Once seated, we were soon greeted with tasty garlic bread.  I'm sure at some point, they considered charging us for the bread given our repeated requests for refills!  Our server was not only knowledgeable about the menu, but very familiar with the wine list as well.  When I asked for a description of my chosen Verdicchio, his description was spot-on and I was not disappointed.I was somewhat disappointed with my entree, Salmon & Shrimp Vincitorio's.  Described as "Fresh Atlantic salmon filets and jumbo shrimp, sauteed with mushrooms, leeks, in our light cream sauce with a touch of tomato, served over fettuccine," I was a little surprised to find more than a touch of tomato.  It was more of a tomato cream sauce, although still light and very good.  The fettuccine was delicious even though I don't believe this particular pasta is hand-made.  My complaint is with the seafood. The salmon filets were actually pieces of filet which would have been okay had they not been so dry.  The jumbo shrimp consisted of 3 shrimp which were also slightly overdone.  At $19.95, this may have been the priciest item on the menu, but probably was not the best.Dessert was definitely the star of the show.  The tiramisu was not only a generous portion, it was fantastic.  The panna cotta was smooth and creamy, with no gelatinous texture.  The gelato covered in a chocolate shell was liked a gourmet version of a DQ dip cone.  This was probably my favorite.  I would return to VinciTorio's for the desserts alone!@AudreyRLWyatt and I ( @canyonjunkie ) met good @YelpPhx friends Heather C and Ryan C for dinner some time ago.  I really am remiss in catching up my reviews.I will try to do better in the future and as penance I will UFC several orange heads.Anyway, I'll cut to the chase and break down Vinci Torio's thus:Dessert         5 starsDinner           3 starsService          4 starsAtmosphere   4 starsThat makes a total of 16.  Maybe someday I'll put together some sort of restaurant scoring matrix with weighted category rankings...Great desserts, very good service and ambiance, the dinner entrees were good but did not wow me.I was in the mood for pizza--not crappy, junk pizza, but a nice pie that I could sit down with and eat with a knife and fork if I wanted to.  After dropping off my wife and daughter at the movies (it was a mommy-daughter movie night), I began searching. . . VinciTorio's, right here next to the movie theatre.  Okay, let's try this.Good service, checkOutdoor seating with those big gas heater thingies on chilly nights, checkNice ambiance, checkGood pizza, checkKeep in mind that's just a check, and not a star for the pizza.  There was little or no sauce on this pizza, which kept me from enjoying it as much as I would have liked to.  Not a bad taste, and maybe you will like it better than I did, but I like saucy pizzas, and they don't have them here, I guess, unless you ask for them.Everything was fresh and the pizza was well-made, with a nice crust.  No issues there.  The three stars is from the pizza snob in me who wants that burst of spiced tomato taste along with the pepperoni and sausage.  Nonetheless, I ate until I was stuffed.  I'll come back some time to see how the pasta is.I came here on Valentine's day. Unfortunately, the atmosphere was less than romantic. We were elbow to elbow with another couple. They crammed in as many two tops as possible, and doubled the prices on their menu, in honor of this day of love. It was obvious their only concern was gaining as much revenue as possible, at the expense of their guests. The food was awful. I feel bad saying that, but it is the best description. I had the veal. It tasted like a microwave dinner. The noodles were over cooked and mushy. How does that happen at an Italian restaurant? As a cook, I expect better, especially when I'm paying through the nose. I didn't come out on Valentine's day to rub elbows with somebody that I don't know. Horrible experience, will never visit again.I have been putting this review off, so time to do it. I am a little behind. But, this is a place that I would go back to any time, and a place I really liked.It is close in the area to us. It is a clean place that smells really good when you walk in. The smell of Italian food cooking fresh is always good.I got the Italian Wedding soup on my last visit. Along with Garlic knots and the Steak Salad. Wow, what a filling meal.It was really good! I am not usally that into the soup when I go out to dinner, but this is worth it. Very good.The salad had a lot of dark lettuce in it. Which is something that we all like.The wine is reasonably priced. Service was great, and the owner even comes to greet you.I like it ,it is a nice place ,and decorated very nice as well.It is good for groups if you call in advance and lots of parking as it is in a shopping center.I hate to say it because I am a huge fan of Philly's Famous in Chandler; but, VinciTorio's Cheesesteak Hoagie is better!Typically I would never order a Cheesesteak Sandwich at a nice Italian Restaurant, but boy am I glad I did today.  I wasn't in the mood for pasta (which they have an "all you can eat" buffet that looked delicious!), so I defaulted to a sandwich.Now, I'm not saying definitely order the Cheesesteak; but, if you really like them and you are not in the mood for one of their many other fantastic entrees, then give it a try!  Trust me when I tell you, you won't be disappointed.

Review Text :
Went on Sunday 10-25-15 around 4PM.  This Panera Bread is located in front of the Galleria Mall in Henderson.  I've loved Panera Bread since high school and I come to this location probably once a month.  Having said that, this is undeniably the shittiest Panera Bread location I've ever seen.  It is just so filthy!!!  The sidewalk outside is littered with food, pigeon poo, and cigarette butts.  The windows and doors look like they have never been cleaned.  The furniture is all beat up and the floors are icky.  I have never been in the bathroom there because I'm afraid.  I always get my food to-go from this location. $16.40 got me a meal for me and my boy.  I got the "you-pick-two" with a Power Kale Chicken Caesar salad and an asiago steak sandwich, and I got the boy buttered noodles with a yogurt.  My favorite part of my meal was the warm piece of baguette that comes with it.  That thing is heaven with about 10 packets of their real  butter slathered on it.  I got my food and went over to the drink area to grab twenty, er, I mean, a couple of butter packets and there was an employee there refilling the tea.  I know she saw me walk up, but she moved a giant container of tea right in front of the butter.  So I had to stand there and awkwardly wait for her to finish.  Three stars because they got my order right, the food was delicious, and I didn't get sick.  Step up your game, Panera.  You gotta clean!

Review Text :
If it's your fist visit, try a combo platter. Such as the beef brisket, sliced pork and St. Louis ribs. The brisket is especially tender, juicy and flavorful. The ribs are also very good. The sides at Bobby Q are also good-sized and tasty. The beans and mac 'n cheese are especially good. One final note: after you pay your bill, you're presented with a "Thank-Q" brown bag with fresh-baked cake donuts. Nice touch!Best, BBQ, ever.It made the 12-hour drive worth it.  Between three people, we had the Hog Heaven: chicken, St. Louis ribs, babyback ribs, and brisket.The sides were awesome too!  All of them!  The service was also excellent.  Manager came by and asked if everything was alright and the place was packed.Afterwards, we went to the lounge that's connected to the restaurant called Q-Lounge.  There were a lot of fat chicks.Apparently the owners traveled all across America and sampled different types of BBQ and thereafter, created Bobby-Q.Wow, the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had. I had the coleslaw as my side which was better than any other I can remember.     I've heard that the ribs and brisket are very good too.   Reasonable prices during happy hour.They have a lounge/bar/dance club attached to the dining room and it was much nicer than I expected.  Our server said Tuesdays are their busiest nights in the lounge/dance club area, (Tuesdays nights WTF?)    Interesting mix of people when I was there on a Wed. night.   Not the Tempe crowd, or Scottsdale crowd, or even the downtown hipster crowd.  It's the METROCENTER crowd which is just a mix of regular city folk.Wow , what a lovely surprise .  On  New Years Night  my husband suddenly  decides we are going out to eat, super. But low and behold everywhere we want to go to are closed for New Years Day. Bummer  .( how can you enjoy Glendale Glitters without food?)   So at the last minute I  remember Bobby Q's  hmm wonder if they are open .. yes and and thank you ! We begin smelling wonderful things in the parking lot. We are quickly seated and have the sweetest server. Meal starts with our cornbread which was moist , sweet and tasty, served in a flat style not a muffin not a loaf...hmmm. But good. Our daughter ends up with chicken strips ( very plentiful ) and macaroni and cheese--which my husband finished off and adored. Her meal was only 4.99  a steal! Hubby and I shared a three meat combo meal with awesome ribs, brisket and pulled pork . We opted for the spicy BBQ sauce which we both liked.   Our sides were a yummy coleslaw with pecans and roasted corn that they shave off the cob and saute after roasting wow. Between the food , excellent service ( thanks Cassie?, Charise?  aaww  I  can't remember )  and peaceful ambiance , we really enjoyed our meal. We will be back.Still delicious , even better service..I swear we had a waiter and two servers working our table..love it! Right now Bobby-q's has a special offer / prix fixe menu .. choice of appetizer , 2 dinners, and  a choice of 1 desert ( it's big)    27.99  not bad ...Once again I love my meat smoked ... yea I said it.  Brisket was falling  off the bone tender, ribs good , love the coleslaw which is chopped into tiny pieces. lightly season and not greasy . The Q roll appetizers were a tasty start and kept us happy. Of course the complimentary cornbread is really good.. maybe my favorite in the valley.  BTW Ladies bathroom is cool  in a stainless sink overkill kinda way...Came here on a whim, and fell in love with the place.Our server Raymond was super friendly and commented repeatedly on how they Love Yelp here.  Hey Gabi, this would be a great place for an official Elite Event, and they have an attached nightclub!On to the food.  Ray suggested the Q-Rolls appetizer, and it didn't disappoint.  They're like flautas made with brisket, accompanied by two dipping sauces.  Simply Amazing!Ray also recommended the whole hog entree with brisket, pulled-pork and baby backs.  It was large enough for my wife and I to share.  Delicious and filling.  My daughter ordered the half chicken plate, and their fries are superb.We finished it off with a peach cobbler, and to our surprise, we were presented with a bag of Thank-Q's (accompanying our check), which were freshly made dough balls coated in cinnamon & sugar.  Very good!If we lived closer, we'd be a fixture in this place.O M F GI just had a killer burger... Try the Smokehouse. It is a 9oz hand pattied burger grilled as you wish with cheddar, fried onion strings, killer bacon and a thousand island type dressing. It also had some BBQ sauce on there too.  It was so juicy and freaking good.... Who cares that the service was great, or that the mac n cheese was good, who cares about the kids chicken strips and the free corn bread and doughnuts... uggghh man that was good.Steak and Crab? Yes, please.For 15 bucks? Whhhhaaaaa? Hell yes! These are questions my friend asked, when she wondered if I wanted to go to Bobby Qs the other night. Honestly, I did not get my hopes up, and prepared myself for a rough ride home. Yes, in case you are wondering, I have had some bad experiences with Seafood.We decided to sit on the patio and were promptly attended to. I ordered a bloody mary, the rest beers. The bloody mary was freaking tasty. Spicy and tasty. We all ended up ordering the Steak and Crab special. I ordered a Caesar to start with. The Caesar was good. Nothing amazing, but solid.Then there came the Crab. Half a snow crab, with an 8oz Steak and a side of roasted corn. As I started drooling, my stomach did a backflip from excitement. The crab was awesome! Not chewy or fishy tasting. The steak was great as well, and the corn was nice and smokey.The only negative...the server was a bit forgetful at times. Honestly, once the crab and I had our moment...I no longer cared.."You smell like smoke."  That's the greeting I received when coming home from a terrific UYE organized by BBQ lovin' Deb L.  And at that point, if my stuffed self didn't already know it, I knew I had just eaten some damn good food.Upon arriving, I had a deja vu moment of being there before...a long time ago, sipping a virgin strawberry daiquiri (I told you it was a long time ago), and thinking I was all that.  Yes, it was Bobby McGee's at one time!  So flash forward 25 years, and I'm having a strawberry lemonade "adult" beverage, which was quite tasty btw, in the company of 20 fabulous Yelpers!We were given corn bread pretty quickly, and it was devoured pretty quickly.  A little on the crumbly side, but delicious nonetheless.  Because my husband could not join us, I went with the 2-meat combo (brisket and pulled pork) so there would be some left to take him.  Yeah, that's my story.  I was a happy eater to find I could order my meats sauce free!  The brisket was good, but a little too fatty.  The pork was really good, however; adequately seasoned and smokey.  I tried the spicy sauce on the table, and found it to be just right, just a little kick to it.  For sides, the mac and cheese was creamy and not lacking in sauce.  Yum.  The roasted corn was really really good.  If corn always tasted that good, I would move to Iowa.Our service was great and they were accommodating for our request for separate checks with a 20% gratuity.  Our service was actually good enough, especially given a party that size, that I tipped extra.  And I did refrain from eating all of my meal, so that I could have a nice lunch the next day when my husband refused my offer of the leftovers.  Only problem was he didn't refuse.  And I went hungry the next day, wishing I had eaten all of my meal when I had the chance.Complimentary cornbread and donuts.Nuff said. OK. There's more! Like the Ronco commercial..."But wait, there's MORE!"We had trouble finding the front door. Looks it's sweltering hot and our brains were in meltdown. We entered the To Go door which is a very tiny room for take out service only. The lovely employee upon hearing our door troubles said we could come behind the counter and enter the dining room. What? We don't have to go outside again? Love her. She led us right to a perfect table and provided us with menus. Great service! Make it happen!I was surprised and impressed by the upscale decor. Kind of reminded me of the House of Blues in West Hollywood...made to look like a shack from the outside but quite luxurious inside. Nice. Our server Kellee was Killer!!! I wanted to snatch her away. Oops, I said snatch. Anyway, the pulled pork sandwich with mac n cheese was Bobby Q perfection as was Rickie's brisket sandwich with shoestring fries...the fries...so so yummy! Sweet tea, actually, well, how do you say...should be called super, really, alotta, sweet tea. Sweeter than Paula Deen's pie. Wait. That didn't sound right. Bobby Q. I wuv you! P.S. Did I detect a little Velveeta in the mac n cheese? Me thinks so and ME LIKEY!That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome. 5 stars. The smoked corn was a little Meh... it was oily like not butter oily... not a huge fan of the texture either. I like corn crunchy and it was not. Service was great. I did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing, but bugs have to eat too right? (still 5 stars lol)Here in Cali, we call it barbecue, or BBQ!In Arizona, they call it Bobby Q.Well, maybe not all Arizonians call it that, but a good number of them do. When I reached out to some AZ Yelpers to find out where I can find some serious BBQ in Phoenix, almost every person mentioned Bobby's name. Bobby Q is a huge place that looks more like an upscale steakhouse rather than a BBQ joint. The inside is dimly lit and has a fancy, upscale decor. They also have two big bars and a banquet room. Right when our party of four was seated we received some delicious house made cornbread with sweet butter. After devouring the yummy cornbread we ordered two appetizers, their Q-Rolls and their Fire Pie Pizza topped with beef brisket. The Q-Rolls were similar to those pigs in a blanket everyone loves as a child.  Instead of mini hot dogs, Bobby stuffs the little flaky pastries with juicy beef brisket. The Q-Rolls were incredible alone but when dipped in the chipotle sauce that comes with the app, it gave the rolls an even more fabulous taste.  The beef brisket pizza was good but not great. They put lots of cheese on the pizza but not enough Bobby Q sauce or beef brisket. For dinner I ordered their three meat combo with pulled pork, beef brisket and St. Louis spare ribs. My fiancé ordered the Prime Rib with Chimichuri shrimp dinner. My dinner was big enough to feed at least two people. Every meat was phenomenal. The pulled pork and beef brisket were both juicy, tender and incredibly flavorful. The St. Louis spare ribs were falling-off- the-bone tender and had a nice smoky flavor. My girls Prime Rib was also really good but her shrimp were burnt, rubbery, and had almost no Chimichuri sauce on them, which upset her a little bit. Once your dinners are brought to your table, they also bring out two big containers filled with warm sweet Bobby Q sauce and spicy Bobby Q sauce. Both of these Bobby Q sauces were great but since I'm a huge fan of spicy I preferred the spicy sauce over the sweet one. My dinner came with three sides while my girls came with two. These are the sides we got.Mac and cheese (we both got this) Pecan ColeslawLoaded Baked PotatoRoasted CornAll of these sides were great but my favorite of the bunch was the Mac and Cheese. I don't remember what my other dinner companions ordered but I do remember they all said they loved what they had.To wash down all this great Bobby Q, we all had huge glasses of their house made sweet tea, which was super sweet and delicious.Even though everyone was full, we all decided to share a slice of their Sub Zero Banana Cream Pie for dessert. This pie was served ice cold and was more like a piece of banana cheese cake than a regular banana cream pie. This pie had an amazing banana flavor and was topped with lots of caramel sauce. To our surprise, after we finished the pie, our server brought us some home made complimentary cinnamon sugar donuts. These little things were wonderful, I just wish I would have been a little less full so I could have enjoyed them more. The service and prices here were both great. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. Since it was our first time there he really helped us out by making suggestions and telling us what their most popular dishes are. The prices were very reasonable seeing that you get so much food.  If your a fan of BBQ then I guarantee you will be a fan of Bobby Q. If you ever visit Phoenix you have to check this place out.Why oh why have I waited so long to come here on a Friday night? You get a a fabulous little mini buffet that has tri tip, nachos, shrimp, cheese, and its free? Oh and the drink prices? Two very strong drinks, $4.50 each? What? Are you kidding me? Tons of people which makes for great people watching, great food, good happy hour prices? Again why did I wait so long? Oh I will be back. That is for certain.My waistline theories go like this: if it's free, the calories don't count. This goes for items like free bread, butter, candies at the end of the meal and especially the free donuts they give me before I leave Bobby Qs. Those definitely do not count towards my waistline. Bobby Qs is a your run of the mill BBQ restaurant with fun (and slightly cheesy) decor, fatty yet satisfying and tasty food and overall a fun time. This restaurant is hidden off of random side streets but the catch is that you can see it from the 17. Like I said, the food here is fatty but pretty good. Expect BBQ food with a chain-like feel. The atmosphere is the same. In summary, if you're in the area and get hungry, this is a great option. I think it would also be fun for a low key group dinner. Plus, they serve those donuts. Yum.Went out on a date Friday night, again he picked the place, and it was a non-chain place, which scored him some points, but Bobby Q's gives the feeling a chain place, I have never been and I never knew about the Bobby McGee's that used to be there, I'm not from Arizona, and wasn't around during that time.   After I went to Bobby Q's I actually looked at some the reviews from fellow yelpers and man I am sorry I missed out on the roasted corn, I am going to have to try that next time I go!  Our server's Melissa was a good, but she got tractable, like we made bets to see how long it would take before she came back to our table to check on us, it was about every 10 mins. Now don't get me wrong I love good service, but there is a difference between being pushy and good.Like I have said before, Im a visual person and when I saw on the drink menu that yummy looking drink called Strawberry Qlada, I knew I had to get that, when it came to the table, it was just as beautiful in person, pinks, red, white, pineapple & cherry garish, it was a delish drink!The round corn breads were a sweet surprise! I love me some cornbread! And with the whipped butter, what could be better, other than drowning them in hot bowl of chili! I ordered the 8oz center cut top sirloin with mac & cheese, ranch beans & mushrooms & onions for my steak!   I had asked Melissa if she liked the mac & cheese and she is it was the bestselling item on the menu, oh that's good, but that didn't answer my question lol but I wound up ordering them anyways, and they were good, but it wasn't great! Yes it's made with 5 different cheese, its creamy and it's like eating velveeta mac n cheese, not my fav but if that's your thing, then it's up your alley! The ranch beans were good, it was little peppery and sweet, which is a great combo for me!  The steak was the perfect amount for me! It was cooked to perfection, it was tender and tasty! The mushrooms and onions were sautéed just right, not too soft not to hard!   Had I read reviews I would have known at the end of the meal they give us some sweet donuts! How cool is that! Any places that offers sweet little donuts is alright with me!I don't usually like to give a review after only having been to a place once but... I have never felt so welcome, so well treated, and so satisfyingly full after one visit!I have definitely found my new favorite carnivorous dining place. My friend Don S. checked in here one day and I asked him if he was clubbing because I had been to the lounge with my cousins before but didn't know much about the restaurant since it had changed from Bobby McGee's back in the day. He laughed! Told me they have an amazing burger! Say what? Bobby Q is a five minute drive from my house! How did I not know this? I went last night with my son and let me tell you, one of the most pleasant dining experiences of my life! I ordered the smokehouse burger. It is 50 cents more than the regular burger and probably a hundred times better because it has bacon! Haha. I love my meat still pink in the middle and when I ask for something m.rare I would like it m.rare and preferably closer to the rare side. The chef hooked up my patty perfect! One of the best burger I have ever had! My little boy ordered the mac off the kids menu (love kids menus), and he loved it so much he ordered up a second helping! Sean our waiter was so kind and helpful and playful with the boy. It's so much more enjoyable when the staff is good with kids. Laura, who must have been management, came out to check on us mid meal and was also super sweet. She brought me out a sample of the brisket. Melty and delicious and bursting to the brim with flavor. She also told my son that if he tried the brisket she would bring him desert on the house! How cool is that?!? Of course he tried it, but more importantly he loved it! Then came.... Death by Chocolate! Its like an ice cream sandwich with brownie book ends! And so large that I only let Buddha tackle one part of it. I cannot wait to come back and try more off the menu! Oh did I mention that they give you free donuts at the end of your meal? I mean who can eat donuts after this kind of meal! But they are just as tasty the next morning! YUM!So impressed!A good friend of mine -who's opinion on Q I highly respect- was in town a few months ago and stopped into Bobby Q's (BQ), and he couldn't stop raving about it. I've been jonesing all week to come check it out, but I figured I'd wait until my wife got into town. Well, I finally got my chance and I was giddy as a school girl. I was actually able to make a reservation through OpenTable on the Yelp app, and I'm sure glad we did. Upon our arrival at 5:30 the place was already packed, but by thetime we left at 7 there was a hoard of people flooding out into the street--and for good reason! Enough jibber-jabber--on to the food! I ordered the Three Meat Combo and that comes with two sides and some of BQ's Cornbread.Sides:Mac and Cheese- This might easily be the creamiest, most decadent Mac & Cheese I've ever had. They use something similar to Velveeta Cheese to coat it, and I'm not slamming Velveeta. It's so rich I couldn't finish it. 3.75*Pecan Coleslaw- I'm very picky about my slaw; I don't want it too creamy, sweet, or bitter and this was absolutely perfect! I also loved the crunch you get from the little pieces of toasted Pecan they add to the top--I'm definitely adding that to my slaw the next time I make it. 5*Cornbread- Excellent mix of a Northern/Southern cornbread--it has the cakiness and slight sweetness if Northern, and the crust and stone-ground corn like a Southern; I could eat these everyday. 5* Meat:St. Louis Ribs- These might be the best St. Louis Pork Ribs (other than mine) that I've ever had! The meat had a nice "tug" to it, but was still so tender, smokey and delicious! 5*Beef Brisket- Juicy and flavorful this brisket was quite good--my only gripe is I wish it had a bit more smokiness to it. 4*Pulled Pork- Another excellent job by BQ! Juicy, smoky and porky (just like me!) Everything you could want in Pulled Pork and then some. I piggled (sic) the whole lot of it! 5*Dessert:Sugar-Cinnamon Donuts- They give everyone at the table these tiny little donuts that they make fresh up front and they're fabulous; they had me at "Cinnamon". I guess you can just walk in and order a dozen for $3 if that's all your craving, too. 5*Service & Ambiance- Good service from our server, Jessica. She was on top of things without being annoying. BQ is located in a building that looks like something you'd find in the middle of nowhere. The interior is mostly brick and wood causing the noise level in there to be deafening by the end of the night. They also keep it a bit too dark for my liking, but the decor is swell. 4*-service/3.5*-AmbianceValue- The meals here are not a bad value, as my Three Meat Combo cost $22, but it's more than enough food for 2 people. Even my piggy self couldn't finish it--but guess what's for breakfast?! Snooch to the Nooch! 4*I'm about to make a bold proclamation: I think BQ has *the* best BBQ I've ever had. I don't make that statement lightly either--after all, I have a reputation to uphold. I think this was easily the best meal I've had here in AZ, and that's saying something. I can't wait for my next visit to the Valley of the Sun so I can visit BQ again. If you ever find yourself in Phoenix, I highly, highly recommend making your way here--just make sure to make a reservation!This amazing place has been here what 30 35 years, maybe even longer. They are still great, if not better than ever.I have always liked the food here. I just never seem to make it out to this part of town anymore.  If you are at Metro center or on the I17 headed south this is a great place to stop for Lunch or Dinner.The meat here is wonderful! I mean really good. I love the Ribs, and the BBQ sauce is mighty fine. It is always busy here, is it any wonder. they are still serving up great food and great service. I know that they have a lot of other things on the menu, but I always  get BBQ.When you like it, don't change. Full service bar and lots of parking.Please do not drink and drive though.Years ago the staff used to dress up in Costume, too bad they do not do that anymore.Short version: The food is delicious and the service is wonderful! 5 stars.Long version: Ambiance: i was impressed with this restaurant as soon as we stepped in. It reminds me of the Lucille's BBQ chain in decor and ambiance - classy yet family friendly, with southern comfort and hospitality. Their menu even has a truck on the cover.Service: Excellent. All of the waitstaff was attentive and courteous. Our waitress explained the history of the restaurant to us since we told her we were first time visitors. When our party of three told her we were planning on splitting a whole rack of baby back ribs, we assumed we would get a large plate of whole ribs and then three plates. Instead, we got three separate plates portioned with 3 equal parts of ribs and the sides distributed evenly as well. Such an unexpected and very much appreciated gesture, considering that ribs are messy enough as it is!Food: AMAZING! Sweet Tea ($2): Refreshing and sweet, but not in excess.Corn Bread (free): The only thing served that I didn't enjoy. If you like dense, oily cornbread "patties", this might be your thing.Cajun Shrimp ($11): The shrimp is marinated in cajun seasonings and beer and it is accompanied by garlic bread. The slightly alcoholic flavor paired well with the shrimp and cajun spices and the garlic bread was buttery, crispy, and not overwhelmingly flavored.Baby Back Ribs ($26): The best bbq I've ever had in my life! To be fair, I'm not a huge bbq connoisseur, but the ribs are succulent, tender, flavorful and the bbq sauce adds a tangy flavor. The meat falls clean off the bone.Shoestring fries (comes with ribs): They are extra skinny and salted to perfection - my favorite type of fries. Scrumptious.Mac & cheese (comes with ribs): Creamy, cheddary with a delicious consistency. The BEST kind of mac and cheese to accompany a rack of ribs.Thank Q Donuts: When you leave, they give you fresh, warm cinnamon donuts - and a lot too! They gave us 6 for our party of 3. An awesome touch.This will be my new go-to bbq joint from now on :)Tip: If you check in with yelp or foursquare and tell your waitress, they will give you 10% off your entire check. Be sure to tell the waiter before you ask for the check!This might be my longest review ever. You don't have to read it, but you probably should. How this place has over 700 reviews to begin with is beyond me. Not even Amy's Baking Company has that many reviews and, as you might know, was heavily trolled after it aired on Kitchen Nightmares. They must be handing out money to folks for writing this shit. Or they're planted reviews. What's even more baffling is that it has a solid 4 stars. Methinks something is not quite right, but whatevs. Let's move on, shall we?This place is truly bizarre. I've been here maybe a total of 3-4 times since it first opened many years ago. It's a BBQ restaurant / club-lounge thingy. And as I learned for the first time at happy hour yesterday, it's apparently two different restaurants. At least, that's how everyone acted. My boss had made reservations for us in the Q Lounge for their Friday happy hour. Apparently you can just walk in (provided you're 21) and eat a buffet spread for free. But not until you get past the LAUNDRY LIST of dress code rules. Yes, a restaurant that serves BBQ, near Ghettrocenter, has a fucking idiotic dress code. Seriously some of the dumbest shit I have ever seen. I thought I was in metro Phoenix at a BBQ restaurant, not a Scottsdale nightclub. The list includes asinine things such as: No white t-shirts, no hats, no sunglasses, no sandals, and must be a cougar. I wanted to be like, mo' fucker, do you know this is PHOENIX? We wear sunglasses upon walking up. We wear hats to shade our faces from the blazing sun. We wear sandals, often times fashionable ones, so our feet don't get all sweaty. And white t-shirts? Now you're just acting foolish. Of course, my boyfriend whom I invited, was wearing a white t-shirt, with a nice button-up collared dress shirt (it was unbuttoned), a hat (a nice one, like derby style), and sunglasses because um, to shield your eyes? He was asked to button up his shirt, remove his sunglasses (no shit Sherlock, don't we all once we get inside?), and remove his hat. Mind you, he's a nice dresser, not some hobo with tattered clothes (usually). Had I not been invited by my boss to this happy hour, I would've bounced right then and there. It all just seemed like some giant, corny joke.Time for a paragraph break. It helps your eyeballs if you break things up. I'd like to point out that the actual restaurant portion does not honor said happy hour. That's right, you must go to the 21+ side with the fun dress code rules to have happy hour, even though it gets insanely crowded with nowhere to sit. Oh wait, you CAN order a happy hour beverage, but you have to get up from the table and walk your ass to the bar. If you order a beverage at your table, it'll be full price.I will now talk about the redeeming qualities which merited that killer 2-star review. The food is very good. The mac and cheese is the cheesiest, and all of the meat is incredibly tender. A wee bit overpriced, but not awful. They also give you free freshly-made donuts when you leave instead of a damn dinner mint. That's pretty dope. The staff is very kind. Our sever, Alicia (sp?), was very sweet and accommodating. Kudos to her.Lastly, it's confusing as shit to get into this place. The parking lot is weird, and if you've never been, you'll have no idea where to enter. The Q Lounge vs the restaurant portion. Two different places, remember. Even though...it's...not.Note: Just don't dress like you live in Phoenix. You might not get inside to the dopest dance club in all of metro Phoenix.Honestly, at times when a review is stated such as my first and initial one, its worth giving it another try. Well that was the case here. At bobby Q I had the pleasure to of course dine-in at this joint. I have to admit the BBQ sauce, taste, and services once again is amazing. Truth must be told, and in my case I had to re-anaylize my taste buzz and give it another try. I ordered the ribs, few beers, and of course can't miss out on the two amazing starters, Corn bread and the Q rolls. Omg those Q rolls I can live on it and Am officially going to change my "last meal before I die" to Q rolls. Its official, Congrats Bobby Q u identified my true last meal "if I had to choose" it would be yours Sir. Okay, Bobby Q restaurant is legit meaning if you happen to visit this place at night (which I strongly recommend) as its a Night place to dine-in at it'll show you the vision am illustrating for you here. The cool xmas white lights, wood chairs outside, and welcome'n type of style will make u feel like your in Texas but really in AZ... Give it a try, I can assure you that this is maybe the only BBQ joint you'll have the chance to get some ribs if your from AZ or just happen to visit it. Cheers. oh and again their customer services honestly by far the best.Let me start by saying I wish I could give it zero stars. Owners/managers are racist, racist, racist!!  It is blatantly obvious that their "dress code" in the lounge is not dependent on what you're wearing but what color your skin is. If you are African American take your money and patronage elsewhere and save yourself the frustration and harassment. We have been here dozens of times over the years and have spent thousands of dollars but we're done!!  Their practice is unacceptable. Shame on them!The restaurant was packed and even though there was a wait list we got seated right away.  However, we had to wait at our table a really long time and I think they forgot about us but the waiter apologized and gave us a free appetizer.  In terms of the food - appetizer 4, baby backs 5, spare ribs 5, chicken 4, sausage 3, mac and cheese 4, roasted corn 5, corn bread 4, potato salad 4, cinnamon sugar donuts 4.  Overall, really excellent barbecue.First time in Phoenix and saw this place on Yelp.  Didn't really think AZ was known for bbq but decided to give this place a whirl. The bbq was surprisingly yummy.  I had the baby backs and spicy sausage. The bbq wasn't drenched in sauce which is how I like it. Huge portions and very reasonable prices. Their cinnamon sugar donuts at the end of the meal are so addicting!  Friendly staff as well with lots of seating.I'll go 4.5/5 for this one.  I've eaten BBQ all over the country, and I can't say Bobby Q is "as good as it gets", but they are pretty darn good.  Almost 3 weeks ago Mr. M and I met up with Tim S. and his family to give this place a try.  Right away I was impressed with the friendly service, and the hostess was helpful when we needed to add a high chair to the table.  Our server was Kanisha and she did a great job and was on point with taking our orders, making sure our drinks weren't empty, and bringing us togo boxes and the check when we were ready.  We wanted to be able to try a wide variety of items so we started with the Q-rolls ($10.50), which are absolutely delicious.  Brisket wrapped up like an egg roll?  Heck yeah!  Those disappeared quickly.  We also started with their house beer, which if memory serves is an amber ale and that was a nice, easy to drink beer.  Really enjoyed that as well.  The smaller one is $4.95 and the larger one is $6.00, so the moral of that story is, go for the big one!I ordered the BBQ chicken/prime rib combo ($34) which came with 3 sides.  I chose the loaded baked potato, mac & cheese, and the ranch beans.  Mr. M ordered the 3 meat combo ($25) with pulled pork, brisket, and some ribs.  I thought I would waddle out of the joint stuffed to the gills, but we actually had so much fun talking that I didn't eat nearly as much as I thought I would.  Here's what I thought of the food:  Prime rib, chicken, and ribs:  Excellent!  Brisket: very good.  Pulled pork and ranch beans: really nothing going on there.  Very little flavor in the pork, and the beans tasted syrupy and had no BBQ flavor.  The other sides we had were very good.  I could OD on the mac & cheese.  Nicely done.Lunch was pricey if you look at the receipt total of $93.63 after tax, before tip, but we had a lot of leftovers.  Overall we had a great experience and I would go back any time.

Popped in for some lunch with old friends.  After browsing the menu, I decided to go for the Trio of Sliders, which are 3 Sliders (BBQ Bacon, Mushrooms, and Regular).  It comes with a small side order of Fries.  Since I wasn't paying for lunch, I forgot to get the price.....I think it's around $9.The food came out after a short wait.  The Sliders were OK.  My favorite was the BBQ Bacon Slider.  The other two weren't that great.  The Fries were just OK.Overall, it was a nice lunch with friends.Return Factor - 60%Having relatives with a time share at the Grand Hiltons, you're bound to end up having a meal at a Paradise Cafe.This one being at the Convention Center Hilton, they remind me of a tropical style Coco's. Got myself a breakfast plate that came with toast, two eggs, hash browns and bacon. Filling and decent, although the eggs were pretty over cooked. Got overcharged on my bill, so double check it!!!

Restaurant name  Tradiciones

Review Text :
Holy Ricky Martin! Me gusto this restaurante! Seriously mis amigos y amigas. Entering Tradiciones is an elevating experiencia. Like entering Disneyland. Es imposible not to be muy feliz.. You get me papi? Waitresses in frilly dresses with big smiles on their caras bonitas. A dining room lleno de color, energia and muy clean. Like spotless. You get mi papi? Carnitas was tender and served with homemade tortillas...Dios Mio! Homemade. Thicker than the ones us gringos are used to. And mucho mejor. You get  mi papi? Fajitas, margaritas, watermelon juice, salsa and service all first rate. So, two thumbs up from this gringo and his novio latino. We we're both treated as las reinas that we are. I hope Tradiciones becomes a tradition of ours. You get mi papi?Okay WHY hasn't anyone told me about this place before?!I think I just found my new favorite Mexican place in the city!! and that says a LOT - I loves mah Mexican food!!Earlier today my mom and I were on our way to visit a relative when we decided to go have dinner somewhere, I wanted Biaz Market, but she didn't want to try somewhere new. So I suggested Ranch Market and she agreed, as we parked I saw the sign that said resturant, and I thought this location didn't have a deli like the one on the South side does - and we were confused. We chose to just give it a try. And we stepped one foot beyond the large corridors and it was so COLORFUL!This is what I mean by the 'hood being colorful, but here - you could actually SEE all the colors and it was beautiful. We wandered around and saw the cool stuff they have outside in a lil shopping area. But it was empty! We were worried that they were closed but trugged on ahead. waay in the back was the entrance of the actual resturant. We were warmly greeted and seated right away because, at 4:30PM on a Tuesday - they were very empty... there were only 3 tables occupied in their very nicely decorated dining room which was very clean and even boasted a mural. Loves it! :) our waiter brought us some chips and salsa but the salsa lacked a kick, it's never hot enought me (that sounded dirty didn't it?!) haha! So I asked for something spicer - he gave me a look of concern and said they had habenero sauce... BRING IT! I was excited... the H-Sauce was KILLER!! But oh - so - freakin - good!! I loved it! i started mixing sauces and dubbed myself the Salsa Alchemist! :D After an entire bowl of chips, our food was ready. I had the Sampler Appetizer and it was very good. My mom had the combination with a Red Tamale, cheese enchilada with rice and beans. My sampler appetizer was sooooo good! The Flautas were nice and crispy and the seasoned chicken was awesome and went better with the mild sauce. The mini beef chimi was the BEST damned chimi I ever ever had! I wanted to pack the rest of my meal to go and order a chimichanga and eat that! lol! I had to have my mom sample it and she loved it too! The Sopricitos were AMAZING! I never had anything like that before. The waiter explained that they were a very thick Corn tortilla topped with seasoned chicken, lettuce, tomato, queso fresco & tomitillo sauce. I will definatly go back just for this dish alone! And as if that wasn't enough - the chicken enchiladas were very good, but the sauce was very deep... it had a very dark flavor. Almost too dark, I would have liked for it to have been a lil lighter in flavor. But it was still good.My mom enjoyed her tamale but felt it was a tad too dry, she wanted red sauce but chose not too ask for it because she felt the enchilada sauce was way too strong for the tamale. She didn't really like her chese enchilada and didn't finish it. But she liked the beans and rice. and really enjoyed the automosphere as well as the chips and salsa. Inspite those small faux pas, I'm still giving it the full 5 stars because the service was SO amazing. It's been a while since I've had exceptionally great service. Everything was spot on... To my fellow yelpers: you MUST go and enjoy yourself! However, they have crazy-funky hours so look out for the signs that indicate whether or not they're open. I hope more people give this place a go - with the economy the way it is, I'd hate for this place to close because no one's going! And don't be afraid to ask for the Habenero sauce, yes it's melt your tounge atomically hot, but ask for an empty salsa bowl and start mixing the sauces and get your salsa alchimist on!!Awesome and Authentic! ~I Loved this place just upon entering, beautiful fountain and courtyard, a row of souvenir vendors. You definitely feel like you've left Phoenix, which can be a good thing!I didn't realize how huge this place was! ~Once we got inside, we were greeted and seated. Service was great. ~Fabulous chips and Yummy Salsa! I ordered the Gringo Loco Enchiladas(see pics), which were stuffed with chicken,corn , black beans and cheddar cheese and smothered with your choice of red or green chile colorado..................I chose red.........Lucky for me I was served green by mistake, I didn't want to say anything I just figured I'd eat it, and let me tell you I'm so glad I did......That was some of the best green Chile pork I've had and it was sooooo much better than the red sauce the Mr. had on his cheese enchiladas (my preference of course he loved his too) Everything was perfect, unfortunately I didn't have time to check out the market side but I have a feeling I'll be back very soon!I think I'm in love. For any of you who have spent time in East LA, Tradiciones is very reminiscent of that scene. I arrived to have dinner with Julia and Amy. I was exhausted and hungry. We were greeted and led into a HUGE dining room. I knew I was going to fall in love. Did I like the dumb dresses the ladies have to wear? No, but it makes the tourists and non-hispanic people feel comfortable. I usually set my bar on the quality of food based on the chips and salsa. We were served a fresh basket of chips and each given a personal bowl of salsa! Hooray for double dipping! The manager was walking around and he stopped by to say hello and then brought us a complimentary bowl of guacamole With three lovely ladies each with a fab pair...of.... I mean each with great personalities, what do you expect? So far so good! I had a margarita that was served in a martini glass full of ice... hmmm is that weird to anyone else? Oh well. The marg was good! For my entree I chose the enchiladas suizas with chicken. What I was served was definitely YUMMY! The tortillas were fresh and they were soft fried. Fabulous, authentic touch! The suizas sauce was slightly tangy. The tanginess was offset by the cotija cheese that was generously sprinkled on top. The word that came to mind every time I took a bite was "creamy". It was a very well made enchilada. The beans and rice were pretty good too. Here's my thing about re-fried beans. I like them when they're made with manteca (LARD) *GASP* and these were more than likely made with them. The re fried beans were flavorful. The rice was eh.. ok. It was rice. I sort of wished for a bit more spice in the rice, but again, it makes the tourists feel safe. An added bonus were the roaming musicians that they had. I was relieved to see that they were not in Mariachi suits but rather nice slacks and blazers and they were SINGING it. I wish I had more energy because I would have been whistling and doing a good ol Grita Mexicano along with the guys at the bar that were enjoying the entertainment! I look forward to enjoying Tradiciones again!So I figured out why this place has 5 from one and 1 from another.... It is owned ny our friends up North. Yep The super nice yet bland group we call Canadians. They have created a tourist trap that appeals to tourist and lovers of SW crap. LOLHere is a copy of the business plan. Lets create a super nice place that attracts people to it, eah? (cuz they end the sentence with a question)But we do know anything about Mexican food?Lets make it so neat just to be in the place that we will get by on our looks? Eah?OKAAY... make sure the drinks are good.

This Cheesecake Factory is like all of the others. Consistent.  That is actually what made McDonalds famous- consistency.  It's very crowded, quite loud, and if you are lucky enough to get a patio seat you will be treated to the Poseidon show complete with smoke, water and flames. My husband went with a chicken pasta dish, and I opted for the chicken tostada salad.  Both were good as usual.  The service was excellent, as it should be in a big hospitality based town.   Is it flash, fancy or different-no, but if you are looking for a quick meal without breaking the bank, then here's your place.

I came here for lunch after driving by this place a few times and was happy with what I had.The decor here is really cute.  Simple, clean and bright.  I went with the Greek Chicken Pita, and it came with a bag of chips, a side of pasta salad and a pop.   Total bill was $9.02.  Not bad!  The chicken was tasty, pasta salad was okay at best.  I took home my extras and had them as a light dinner. Food here is fresh, healthy and light.  Servings are healthy in size and would gladly return in the future.Lets just set the record straight here. Zoe's serves Mediterranean just like Qdoba serves Mexican.When I say just like the Q, I mean the entire experience. Walking into the shop gives more of a cookie cutter national chain feel; which is probably because they are in fact a chain of restaurants. Zoe's food was average and unimpressive. I did like the hummus though. Their prices similar to independent and family operated Mediterranean around the valley; in some cases more. I would prefer to visit Cypress Grill, just up the street from this location, they're my favorite Medi in CenPho so far. The staff here was friendly, they took our order promptly and served the food within a few minutes. Don't get me wrong, the food was in no way "bad", per se. I just can't shake the feeling of "I've had better" when thinking about my experience.If you're looking to fill your belly with food just because it's time to eat, this might just be the place for you. If you're interested in a great Mediterranean meal, I implore you to please try something new. I likely won't be returning, we do live in the city of a million restaurants, go out and choose one! (but don't take me at my word on that just made up fact).Happy Yelping Phoenix, now where's my hummus?Tried Zoe's Kitchen for dinner one night, it was mid-week and after 7pm so the place wasn't too crowed. After checking out the menu I went with the chicken kabobs and put in my order to go.The meal had chicken kabobs with grilled peppers, onions and tomatoes on a bed of rice pilaf, and came with a pita bread cut into 4 and a Greek salad.  The Greek salad was fresh and great tasting, even without the dressing. The chicken kabobs were tender and moist, I took everything off the kabobs and just mixed it in with the rice pilaf and it made a great meal.  Perfect for a simi fast dinner.

Looking for a place to eat, we stumbled across this joint.  What a great surprise!The restaurant is located on the sublevel floor of the hotel, below the lobby.  It's kind of hidden and difficult to find if you're unfamiliar with the place....but worth looking for.  The stairwell is lit with candles...I wonder how long it takes to light all of those every day?  Ha!They serve you this Bread that must come from Heaven because it's so awesome!  The only bad part is that the Butter comes out cold and hard....why do restaurants do that?!  It's such a pain to spread it on the Bread.....it was awesome nevertheless.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=2eQrsJcdON3yV2NWBPJq5w#2eQrsJcdON3yV2NWBPJq5whttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=nhgW17m3ur1K6_t2ewSXRQ#nhgW17m3ur1K6_t2ewSXRQFor appetizers, we had the Kobe Beef Tenderloin Flatbread, $12.  It was very good and raw.....the server didn't tell us it was raw and neither did the menu (see pics below).  Good thing we didn't mind, but consider yourself warned.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=0hM9bfms7OIUO2zP98tL1w#0hM9bfms7OIUO2zP98tL1whttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=4bqUF6UcLnJTWSHAIVRFpQ#4bqUF6UcLnJTWSHAIVRFpQThe Better Half had the Lump Crab, $14 and I had the Annatto Pollo Asado (Jidori Chicken), $27.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=Zp0dRqvTPsRo-B1FmjLXvQ#Zp0dRqvTPsRo-B1FmjLXvQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=0tOnd6OKDEW3P7U6Osq8Ew#0tOnd6OKDEW3P7U6Osq8EwFor a side dish, we both split a Calabzitas Con Queso (Squash & Oaxaca Cheese), $6.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=0o4t4YI1Gd10sO4wnhCerA#0o4t4YI1Gd10sO4wnhCerAThe Jidori Chicken is full of flavor and comes with some Pasta, so it's very filling.  The Squash & Cheese was good, but I thought was a little runny.  Very different flavors for your palette here.The service was outstanding and the room is very elegant and romantic.  We washed it down with a bottle of Cabernet of course....yum!I'm glad we found this place, can't wait to return.Return Factor - 99%

Every time my sister comes to visit, we hit up a AYCE sushi joint. Last monday, this was the spot. It was $26.95 which comes w/bud light and the house sake for 60 mins. Here is what we had:3 buds and 2 large sakesspicy tuna hand roll w/masago and a quail egg (me only)2 orders of ahi poke1 order of raw tofu2 orders of salmon and 2 orders hamachi2 orders of amaebi w/deep fried heads1/2 of a roll that i forget the name1 sake shooter (me only)2 baked scallops1 salmon collar1 order of the cajun albacore and 1 order of tako1/2 roll of new york girl in vegas1 green tea ice cream1 pink colored ice cream which i forget the flavorThe food was very good. The fish was fresh. Our sushi chef was the older japanese man. He was great. The waitresses were nice. The place was clean. I'll probably come by myself next time I'm craving sushi when my sister isn't in town. We came here for an early dinner so I was disappointed that I wasn't able to eat more. Great AYCE spot hidden in North Las Vegas.My sister's one complaint was that the bar stools were too low. Yeah they were a little low.Not sure why they have 5 stars. Not sure why they have 2 business listings with 2 different addresses when there's only 1 Tachi. I've been coming to Tachi for years since this place is close to home. The quality has declined over the years. We would normally do AYCE but they also have a regular menu to order from.Miso Soup:This is not the version that's made with love.  The soup is pre-made and the tofu pieces are so tiny. 1/5Sushi/Sashimi:Sashimi isn't included in AYCE. AYCE is about $24-26/person. Or you can get sushi/sashimi combo starting at $10. The quality of fish is inconsistent. Sometimes the fish looks like it was cut using a butter knife. Sometimes the fish is ice-cold. 2.5/5Shumai:You can get these balls fried or steamed. Shumai is meant to be dipped in soy/ponzu sauce but they don't give you sauce here. 3/5Donburi:Katsudon, raw egg on top of rice with hot broth. The hot broth cooks the raw egg so mix it all up as soon as the bowl touches your table. This is a good dish, however, when my sister ordered this the last time, it lacked flavor. They were not busy at all the last time we went so there's no excuse. Another inconsistency? 3/5Since the location is convenient and sometimes we just don't want to drive 10 miles to get good AYCE, I guess we will continue to come here and keep hoping we catch them on a good day.We were in the area and starving for lunch. We decided against AYCE and instead ordered some lunch specials and a couple of appetizers to share.We ordered the shumai and gyoza to start. These were decent, but nothing amazing. Two of my dining companions complained about the shumai tasting overly fishy. I ordered the sushi lunch for my entree. It included five pieces of sushi and a California roll. The sushi and roll were not good. The fish was not fresh and the California roll had an unpleasant texture. The service was really friendly and they accommodated all the specific requests our table had, but I don't think I would come back even if I was in the area again.

I disagree with the previous punters! They're from Berkeley and SF, and comparing an Airport quickie meal to authentic Chinese in the Bay Area? Get real! Compare this to your other choices at Sky Harbor for asian food!For airport quick food, I think Flo's Shanghai Cafe is a good choice, considering it is about the only Asian flavors in PHX. Yes, it isn't up to Flo's in North Scottsdale, which is a great and better choice than Panda and even PF Chang's! Number one, at least this is made (well, somewhat) to order, unlike the buffet at Panda's. There are no fancy food pictures, just a lot of red lanterns and a sign listing the menu options: Noodles and Rice (chow meins and fried rice dishes $6.95 to $7.95), Appetizers ( Pot stickers, Spring Rolls, Crab Puffs, Fried Wontons, Lettuce Cups, Chicken salad, soups, and Shanghai Bao, which are pork balls batter covered and deep fried (you get 4). All of these are $3.25 - $7.95. Then there are Rice bowls, i.e. Broccoli Beef, Mongolian Beef, Teriyaki, Cashew, Sweet and Sour, Orange, Kung Pow, Garlic (all chickens) fro $7.95 to $8.95.I ordered the Shanghai Baos and Mongolian Beef . The beef was real steak slices, not that overcooked brittle things of Panda's 'Beijing Beef", and it was covered in sauce and green onions over rice. They have soy and red chili on the tables, not only in packets that you have to beg for at P.E. They also have Arizona Ice Teas and Yeo's Soymilk, try finding that at P.E.! I do wish that they had Asian bottled Green and Oolong teas, but this is Phoenix, who is going to drink that?Of course this is meant to be an airport restaurant for quicker meals, so don't expect Hong Kong quality! Hell, there are only a handful of authentic asian restaurants (of any cuisine) in the Valley of the Sun, where there are maybe 5 Million people living, and less that 1% Asian?Get a grip. I support Flo's because I really liked her Scottsdale location (the old one before she moved across the street) because beside better than PF Changs food and prices and her smiling attentiveness, she had real Serigraphs of Chinese Yunan (now Beverly Hills retired) artist Jiang (which made me like the place immediately, as I like him and own a Serigraph myself of his..."Running Horses"). PS - the help are Mandarin speaking Chinese, too! Try finding two of those in any PF Changs!PPS - Flo's is located in Terminal 4 (Southwest, US AIr) in the shopping mall upstairs, closer to the B and C gates, across from Oaxaca.

Review Text :
I awake, wild eyed in a cold sweat, visions of caramel creme macaroons soliciting me like high class tricks in a whorehouse, Croque Monsieurs their swanky pimps, demanding payment for service. Essence strikes again. The only way to vanquish these dreams is to lunch here on a regular basis. I've been here twice in the past week alone and I think I'm addicted. The atmosphere, product, service, and baked goods have seduced me with their simple elegance. The only gripe I possibly have about this place is the fact that the parking lot is the size of a matchbox, and with Sacks, Cafe Lalibella and Starbucks all occupying the same plaza, finding a place to park during the busy lunch rush is like simultaneously playing Tetris and Frogger.The atmosphere at Essence is understated in its sophistication. Windows line the majority of the dining room, creating an inviting, open air feeling and the attached patio is charming. Strong earth toned colors and cute little origami flower bouquets grace the tables. Despite the small size of the establishment there are a variety of seating options for single patrons or small groups, and I've never seen people waiting for a table, even during their busiest Friday lunch rush.A broad array of patrons frequent Essence including hipsters, young professionals, older adults in their power suits, and even a few elders. I haven't seen very many college kids, which may because the food isn't cheap and it's probably "weirder" than options on Mill's strip. But I dig the "weird" French inspired cuisine. It's decadent and I feel naughty eating it.Everything I've eaten during lunch has been exceptional. The croque moniseur is far and away the best thing I've tried so far. A grilled sandwich with an egg washed top layer, thin sliced ham, creamy gruyere cheese and jalapenos. It's heavenly crunchy, just as the name suggests. The open face steak sandwich is tender delicious and smothered in buttery sauteed mushrooms with a sprinkle of bleu cheese crumbles as a savory accent. The layers of phyllo dough used in the spanakopita demonstrates some serious painstaking dedication to producing a good product, and the chopped Greek salad was phenomenal. Crispy cucumbers, bell peppers, kalmata olives, feta cheese and tomatoes that tasted like, well, actual tomatoes, for once. Something that you don't often find and an indication that Essence uses amazingly fresh organic product whenever possible. Even the side of potato salad with whole grain mustard was exceptional.The offerings at their bakery are just as phenomenal as their lunch entrees. The caramel creme macaroon is seriously the most amazing sandwich cookie I've ever tasted, a perfect harmony between savory creme filling and sweet chewy wafers. The strawberry shortcake is amazingly fresh and light, if not a little hard to eat. And their white chocolate raspberry layer cake is the classiest Little Debbie-esque snack cake I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. One day I vow to pick up a box of "Tasty little treats" just so I can sample a cupcake and about three cookies without having to choose among all the desserts on display!I highly recommend this place. Just don't be surprised if you develop an insatiable desire to consume Essence on a daily basis.This is easily my favorite cafe in all of Tempe - and perhaps the Valley - for lunch and baked goods.  The atmosphere is charming and understated from the way you order to the friendly service you wouldn't expect from a counter service kind of place.I'm always torn on whether to order the croque monseiur or the warm open faced steak sandwich.  Both of the sandwiches are superbly prepared and presented.  You can't go wrong with either.  I always opt for the dijon potato side salad garnished with mustard seed.The warm open faced steak sandwich is tastefully done with tender grilled ribeye with a cabernet butter and sauteed mushrooms and bleu cheese.  Rich, sinful and bad but in a good way, kind of like sex with an old ex.  Similarly the croque monseiur has me hooked, but their use of de-seeded jalapenos adds a distinctive Arizona touch that I just love.While waiting for my lunch I can never resist their outstanding macarons (I prefer the chocolate, but both are delicious), cakes and cookies (go for the chocolate truffle) displayed so innocently behind the glass case where you order.Since I am friends with someone who works here, she doesn't serve us (company policy), so service is usually by the manager, and once we even got the chef, which was a nice surprise because I was able to ask her details on the sandwiches.And finally, because they use organic and locally grown ingredients you can leave feeling like not-so much of an asshat.Five stars. If there were more stars at my disposal, I'd give them all to Essence.Here's what you need to know:Awesome for breakfast and lunch. As many ingredients as possible are organic and local. And if "local" and "organic" is not your thing, come here anyway. Do it. Do it just because the food is outstanding and the people are nice.But know that they close at 3pm. I went through a period in my life during which I was mad at Essence because they weren't open later. But my therapist now has me believing this is a good thing; otherwise I'd be eating here three times a day and would NEVER go home.  If you're vegetarian, plenty of goods for you here. I'm carnivorous myself, and favor the Roasted Chicken Club. How can chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo taste so abundant? It makes no sense. And the potato salad?! Dude ... I don't even like potato salad (a bad picnic experience from my youth turned me off the stuff for the better part of two decades), but this is the goods! Perhaps it's the mustard. Perhaps this is what food from the earth is SUPPOSED to taste like (another shameless plug for organic).And don't even get me started on their sweets. Chocolate truffle cookies: check. White chocolate macadamia nut cookies: check. Macarons: okay, hold up. The macarons are to die for! I went through another period of time where I harbored resentment for Essence because their macarons taste so good. I'm still kinda' in that space. (My therapist and I are working on it as I write). My contention is that Essence is going to become so popular - on the basis of their macarons alone - that Chef Eugenia ends up closing shop and having her own show on the Food Network. Go there. Have one. You'll understand.But go soon, my friends. Because once Eugenia makes her first appearance on Oprah ... it's all over but the crying.I hate to do this, but after today's experience, I am at a loss...I don't even know where to start.  I love going here, but something has to change.  I always look forward to Essence...but today I just shake my head.I went to the counter to order my Hamburger with Cheese (and extra .85 cents)  which is a new item on the menu which I have had before.  I loved it the first time.  I was not in the mood for a salad and I asked what I could do for a substitute and they said I could add potato chips for an extra dollar.  I let that one slide and then I asked for an Iced Tea and if it could be in a to go cup and they said that they would have to charge me an extra .50 cents.  I asked why and the girl at the counter said it has to do with refills.  "But I get refills in my Glass, correct?" "Yes, but that is the way the owner has it."Now I am a little annoyed, but I try to get over it.  My lovely luncheon date, the wonderful Sarah G thought I was in a bad mood, and then I explained my issues with the counter.  I get my food...put my mayonaise all over it and then I cut into the meat...completely raw.  (Please remember that I did not put the top part of the bun and lettuce on my sandwich yet)  I cut into it in the middle just to make sure...and yep!  Red raw meat....I went to the counter and explained my finding and she said that she will put it back on to cook a little longer.  I explained to her that I cut into it and I had put the mayonaise on it...but she said she will take care of it.So I get it back...with the bun on top of my hamburger.  I look underneath, and there is my cut up hamburger.  I take the bun off and noticed that the bottom half of the bunch is extremely soggy.  I also bite into it and it scorched my mouth.  I don't know that they did, but it was completely unacceptable.  On top of it, which didn't surprise me, the hamburger was COMPLETELY DRY.  Sarah and I both noticed that the staff did not come by at all to ask how our food turned out.  I went back up to the counter and told her that I couldn't even it my lunch.  The girl said that the cook ASSURED her that it wouldn't get dry....and I told her that she was assured incorrectly. They did end up refunding my money...after the fact I noticed that I didn't get reimbursed for my cheese.  (LOL)My Parfait was awesome...that was a plus...their desserts are always so yummy.Please Please Please Essence...I want to be able to come back next time and give you back at least 2 extra starts....And by the way....I am still hungryI have a crush and I'm not afraid to admit it -- so here it goes. Dear Essence Bakery, I think you and I make a great team and we should never be apart. Please check yes or no if you feel the same way. As you can tell, I have a soft spot for Essence Bakery and it stems back to a random drive-by encounter during my days of working in that area and searching for a local delicious dining experience. I tried their lunch menu, I fell in love and I've been stalking them ever since. Just today, I had the perfect excuse to visit Essence for breakfast. While I've enjoyed their lunch items many times, I'd never tried breakfast and man, I had no idea what I was missing. I started my eating binge with an Iced Mocha. Do you like chocolate? I do. And I liked this iced coffee. It was like a chocolate milkshake meets a quick hit of caffeine to my brain all while overflowing with coffee awesomeness. Then, it was time to order breakfast. After asking our the wonderful staffer, John, what to order...he said the croissants were heaven in your mouth and comparable to the Parisian delicacy itself, so I obviously had to see if it lived up to the hype. I ordered the egg sandwich on a croissant (ps my waistline hates me after this meal). Verdict? I don't even have words to describe the deliciousness. The croissant melted in my mouth and after I finished, I wish I could start all over again. So just when you think my calorie binge is over, I was told I had to leave with a box of the macaroon sample pack. Have you ever had a macaroon? If not, let me explain...it's two cookies with a creme like mixture in the middle. It is soft and chewy and yummy. These were some of the best macaroons I had which is bad news because now I want them every day. They have macaroons of every shape and size...aka mini and big. I suggest the big macaroon because it's just that good! So when you can't find me, look for me at Essence Bakery because I'll be that girl waiting by the door begging them to open early or stay late.essence /sns/ Show Spelled[es-uhns] -noun1. the basic, real, and invariable nature of a thing or its significant individual feature or features: Freedom is the very essence of our democracy.There are actually five additional dictionary results, but the above is exactly what the word 'essence' in Essence Bakery & Cafe means to me... After hearing about Essence Bakery & Cafe for years, I finally made it in for breakfast a few weeks ago.  And I broke the diet completely by going with the Egg Sandwich on a croissant.  No egg whites here, folks!  I went for the real deal!I devoured my sandwich which included a fried egg with melted Dubliner cheese and tomato.   I washed it down with their Vanilla Iced Coffee.  And I topped it off (a few hours later) with a just sweet enough, delicious pumpkin macaroon!Friendly staff, laid back casual environment, moderate prices, environmental responsibility, and fabulous food; this place is the essence of a local bakery and cafe.  (Did I use 'essence' correctly in that sentence? I hope so!)-Parking was semi-convenient (lot was almost full during peak lunch hour).-Outside and inside seating. -Inside seating was LOUD from all the various conversations within the small restaurant.-Place your order at the counter, they give you a number table tent, and bring your food to you.-Sandwich was REALLY good! Side salad of mixed greens was the BEST I have ever had! Justified the price ($8.25).-Order took maybe 20 minutes to receive (not good if you have a certain amount of time for lunch).-Chocolate Macaron was delicious! I would had ordered more to-go, but at $2.95 each, this could get expensive. -Clean restroom.-I would eat here again!Just the smell of the bakery when you walk in makes your mouth water and aim for the counters.   I have passed by too many times and finally had stopped in after the Tempe Heart Walk.  The restaurant was packed with lunch-goers.  I am glad that they actually have a to-go line.  The menu offers breakfast, lunch, and pastries, but it's the pastries I'm after today.  I went straight for their famous macarons.   The vanilla bean macaron was so delightful.  The texture was light and creamy. The macaron wasn't enough so I had ordered the Small Box of Treats (mini macaron, strawberry tart, key lime tart, and a cookie), almond croissant, and a brioche roll.  After opening the boxes and bags, I completely forgot to take any photos.  Who can blame me?  I will need to return to try their crepes and other desserts.Essence does have an amazing menu but the last two times I've tried to enjoy myself there it just hasn't happened. Twice in the last two weeks I've had experiences where I now will never go there again unless a group of friends decide that's absolutely the only place they want to go to brunch. 1st experience: About two weeks ago today. I had a busy day ahead of me but I had enough time to grab a coffee and some food somewhere before going about my day. I was craving their hot breakfast cereal with fruit and knowing how busy they can get I thought I should probably just call in a to-go order and even if I have to wait a little while when I get there, that's fine because I can take it with me. The first time I called a girl answered the phone and instantly asked me if I could hold without even asking how she could help me, I said "of course". I stayed on hold for 15 minutes. I walked into my coffee shop, stood in line, ordered my coffee and when my coffee was done, I decided to hang up and redial Essence. I call again and sure enough "can you hold please?". I'm thinking "really?" but I say "of course" again. I'm on hold for about 5 minutes (which is a long time when you're already a little frustrated waiting for 15 min the first time). I decide to hang up when I pull into their parking lot and no one has picked up the phone. I walk inside and to my surprise it wasn't as busy as I thought it might be which would justify the ignorance on the phone. I walked up to the counter and stated "I need to place a to-go order". The look on the girls face was like "crap, this might be the girl from the phone". Still, I am a patient person and I thought "its OK, I'm here now and I can just order". As I was ordering one of the gals who works there was showing a girl how to use the register. It ALL made sense! This girl was new and they were trying to train her which was causing everything to be a little more backed up than usual. OK, now I'm not as mad.After placing my order I told the girls I would wait out on the patio. The girl retorted with a condescending tone saying "Just place your number on the edge of the table and we'll find you". Although, I've been to Essence MANY times and knew how their process worked, with their already awesome lack of service I felt I needed to verbally state where I was going to be. OK, sitting on the patio waiting for my food for how long now? I realize that there are other people who may have ordered  before myself but waiting 25ish minutes for hot oatmeal is just ridiculous. It gets better, after I the whole "I'll be on the patio" fiasco. I see a girl pacing the shop inside holding a to-go box looking desperately for whomever it could possibly belong to. At this point I'm thinking to myself "you've got to be kidding me". I just sat there and watched her walk around for a good five minutes if not longer. She finally went back to the counter and did an "I don't know" gesture. I decided to finally mosey on inside. The girl training her saw me frustrated, standing up and walking in so she grabbed the box and some silverware and handed it to me as i was approaching her. I was kind despite my annoyance and thanked her but come on meow. REALLY?A week and a half or so goes by and I think to myself, ya know what? I'm going to give Essence another shot. With their ridiculous hours I wasn't sure when they stopped serving breakfast so I tried to get their as soon as possible. I arrived at  10:45am and they stop serving breakfast at 10:30am (which I will never understand from a business stand point especially given their awesome location. They are totally limiting themselves.) I wasn't annoyed or bothered or frustrated because I could have easily looked up their menu hours and chosen somewhere else to go knowing I would miss the breakfast menu. (Same two gals working by the way) I was pleasant and ordered an iced coffee and a simple SIDE SALAD. Somehow my total came to around $9 after a tip. I'm thinking "that's fine because I know they use fresh/organic ingredients and I'm happy with that". And then I also waited forever for my salad and once it got there the sad pile of green on my plate was enough to erk the evil Steph monster out of me. I was pissed. I downed my salad in maybe five minutes because I HAD to get out of there. I ate my salad so fast I didn't finish my iced coffee. I walked up to the counter to ask for a to-go cup so I could take my remaining coffee with me. She told me I had to pay extra if I wanted to take it to-go!! ARE YOU SERIOUS????? "For a refill its more" me: "but I don't want a refill. I simply want to take the coffee which I've already paid for with me". "Its still more if you want to take it to-go". She knew I was upset. I sat my iced coffee on the counter and left. I promise, I waited a LONG time and thought about all of this over in my head a few times before writing this review. I'll miss their breakfast but OH WELL.Way to go Essence. After a few awful experiences here you'd think we would learn right? Remember how I said I would never go back to eat here ever again? Well this morning I did. And I regret it.Long story short. We stood in line, ordered, paid $30 for two breakfast items and two iced soy lattes, found a table, and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. As soon as I noticed a table of four who had come in significantly later than us being delivered food and enjoying their meal I was furious. Our drinks were gone and we had been sitting there for almost 40 minutes. My boyfriend went to the counter to ask them what was going on. They didn't have our order. Surprised? I shouldn't have been. Essence and I just weren't meant to be. IT GETS BETTER!  We asked for the food to go since we live 2 minutes away and we were sick of sitting there. They brought out the food super fast which was a little concerning since our food hadn't been made yet, right? They were kind enough to load us up with some goodies but it didn't even matter because after our super short drive home we immediately opened our food from being super hungry and its was COLD. Holy shit. Give me a break.The food here at Essence is really good.  It really is.  BUT, they're not only not open on Sundays (they serve breakfast for the love of god!) but the service is consistently just the worst goddamn thing in the world.Each time I go there, I say it's my last time and this time I think it really is.  I don't know.  Fuckin' place always draws me back in because Tempe only has like three places to get breakfast, it's silly.  Anyway, I got the "big" breakfast, which cost as much as any normal thing called a big breakfast would, but the portions given to the namesake were a total joke.  Lil' potato cake thing, lil' pieces o' bread, lil' thingy of mushrooms.  It's cute.  It wants so badly to be big.  Anyway, I didn't get the vegetarian version and I noticed that it was missing sausage.  I brought it up and the food server was like oh man, sorry about that, it'll be right out.I ended up eating my entire breakfast while waiting for my sausage.  I waited and waited before I finally went inside to inquire and before I even said one word, before my dumb mouth even opened to speak, everyone working behind the counter, three people, frantically said, "It's coming right OUT, sir!"  Like I'm being fucking unreasonable.  Sure.  How demeaning is that, to be treated like I'm some cheapskate fatfuck for wanting something I already paid for?The sausage came like ten minutes, literally, after that.  I wanted to hit the road.  But, it was super delicious.  There was a dude sitting next to us outside and the chick food server he had was treating him like total shit.  He didn't seem to mind, but I overheard her really patronizing him when he asked if he could have a thing of toast, "Uh, well sir, if you wanted toast that's something you would've ordered beforehand.  It's NOT free."  She said it so shitty, like responding to a pervert who asked her if she shaved her privates.  He said he'd pay for it, no big deal.  Dude, that guy ordered a lot of food and probably racked up a decent bill.  Bring him some toast, you cheap bastards.Essence is always packed, hot, loud and stupid.You know I love Essence, but because I am a regular who sometimes visits twice in the same day (like today), I have to say that I am sick of their bad customer service. No, I am sick of their crappy attitude! The people at the front end of the house are either incompetent or rude ... with one exception, the lady with glasses and short dark hair. She has always been helpful and nice. I don't want her lumped into this review, she is the only good front end employee left in this place. At least, she is the only one from the old crew I've seen on my last several visits. The rest of this younger, new bunch have such an awful disposition and way of saying things that I am no longer going to be an Essence regular.   Here is how today's lunch visit went:-They were out of the lunch special -They subbed an item in my back-up order without notifying me -They were out of the caesar dressing on my co-worker's caesar salad and it took 40 minutes of waiting to realize this-It took 40 minutes before the food was ready and we even called ahead.-No one apologized for this-While we waited, we watched one of the chefs literally toss food onto the counter in annoyance whenever she had completed someone's order-the bread was so hard I couldn't eat it and the knife they gave me couldn't cut through it either-the man helping us was physically annoyed by the lunch rush and couldn't be bothered to treat customers like they mattered On top of that, no one greeted us with a smile. Everyone had an attitude and made sure to say things in the bitchiest way possible. What the hell is going on? Are the employees treated terribly? I feel like it's so bad that it must be an internal problem and not exactly indicative of the personal nature of the employees themselves. It almost feels like a product of the environment: unhappy employees=they don't give a shit about your business. Just saying.  It's been real Essence. We've had some great memories, but it's over ... and it's definitely not me, it's you! Hopefully, one day we can be friends again. I will certainly mourn the loss of my beloved macaron.*Update: I was sent a very sincere note from the management. I will say that they definitely reached out to make everything right. Hopefully, the customer service issues will improve, because I love everything else! I think 2 stars was a little harsh, so I'm giving them a 3 for being so gracious after reading my review.  Ok, Essence, we might have to give it another go. I just can't quit you!!!

Review Text :
Definitely a fan! It's so not what you would expect from just driving by... Heck, they have beef wellington on the menu!!So far, I have only been for happy hour (twice) but it's a good one! The drink prices are great. As far as food, I've had the potato skins, fried zucchini (each $4 during happy hour) and the tenderloin toasts and spanikopita. The spanikopita was delicious! 5 small triangles packed with spinach, but what was most notable was the freakishly buttery taste to to the phyllo! And, by "freakishly buttery" I mean... AWESOME! The tenderloin toasts were great too. The bread was sliced thin enough that it didn't cut up the top of your mouth despite being crisp yet was sturdy enough not to crumble into pieces when you took a bite. The meat was tender and still pink. Packed with flavor! Talk about a neighborhood place. Went by today around 3:15 but they don't open until 4. Thought it was weird no one was behind the bar when I walked in, and it took a while for someone to come from the kitchen. The customer service was spectacular! First, he asked what he could get me, then he explained they weren't open for another hour so he'd be back in the kitchen getting stuff ready and invited me to just holler if I needed anything. And, still, he kept coming out to check on us offering to take a food order as soon as the kitchen was ready. Yay, Frank! You took great care of us. Thank you so much!! I'd totally recommend Feeney's!I used to come for the booze (I actually still do!) but I wound up bringing my family in for dinner while they were visiting from out of town. Being the zealous consumer of lamb that he is, my father ordered the Greek-style lamb chops. Needless to say that every time he's in town, he HAS to go to Feeney's and have the lamb. He has since tried the pork chops (also Greek-style) and is just as much of a fan of those. I've brought in other family since who are also nuts about the lamb. So bottom line, if you're into lamb, come here and take it Greek-style!Not a lamb eater myself, I usually get the filet mignon. There is just something about the way the filet is prepared, old-school style and not a lot of bells and whistles. Bells and whistles are not needed because it's just so damned good: tender and flavorful. What else is delicious? The calamari is AWESOME-probably one of my favorite in any restaurant anywhere.The service here is above and beyond. Maria and George and the rest of the servers treat all of their customers like family which is why they have so much repeat business. In addition, you will never have an empty glass in front of you, whether is beer, wine cocktails, soda, coffee, even your glass of water is always refilled.Sure there are other places in The Valley that are fancier where the food comes to your table almost too pretty to eat, but that comes with a price tag and often a nice appearance is used to mask inferior quality. Not the case here, you always enjoy a good, down-home, no-nonsense meal with great service and all at a VERY reasonable cost.Old school yo!We're talking salad bar with beets, sunflower seeds and cottage cheese yo!We're talking prime rib of Flintstonian proportions! I met a group of good friends here recently. We were seated in a back (non window) room and my claustrophobia almost got the best of me. It was a pretty tiny room. Soon I decided it wasn't tiny. It was cozy. And soon the Coronas were a- comin' and the conversation was flowing.Our server, a delightful woman, was efficient and friendly. And a shout out to her just for handling a group of a dozen or so yelpers! Can you imagine waiting on us lol!?!?My prime rib and baked potato were pure perfection. The salad bar was fresh and fully loaded. Much like myself towards the end of the evening.The decor is all muraled-out if memory serves me. So there's a lot going on! So Feeney's you got a new fan! Great place to take my folks, out of towners or anyone I think is worthy of the Feeney charm!!!Yo!Confession - I am remiss in writing this review.Feeney's great meal and service was an excellent compliment to a great evening with friends!  You see, this raucous bunch took the place over on a Saturday night and while we were by far the loudest table they didn't mind a bit.  From @AZvern to @audreyrlwyatt to @TheDottsyZ to @ThomasWSmith to @lupnacca to @chrissyP71 to @cutepup8191 we all had a great time and enjoyed the old school food and service very much.I went here last weekend with the BF's parents to see if we would like to have our rehearsal dinner here. When we first walked in, I wasn't 100% convinced because this place is old school....like what I remember a sizzler or something looking like in the 90's. The place is dark and it has an old school salad bar.... need I say more? But this place really surprised me with their excellent service and food. We started with apps (which is totally unnecessary because the portions here are out of control). We had the spinach dip and the potato skins....it was good, but typical bar food. I also had a couple mimosas because they were on special for 1$....heck yes! We then got our soup/salad bar. I had the soup and it was good, nothing terribly special, but not bad. Then the (humongous) entrees....I had the lamb chops and they were delicious! They were perfectly cooked and seasoned....super juicy, they reminded me of eating lamb chops at home as a kid....definitely delicious. The BF had the new york strip which was equally good. He got it medium well, and they managed to keep it moist and juicy....awesome! We all got twice baked potatoes with our meals, which were very good (how can potato and cheese and bacon and whatnot be bad?). We finished with mud pie, which was ok, but nothing special. Anyway, at the end of the meal (while I was sitting there dying of stuffedosity) the owner came over and spent the time to chat with us about how our party was going to be set up and what the room would look like. I liked how friendly and accommodating the owner was. We are planning to have our rehearsal dinner, so I will update after that! Definitely check this hidden treasure out!

Restaurant name  Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I hate this bar and grill.  Seriously.We had some friends in town that had enjoyed Toby Keith's a few years ago and wanted to go back.  So we made the stop at Harrah's on a late Sunday afternoon.  On the way to the casino, I called ahead to make reservations.  You can't.  So I asked how busy they were, expecting the girl on the other end of the phone to tell me there would be a wait.  Instead, I was told "We are the opposite of busy."  Things weren't looking good already.We were immediately seated and I enjoyed the feel of the place.  I'm not into country music but I don't mind it playing in the background.  It's pretty much an Applebee's or TGI Fridays feel, except with a country theme.  But you can only enjoy the scenery for so long....We waited, and waited, and waited.  It took at least 15 minutes before our server even came over to greet us and get our drink orders.  Someone in my group wanted one of the specialty mixed drinks that are listed on the back of the menu (the ones that come in mason jars - 19 flipping dollars).  When my friend asked how much a 16-ounce version of the drink would be, she was told it was $12 but it would only come with a half a shot in it.  What??  I'm going to just say that we misheard or she misspoke, because that can't be right at all.  And the bad signs kept on coming....I would say a good half hour went by before we got our meals.  I ordered the quesadillas with veggies and they were awful.  DRIPPING in grease- I had to blot them with napkins just so I didn't get grease on my clothes.  It was served with some sad shredded iceberg, mushy chopped tomatoes, and a super boring poblano salsa.  I managed to eat half and then called it a day.  $13, but worth $0.My husband ordered the Ranch House Salad.  It claims to come with iceberg AND romaine, but there was only iceberg in that bowl.  Unless you're talking about a wedge salad, iceberg lettuce just screams cheap ingredients and that little thought went into making the salad.  He also got a couple of slices of tomato, a little bit of cheese and croutons, and about a tablespoon of corn.  On the side were two enormous containers of ranch dressing- you know, in case you want to eat 1200 calories in salad dressing during your meal.   $12, but worth about $6.We also got a side of fries for $5.  They were actually really good (especially with all the leftover ranch from my husband's salad) and the portion was pretty generous.My friends ordered the She's a Hottie Wrap and the Steak Sandwich.  I didn't hear anything good or bad about their food or the mason jar drink.We then proceeded to wait again for the check and for it to be brought back to sign once we paid.  Our drinks were refilled once the entire time we were there.When it was all said and done, my friend said that a few years ago it was a fun place to be.  Now there's just terrible service despite the fact that the place had zero customers.  There are typical overpriced menu items like you'll find all over the Strip and ridiculous price differences for Harrah's players card members vs. non-card customers.  Do yourself a favor and go next door to the Venetian and eat at Grand Luxe- similar food and price but better quality and service with a larger menu.  Toby Keith's will do if you are starving and have a broken leg and you can't hop any farther before you pass out from hunger.Oh, and there's a $6 charge if you want to split a meal with someone.  There should be crimes against stupid pricing like this.Firstly, everyone should know that Toby Keith has nothing to do with this location at Harrah's. He did sell his likeness to the group that does own this location. If you are looking for cheaper prices and a true Toby feel you should try the locations he does own in Oklahoma.I was told it would be about a 10 minute wait and they have some tables and chairs to sit and have a drink or just hang out while you wait to be seated. I ordered the "Fried Chicken Salad" and it was fantastic. It is so huge you can eat off it for 5 days! The ranch dressing was thick and delicious.I loved the country music playing and how other customers all sang along with the music together. When "Red Solo Cup" played everybody was singing and having a great time. They have many drink specials and for beer lovers they have special sizes just for you! With a players card I was able to get a discount off of my bill. If you want a good time this place is a must try!Met some friends here for drinks and to hang out for a bit.  The joint is tucked away on the 2nd floor of Harrah's in the back near the entrance to the Monorail.  It's too small to be a club.....about 1/2 the size of Gilley's.  The food here is OK bar food.  Our friends ordered some Wings and I sampled a few....they weren't bad, just OK.  Same goes for the Fries.  Since I didn't pay, I didn't catch the price.The waitresses are supposed to be cute/hot....but only 1/2 of them were.  The others looked a little "sloppy".  I hate saying that, but if you're going to put your staff in sexy outfits, I'd make sure they are able to meet high standards....especially in Vegas.Overall, the food/experience was just OK.  The best part is the music.  The joint feels very 'touristy'.  I'd give it another chance under the right circumstances.Return Factor - 50%If you have a choice DON'T DINE HERE. Toby Keith I HATE YOUR BAR & GRILL. I would rather stay home and get a third degree burn in my mouth from a Lean Pocket than ever dine at this type of place, but sometimes it's not about what I want. It was my sister's birthday and her and my mother love country music and Toby Keith in particular. My mom had mentioned she wanted to take my sister here so I took the bull by the horns and made it happen. Big mistake.We all know there are outstanding restaurants on the strip that are worth every over priced dime that you spend. Not this one. This falls into the other category. The Over Priced Food That Just Sucks Themed Restaurants.Still, I can get past the price just to make people I love happy, but not this time. In a nutshell.The food wasn't terrible. My sister ordered meatloaf potato skins with gravy for our appetizer. This was creative, yet under seasoned, but still I was thinking this would be cool to recreate at home for one of my dinner parties. Maybe with sweet potatoes.Next we each had a sandwich which does not include fries and my sister added fries. My sandwich was a grilled BBQ chicken sandwich which wasn't terrible at all. I could only eat half and brought the rest of the chicken home to my dog. One Coke, two well drinks and $95 LATER!!!!!!! Fuck me.Like I said, I can get over the price, but the waitress broke my number one rule. IT WAS A BIRTHDAY AND SHE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR MY SISTER. Not that we expected a lap dance or Toby Keith to serenade us in tight jeans, but something! I made it a point to tip the busser and have her tell the waitress about the birthday (let me say those girls are the ones hustling in this joint) . The waitresses merely take your order and then hand you your check at the end. Other than that they do shit. It's all about the bussers. Our busser  was on point and I know she told the waitress. Well Sue or Suzie our blonde waitress brought me the bill and I mentioned it to her and she just looked at my sister and said, "Happy Birthday". I wanted to rip her Lee Press-On nails right off. Well, I tipped her accordingly and then tipped the busser again.If mediocre, overpriced, under seasoned bar food and country music is your thang than you will be in hog heaven with the trailer park beauties servin' it up. If you are looking to spoil someone you love on their birthday with a simple scoop of vanilla ice-cream and a feckin' candle than do not come here.Let me premise this review with "I like Toby Keith's and his music", so this review is in no way impacted by my personal taste in music or the artist. Now with that said, I do NOT like his restaurant and food.  My review is not based on a single visit, but the last of 3 separate occasions with similar if not exact circumstances.  All of my visits were on a weekend evening and for dinner.The 1st thing which I found odd when arriving (2 of the 3 times) was no music playing.  It wasn't that it wasn't Toby Keith's songs, or even country music...but NO Music at all. The TVs were tuned to various channels ranging from the World Cup (the vast majority) to baseball, ESPN and even a cooking channel, however no sound.  When I inquired if they would be playing any music or at least have Keith's videos playing I was told "No, the bartender and managers are watching the world cup."Now I could see if the place was busy and everyone was interested in the game, but the place wasn't even half full and NO ONE was even paying attention to the game other than the staff.  However, they were intently watching the game to the point it took us almost 5 minutes to be acknowledged and 15 minutes to be seated.  I had similar experience on both times prior as well.Once seated the service did pick up, however our poor server was covering the vast majority of the restaurant as the others were focused on the game or their phones.  She took our drink orders right away, but stopped by a few times to apologize as it was taken longer than normal to prepare our drinks. We didn't order anything other than a beer and one of their signature cocktails.We placed our dinner order once the drinks arrived.  Very shortly afterwards ONE of the entrees arrived (Fried Bologna Sandwich) burnt yet cold.  The server was shocked when she saw it and was present when my entrée arrived.  Mine was cold as well and she took them both back right away.  She returned about 10 minutes later saying the 2nd sandwich was also way over cooked so she had them doing it yet again.  Needless to say after all of this our server apologized over and over, but yet management never once came over, or stopped watching the TV either.  I don't knock the server, as she was working hard to try and keep up, but the food and rest of the service staff was horrible.  I hate giving 1 Star reviews, but I also hate horrible experiences and would prefer to warn others.I came here with my friend William, he hug out here while in town for work. We got lucky and got a place at the Bar the bartender was cool, cute and on point with the drinks and had a cool spin the beer bottle, open-the-beer-flick-the-cap-and-side-kick-it -spin the opener back into the holster gig going onneet!the food was OK, Bill got the TK Nachos tri color chips with cheese and beans, peppers queso sour cream and guac looked pretty good.I had the cowboy cheeseburger The bun was buttery and soft and had a fat wet spot from the pickles. It was not Med well and it was meh over all.I do like that active duty military eat for free.A group of friends and I decided to visit Toby Keith's I Love This bar & Grill for dinner.  We got in without reservations with only a minimal wait at 6:00 on a weeknight in July.  It was a little tricky to find as it was upstairs and around a corner inside of a casino (Harrah's Las Vegas), but after wandering around for a while we finally figured it out.  The decor is very cutesy country, fitting since the bar's namesake, Toby Keith, is a famous country singer.  The atmosphere alone is worth part of the cost of the meal.  We pushed together a couple of tables and ordered a few drinks.  Now, I should probably warn you, as I WISH someone had warned me, that their drinks are HUGE and come in large mason jars.  Even the adult beverages come in these same jars, and they don't make them weak an watered down, either.  You'll be feeling your liquor by the end of your first one, and I had more than one.  I was drinking one of their signature cocktails called The Patriot. The Patriot consists of Jim Beam Kentucky Bourbon, Southern Comfort, dry vermouth, and sour mix with just a splash of sierra mist on top.   Let me tell you, they go down smooth.  I had a sip of my friend's Georgia Peach (vodka, peach schnapps, and sierra mist, and it wasn't too shabby either.When it came time to order the entree I decided to go with the BBQ'D rotisserie chicken as it looked like one of the healthiest items on the menu.  For about $18 I got a half chicken slow cooked on a rotisserie to a tender and moist perfection and brushed with a generous helping of barbecue sauce.  It came with a choice of two sides; I chose mixed vegetables and a baked potato.  I asked them to put just cheese and bacon on the potato and put the butter and sour cream on the side. Everything was tasty and while I felt stuffed by the end of the meal, at least I didn't feel like I'd clogged my arteries with grease.  One of my friends even mentioned how tasty my plate looked.I'd definitely come back again the next time I'm in Vegas

Review Text :
Known as "The Onion" by regulars, this is an awesome dive bar with some of the best burgers in the valley.  I used to live near it - and went FAR too often.  My friend told me he went there the other day - can you say Jealousy?   The bar rocks.  The service is out of this freaking world.  Go there 3 times in a month and they'll most likely remember what you ordered.  Alcoholic drinks are served stiff, and sodas are served LARGE so the designated driver doesn't have to keep asking for a refill.  (I hate that!)  Menu is limited - as bar food should be - but everything here is awesome.  There is no "kitchen" in the back - you can watch everything they are doing right to the side of the bar.  Where did those french fries come from?  Oh yea, they put a potato on that metal device, pulled a handle and presto - fry shapes.  As for the tomato and lettuce?  It's in a Tupperware container in the fridge.  Other than that it's burgers, chicken, fries and onion rings.  Even if there is just one person behind the bar, they will come out to see what they can get ya - drinks or otherwise.  And they'll bring it to your table.  Sure, there are big screen tv's, pool tables and a pretty decent juke box for a spot like this.  But the real attraction is watching the regulars come and go while you enjoy your awesome burger goodness.I sent out a yelp for a new place to eat and was told to check out R.O. I am glad I did. The place is located South of Greenway (both of them) and right before the AL's Rayco, on the West Side. It is a simple looking place with nothing extraordinary to draw you in. BUTOnce you get inside it is a very comfortable bar. The place holds a bunch of people, has several pool tables and a full bar to sit at. There is a little "outside type patio for you lung killers". Several video games, bar top machines etc. Since I was ther for lunch, I did not have the Captain and Coke but verified they do have it. ( happy face here)I had the cheeseburger, (fresh sirloin) with a toasted bun, lettuce, tomato, and pickle. IT WAS FAN-TASTIC. It might have something to do with the pat of butter melted on the top as she was cooking it. I also had the hand cut french frys. They were really good. The next trip will be for the Braut. The only bad thing I can say is, although worth it, the burger, frys and coke came to $11.75. I would have preferred a lunch special with it as a combo instead of the ala-carte. The place was clean, the owners are fun and do not mind a little chit chat while they cook and run around. They have the football package for the sports fans. They are a Packers Bar but don't let that stop you. Check it out if you haven't before.

Review Text :
This Pizza is LAME.  I should have gone with my instinct that a downtown "pizza by the slice" pizza joint shouldn't be completely empty at 11:30am on a weekday and gone somewhere else, but I didn't.  The place was completely empty and it still took them 12 minutes to get me my two slices (which were huge).  I hate to say it, but the pizza completely sucked.  The crust was so rubbery that I couldn't pick up the slice without it flopping over.  For two slices and a coke I paid nearly $8 but I wouldn't have paid $2 for that "food".  I forced myself to eat one slice and then threw out the other.Yuck

Restaurant name  Cravings Buffet at Mirage

Review Text :
I have to eat at Cravings whenever I'm in town.  I don't care how hung over I am, or how much money I've lost, I will eat prime-rib, eggplant parm, sugar-free hazelnut gelato, sushi, sugar-free cheesecake, crab legs, fried shrimp, fried chicken, sausage, ham, bacon, smoked salmon, meat n' cheese, and salad.  If you think that's gross, you should catch me when I'm not on my diet.The last time I was here, my friend Cynthia and I never actually dined together.  It was more of a tag-team (not the Whoomp! There it is! kind).  Somehow, whenever one was eating, the other was going up for more food.  Next time, I'll be the 2 plates-at-a-time kind of girl.I'm broke.  No, not just gambling broke (which I was).  Much worse.  Stripper broke.  The worst feeling.  I spent all that money only resulting in.........zipper chaffing.  Get that mental picture?  gross..yeh imagine how I feel.Waking up dejected and just enough money to buy 4 happy meals...we were hesitant.  Hesitant to go to Sterling buffet (ironic that we'll drop hundreds on lap dances but not $75 on caviar huh?), the cocoa-butter-smellin-asses opted over to the Cravings buffet in Mirage.  What makes the Food Slut smile in such gloomy conditions?  23.99 AYCE and AYCD champagne.  WHAT?  Say WHAT?!?!  Yes, AYCE crab legs, ribs, prime rib.................and CHAMPAGNE!Quality?  Well...it's a buffet.  You only go to gorge yourself on cheap meats and booze...mmmm..just like how I like my women.  Low maintenance....er..but not cheap.This is one of the few buffets that my classmates and I have not tried so we came and visited it one day after class.  It was around 12pm and we were starving! The line to pay wasn't long, but we waited about 5-10 minutes to get seated.  I was pretty impressed with the selection at this place.  I hated the lunch buffet at Green Valley, Mandalay Bay, and Planet Hollywood, so I expected this buffet to be completely disappointing.  I'm glad they proved me wrong!!Their sushi spread wasn't that great.  They had two platters full of tiny little sushi rolls.  But they had a bunch of stations that I seriously couldn't even get to because I was so full!! They served crab legs and oysters in one end, and BBQ tri tip and filet slices on the other.  Their pasta station wasn't that great though, all they had that day was spaghetti with meatballs. Their dessert station was okay.  Their sugar free stuff did not taste very good but their gelatos, chocolate pastries, and cookies were yummy!  It was still a good experience. Another buffet to check off my list.  I only have two more months left here in Vegas, and I have 2-3 more casino buffets to hit up before leaving!My typical experiences at a buffet. 1. I get my moneys worth no matter what the price is, I repeat, no matter what the price is. 2. I eat to the point of almost puking. 3. Not 28 bucks w/ gratuity. What on Earth went wrong at Cravings?! Please consider renaming to Loss of Appetite. Nothing I repeat, nothing looked tempting enough to reach my plate. I ate a couple slices of prime rib, guacamole and chips, some steak, fruits, done. Everything else tasted old.The gf went irate because I was not eating. Am I sick?Came here on a Sunday for the champagne brunch. It was about $28 which is a lot cheaper than the nicer Vegas buffets. And you don't have to wait in a super long 1-hour line which is a plus!I was actually pleasantly surprised by this buffet! I really didn't expect much because it's in the Mirage hotel and I'd never really heard of it but they actually have a huge variety. Quality isn't all there for some of the food items, but there is a HUGE variety of eclectic food. And I love how every section is neatly labeled (ex. "chinese", "sushi", "mexican", "desserts", "salad", etc) so you can go for exactly what you want. Some food highlights:1. The prime rib was surprisingly really good! Red, soft, and juicy. My friend asked if they had cranberry sauce, and they went to the back and brought a huge bowl out for us. So nice of them!2. They have fried plantains!! Yessss!3. Crab legs were cracked open in half already like at Bellagio buffet so it's easier to eat but I didn't like the way they tasted. It was pretty much frozen cold and was too salty/fishy for my taste. 4. The eggs benedict looks really nice, but it was a little too bland in my opinion. 5. They have sriracha sauce if you need that with your chinese food like I do!6. They have a gelato bar hidden in the corner next to the desserts! Note: it's NOT self serve. So don't try to go back there by yourself and scoop your own.  Just wait patiently and someone will come to help you. ;)Oh I really enjoy this buffet....In the past I never really enjoyed the buffet at Mirage, but ever since Cravings buffet was established I've became a fan of this place...The decor is sophisticated at it's best.. all the nice LCD TVs along the entry way showing a slow motion of an egg being dropped into a pile of flour.... awesome way to start a buffet!  (lots of other food related video clips for your enjoyment!)Here are the typical review section for a buffet...Pizza:  Pretty good.. probably about as on par as CPKs... so pizza lovers will enjoy.Carving station:  Prime Rib and Ham.... decent prime rib as it was more red than how I've liked it, but the server was nice enough to carve the other side for me and was very attentive!  Definitely a plus!Mexican food section:  Had some breakfast burrito but didn't taste that great.. pretty dry in preparation so decided to past on this section for the rest of the time there.Cold seafood:  Had snow crab legs and shrimp cocktail for brunch!  Cool!  I didn't really eat too much of this because it seemed too early for me for crab legs but others were diggin this!Hot seafood:  Had some paella, pesto cream mussels, and some salmon... they were all fair tasting.Special metal room for fresh Chinese noodles!  This was my favorite!  A chef is inside this steel room cooking fresh noodles with the options of wonton soup or beef stew soup.... had some gyoza and also few dim sum servings (little shrimp wrapped in rice paper), all very tasty!  The best part was hot roast duck and BBQ pork to go along with the noodle soup!  YUM!!!  Definitely my favorite!Chinese food section:  Not a big fan... bored of all the orange chicken that everyone is serving and beef with broccoli, I think I will past for sure..... (But the egg drop duck soup was very delicious!  Not salty yet sweet tasting!  Add some scallions and cilantros and you are definitely good to go here!)Crepe station:  Fresh peach / peach cream crepe.... wow!  One of the best  crepes I've had in a while as the cream reminded me of Beard Papa's except is a little bit tarty..... but not overly sweet and just right...  Crepes were made to perfection so it turned out awesome!  Had to share it with everyone though.. couldn't finish this large chunk of heaven!Salad station:  Skipped this because I was getting really full, but noticed that they had fresh made Paninis if requested.... so for those of you who like to take a little snack out of the buffet for later.. this option would be great as those sandwiches looked healthy and wonderful!  I'll give it a try next time!Dessert station:  By this time I'm ready to faint..... but had to pull myself to take a look.... took a sugar free cheesecake and that's about it... not bad.....  Had to end the meal with ice cream though... so grapefruit gelato was on my menu to clean up my palate.....Cravings...... I can't crave you anymore for today.... maybe another time.....Definitely not craving this place again....Staying at the mirage and on a time schedule, this seemed to be our closest option for our breakfast choice this early Saturday morning.The place is aesthetically pleasing and appeared to be clean and well kept. Arrangement of food was organized to aesthetically pleasing visual as well, making the majority of the food items appear quite appetizing, except for a few beat up egg benedicts.Unfortunalty looks can be deceiving, which apparently it was for the most case with most of the breakfast Items I tried.I made my first and last round starting at the omelet station. The guy behind the counter took some time to make the omelet, did it a little carelessly however; it ended up being the only decent tasting item I tried.Most of the sausage links and patties I tried tasted as if it was picked from the bottom of the barrel. I tried some cheesy potatoes like casserole thing that looked better than it tasted.The dessert items did not look appealing enough to try though,I had a bowl of some oatmeal, fruity dish with milk that was semi sweet and extremely tasty.The service was nice and the place appeared to be well kept however the food has not enticed me enough to want to give them another shot.One thing I love about Vegas is trying out all the different Buffets. Do not get me wrong I am very meticulous about the ones I go to. We were getting hungry and so were our friends. We all decided to come here for dinner. Make sure you have your "M life" card, as it does help points wise.For dinner its $26.99 per person, yes I know it is a little steep but its Vegas plus you are getting a lot of food. When we arrived, the line was pretty long at 8:00pm on a Tuesday night but the lone cashier kept the line moving. While standing in line we were laughing at the LCD TV's they have up. At random times they will have different foods flashing up but in slow motion (kind of like food sex) not going to explain anymore, you will just have to go yourself to see it!The host who sat us was not too friendly but we were seated pretty fast, our table was close to the action so we didn't have to walk to far to get to everything. Only thing I totally hated was the bathrooms which were not located inside the buffet, you had to walk out hang a left, and there they were! Our waiter was nice but it seemed like her mind was somewhere else. She took our drink orders and said we could start eating whenever we would like. All four of us made a mad dash in different directions!  FOOOODDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This buffet has:-Pho (it is freshly made at some point, but sits out)-Wontons-Crab legs (I was impressed that these legs had a lot of meat)-Jumbo Shrimp-Prime Rib-Turkey-Lemon herb chicken-Various pre-made sushi and sashimi's (eeps do not touch)-Various deli meats and slices of cheese-Pasta-Veggies-Potatoes (Both mashed and wedges)-Woodfire Pizza-Mexican slow-roasted pork-Greek Salad-Chips and salsa-CornbreadDessert:-Mango or Pistachio pudding-Chocolate Mousse-Various cheesecakes (sugar free option too)-Chocolate logs-Large selection of sugar free stuff-Macaroons (no I did not miss-spell it, it is not the French kind)-Fruit-Whipped topping-Ice Cream-Mini Pies-CookiesAnd oh so much more!After about four plates, I was tapping out... I had to sit for about 20mins before I could start on the dessert end. The food was not bad unlike some of the reviews I have read. I put it this way some days are better than others, it happens everywhere you go! You just have to look and know before you decide on what you are going to grab and eat. Our waiter took our plates away pretty fast and our drinks were filled with a smile. We left in food comas and wanting our beds!! Good job cravings for stuffing us silly!!Located in The Mirage..Cravings is about 26 a person. Pretty big, and they have their dessert bar, salad section, Greek section, Chinese section, sushi, noodles, raw food, Latin, Breakfast, Italian, and the omelet man. I like how majority of the sections have somebody that can make it for you. Noodle section had a lady who can make you your noodles. Salad bar area had a lady who tossed it for me...........no dirty-ness. The Chinese food was not good at all. Got the fried rice, bok choy, noodles, and egg roll...did not like any of it. They had a good variety for the Latin section most definitely.My fella and I came here during a weekday for dinner. We had purchased the Travelzoo deal for two buffets with unlimited beer and wine. The place was really dead. We came at a very off hour hoping to avoid crowds and we successfully did this. The staff was attentive and friendly and we never had to remind them for refills or to clear our plates. The line is kept very clean, which is a must when I visit buffets. They don't have a lot of selection and it's kind of difficult to find some things since everything is spread our so far apart. They take minimalist design to the max. They only have 4 or five dishes to choose from for each type of food, which is a little bit of a letdown. Buffets should be all about selection and they don't have a lot of choices. The food was standard. Nothing amazing, but there were a few standouts. I did enjoy the salad bar. They allow you to pick all the ingredients you want and they mix them for you. That was probably my favorite part of the meal. The desserts were limited as well. I ended up with macaroons. They were very good. Warm and chewy, definitely another highlight of the evening.I have to note that our beers were overly carbonated and both my fella and I couldn't even finish half of our glasses. It was Bud Light, which was expected, but it was so bubbly it tasted awful. For the price, we didn't feel ripped off, but we definitely won't be going out of our way to return. Overall, we had a pleasant experience, but it's not one of the better buffets on the strip by any stretch of the imagination. The food is really two star, but the service bumped it up to three star for me.I've been to the buffet at Wynn and I've been to Wicked Spoon. While both are spectacular choices, I think one of the biggest drawbacks of both of them is that the wait is pretty long. It can be anywhere between 40 minutes to 1.5 hours.You'll never had such a wait at cravings. Since we didn't want to wait that long and we needed some sort of sustenance to soak up all the excess alcohol we drank the night before, we decided to be efficient and go to the buffet downstairs from the Mirage, where we stayed this weekend.We arrived there around 10:30a and zipped pass the cashier since there was no line! For $28, which is $10 less than Wynn and Wicked,  we got not only entry into the buffet, but unlimited mimosas.While I wouldn't say the choice selection here is that big of a range, they did have all I wanted from a buffet. Smoked salmon, check. King crab legs, check. Prime rib, check! But one of the greatest things I discovered at this buffet was that they had Bouillabaisse!! The soup was prepared pretty well, while it doesn't compare to what I had in Marseilles in 2010, it sure hit the spot in my stomach and evoked many great memories from my time in Europe!Overall, Cravings is an underrated buffet you should consider if you don't want to wait at Wynn or Wicked. 4 stars and definitely returning again!I came here on a Saturday evening, and we got 2 buffets for $42 (We used a casino BOGO, $37.82 with tax). The meal also came with unlimited wine and beer. - We came around 8pm, which was a great time for us because we didn't have to wait in line for a while. There was just 1 couple ahead of us. I thought that was pretty good for a Saturday night. It took less than 10min for us to be seated at our table. - I suggest starting off with the shrimp cocktails and crab legs. The line can get pretty long, but if you time it right, your meal will start off great. The shrimp cocktails are pretty big too compared to Feast Buffet. Crab legs not as meaty as Bellagio. - Their wanton soup was pretty good but not as good as the Rio Carnival World. - Prime rib was average like any other buffet like Feast, but there is no grill if you wanted it Med-well or well done like Sam's Town. - I did enjoy their seafood stew. It had a lot of scallop and clams in it, less small shell bits, few corn. - Avoid the steamed cod. It was a bit tough and flavorless. - Do mack on the BBQ spare ribs! It was tender and so saucy! I loved it. It was especially tasty with the creamed corn. I love corn! :D nom nom- The sushi was filler for me so after a few, I didn't bother getting more- Their dim sum was pretty good. I suggest that you should at least grab one of each. Don't get the Ramen though. The noodle tasted like Maruchan. meehhhhh! But I did really like the egg! - I don't care much for the desserts, but my girlfriend thought it was worth trying. Don't expect to find macarons here though!- Although I did not drink the wine, I did get the beer. The choice was between a Bud Light or a pale ale. Each time I got a drink, there were at least 2 or 3 people ahead of me. I suggest double fisting to reduce the wait time. Haha. - Friendly service. Clean and fine dining.The Cravings Buffet at The Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas offers eleven international food stations serving dishes on an all-you-can-eat basis with unlimited wine and beer. It's  the only buffet with an enhanced self service beverage station with 150 plus coca cola flavors, all for $31 per person for dinner.The set up of each International food station is very identifiable and they are laid out in an orderly fashion.I particularly enjoyed the crab legs at the seafood station, since the legs were already cut in half and very easy to eat. I enjoyed it together with the mixed fried rice.The selection of Sushi and Sashimi are good but I was not particularly blown away (I had tried a better Japanese buffet off the strip.)All in all, with its rich selection of dishes, best value and great customer service, Cravings at The Mirage is highly recommended. I will definitely come back!I got a free lunch buffet at Cravings thanks to playing Facebook slots on MyVegas.com. Out of the Vegas buffets I've had the pleasure of gorging out at, this was the least quality out of them all. They had a good selection of foods, sorted by the type. Asian, American, Italian, fish, etc. The food seemed to be fresh, but they had obviously cut some corners on the food. The eggs Benedict was served on a roll, not the typical kind I'm used to. The shrimp was, well shrimpy. There was a long line to wait for the carving station. When I got the roast beef back to the table, it was rather fatty- a low quality of beef. The desserts seemed to be leaning heavily towards the sugar free side, which blows my mind. If you're going to a Vegas buffet, I'm sure you're not terribly concerned about your waist line. There was a lady that came by and picked up the used plates, but there was no other service available. You had to get your own drinks like some sort of shlub. I was pleased to see that there were about four different types of sushi, which seemed fresh. But they were lacking many things that I have come to expect on a Vegas buffet. They had no crab legs. The pizza was a shade better than Little Caesar's Pizza. Yes, the food was plentiful, but not the high grade that I have come to expect from the Mirage on everything else.The drinks were impressive. Free beer. But they only have Anheiser Busch products. Boo. They had one of those magical Coca-Cola machines where you can get over a hundred varieties of soda.  I was disappointed in the quality of food, but I didn't get food poisoning or anything. It was OK, but I don't think I'll be back.

Restaurant name  Copper
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
My husband and I have been wanting to try Copper for quite a while.  I have to admit we were divided on our overall rating... if I could give 3 1/2 stars, I would.  I cook a lot and, as a rule, my husband and I never want to eat somewhere that serves food we could eat at home.  Strangely enough, I cook traditional Indian food quite a bit.  From the start, the menu did not wow me.  I usually struggle over what to order but tonight there were really only two main course items that interested me - my husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and I ordered the Lamb Rhogan Curry.  We also ordered samosas (my favorite part of the meal), garlic naan, and a mango lassie (delish - I always have to order a mango lassie!).  The samosas were absolutely amazing and I loved the spicy sauce drizzled underneath them on the plate.  I was not so impressed with the three side sauces served with the two pieces of naan that accompanied our appetizer order.  Our water glasses remained filled - right up until the point we actually got our meals - and then while eating my slightly spicy lamb, I was forced to chew on a few ice cubes because there was no server or busboy to be seen.  Our main course dishes were not stellar - the quality of the meat was quite good but the overall flavoring was somewhat lackluster.  My husband's tikka masala almost seemed a little too "tomatoey" for my taste - he was not impressed at all, he said mine is better.  (Aww, so sweet...)  My lamb had a bit of a kick to it but the sauce was not "lick the bowl clean" kind of good - far from it, to be truthful.  To me, Copper is not the place to go if you are simply looking for a tasty, authentic, Indian meal.  Copper is the place to go for a nice dinner, a date perhaps, if you are in the mood for a  trendy, modern take on Indian cuisine.Indian food is almost always expensive, so I won't even bother to complain about that.  But the food here is good and they accomodated a special request, so for that Copper gets high marks.  The SAMOSAs are as expected.  Potato and pea wrapped in a nice fried crunchy dough. The chutneys are tasty.  Nothing out of the ordinary or that you couldn't get anywhere else (or make at home).CHICKEN CHETTINADU is not for the faint of heart (or palette).  My colleague was warned that the base was spicy, but she scoffed and said she loved spicy food.  Fast forward 20 minutes and there was sweat dripping from her forehead and her eyes and nose were watering.  I tasted the gravy, and thought it was great, but I didn't try to eat a bowl full of it.  All entrees are served family style, with rice added to the table.  We also got a bit of naan free but ordered extra with the meal.  No salt or pepper on the table, but they're happy to bring it if you ask.The ZESTY VEGETABLE BHAJI side was interesting.  Long julienned pieces of mixed vegetables, including beets, all mixed with a dry spice rub.  The traditional vegetarian menu offers PANEER MAKHAWALA, which is a red gravy similar to tikka masala or butter gravy.  Very rich and flavorful but not too spicy. I asked to substitue cauliflower / gobi for the paneer, and the chef nicely complied.  Overall this was a very tasty and well balanced dish.  The service was great, and the interior of the restaurant (located in a very old rehabbed house) is unique.  For people looking for more Indian options, try the University area.  It's full of great Indian hole-in-the-walls.  My personal faves: Persis (everything is good, but the Gobi 65 is amazing), Tulips (varied weekend buffet and good a la carte ordering) and Passage to India (great gobi manchurian and weekend/lunch buffet).

Restaurant name  Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
It's no secret that I'm not a huge steak fan, but since my parents like it and they were treating for dinner, I was powerless in the negotiation of venue and we went to Fleming's, an upscale steakhouse serving dead animals graded USDA Prime. Mmm.Despite the mall location, the restaurant is dark and intimate and the bar looked inviting. My affinity for plastic is relatively low, and with the exception of the Scottsdale equivalent of a gangbanger (an adult frat boy bearing a backwards-turned cap indoors) and his Barbie doll/date, the only people who were in desperate need of recycling were the hostesses which was a pleasant surprise given the environs.On the recommendations from a sweet but not saccharine waitress, we sampled:[NB: Prices are approximate, since Fleming's avoids website sticker shock.]- Starter platter (Gratis): Brie, olive tapenade and some crostini, celery and radish - a light start and a substantial improvement over the standard bread offering (which is also optionally served at entree time upon request)- Crab Cakes (~$15): Great crabmeat to breading ratio but not superlative as advertised- Sweet Chili Calamari (~$12): Expertly lightly fried, breaded and sweetened- Petite Filet (~$30): Dry, which is unfortunate in the most tender of steaks- Bone-in Ribeye (~$30): Very juicy and flavorful, significantly superior to the former- Beef Flemington (~$28): Filet Mignon in a light pastry shell and a Madiera sauce, juicy unlike the vanilla offering - a solid A- Dessert Sampler ($13):  - Creme Brulee: Divine vanilla goodness, I'd order it again and I'm not a general fan  - Cheesecake: Thoroughly unremarkable  - Chocolate Lava Cake: Overly sugary molten chocolate in a thin souffle-ish cake shell  - Peach Cobbler a La Mode: Proving the exception of the "less filler" trend, heavy on the cobbler but light on the fruitOutside of parental benevolence, an expense account or a serious apology to a significant other from the heartland, I wouldn't be looking for a dining experience like this, but I'd come back if the time was right. Unlike other local high end steakhouses, Fleming's does it with more tender delicious substance than heavy oily pretension.While I have been to a few Fleming's locations for dinner, up until last week I had never experienced Happy Hour.  What was I thinking!?  Fleming's HH by the numbers:  3 categories (mixed drinks, wine & appetizers) featuring 5 items for $6 each, 7 nights a week until 7pm.  A great way to take in the refined and inviting Fleming's atmosphere and eat/drink very well.On this particular evening, my friend and I enjoyed some HH offerings, and a couple items from the "regular" menu:Starting off with wine, we chose the Belle Glos "Meiomi" Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir.  While the HH wines are very good (on a previous visit I had the Pillar Box Shiraz - yum!) it was well worth departing from the HH list for this one.  Hey, it's Thursday... *Tenderloin Carpaccio.  In a word, magnificent.  Beautiful thin slices of beef topped with just the right amount of aioli and capers.  Perfect when topped with freshly-squeezed lemon juice and enjoyed on small slices of parmesan-topped toasted bread.  Oh!Chipotle Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese.  This is a side item from the dinner menu.  While "not a mac n cheese person" my friend humors my addiction to this cheesy treat.  This one was special - easily one of the best I have tasted.  The cheese had a slightly smoky flavor, with a hint of spiciness that wasn't overpowering.  It was just right - I didn't even want to add my usual Tabasco...  and that says a lot.Wicked Cajun Barbecue Shrimp.  While this was very, very tasty, the allure for me wasn't really the shrimp, but the SAUCE!  A captivating blend of hot chili spice, garlic, more garlic, butter and a few other magical ingredients I couldn't identify.  No vampires were coming near us after this!  We dipped our bread in it.  I could have eaten it with a spoon.  Seriously.When do you go to HH at the same place twice in one week?  When it is Amazingly Good!!  There are still items I need to try - seared ahi, I am coming back for you...* Two things You Should Know:  1) In the event (gasp!) you don't finish a bottle of wine at the restaurant, they can "re-cork" it so it can be legally taken home to enjoy later.  Nice if you don't want to purchase by the glass.  2) Get there early - the cozy booths in the bar area go fast!  Actually, wait...  Don't get there early.  Otherwise, I won't get a good seat.  :)I cannot think of enough terrible things to say about their reservation system at this location.  I was a huge fan of Flemings and a very loyal customer, until now.  The complete lack of customer service and obvious practice of over booking reservations is beyond disappointing.  Looking forward to a nice dinner?  Bring your patience (and a snack).Fleming's knows service, food and ambiance and they excel in all three. I have been to other Fleming's before, but just recently dined at this location. It's a perfect option in the DC Ranch option for a nice dinner out. From the outside, it looks like they don't have a patio, but they actually do and it's a good one because it's covered so it's not as hot in the summer. However, we dined inside during this visit and enjoyed the cozy atmosphere. The service at this Fleming's was excellent and the server paid very close attention to our requests, especially my pregnant request for very well done salmon. I enjoyed a Cesar salad followed by the BBQ salmon and thoroughly enjoyed both, especially the BBQ salmon. I highly recommend ordering it if you feel like something other than steak. However, the steaks are also delicious and I stole a bite of the Filet which was delicious as well. For dessert, I highly recommend the carrot cake. It is fresh and amazing! The frosting is delicious and the cake is perfectly moist. This was a nice dining experience and I definitely look forward to returning and especially taking advantage of their happy hour specials.I wasn't aware Fleming's had an A/V room, replete with screen and ceiling projector.Do you know what else this room has?A light switch with no dimmer.For those of you lucky enough to be seated in the main dining area, if you look toward the right rear of the room and see a very bright light, (sans the tunnel) that's the place.When first ushered into the room, I asked if this was the steerage section.They didn't laugh.Turns out, it WAS the third class section, only they were too nice to not inform us how we'd be eating our meal while being interrogated by a team of international spies, under an intensely bright light. To make it more fun, we were seated in the center of the room.These guys are real pranksters.After a while, others were ushered into the room, all of whom looked like they'd fucked-up in the lobby while waiting on a table and were now being punsihed; a mom with a small whiny child, an old couple - both with walkers, and a couple so obese, I think they sat them in there so if the chairs collapsed, no one would see.Fleming's - you made us feel like we didn't belong - as though we weren't good enough to sit in your half-empty dining area at 5:30 on a Saturday night.The next time I hope to see a light this bright, it's going to be after trudging through a long-ass tunnel, looking for an old white haired guy in a robe with a big 'G' on his pocket.Other than the bright light, dining with 'Goonies', and the extremely slow service, it was a real fucking hoot at 170 bucks.If your hostess marches you toward this room, don't go in there. Fake a seizure of something.Just don't go in there.You've been warned.The WaunaQueen and I dropped by Fleming's on a Sunday evening for a glass of wine, a couple of appetizers and a great view of the sunset over the west side of Madison with a couple of former co-workers.  As mentioned in other reviews, there is a subset of items from the drink and appetizer menu available for $6 between 5pm and 7pm.We ordered a couple glasses of the Vinedos Terranoble Sauvignon Blanc, the baked brie and the French onion soup just before the end of happy hour.  The wine came recommended by a wine blog I follow and it was the right choice for the setting and a decent value at $6 a glass.  The baked brie was a disappointment - just brie baked in a less- than-crispy puff pastry shell.  The cheese lacked that earthy flavor and needed a boost, whether from a sauce or some added herbs.  The gala apples served with the dish started to brown by the time we received our plate.The French onion soup ($12) also disappointed.  This dish is good test for a restaurant.  It takes time and skill to coax the natural sweetness out of the onion.  Rush the dish and it is bland, cook the onions with too much heat and they become bitter.  Cook the onions slowly at low heat and you are rewarded with a wonderful caramelization that provides deep, rich flavor.  The Fleming's version of this soup was on the bland side of the spectrum with its thin broth.  The baked gruyère and parmesan cheese topping was well executed and added a much needed punch of flavor.Our group enjoyed the patio setting at Flemings.  Despite sitting near the bustling intersection of University and Midvale, there was very little traffic noise to interrupt our conversation.  Our server was efficient, but less than enthusiastic.  At happy hour prices, it fit the A-OK definition of a three star rating primarily due to the setting and the wine list.  Outside of happy hour, I probably will go elsewhere to find more satisfying food options.UPDATE: After posting this review, I did get a message from the restaurant manager, apologizing that my happy hour experience with them fell short.  Her message was sincere,  appreciating that I took the time to provide feedback.  I then spoke with the manager on the phone and because of that positive interaction, I do plan on returning to Flemings.  It's a favorable sign when a restaurant uses feedback from their patrons to improve.Exchanged some of my Amex points for a $100 gift card here.  What a great dinner it was.  As a whole meal from beginning to end...it certainly is better than either Morton's or Ruth's Chris.  I like aspects of both those restaurants but certain things still lack for a complete meal.  For ex...we only order steak at Ruth's Chris.  No sides, apps or desserts...cuz they all suck.  But not this place. Fleming's was surprisingly awesome.  The place was also super packed for a random Tuesday night.  The bread for example doesn't come with just butter.  You get a feta cheese butter and a sun dried tomato butter.  I got the ribeye and the wife got the usual rare filet which were both fantastic.  Tons of sides to choose from and went with creamed spinach and mac and cheese. Had some special dessert not on the menu which was basically a super version of a Mcdonald's apple pie w/ cranberries and vanilla ice cream.  Fn great.  They also have a killer happy hour from 5-7.I am a regular fan of Fleming's, but had never before tried its Las Vegas location.  A Filet & Lobster Special for $34.95 drew Diane and me in with another couple.  After our meal was completed, we were quite glad that we had come.To begin at the beginning, we were presented with excellent chewy Rosemary Sourdough Bread with Chardonnay & Feta Cheese Butter.  Mmmmm!  Delicious!  Sun-Dried Tomato Butter was also offered, but I was not as fond of it.French Onion Soup that came next was good but small, and the cheesy top was not fully capped.  A small Wedge Salad with vibrant Cherry Tomato halves, Blue Cheese Crumbles, and a Blue Cheese Dressing was excellent.  After 2 quickly downed glasses of Iced Tea, my small glass was smartly exchanged by our server for a large globe.  But later, just as she was pouring me a refill from a pitcher, the very attentive waitress was suddenly bumped from behind by a plate deliverer, and I was doused with Iced Tea.  It was no big deal, and not our server's fault.  But the manager came over, gave me her card, and said that the restaurant would pay for any needed drycleaning of my shirt and pants.  I appreciated the gesture, but regular washing by Diane took care of the problem, with no lingering stains.  And, except for the splash, service was otherwise exemplary.My medium-rare Filet was excellent although peppery, and the meaty Lobster Tail was large and sweet, as I had hoped it would be.  Requested Bearnaise Sauce for the steak was somewhat viscous and excellent.  And, Drawn Butter for the  crustacean was tasty until it grew cold.  The busy restaurant was out of warmers, announced our server apologetically.  Sauteed Button Mushrooms yielded a very good side, and so did a platter of thin buttered Green Beans mixed with quite a few slices of mushroom.  But had I known that these greens would come with mushrooms, I probably would not have ordered a side of mushrooms, as well.We finished with Chocolate Lava Cake that came with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chantilly Whipped Cream.  It was a tasty end to a fine meal!My parents rarely take themselves out & I'm grateful to have the chance to treat them to a nice outing whenever I can. I was planning on taking my Father out to dinner at Wicked Spoon for Father's Day, but by the time he got off work that place would be closed. Since I took off work, I thought Fleming's would be the next best thing to try without worrying about the time. I took the last reservation at 9p.m. & we were promptly seated upon arrival. The hostess was welcoming, asked how I'm doing and how my day was, which was a pleasant to hear. She also informed me who's my server & wished us both to have a nice dinner & actually wished my Father.. & Happy Father's Day to you sir. My Father lit up & said.. Thank you thank you. That sure brought a smile on his face and to witness that.. brought a smile to mine. Great job to this hostess!!!It took a few moments for our server, Sarah to greet us & by that time, we were already ready to order. We, both decided to get their Prime Rib Dinner. It comes with a choice of salad, one side, & one dessert. Like Father, like Daughter.. we ordered everything the same... Fleming's Salad - Not spectacular or anything to rave about. There were too much sliced purple onions, which I had to put aside. The dried cranberries, croutons, & tomatoes were just okay. Extremely simple & looked cheap. The candied walnuts were overly covered with rock hard caramel, that I warned my Father to watch out in consuming it. You could literally hear me crack the candied part in my mouth & it wasn't a good feeling against my teeth. The best part... the dressing was tangy & fresh. The presentation itself wasn't appealing at all. Baked Potato (Fully Loaded) - As the side we chose... It was the Best in our entire meal. My Father noted that it was his first time ever seeing such an enormous size potato & all its fixins. It came exactly in this order of toppings on the baked potato.. sour cream, butter, green onions, bacon & cheddar cheese as being a happy surprise in the very end as you dig inside. We enjoyed this Very much & it was one of the most flavorful fully loaded baked potato I ever tasted. Each bite I couldn't believe how delicious it was. Every topping complimented one another & it was like a joy ride of warm gooey goodness in its highest form. I can't tell you enough how much I love this side.. If I can give 5 stars alone to one food item I tasted here... this would definitely be it. Even my Father goes.. this Prime Rib isn't the best, but... this Baked Potato is!Prime Rib - It comes with three sauces on the side, which consists of spicy mustard, horseradish, & au jus. I felt the au jus was too heavy in flavor & one bite with this sauce was overpowering the natural flavors of the meat. I did enjoy mixing the spicy mustard, which wasn't spicy at all, where you get any heat.. with the horseradish sauce, which was also very light like sour cream taste to it. The combination of these two sauces went great with the Prime Rib. I ordered mine Medium & it was cooked perfectly. My favorite part, the dark ends were in depth with flavor & I loved the tenderness of the meat. Overall, I thought this was an excellent entree. I would definitely order this again.Dessert time! You have to order their signature sweet.. Chocolate Lava Cake. We both learned the hard way.. you can easily be completely full & satisfied with one order.. easy. It comes with a thin cookie-like holder with two generous scoops of vanilla ice cream inside & topped with chopped pistachio nuts. Next to it, is the rich chocolate cake with a molten chocolate center of belgian warm chocolate. Baked to order, which takes 20 mins. to make. One of my favorite desserts. It also comes with a side of Chantilly Cream, which is the next best thing to sliced bread! So freshly whipped, light, & tastes like a whipped vanilla bean ice cream. SOOOOO soooooo GOOD! Every bite I took.. I added this cream with my cake. Heavenly!!! I am known to finishing all my meals, but I could only eat half this portion. When the server first presents this dessert to you, you'll just be amazing how much you get. It's like a whole meal... dessert style. Then sugar coma sets in & you have to reevaluate your desire to finish it all or throw in the towel. I... threw in the towel & rested my head back. Waaaaay too much for lil ole me. Even my heart was racing! Three mishaps, wanted to take our leftovers home, but the runner threw away half my dinner... Damn it! I love that Baked Potato!!! Oh well... Next time I want the to-go containers & bag it myself. Second, having to wait for a long time for our entrees to come out. Felt rushed. Third, being charged for both sides ($17) when it's included in the Prime Rib Dinner. I didn't catch it at first, but caught it after tallying 20% tip & giving my signature. You would think if I ordered that special, you would know not to charge the sides right?! Hmm honest mistake?! As another Yelper noted.. no such thing.If you're craving steak and don't want to leave the friendly confines of Summerlin, Fleming's should be near the top of your list. When we stopped in on a Tuesday night it was hopping and there was a 15 minute wait. So, apparently the fine folks in and around this master-planned community are well aware of the good eats here.The atmosphere is just like any other traditional steakhouse. You've got your white linens, dark wood accents, mood lighting, etc. And, just like other steakhouses you'll find the typical steakhouse fare: for example a wedge and caesar salad, French onion soup, some seafood, and a variety of steaks. It's familiar, comforting, and (most importantly) good.The crab cake appetizer ($15.95) consists of two small jumbo lump crab cakes in a lime butter sauce. They're lightly seasoned, allowing the sweetness of the crab meat to shine.Unfortunately, the butternut squash soup ($9.50) was a miss. Thin, watery, and runny aren't good qualities for any soup.The 14 oz. bone-in filet ($54) made up for it. While it could have benefitted from a more charred exterior, the seasoning was spot on and the quality of the beef was well worth the hefty price tag.We had two sides. The sautéed mushrooms ($9.50) contained a variety, most of which were slightly overdone, which I actually prefer. The sautéed sweet corn ($8.50) was average at best.Surprisingly, they have a kid's menu. With our little guy in tow, he gladly ordered a plate of chicken tenders ($14.95). What came out was a massive mound of crispy fries topped with several strips of chicken. The plate easily could have fed two or three kids. The meal also included an appetizer of celery, carrots, apples, and ranch. A kid's ice cream sundae is an additional $1.Splitting an entree usually means the wife and I have room for dessert. We went with their chocolate lava cake ($10.95). You'll definitely want to share this dish. It was a big mound of cake and oozing belgian chocolate. The vanilla ice cream and chopped pistachios provided a wonderful contrast in temperatures and texture. Countless restaurants have a version of this dish, but this one was truly memorable. The fresh whipped cream on the side didn't hurt either.The meal wasn't cheap but was much cheaper than a similar one on the Strip. They may play it safe with the menu, but it won't leave you disappointed. If you're looking for that traditional steakhouse experience it's good to know that you don't have to travel far to get it.One evening last week, we had a great Happy Hour AND Fine Dining experience in this elegant, comfortable restaurant. We'll be back again and soon!YELPIER DETAILS Fleming's has an upscale ambience, good food, superb service and at a reasonable price. Its menus offer nice selections of food and beverage.  It also has a classy bar. However, this restaurant does NOT have a view, and could be slightly noisy when filled to capacity.Yes, we had excellent dinners at Fleming's before, 2x, to be exact, since its sister restaurant right NEXT DOOR (Roy's) was closed recently- But this was the first time we came for its happy hour AND dinner. We enjoyed both!We started our nice evening with happy hour over delicious apps (Pork Belly; Calamari) and tasty glasses of cab, at $6ea. For our dinner, we had Chef's Specials: Mahi, $37; Steak & Shrimp, $43; side of asparagus, $10.50. The fish was fresh and flavorful. The steak was tender and juicy but kind of small, the 3 shrimps were tiny and  slightly overcooked. For dessert we shared a wonderful Chocolate Lava Cake/Ice cream, $12.50 over great tasting coffee!The serving staff for our happy hour and dinner were absolutely superb! Our waitress Monica and her crew were friendly and helpful, attentive but not overbearing. The hostess was friendly and welcoming. She cheerfully welcomed guests at the start, and warmly said goodbye to them at departure. However, as the restaurant was filled to capacity around 7pm, it was understandably a bit noisy. I would give it 5 Stars, if it had a view. In short, we had a wonderful happy hour/dinner experience here, and will be back again for more and soon! Nov 2013I've been to Flemings probably a dozen times in San Diego and Rancho Cucamonga.  This is my first time to the Las Vegas location.  The set up, size, vibe, and service is as consistent as it gets, but that's not necessarily a good thing.  I'm fine with the service and ambiance for the most part.  My only issue is the noise.  Tough to enjoy your steak and company when all you hear is everyone's conversation.  Regardless, I still had a decent dinner with the gf here the other night. As for my meal, I have never deviated from their 8 oz petite filet mignon.  Before dinner, I scoped out the menu and contemplated on something different.  But guess what? I chose the petite filet again.  The steak was decently sized, but was a little disappointed on the overall taste. I got my steak medium-well and thought it was too pink. As for taste, I thought it was just "A-Ok".  For a pinkish steak, I thought it tasted burnt. I don't know if it was Fleming's or if my taste in steaks have changed. Price is about what you expect at a steakhouse.  However, I've had better steaks with the same price points.  Overall, will I be back?  I'm sure I will one day.  Maybe next time I'll try their lobster or seafood.PS:  Their Mushrooms Ravioli is phenomenal.

Restaurant name  Penn Station East Coast Subs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
It had been a horrible day.  Lean Cuisine was not going to cut it.  Let's go to Penn Station East Coast Subs!Located off of Providence Rd, just past 485, this is in the same shopping center as Hickory Tavern and Harris Teeter (and Carvel!).  At 7:45 pm on a Wednesday (school night), there were more people there than I expected.  Upon walking in, I gave my order to a friendly gentleman, then moved a few feet to pay.  Drinks are self serve and my meal was brought to my table a few minutes later.   There are a few tables outside (which people were smoking at - GROSS), and quite a few tables inside as well.The food:12" cheesesteak ($9) - I can eat a 12" Subway sub with no problem, but this bad boy, wow... towards the end, I didn't think I was going to be able to finish it.  But I tried hard and believed in myself and managed to eat everything but the crumbs.   Served smoking hot, the meat was plentiful and well seasoned on bread that was toasted enough to keep the ingredients together (for the most part), but still soft on the inside.  I didn't go with the fully loaded cheesesteak (I don't like mushrooms or mustard) and had cheese, onions and mayo.  Absolutely delicious, though a bit drippy.Small fries ($1.69) - meh, they were fries.  I am not a huge fry fan and just ate a few, but they were hot and made from potatoes.  Ketchup is self-serve from a pump next to the drink machine and they also have malt vinegar if that is your preference.It was just over $13 for a 12" sub, small fry and a drink - a little more that your average sub place, but quite good.  Good food, friendly employees, clean interior, fresh tasting ingredients, Penn Station is a winner and I shall return.

Restaurant name  Rao's
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Vino, pasta & dolci, oh my!For those of you unfamiliar with Rao's, allow me to provide a little info.  The original Rao's is located in New York City.  It is super tiny and IMPOSSIBLE to get a reservation.  I mean, if Madonna and Bill Clinton couldn't get in!  Yes, it's true.  The folks that are privileged enough to dine at Rao's have standing reservations.  Fortunately for us mere mortals Rao's has a restaurant in Las Vegas at Caesar's Palace.  I have been fortunate enough to dine here several times and each time I have been pleased.  My most recent experience was last weekend.  My family and I were seated in the "fireplace" room which is an exact replica of the restaurant in NY, right down to the autographed pics of celebs and important peeps.We ordered family style so we could sample multiple dishes.  My faves were the lemon chicken (so moist and flavorful) and the penne alla vodka (TDF!!!).  Service was spot on.  The host added to the ambiance.  He reminded me of someone straight out of The Godfather.  He was so sweet to my little nephew!  Rao's is not fancy, but it does serves yummy Italian food.  Mangia bene!One of the things I LOVE about Vegas is all of the wonderful dining options.  The other thing I love is that you can actually GET a reservation at these wonderful restaurants.  Case in point: Rao's.  As most people know, Rao's (the original) is located in NYC and is so super-exclusive, that even celebrities have been turned away.  There are standing reservations so don't even try.  Until now.  Rao's LV is owned and operated by members of the family who own Rao's NYC.  The LV restaurant is much larger than the one in NYC.  There are even two rooms which are exact replicas of the NYC restaurant, right down to the autographed photos of celebrities who have had the fortune to dine at the original location.  I've been to Rao's LV multiple times, and each time I love it.  We always receive fabulous service and delicious old-school Italian cuisine.  This place is the kind of restaurant where even your Nonni (Italian grandmother) would feel like she was dining at the home of a fellow Italian family.  Seriously.It is that good.  Buon Appetito!  :)Rao's in New York City is notorious.  It is not clear how good their food actually is since no one is able to get a reservation at the restaurant.  Seriously, the wait is measured in terms of years, and at the end of the day, they primarily serve pasta like most any other Italian restaurant in the city.  In Las Vegas, it is a different story.  One can freely walk into the restaurant with the hope of actually getting a table.  Short of that, a seat at the bar is almost always guaranteed.  I believe the menu is the same, and the owner was at the restaurant on my visit, so I felt like I was able to have roughly the same experience as I would in New York if I had somehow managed a reservation.I ordered the gnocchi bolognese and had a glass of Montepulciano.  The dinner began with a bread course served with a plate of olive oil and vinegar.  I was happy with this beginning with the tasty bread and the good quality olive oil.  The gnocchi were beautifully presented simply dressed in a deep dish.  I had an impressive amount of pasta before me, and the gnocchi were not heavy at all.  I thought the texture was great.  The sauce was very flavorful and balanced.  Simple and good, exactly what I wanted.  The wine paired well.  More generally, I was pleased to have a nice selection of Italian wines available by the glass.  The restaurant itself was fairly busy and very dynamic.  The interior is dark and nearly every square inch of the walls was decorated with photos of the celebrities who have visited.  I know that can be kind of cheesy, for example at the Carnegie Deli, but here I was getting more of a Minetta Tavern kind of feel.  I think this location of Rao's is a wonderful place to have a glass of wine and a plate of pasta.  It definitely gets my vote over places like B and B Ristorante which charges far more for less.  Recommend.First, a lesson. The name of this restaurant does not rhyme with "Wows". It's more like "RAY-Oh's". And now you know. Feel free to click that little "Useful" button down below.Atmospherically speaking, Rao's is very nice. Warm, clean, inviting. Sort of homey, if you lived in a really nice home. With lots of people eating in it.Foodwise, Rao's is merely good, in my opinion. The pasta I had was fine, but there wasn't anything to really set it off from a bunch of other Italian restaurants I've been to. And it's pricey too. The average pasta price was around $24. A moderately sized side of spinach was $14. Yes, I realize price around here is as much a factor of location as anything else, but even factoring that in I don't think the price is QUITE justified. The service was good. Our waitress had good recommendations and water & ice tea glasses were refilled properly.Something else useful to know (hint, hint) is that while it doesn't say so on the menu, you can get half portions of pasta for a little more ($2 I think) than half the price of the full portion. I made a meal out of two half pastas, and it was enough food. They also give you plenty of bread. My friend's chicken dish was also quite big. If you aren't super hungry you could probably split an appetizer and an entree between two people, which would make Rao's a bit more affordable.I'm a little torn between 3 & 4 stars, but at the end of the day I'm not ready to call myself a fan.This scenario seems familiar to most...dinner for a friend's birthday...pick somewhere nice with a wide variety of food options that most in the party have not eaten at before.  The celebrant decided on Rao's in Caesar's.  I had forgotten until I walked up to the restaurant that I had actually eaten there twice before.  After this experience, I remember why I didn't remember them the first two times.  Our night began with a phone call to the restaurant to find out the dress code/attire.  We were told that it was business casual and that jeans were not permitted.  We asked even for women if they were nice jeans and were told we would be "turned away."  Upon arriving at the restaurant, the first guest I saw seated was wearing a Hawaiian print button up shirt, tan shorts and flip flops.  Next I saw a women in a tank top, white shorts and tennis shoes.  I had changed out of my outfit to meet their requirements, making us 20 minutes late, only to find out when we got there that we still would have been better dressed then some of the patrons.We were seated in a far corner in the back of the restaurant.  Greeted promptly with menus and a discussion of the specials.  The rest of my party was a bit put-off when we were told that the poached salmon was actually served in a "foil-bag."  We ordered drinks and reviewed the menu.  I explained what I had eaten before and what I thought might be good selections.  Being that I had been there before I decided to try something new.  Their vodka sauce is truly amazing and they had a ricotta shell dish that came with their famous marinara sauce, so I decided to switch it out with the vodka sauce.  The rest of the party gave their orders. Our waiter then became non-existent and seemed rushed or busy whenever he did finally come over to check on us.   Food came out after a long wait (the restaurant wasn't even busy)...mine looked like a glorified version of mac and cheese made with pasta shells and a vodka sauce.  I was very disappointed that there wasn't any ricotta in the shells.  When I inquired about it with the waiter, he told me I had ordered it that way.  I knew I had specifically asked for ricotta so he offered to bring me a side of ricotta.   The rest of the party was not satisfied with their meals either.  The waiter never asked what we thought about our meals.  When we finally got our check, we about passed out.  The drinks we had been ordering (Red Bull and house vodka) were $22 each.  These were tiny little cocktails that are served in the same size glasses that you get comp'd drinks in, while gambling in a  casino.  They charged separately for the Red Bull and vodka, which most places do, but charged us for a full Red Bull with each drink, with out bringing out the remaining Red Bull to the table (as most places do.)  We were appalled.  Dinner was over $250 per couple, the food was below average, and the service was horrible.  We even told him we were there for our friend's birthday and he looked at us like, "so?"  I can pretty much guarantee I will NEVER eat at Rao's again.  I am more than willing to pay decent prices for excellent food and service, but for what we received at Rao's, I would have rather gone to The Olive Garden and saved $200!  At least there I can get unlimited salad and breadsticks!  LOLI am not a glutton for punishment...this girl will NEVER make the mistake of going to Rao's for a nice night out with friends, EVER again.There's something a little unsettling about going to an Italian restaurant and being told by an angry German man that they won't serve you.  Didn't Mussolini and Hitler form some sort of tag team about denying people what they wanted or some such?Not that I'm comparing the inability to order a set of damn meatballs to genocide, but I've actually been told I couldn't get food there; nobody's ever tried to shove me into a gas chamber.  Melt me in lava, impale me, throw me off of catwalks that don't meet OSHA standards, wreck my pod racer, and ignite the bio gas coming from the Deathstar's latrines with a bomb, sure.Here's the deal:  If your website says you are open till midnight every night.....when someone shows up at 11, don't tell them that you closed an hour and a half ago because it was "a vittle slow".  It's Vegas - the town never shuts down.  You're telling me that you closed your entire restaurant in a major strip casino 2.5 hours early because you felt like it?  This has happened 2 of the last 3 times we've gone there.  Do these people have ANY idea how hard it is to find parking for the Deathstar?  Those resort parking lots are designed for 9 dollar a day subcompact rentals, not capital spaceships.  And don't even get me started on what happened last time I parked it valet - I'm still paying the fines associated with the planetoid they blew up because they thought the Deathray button was the e-brake.  It takes effort to get to this place.The worst part is just how unapologetic and rude these people are about it.  Look, I've dined at the Harlem location.  I know that you have to book it half a year in advance and if you don't like it then that's no sweat off of them because....well....you have to book it half a year in advance! But this is a much larger space in a major Vegas resort, and one that I have never seen at more than 20% capacity.  You aren't that damn special.  You aren't afforded the right to be a bunch of jackasses.  You guys are lucky that I had a 50,000 game Keno ticket at Caesar's that I wouldn't have been able to check on had I been thrown out of the casino for Force Choking all of you, otherwise it woulda been the end of all of you.The food?  It's delicious when you can get it.  The meatballs are literally the best I've had anywhere.  Of course, the Lady Vader has figured out how to perfectly replicate them, so we don't need you for that.  The pasta dishes are delicious, but nothing that can't be easily replaced by venturing about a mile off strip and going to Ferraro's.   The service alone drops this thing all the way down from a solid 4, possibly even a 5, to a 2.  And rest assured, we will NOT be returning to be denied for a 3rd time out of the last 4....which is probably best for the staff's health.  A very sincere "shove an iLightsaber up your ass" and a score of 2 Deathstars.Yelp is right again.  3.5 stars for this place is exactly the meal I got.  I was hoping that most of the low ratings here were based on the "oh my it's soooo expensive, I can get spaghetti & meatballs at my local mom and pop place back home for $7.50."  I hate those reviews.  Yes it's going to be expensive here, you are on the strip and that's why the meatballs are like $16.  They are also the size of softballs.  If I can throw a meatball at you and possibly knock you unconscious ....If we can play dodge ball with it...If I have the urge to put three fingers in it and I'm looking for pins and a lane....If I can chain it to a prisoner's leg and keep him from escaping...If a meatball can do any of those things, then you can charge me $16 for two of them.  Now all of that bragging said, it didn't taste as good as my local mom and pop place back home for $7.50.  Yes I'm that guy.  Tomato sauced based Italian food is comfort food.  Some Italian Grandma has made all these dishes for her whole life and has been taught them by her Grandma and will pass them on to her Grandchildren who will all open restaurants in your cities.  They won't charge you an arm and a leg for them and you will eat them all the time.  They will be really good.  So if I walk into an Italian Restaurant in Caesar's Palace where you need a reservation in advance, I'm going to hold them to a higher standard and I'm expecting to be really wowed.  I wasn't, it was just ok.For starters we had baked stuffed clams.  These smelled great but the clam was pretty tough to get out of the shell (as clams can be).  The stuffing was way way overdone with fresh oregano.  You could taste nothing else, just oregano bread stuffing. Plus with the clam hanging onto it's shell for dear life, when you scooped out the clam shell, all you got was the stuffing.  The clam was left behind.  2 stars for this appetizer.My dish was the best at the table, Ossobucco alla Milanese.  I would give it 4 stars.  It was nice and tender shank of veal cut very thick.  It was served on top of saffron risotto and in a traditional tomato/ vegetable sauce.  There was a small fork placed in the bone marrow for sampling.  I enjoyed the flavor of the bone marrow, but I'm not a fan of the texture of it.  If you eat at Rao's, I would recommend this dish.  My brother got a beautiful looking Veal Parmesan.  This was served bone in and was impressive to look at as it covered the entire large plate.  Unfortunately it's flavor didn't match it's looks.  It was also tough.  Not terrible, but not great either...3 stars.  My wife had Ricotta Purses with Sage and Butter.  Although the pasta was cooked nicely, the ricotta cheese was kind of sweet and somehow the sage butter lacked the savory element to offset it.  Just recently we had a similar ravioli style sage butter sauce dish at Angelini Osteria in Hollywood, CA.  That dish was so magical, but this one was very blah.  Again 3 stars.  One other strange bit of info is that Rao's is decorated for Christmas year round.  I asked about this and was told that at the original Rao's in New York, they never got around to taking the Christmas decorations down one year, so it became a joke that they would just leave them up.  When they opened this Las Vegas location, they kept that tradition.So there you go, as with most restaurants on the strip, Rao's is 3 star food at 5 star prices.Not bad, but not great for the money spent. I read a few reviews here on Yelp before and after I went to Rao's. I had to confirm what I had read to be accurate. Among the situations other Yelper's have listed, such as being told they are fully booked or that they they don't have a particular bottle wine (due to the lower price of the bottle..) I can tell you both of these things happened to myself and my party. We originally tried to make a reservation for 8 pm on a Friday and were told there was absolutely no way that would be possible for 3 people. The reservationist directed us to come in and sit at the bar if we liked and we could wait for a table to open up for dining. This is what we decided to do. We strolled in just before 8 pm to a crowded bar at Rao's. My female companion inquired at the door about a table for 3. We wanted to be thorough in case a cancellation or something of the sort had occurred. The young hostess assured us there was no way we would be seated in the dining room before 930 p.m. We decided to go to the bar for a drink. Sitting at the bar, the room was fairly full. As I turned to look at the dining room, I saw 7 empty tables. All clean, prepped and ready to go. At 830, then 845, still no one sitting in them. Close to 9 pm we are seated to a half empty dining room. ... ... So we sit down and my one buddy has been here before including the one in New York. He did the ordering of food. I ordered wine. Figuring the 3 of us would drink at least 2 bottles of wine throughout dinner.. (we like wine:) I decided on a $80-ish bottle of Montepulciano. The server came by to tell us that the wine was unavailable and suggested a $95 dollar bottle instead. I told him I would check the menu a bit and get back to him. Im not afraid of a $95 bottle of wine, but the review I had read was ringing in my ears.. so I decided on a $70-ish bottle instead... ALSO unavailable. So when I decided to go to the $95 dollar bottle .. they had it practically ready to pour! Haha.. It was almost comical. The sommelier came by and was pouring wine as the first course of beet salad was arriving. I was serving the salad to my friends and was told by the sommelier that I "do that very well"..I said thanks, I am in the service industry also. "Oh we didn't know you were service industry too"... she said.. Hmm. Why does that matter I thought?Overall.. I have to tell you i was so unimpressed with the whole situation, that I just smiled, ate and ordered more wine. I gotta say.. the food was really unimpressive. My main gripe about 'American Style' Italian food is the over abundance of sauce, and lack of flavor.. in a high-end place like Rao's.. I would have expected that to be a non-issue. Not so. Really bland Sausage and Broccoli Rabe, unflavored red sauce on a couple of meatballs, and really just non existent on anything over the top delicious. Aside from the bottle of Ripasso I had in place of dinner, as I stopped dining after a few bites. Just not good. The bartenders at the bar were very nice, smiling and made a great martini. It was a saving bit to the evening as they even smiled and wished us good night as we left. It was around $300 for the 3 of us, and is probably near average per person price, but far less than average dining experience. Sorry. Better luck to you if you try this out. I won't be back for dinner.We wanted to try a new Italian place in Vegas, and since most Caesar's restaurants have impressed us, we went with Rao's.  BIG MISTAKE.  Hundreds of dollars later, the only nice thing I have to say about Rao's is that the service was great and the ambiance is nice (Although Christmas-y.  In August.) but everything else?  Pass.  This is what we had: Caprese Salad-  Weird.  The tomatoes were in huge quarters instead of slices and there was a pesto/garlic/balsamic sauce all over it.  The cheese was delicious but the rest?  Not so much.  Caesar Salad-  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.  Salsa alla Marinara and a Side of Meatballs-  My husband had this dish and didn't dislike it, but didn't think it was anything great either.  I tried the meatballs in some marinara, and I'm not going to lie...there was an acidic, I-just-puked-in-my-mouth aftertaste that I couldn't shake.  Needless to say, I've had better meatballs.  And sauce.  Porcini Mushroom Risotto- I really thought this dish was going to blow my mind.  The menu lists it as:  "Vialone Rice Cooked with Mushroom Stock, Sliced Porcini Mushrooms, Parmesan Cheese, and White Truffle Oil".  What it actually is though is a different story:  Simultaneously mushy and hard rice with bland mushrooms, and an overwhelming truffle oil scent with a underwhelming truffle oil taste.  The busboy knew I didn't like it and offered to tell my server, but what is she going to do about it?  She didn't make it.  I'm just bummed we paid $30 for a dish I took five bites of.Overall, the place has potential, the service is great (I mean, a guy comes out and dishes your plates in front of you!), but it didn't do anything for our wallets or our stomachs.I went to Vegas with a very old friend of mine that I grew up with in NY.   She is less than adventurous when it comes to food so Italian seemed like a safe bet for dinner for the two of us.For some reason, I find it difficult to find baked clams in LA and they were a favorite of mine growing up in NY so my friend and I decided to split an order.  They came out piping hot, the breading was plentiful and perfectly seasoned and the ratio of breading to clam was spot on.  A squirt of lemon and I was in heaven.We didn't want to stuff ourselves before going out for the night and I wanted something simple so I ordered the spaghetti marinara (something I would normally NEVER order out), a side of meatballs to split with my friend and I had a glass of wine to wash it all down.The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was well balanced, sweet and just a little tangy and the meatballs were everything that everyone makes them out to be.  They are just dense enough not to crumble when you cut into it with your fork and tender enough that they still practically melt in your mouth.  Truly divine.  The portions were HUGE.  I had half of my pasta and half of a meatball left over at the end of the meal.  It's a good thing though because for what they charge, I might have been LIVID if I wasn't MORE than stuffed.  Our waiter convinced us to take our food back to our hotel (even though we didnt have a microwave) and I'll admit, after a long drunk night out, it tasted just as good cold as it did when it was hot and at least I felt like I got my moneys worth and didn't have to eat at McDonalds at 3am.  At least not on that night.My out of town buddy wanted Italian somewhere he hadn't been before.  He's a frequent visitor to Vegas so he has been to most of the good ones on the strip (thanks to me! ha!).  Throw in Restaurant Week and a lack of last minute tables available at 9pm on a Saturday and I was back at Rao's for the first time in 6 years.  I wanted to dine in the Christmas room again but there was a wait so we just opted for the lower floor area facing the pool.  We ordered a plate of antipasto (prosciutto di parma, mild sopresata, marinated artichokes, gaeta olives, buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, grana padano, gorgonzola cheese, dressed arugula) to kick things off and that was very good.  Everything was fresh and that was a nice substitute instead of four people getting individual salads.The osso bucco was literally calling my name right off the page but I figured I could come back for that any other time of the year.  I decided to take advantage of the great value of Restaurant Week and use the couple of bucks saved on drinking more wine.  The appetizer was "Mozzarella in Carrozza" which was described as fried fresh mozzarella sandwich served with marinara.  In reality it was 2 HUGE wedges of deep fried breaded mozzarella.  So unhealthy yet so delicious.  Fried cheese has never tasted bad...ever.There were four options for the main course but since everyone else was getting pasta (scampi, spaghetti and meatballs, shells) I decided on the pork chop and MAN OH MAN was that a solid choice.  It was a double cut of pork that was pan seared and sauteed with hot and sweet cherry peppers.  It was juicy, spicy, well seasoned and I ended up gnawing on the bones at the end like a dog.  I took only one bite of the tiramisu since I was so full and my wife ate the rest of it.  There are so, so, so many Italian options around these days (and better values to be had) but I wouldn't mind splurging a little more for this gem a few times a year.A taste of the old country; yep, New York City circa 1890.  The ultimate expression of what many have come to know as Italian or rather I-talian (emphasis on the I and meaning no disrespect) food in the US.  It's origins in Naples, but long since corrupted for American taste and bounty.  The Italian spirit and passion for sharing good food lives on.Rao's is a fun place to mangia!  Example one, ginormous meatballs the size of your fist.  Flavorful, Perfectly cooked, tender, balls bathed in a hearty red sauce.  A great blend of fatty beef, pork, and lean veal the right amount of breadcrumb filler.  Example two, spaghetti alla Bolognese, a pile of noodles hidden under a thick meaty, flavor charged sauce.Classic starters.  Baked clams, rich with butter and crisp breadcrumbs, dried herbs and a kiss of lemon; the fritto misto (calamari, shrimp, cod, and zucchini) a slightly crisp, slightly oily, aggressively seasoned; the sautéed mussels, sweet and tender sautéed in butter then quickly steamed in white wine and garlic.  No complaints.Classic mains.  Outstanding veal chop served smothered with Rao's classic sauce of mildly spicy, sweet cherry peppers.  Subtle flavor of tender veal along side the clean, pepper flavor and zesty tomato sauce.  It heightens the sweetness of the veal.  Win!  Veal not your thing?   The same sauce tops a tender grilled shell steak (Steak Pizzaiola) and a thick, juicy, double cut pork chop.  The Ossobuco, delicious.  Well braised, tender without being stringy.  A good portion of bone marrow a nice touch.  Finally "Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken; charbroiled marinated in a lemon olive oil mixture and finished in the same.  Tart, sweet, bitter, classic.Portions are large.  Very good wine list focusing on Italy.  Typical high Vegas resort pricing.Service is very friendly and efficient.  Exactly what you would expect from an I-talian restaurant from NYC.  Well done.Before my show last night, I had dinner at Rao's, something that had been on my radar for awhile.  I made a reservation for 5 PM so I had lots of time for a leisurely meal before the 7:30 show.I was greeted promptly and taken to a table on the far side of the bar and down a few steps.  It's the last area before you go to their patio.  I had a view of the pool area and one of Caesars iconic Roman statues in a columned structure.My server, Howard, quickly appeared and asked for my drink order.  He brought my iced tea quickly.  Having read about the size of Rao's portion, I was careful to choose wisely.  I went with the baked clams for an appetizer and the ravioli purses for the main course.I was soon brought a nice bread basket.  Howard asked me if I wanted some balsamic with the olive oil and I declined.  I poured some of the oil onto the plate, salted it a bit, and then dipped some of the olive bread that was part of the basket.Within a short time, my baked clams were delivered.  They are littleneck clams that had an oregano bread crumb topping.  I squeezed some lemon on the clams and dug in.  It's been a long time since I got baked clams and they were great!  The lemon mixed with the juices from the clams and I had another dipping "sauce" for my bread.  Very tasty!The main course came. Rao's calls them beggar purse ravioli.  The ravioli were stuffed with a mixture of pear and ricotta cheese and they were in a sauce of brown butter seasoned with sage and topped with dried cranberries.  This caught my eye when I was reading the menu because it was such a different dish.  It was excellent, too!  The pear taste with the cheese was very mild and the butter with the dried cranberries was a true winner!  A good dish that's really different.  Also, I had dipping sauce #3--the brown butter with sage was a wonderful place to dip a few cubes of the good bread.For dessert, I asked Howard for his advice.  He gave me a listing of the entire dessert menu without having to bring one to me.  Of the things on the menu, he recommended one, the peanut butter tart, something his wife makes--she's one of the pastry chefs at Rao's.  The tart had a graham cracker crust, a layer of chocolate ganache, and it was topped with peanut butter mousse.  It was superb!  I'll have the other dessert he recommended on my next visit.The dinner was very very good!  Service was exemplary.  The staff or Howard was always around to refill water, get more iced tea, remove dirty dishes, and simply to do a great job!  I am a big fan of Rao's.Can't say enough about this jewel!!!  How lucky was I to have participated in the grand opening. Was introduced to the owners, chefs, and the main gatekeeper... The man that allows you to make reservations!!!  We became best friends (due to the fact I was an Executive Casino Host at Caesars) and never did I have a problem getting a table.  The food is perfect, the entrees are amazing, their customer service is outstanding.Let me start by saying, I had hoped for great things  at Rao's. I mean the place was packed, we had to wait to get in. The food looked and smelled great. But then after waiting over a half hour, we finally get seated, and then reality hit! Rao's is great if you have no sense of taste and love bland food. They are known for their meatballs so a few of us ordered those. Let me tell you, the meatballs in the frozen section at the supermarket were better. Very bland. The lasagna? Again, not the worst I have ever had but very far from the best. Again, the ladies at the local church make better pasta dishes than Rao's and their lasagna does not cost $30. But the worst of the meal was the peas, onions and prosciutto.  What were they thinking? The  prosciutto was so tasteless! How do you make it so bland? Anyhow if you are thinking of eating at Rao's, don't. If you want to spend big bucks on a meal in Vegas, go over to the Bellagio and try their buffet, the locals love it. Or try FireFly Tapas over on Paradise Rd. I'm a foodie that's been coming to Vegas for 10 years. Don't waste your money here, unless of course, you enjoy spending big money on food with no flavor at all.I like good meatballs. Rao's is famous for that. Their New York location is always busy and they say the best way to try Rao's is by going to this location.We tried the lasagna and the meatballs. We had a show to go to so we let them know ahead of time that we're a bit pressed on time. The service wasn't all that great and they weren't even busy.The lasagna was good but nothing special. The meatballs were huuuuuge and tasty. I won't mind coming back for these balls but I'd probably take them to-go so, I don't have to deal with the service.Generally unamused by Restaurant Week, an excuse for infrequent diners to eat dumbed-down menus from restaurant's they'd not normally visit in the name of a charity that would be better served by direct donations, it was only long-standing New York Import Rao's at Caesars Palace that seemed willing to do something interesting with the $50.15 prix-fixe, a selection of novelties offered in addition to the restaurant's fabled fare finally providing a reason to check the space off a long-term list of places as-yet unseen.Currently toqued by Chef Fatimah Madyun with pastry duties assigned to Laura Augsburger, Rao's Las Vegas was the second amongst three current iterations of the East Harlem classic whose 'impossible' reservations and 'owned' tables garner far more attention than the food, yet with the Southern Italian recipes of Frank Pellegino presented true to form  the menu itself is a well-culled pick em' of  plates to please any palate, the "On-Strip" pricing and stereotyped Eye-talian service an expected footnote probably best ignored.Dining as a group of five, and as such able to sample widely from a tasting served in four family-style courses despite initial suggestions that the Restaurant Week option could not be 'added' to a larger scale meal, it was in a basket of fresh bread in three varieties paired to peppery tomato cream that the meal began and as much as restraint was attempted given all the upcoming carbs, any resistance proved futile as the warm trio was replenished more than once - the bites not topped with creamy spread proving more than amenable to sopping up any sauce gone astray.Dividing the meal into appetizers, pastas, entrees, and dessert, with a bit of overlap to balance out courses two and three, it was after a short delay that round one was delivered along with glasses of wine for those choosing to imbibe, and although the well seasoned clams proved somewhat skimpy in portion given the pricetag there is little argument that Rao's signature meatballs more than justify their legendary status, the balance of meat and breadcrumbs somehow dense and dainty at the same time with a spice profile that melded well to both crushed San Marzanos as well as the special cream sauce rife with blue cheese.Noting that the large space was perhaps 2/3 full throughout much of the stay, and that waiters appeared stretched across sections that saw them working two-tiers of the restaurant at once, there was again a sizable delay paired to empty glasses prior to pastas presented by a pair of back-servers, yet when the three piping hot plates arrived almost all sins were immediately forgiven, the imported dry bucatini prepared perfectly al dente beneath a smooth lacquer of eggs, pork, and cream while the tubes of Rigatoni were equally well textured amidst an aromatic red sauce, the housemade purses a far more mild option that may have benefitted from a bit of salt or grated Pecorino, though the bites taken with dried cranberries were admittedly quite nice.Seeing secondi arrive in a much more expedited manner than the prior course, each dish served with an appropriate warning that plates were 'extremely hot,' it was here that the Restaurant Week special of Duck Cannelloni was presented and although the composition was perhaps a bit reminiscent of the aforementioned ravioli the utilization of confit duck proved a substantial upgrade to the milky ricotta in terms of both taste and texture, the $51 Veal Parmesan a bit overpriced despite good quality and substantial portion while the lemon chicken was moist and surprisingly restrained, the crispy charred skin proving a more than admirable foil to the citrus.Already selecting a single cannoli as part of the prix fixe, and adding on a $32 platter with three more options to share, dessert at Rao's no doubt trends towards the classics and as good as both the dense cheesecake and crisp tube of lightly lemon cream were, neither could outmatch the block of espresso-soaked ladyfingers amidst mascarpone, let alone the peanut butter tart that no-doubt tipped its hat to Reese's while simultaneously meeting the tongue both rich and as light as a cloud.While some purists may suggest that such 'one-off' concepts are disingenuous to the original others may consider such things to be a benefit providing the cooking is on point, particularly since most lack the political (or mob) ties required to visit the original and would likely be better served eating somewhere else in The Big Apple instead.  Setting aside high prices and service that would benefit from a few more hands-on-deck, Rao's is a worthy dinner for those seeking rustic red sauce on the Strip.My first visit to Rao's was about seven years ago and I have never felt the need to rush back and try it again. I remember the food being good but for not amazing for the price point. Last Saturday, I finally got the chance to return and again, I enjoyed my meal quite a bit, but there was nothing that blew me away.  Dining with a group of five, we had the opportunity to share a large selection of different items, including one restaurant week prefix. The highlights from our meal were the meatballs, which were extremely moist and flavorful, duck cannelloni, the lemon chicken, which is another of their signature dishes, ravioli purses, which wasn't a favorite around the table, but I really enjoyed the sweet and savory elements and the veal parmigiana. The desserts were classic and delicious as well. The peanut butter and chocolate torte stole my heart but the tiramisu was also very good. The meal was delicious but nothing that was so extraordinary that I see myself going out of my way to return for.

Review Text :
*** Ich bin betrunken und angefüllt und es ist ehrfürchtig ! ***Man -o -man...Big giant Spaten beers...and deep-kraut-fried-schweiner-schintzel-burp-o-pleasure-cheesy-orgasmonic. Another super short but sweet review.If you dig authentic German grub (which I grew up, thanks Granny!) this is the joint. Plus the great back bar..and do I need to mention the Spatens as big as your head (again)..?F-ing lovely!I'm heading back very soon.*caution: if you have a heart attack after eating here do not be surprised, be expectant... in a good way.Es schmeckt sehr lecker!That's German!I have been to Haus Murphy's to drink a few times in the past and was quite pleased by the beer selection as well as the size. I can get beer in a stein the size of my head? Surely you jest. I have a rather large melon. It is true though. The effer is huge and tasty.I finally got to eat here with my favorite collection of Brite girls. The whole place feels rather authentic though I have never been to  Germany so what do I know? Everything I know about Germany I learned from Polka and online pornography (I think they love the Hoff). Community tables were not uncomfortable as they can be other places. They were quite cozy and enjoyable in fact.The food while unpronounceable was very delicious. In fact I have been told that my opening line means "It's delicious" however as previously stated I know nothing of German so it could very well mean *insert funnt profane thing here*Sauerkraut has become one of my favorite things in the world  and It does not disappoint here. The sausages were delicious and the beer made it all just a happy dining sort of day.Also how can you go wrong with two old men in lederhosen playing the oompah oompah on a tuba and an accordion. These guys are rock stars. You learn to play these instruments solely to get chicks.Srsly...I know you uppity east sider kids like to stear clear of the avenues except to take in some hipster-slumming it culture, but downtown Glendale has so much to offer. Haus Murphy's is amazing and it is nestled amongst little antique shops and whatnot with brick and lace and charm. Give it a shot. Tell them "Du hast meine Katze auf dem Fenster geworfen!"Do you want an escape from your typical Arizona dining experience? Do you crave an outdoor seating area were the beer flows like water and the old men dance around in traditional German clothing holding tubas? You really need to check this place out. I live about 5 minutes from here and it took me a full year and visiting relatives to finally get to downtown Glendale to check it out. We had a 6:30 reservation on the patio (It was a Saturday and I wanted to be safe but for 4, you could have done without the reservation). We sampled several German beers and I loved them all (wish I remembered the names). We started with the giant pretzel and sausage sampler-both were SO good I am still drooling. The Sausages were served over a bed of sauerkraut and the pretzel with spicy mustard. Everyone at the table tried something different and we all sampled everything. I loved the German potato salad served with the entrees and also the cabbage soup. The ambiance of this place was fantastic! The live music is from 6-8 and I really wish it went later. My boyfriend and I agree that eating there really makes you feel as though you are on vacation-far away from Arizona! I would HIGHLY recommend this place-great spot for anyone and especially out of towners looking for something unique!Last Thursday I had the pleasure of joining a bunch of Yelpers at a UYE here.  I had not been here in over 10 years and they have move East on Glendale a bit since then.  At that time they were out of sauerbraten so they served us a stew of sorts that wasn't on the menu and I remember it being quite good and large plates of food.I still desired to try their sauerbraten so that is what I ordered.  It comes with a potato dumpling, gravy, and red cabbage.  I expect a piece of beef marinated for three days to not require a knife to cut and to have some flavor of it's own before dowsing it in gravy, and sauerbraten I have had before met this.  This one to me was quite chewy and the gravy too sweet.  Gravy is one of those things that just because I think it is too sweet doesn't make it bad or improperly made, it just didn't suit my taste.  If I had liked the gravy better it would have improved my image of the dumpling which, without gravy, was sort of tasteless.  The red cabbage was just as I expected and have had before.Now that I have grumbled about my meal.  I got a bite of a big pretzel two of which the restaurant comped us.  I thought it was a bit salty but overall a very pleasant surprise.  I chose to try mine with butter.  The bread pudding was delicious, I chose the small size and it was easily enough for two to share, but I ate it all anyway. :-)  All of this food was washed down with a good tasting Spaten lager.  The service was pretty good, especially for our large group.  And they were willing to split the checks, which even with a party of about 18 did not have the mandatory added gratuity, although I doubt if anybody in our party tipped less than 18% because they was nothing wrong with the service to warrant a poor tip.  The owner didn't introduce himself but he did make a couple of appearances on the patio to see how things were going.I could easily be enticed to come back to the patio and enjoy a beer.  I think I would opt for one of the appetizers like a pretzel or the potato pancakes to soak the beer up with.I attended a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) here and I have to say that Haus Murphy's pretty much wowed all 20 or so of us!It has taken me over a week to get to the review.  I was still reflecting on the German meatloaf, red cabbage and Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen.How do you say, "Damn that was good!" in German?  I have new found respect for German cuisine thanks to Chef Hoffman (not sure about the spelling there).The fubar of Yelpers (I am pretty sure that is the correct term for a large gathering of Yelpers) dined on the patio which is a great space.  Service was very good throughout the meal.There was quite a bit of sharing going on and although I don't remember everything I tried, it was all really good.It was great to see so many friends and meet some new Yelpers like Norm!Stumbled upon this place while driving to the Chocolate Festival. My husband was thrilled as he LOVES German food. We decided to have lunch here after checking out the festival.Being a lovely warm and sunny day we decided to sit outside....which is very cool...nicely decorated, big picnic tables and plenty of sunlight.I ordered the Hackbraten (German Meatloaf) which was very good, the mashed potato and red cabbage were superb! With this I of course had to try a German beer.....I asked the waiter what he would recommend, he asked what type of beer I like and I said usually the darker ones...he recommended the Franziskaner Dunkel - an unfiltered dark wheat beer, dark roasted malt with a smoky roasted grain finish .... a great recommendation as it was just perfect with my meal.My husband who is constantly craving Weisswurst Sausages was finally at peace having found it on the menu. He insisted I try some of his and said it would melt in my mouth....wow!...it actually does melt in your mouth....delicious. Our waiter was awesome as he knew everything on the menu so he was very helpful as well as very friendly and a great photographer! Everything you need in a waiter : )The German music playing in the background was really festive and added to the great atmosphere. We will definitely be back!Ugh, I would really like to like this place. Getting to the location is awful, traffic is painfully slow since there are no left turn signals on the main street. Parking was okay since it was Saturday afternoon, but having to re-park every two hours kinda sucked and the food was bland!! I have been to Germany, and all the dishes I had there were flavorful, and yummy...but this place? bland and embarrassing. I met a group there to play board games and the staff was so nice and great! But the turkey sandwich with horseradish mayo was dry and gross. I ordered it thinking the mayo would throw me off but "hey, it's a German restaurant, let's give it a whirl" I couldn't even taste the special mayo! My homemade sandwiches have more flavor than this one. I ordered the apple strudel hopeful for some redeeming quality to compliment the great service...0-2, again like the Compass Restaurant, the best thing about the dessert was the sliver dollar shot of whip cream. This place was so accommodating and fun to hang out at, with really nice service...but I wish I could have something nice to say about the food.Haus Murphy's is fun place place to go for German meals and it has a lot of fans.  I found them to be a little dated with their decor and their food is usually cooked well done or over cooked.  Their service is A~OK.Food feedback:Apps ~ Sausage Sampler, Bratwurst/Krakauerwurst served over a bed of homemade Sauerkraut is tasty! Potato Cakes,  served with a side of Apple Sauce and sour cream was a bit overcooked very dry. The Giant Bavarian Pretzel Imported 10oz. salted Pretzel is highly over rated and was not cooked evenly. Meals ~ Their beef & pork sausages are all served over their homemade sauerkraut with German potato Salad or fries.Bier Bratwurst - Beef-Pork Sausage is good.German Bratwurst - Pork Sausage is bland.Krakauer Wurst - Polish spicy Beef-Pork Sausage is awesome! Their Schnitzel's are good but again overcooked at times. I preferred their Steak Schnitzel topped with a Gorgonzola cheese and Roasted Onion Sauce.  Served with German Fried Potatoes and Bacon Roasted Green Beans. Beers~Spaten Lager or Weihenstephan Hefeweizen are best, you cant go wrong here.Shame on the owners of Haus Murphy's for participating in the sham of a TV show "Mystery Diners!" When the producers promise free publicity, and you so easily lie to the public - that is not a business I will support. The "manager" under scrutiny on the show was an ACTOR - not a relative, and not a manager. The show, the conversations, the issues......all phony. Entertainment is one thing, but. I do not respect this at all!Reheated, insipid food and perfunctory service in a kitschy atmosphere.We drove 32 miles from our house to Haus Murphy's because we were in the mood for German.  It was the middle of a Sunday afternoon so it wasn't very busy.We ordered a couple of beers and the Bauernplatte combination for 2.  This includes several kinds of sausage, a pork cutlet, a schnitzel, a kind of hamburger in gravy, red cabbage, sauerkraut, spatzle and fried potatoes.  It look great! Sadly, it all appeared to have been pre-cooked and then microwaved.  Let me repeat that -  a precooked and microwave schnitzel!  The spaetzle in particular was a soggy, water-logged travesty.  $35 for this by the way.So with two beers and tip, that was $60.00 for lunch. For microwaved food.It's quite sad that they don't really care about the quality of food here.  This type of Bavarian food is fairly easy to prepare so it's hard to understand why they would have so much contempt for the customers or the lovely cuisine of Germany.Any restaurant that would serve you reheated food like this really doesn't care about you or about the food they are serving.I wish I had noticed the 50 filtered reviews before eating here.A few weeks ago I was watching an episode of Diners, Drive-ins & Dives and they're doing a feature on this restaurant.   Knowing I would be heading to Phoenix soon AND I don't have German food very often, I bookmarked it, then ask my friends if they want to have dinner here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=xeRpdNyGlTwF4SNYZ3588A#XdSMeOjMFXkDYkLe9CmVSgFast forward to Friday afternoon.  I call and ask if they take reservations, they said yes, so I made one.   We arrived about 15 minutes early and the place is packed!   Come reservation time, they didn't have a table ready and asked us to wait in a "waiting area".   It's a small group of tables at the back of the bier garten.  I figured I might as well have a bier, right?  So I ordered a hefeweizen.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofA#fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofAAfter about 15 minutes they had a table ready in the "bier garten".   Yes it was cool outside but they had tons and I mean TONS of heaters!   There were three heaters around our table in very close proximity and another heater near the next table about 2 feet away.  We sat down and while my friends enjoyed the heat, I started baking immediately.SERVICE: All of the staff were very nice!   Our server Jeremy seemed to have very little personality and only smiled once when I made a joke.    However he did do a very good job taking care of us.   I ended up speaking with Rose, the owner.    What a sweet and fun lady!   We chatted about the restaurant and her experience with Guy Fieri and the production staff for the show.   She said they filmed that segment about 6 years ago.Rose also told me they've been in business for 18 years and at this location for the last eight years.  Her restaurant can seat 300, she has a staff of 22 working the front of house and 12 in the small kitchen.As we were dining two gentleman came out and started serenading the bier garten with an accordion and a tuba!   Hmm, does two make an "Oom-pah-pah band"?   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#Xg7Kg3cwQvevC0BJMIuXbAThey starting with "roll out the barrel" of course, and continued with a number of other bier drinking songs and Christmas songs for a good 30 minutes.   For me anyway, it made the whole evening that much more fun!FOOD:  We started with a giant pretzel!   It was warm, soft and very tasty!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#2s8FvkPpB0J_OGZSxDiYHA  (notice my phone for a size reference)   I really wanted to try 5 different entrees, but could only have one, so Paprika Schnitzel it is!    The entrees come with a cup of soup, which was a "lemon martini" on Friday.   It was quite tasty, but I didn't really get lemon or martini.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#lYe5isj_vkLSPwbdJHF8qQ  The schnitzel is pork loin pounded flat, breaded and pan fried golden brown and is topped with an onion and bacon infused paprika sauce.   it also comes with German fried potatoes (with garlic and caraway) and wirsing (shredded cooked cabbage and onion in a creamy cheese sauce) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#L0eXT4gWympRVAeAB-1_PA   The pork was very tender and tasty.  The paprika sauce was WONDERFUL but also very subtle and nearly "disappeared" on the schnitzel.   I LOVED the wirsing!   The potatoes were very good too!   One friend ordered the Hackbraten, which is a beef and pork meatloaf with roasted onion gravy, spatzle and red cabbage.   I was able to taste the meatloaf and it was fantastic!DESSERT: We couldn't leave without dessert, so we ordered and shared the Apple Strudel (Very good), Cherry Strudel (to die for!) and the "sauerkraut cake" (A chocoholics dream!).   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#NGjfFFw99WpS8Gzdt0-U8whttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#DdkM66FWNZZh2yjbHPQGFAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#ovcyB00DsctJwyk3X7TMpAOVERALL: it was an awesome evening with wonderful food and a great German atmosphere!  4.5 stars rounded up!Nice restaurant with good food. I had the Jaeger Schnitzel which came with potatoes and a cabbage and sour cream type side that was my favorite part. The Schnitzel was tender and the sauce on it was very flavorful. The potatoes were ok, nothing fantastic but good. We were a large group so I understand slower service so that isn't my complaint, my reason for not 5 stars is the waiter gave us a hard time about ordering any drinks while we waited for a few more people. The first table designated to us was full and he said he didn't want to take drink orders till everyone was there. He ended up doing it but wasn't to happy about it. That is fine but not great customer service. I have only been to one other German restaurant and I liked their food just slightly better but this was very good and I would return with a smaller party!I had a really good time, but sometimes I think your experience at a restaurant is much better due to the company.  I really enjoyed our gigantic table.  It created a little bit of havoc for the server and it made service a little slow, but I will cut them some slack.  I ordered the pretzel, because I am a carb addict.  I was so happy we had such a big group, because after cutting a piece I could pass it around to share and not feel so guilty.  It was big enough that about 10 people were able to taste it.  I really liked it.  The spicy mustard was indeed spicy. Before our dinners we got split pea soup, it was very tasty, I am usually not a soup person, but I was hungry and I enjoyed it very much.  For my entree I ordered the Wiener Schitzel, I had not had baby cow in a long time, it was well worth it.  I ate only have of it and took home the rest.  It came with potatoes and wirsing.   The potatoes were very good, on the other hand, I personally didn't like the wirsing (a creamy cabbage concoction).  Good thing Amy liked it, lol. We ordered dessert, but they were taking so long that we asked to have our Black Forest cake and Cherry Strudel to go.  When I got home, I was trying to be so good and got only a third of the strudel, then gave my hubby a third and put the rest in the fridge.  Well that freaking strudel was amazing, I went back to the fridge and ate the rest.  The next day I went twice to the gym.2nd meet up for the International Supper Club UYE (#ISCUYE) for 2014 and Haus Murphy was the place picked to try! It was a big group this time; we took 2 tables, holy cow!! Our server was a little frazzled about having to deal with this. We were pretty darn close to the bar and our server told me that he was not taking any drink orders until everyone had arrived and I had already known some were 10 to 15 mins out, so off to the bar I went!  I'm still fairly new to the whole ordering beer, so when I walked up to the bar the bar tender asked what do I like, and I told him I'm still unsure, since I'm new to drinking beer, he said oh you must be 21 haha Love him!! He offered me samples of all the beers they have on tap, which I thought I was pretty sweet and I went with a nice glass of Warsteiner Dunkel, it went perfectly well with everything! Kudos to the bar tender!   When I had already ordered my drink my server came to me and told me well I'm taking drink orders now, and I told him you told me to go to the bar and get my own drink so I did and I have.  Everyone placed their order, even folks who arrived 20 mins late got their order in, everyone except me got their food, even my daughter who was on the same check as me, ten minutes go by and the server noticed I didn't have my meal, oh it must have been forgotten. UGH!!!! I was upset!! But within minutes my food appeared and I took a bite and OMG ITS DELISH!!! and being upset slowly faded away, one could say I ate my feelings LOL (not really)   I ordered the Huhner (Chicken) Schnitzel with German fried potatoes and Wirsing, it did also come with a bowl of split pea soup, which was amazing, reminded me of the times I went to Pea Soup Andersen's in California, so good! The schnitzel with mushroom gravy was soo yummy!! Couldn't believe I ate it all!! It also came with fried taters and this Irish girl luvs them taters & wirsing, it was my 1st experience with that, didn't even know what I was eating when I started, it was creamy melty goodness, learned it was cream cabbage, omg really? That was dang good!But what I came for was the Sauerkraut Cake, yea that's right, sauerkraut cake!!! I have heard nothing but praise for this cake, they said its better than a death by chocolate cake!! I had to find out for myself!! OOOOMMMMYYYYYGGGAAAWWWDDD!!!! It's amazing!!  Sometimes the company makes the evening more pleasurable then the overall experience & the food was simply delicious , service well that could have been better.  I'm already craving some more schnitzel so I see myself coming back soon.Great food, service not so much! Let me first say that we had a large group and one server  was definitely not enough but Patrick gave it a great effort. On the other hand we did call in a reservation so perhaps a bit more preparation on their part would have been helpful so all of us might  have been served and waited upon in a more timely manner. Also, I didn't know it went against protocol to turn around and ask the bar tender whom was not busy to refill a soda. I guess it was since I was told that was my server's job and he would get it, apprarently if he was I woudn't be asking the bar, enough said.It was my first time at Haus Murphy and one of the best things about going with a big group is friends share. I ordered the Kilometer sausages, with fried potatoes and sauerkraut. The sausages were Hungarian, great flavor and so big they hung off the sides of the plate. I've never liked sauerkraut growing up but theirs I liked. My food was excellent and back to the friends and sharing, we exchanged bites, sausage for schnitzel, I tried a few, and every bite was amazing! I was getting quite full but since it's quite some distance from where I lived I figured I better try dessert. Oh bread pudding would have made the evening, but unfortunately for me but probably fortunately for my waistline they had just ran out. I'd go back again, the food is definitely worth coming back for!I haven't been to Germany but I have been to Haus Murphy's. Why does this matter? Haus Murphy's makes me feel like I haven't missed out on the great beer halls of Europe.My first visit to Haus Murphy I was serenaded by a tubist (Duane) and an accordion player (Elmer). Both gents were wearing short lederhosen and alpine hats (complete with a feather!) Perhaps entertained by my slack jawed expression they asked for my name.  And so I heard the song "Good night Irene" as performed by a tuba and an accordion. These guys are here on Friday and Saturday nights, 6:30-8:30pm. They take requests!You should come hAngry. The food is served in enormous sized portions. The Wiener Schnitzel is perfectly delivered. "But Irene. You haven't been to Germany!" Heck no. But I've been to Vienna and have gobbled my way thru many a schnitzel.  Haus Murphy's version is tenderly prepared, lightly fried in such a way you want to forget about the calories involved. I've had the good fortune to enjoy the indoor and outdoor spaces, in small, medium and large groups. The outside space is a wonderful venue to enjoy people watching. The indoor space readily accommodates larger parties. I would recommend coordinating in careful detail if your party is larger than ten. At my last visit for Int'l Supper Club the staffing was a little stretched for a party of our magnitude. We ended up walking to the bar to obtain our drinks, which wasn't really too much of an issue.Haus Murphy's is a really fun place to visit and dine. Also, RSVP for holiday events as they fill up!

The best thing is the Banana Nut Muffin! OMG it is TO DIE FOR! How good is it you ask?  My sister made me bring it back to San Diego for her on a business trip! I had to lug the goodness in the car all the way back to OC and then back down to SD! See the love for the muffin and for the sister! I delivered a muffin from so freaking far! lolYes, it is THAT GOOD! I still think about it that I drool and want to drive to Vegas again just for it! lol The muffin top is flat so more chewy crisp surface area.  We all know that is the best part! Here are the dishes I recommend.  I have had a bunch of different ones but I only order the Piggy Skillet.  It's the best of all the meat worlds! They put Crisp Bacon, Diced Ham, Pork Sausage, Potatoes, Cheese, and Eggs.. how can you go wrong! Mmmmm meaty cheesy goodness! Yes you can easily make this at home but I want the muffins! lolThe Chicken Enchilada Omelette is pretty good too.  The chicken inside is tender and flavorful paired with all the condiments on top.  All the dishes are huge and plentiful.  I can never finish it, but that can also be that I scarf down as many muffins on the table and more! lol Still the food is pretty good and the seasoned potatoes are delicious! ^_^ Yum Yum.If you are ever in Vegas, be sure to come try it out.  I think the design of the place is cute too, very wholesome! I like the mom and pop feel with cute sweet servers that are very attentive.  I have been back many times since and will keep coming back! Muffins!!! O=pI am not a big fan of Rachael Ray, but she doesn't get on my nerves nearly as much as she did when she was all unfiltered perkiness. Now that she has been homogenized and Oprah-sized and puts on make-up like Jack Nicholson as the Joker, I am somewhat sympathetic to her insatiable need to be the people's home cook, the pint-sized Paula Deen. Maybe that's why I was rather turned off by one of her Tasty Travels recommendations, the Egg & I on the corner of a strip mall out on Sahara Drive in Vegas. Even though it doesn't have the A-frame roof, it's really an IHOP with a country kitchen vibe that seems to draw the who's who of the Convoy-and-trailer-park set. Rachael was giving her thumbs up to this place for all the egg dishes they offer. That I won't argue as the menu went on with variations of omelettes and skillet breakfasts that span the globe and stretch the pocketbook. Jamie W. was being very good and ordered the Original Breakfast Burrito (see photo). However, it was quite a log that came out with a flour tortilla stuffed with four eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers onions, potatoes, cheddar and jack cheese. It came on top of a plate of cubed ranch potatoes and some salsa. It honestly tasted like any breakfast burrito, just more of it to justify the entree-level price. I went all self-indulgent and ordered the Blackened Prime Rib Benny, an Eggs Benedict variation which had little cubes of prime rib (whether it was blackened or even prime rib was quite arguable), sauteed spinach, roasted red bell peppers all chopped over what looked like a slice of Texas toast. Two poached eggs lay on top, and I asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side (see photo). Thank goodness since it was the congealed variety that clogs arteries faster than Drano cleans them out. It was on the meh side with nothing hofbrau-ish about the meat at all.The dish came with the same cubed, packaged-looking potatoes Jamie got, and neither of us had any desire to finish them out. When you order coffee here, you actually get a little pot so they can charge $2.25 for it. Jamie had a glass of milk but it was $2 for just six ounces. Hell, I would have lactated myself for that price. Service was efficient, and even though they have a little egg sign you can flip over to get a waitress' attention, there was no need for it since they seemed interested in turning over tables lightning fast. I'm afraid I will need to second-guess Rachael Ray's judgments on what amounts to good eats on her travels, or else I may be doomed to high-calorie intakes of mediocrity. FOOD - 2.5 stars....just thought the dishes were just too generic despite the abundance...it didn't seem human hands touched those ranch potatoes AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...country kitchen quaint if that's your idea of charming SERVICE - 2.5 stars...efficient if rather impersonal, no need to flip that egg sign over on a busy morning TOTAL - 2 stars....right on the border between 2 and 3 stars, but I need to go with my bulbous, post-benny gut on this oneVegas. Two girls. Hungover. We had a long drive ahead but needed time to collect ourselves. In our dysfunctional state of mind, we decided we wanted brunch.Off to Egg & I we went. The place turned out to be a local favorite. It was fairly packed, but we got seated right away. Extensive breakfast menu. Options! And loved how it was printed on newspaper! Chicken Omelet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=5jiBgyVg3dAhbE4X129pOw): I can't remember its name, but I do remember that it was absolutely tasty! Chicken, cheese, avocado with sour cream on top. Moist chicken. Fluffy omelet. Yum! Ranch Potatoes: Came with omelet. Addicting! Even though they were overly seasoned for my taste buds, I couldn't stop eating them.Banana Nut Muffin (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=6JXT3ryRPelUwv5grDI67A): Came with omelet. Gigantic homemade muffin. Chewy top. Soft inside with bits of banana and nuts. So good!Eggs Florentine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=YvTvI5skrvIBBFC4W7TUVg): I didn't try it. But judging by its looks, I would imagine it to be delicious!Coffee: Great quality coffee. It was unlimited refill and I had the whole carafe to myself. They have their own line of coffee. Huge portions!  We both packed half of our food to go. Great service! Friendly and attentive. And best of all, great prices! 2 breakfast entrees, 1 orange juice, 1 coffee, plus tax and tips all for $30! =DI'm always happy to find a local place in LV to have meals.  Sometimes being on the strip is just too congested and I crave some sense of normalcy... and buffets are just too much food and too expensive.Hence I visited the Egg & I.  And it was closed.  Computers Down. :(When I was finally able to return I looked through my newspaper style menu and was torn between the biscuits and gravy or a omelet.I tried the artichoke omelet and sub'd for some mushrooms.  I love the fetta cheese on top and the fresh tomatoes.  One thing that lacked... I couldn't taste the artichoke... and it could probably use more mushrooms.  It was a great idea however probably would taste better with bacon and mushrooms or ham or something to that effect... Something you can actually taste.  The potatoes were really good, home fries... and more of a fries taste since they had a TON of seasoning on it.  I would prefer less seasoning, and have a bottle to the side if you want more.Servers were very nice, there was a line of people waiting to be seated.  It was a good experience, I think I like Blueberry Hill more, but I wouldn't be opposed to returning here again.My first impression was, "Cute sad and happy egg people everywhere!"The decor of this breakfast house really caught my attention as I first walked in. Eggs are featured on everything from their tableware, to their menu, and their walls. It's too adorable. The menu looks like a real newspaper which is also a nice little touch to the theme of this restaurant. Bright yellow everywhere is a great way to brighten up and start your day in Vegas!We went to Egg & I for brunch and I can say it loud and proud, this is the best American breakfast I have ever had. Hearty, filling, innovative, more than just eggs and waffles. Egg & I has taken breakfast foods to a whole different level. I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine (featured on Rachel Ray) which had  spinach, canadian bacon, two poached eggs on a grilled english muffin, with hollandaise sauce. We also ordered an omelette, Both served with ranch potatoes...by far the best breakfast potatoes on this planet. I forgot the name of the omelette, but I know for sure I'd order the eggs benedict florentine and extra banana nut muffins on the side. The complimentary banana nut muffins are made fresh in house, and they are SO GOOD. The service was just as bubbly and friendly as this restaurant is. If you want to start your day right in Vegas, this is definitely one of your options.The lasting impression? "Love my breakfast, let's get it on country style at Egg & I!"Located "off of the strip" in a plaza, The Egg and I is definitely a local's haven. We only discovered it since our hotel (The Artisan) was nearby and we used our Yelp app to find the closet breakfast place that wasn't a buffet (by day 3 of buffet hopping, I needed major portion control).Even though it was Mother's Day and the line was out the door, this tiny restaurant somehow managed to get everyone seated quickly and keep diners moving through the door. The menu was quite extensive for breakfast with everything from stuffed french toast to eggs benedict to the infamous breakfast burrito. I tried the eggs benedict, which came with ranch potatoes and a huge portion of fruit. The orange juice was the best part though, it tasted like it was just squeezed in the kitchen.Highly recommended if you are staying "off the strip," in Downtown Vegas or if you are on your way out of town!A group of 15 girls arrived here on a HOT Saturday morning. Half of us were hungover, half of us were starving and all of us were in a rush. We had bachelorette duties to attend to in oh about 1.5-2 hours. The place was really busy and didn't seem possible to get a large party seated and fed within our time frame. Surprisingly enough, we got seated in about 20 minutes. We got right down to ordering and in about 20 more minutes, our food was in front of us ready to be devoured. We ordered the Chicken Fried Steak, Eggs Benedict Florentine, Ultimate Skillet, French Toast and of course the Banana Nut Muffin. The portions were huge and the food was tasty. The best part of the brunch was the service. It was very friendly and fast. We got out of there with satisfied tummies and within good time. This place is definitely worth the trip off the strip.Solid breakfast joint!We decided to go off the strip for breakfast this past weekend to save some money. I swear we always spend at least $50 on breakfast when we eat in the hotels. Breakfast at Egg & I was under $30 :)They were busy when we arrived and we waited about 15 minutes to be seated. They put us on the patio, luckily it wasn't too hot yet and there was one table left with shade. It was tolerable.Service was decent but not over the top. They have a system where if you need something you flip over a plastic egg on the table and the waitress will come back. Seems like they never check on you unless you flip the egg.Breakfast was good. I had the eggs benedict with bacon instead of canadian bacon. One of the bacon slices was too fatty and not cooked enough, but the other one was good. The hollandaise was tasty, although a little runny. The potatoes on the side had a nice flavor to them.BF had their daily special, which was Cinnamon Roll French Toast. It was really good, had a custard batter. Too sweet for me, but he enjoyed it a lot. That was also served with a little cup of yummy cinnamon apples. I liked those very much.You pay at the register, which is kind of annoying because that area is already super cramped with people waiting and there isn't really anywhere to stand in line to pay without getting in somebody's way. Overall though, a good breakfast place. If you're willing to drive a couple minutes off the strip to save some cash, I recommend this place!Summary: Every time, and I do mean EVERY TIME I'm in Vegas, I HAVE to stop by Egg & I for breakfast. I mean, I was offered free breakfast at Wicked on my last day there and yet I decline because I MUST go here. The wait at time is long especially on the weekend but if you are willing to be seated in the patio, the wait time is cut in half. I couldn't have ask for a better service from all their staff.Food: Waffle, Scramble Eggs, Omelets, Work Potato, etc etc etcYou just can't go wrong with whatever you pick. Well, you might but I haven't. No matter what you order, make sure you try their work potato, it's like country potato but crunchier with more flavor. Overall: Hate their parking lot, at times we have to park at the end of the plaza and walk over but it is so worth it.Our last place we visited before coming home from Vegas. Thank you YELP for letting me find you. This place was the Bomb.com. I loveddd it!!  This place was super packed however we only had to wait 5 minutes before getting seated. Simple menu on paper but tons of options. I ordered the Chicken Skillet, my husband ordered the chocolate chip pancakes.  Both items were reallyyyy good however the chocolate chip pancakes were total overload, the pancakes were drenched in chocoalte chips and i love chocolate but it was a little too much actually not a little just TOO MUCH for my liking even my teeth starting to hurt because of the sweetness.The prices were really reasonable and food was good and the service was awesome especially for how busy it was all.  You must visit this place! yummmmy!In spite of its obvious chain affiliation, the food is better than average.First, there is the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet.  Just so you know, the CFS has a crispy crust, cut into bite sized pieces and placed on top of their mini crispy potato cubes.  Topped with a good tasting, creamy gravy, this dish is really good.  I had to restrain myself from ripping it away from my son.The Hanks Scramble contains fresh spinach, mushroom, tomato, and cheese.  I don't know where they went wrong, but I have had much better tasting vegetable scrambles.  It was a disappointment mainly because it tasted way to bland. Dumping their house salsa on it redeemed it considerably.Then there were the pancakes and bacon. Decent pancakes, but nothing that stands out.  The bacon was salty but not smoky tasting and rather flaccid.  I like crisp.  Good, not great.The Waffle and Bacon combo was similar, neither the waffle nor the bacon were crispy.I really liked the serve yourself carafe of coffee left at our table. Got it hot.  Got it exactly when we needed it.The service was excellent. Maybe part of that was because they did not need to run around filling coffee cups instead of taking care of more important matters like getting food out of the kitchen fast. Smart.This was ok, but we shall continue to search for the ultimate Mom and Pop places in Vegas.My favorite breakfast joint in Vegas!Thank the Yelp gods for throwing this gem into my search for brunch.  Best part is that it's off strip--meaning that the price is reasonable and not completely inflated and ridonkulous.  It's not too far off strip where it's a drag to get to, but you'll definitely have to drive or take a cab.We've only visited during the week, so we haven't really ever had to wait for a table, but I can imagine that weekends can get pretty hectic.Food for DAYS!  Portion sizes are pretty large + with most breakfast entrees, you'll receive a choice of toast or their incredible banana nut muffin.  If you choose against getting the muffin, you're BSC!  Their muffin is the shyyyyza, plus they currently have a Yelp check in offer for a free muffin!  DOUBLE MUFFIN!  I haven't strayed away from my favorite (chicken fried steak with their perfect potatoes), but their menu is quite extensive, and I'm pretty confident you'll be able to find something that you'll love on there.  But seriously, what's in those potatoes?  You've got me addicted, Egg & I!The servers are attentive and friendly, but the tables also have a small egg sign to get their attention.  It's a yellow, sad egg when you need assistance (so cute).  Every time we've gone, we've never had to utilize this, since their waitstaff are so great.Egg & I will always be on our list for breakfast eats when we're vacationing in Vegas!So I had a craving for steak and eggs and my yelp radar picked this place right up. My steak was tasty and my cheesy eggs were extra cheesy. The potatoes were way beyond delicious and my sourdough was on point. You put up the sad egg and you are quick to get help.I'll be back for sure.If you love a good breakfast, this is the place to try. I have to say first of all Brady our server was awesome! Personable and very professional, I haven't had this kind of service like this in a long time.It was Brekkie Time and I decided to check out the Sahara location,this place is smoking busy even on a weekday.First of all if you're the kind of person like me that can't decide on what to eat,you'll be in trouble, huge breakfast menu! The banana nut muffin is must when eating here, it's that good. I ordered the Cordon Bleu Skillet, which has their tasty seasoned potatoes lining the bottom of dish. It was a deceivingly filling and I was very Happy with my dish.I can see why Egg & I is such a super popular place to eat no matter what time of the day. Excellent attentive friendly service with lots of parking makes this place a great choice.This place has to be related to Egg Works because they are literally exactly the same. From the decor to the menu!It's a Sunday morning so we came into it assuming we would be waiting at least 30+ minutes. Although it was packed we probably only waited between 15-20 minutes. For breakfast on a Sunday morning that's really not bad.We got seated on the patio which is what we wanted at the time but honestly we froze to death. If you're eating breakfast before 11AM sit inside or wear like ten sweaters.We both ordered omelettes. I had the mashed potato Omelette and my friend had the bacon and avocado omelette.Huge, huge portions! And very tasty! I had half of my omelette left over to take home!It's a pricier place to eat breakfast you're probably looking at between 11-15 dollars for breakfast and OJ but it is very much worth it!Review - Egg & IIf I were looking for a reason to move to Las Vegas the Egg & I would be the reason.  Funny thing to say when speaking about a location that has something to offer for everyone and a few of the best dining experiences that money can buy. The Egg & I is simply a great place to enjoy breakfast and that's because it is simple.  Everyone who knows me knows that I love breakfast and can almost always be found at my favorite breakfast place in Corona, CA every Saturday morning without fail.The Egg & I is a place that locals visit and has a lot of regulars.  It's located in a small strip mall that is way off the strip.    The interior is what you would expect in a diner that intended for locals.  It's a large open space with lots of tables and country-ish decorations on the wallsThe menu is consists of many different egg dishes, pancakes, waffles and some incredible looking skillets.  On my first visit I tried the Works Omelet, which as you would expect has a list of ingredients including bacon, sausage, ham, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, mushrooms, cheese and sour cream.  It is served with Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes and a choice of toast or a house made banana nut muffin.    The omelet was cooked to perfection.  It was served hot, light and fluffy. The cacophony of ingredients came together to form the perfect symphony of deliciousness.   My preference for breakfast potatoes is hash browns.  I love them!  The Habla Diablo potatoes were a treat and a nice departure from the hash brown rut I'd been in.  The high point of the meal was however was the banana nut muffin(s).   They serve one almost like an appetizer when sit down before you order.  You get a free one with a Yelp check in.   It told our waitress, Chance (awesome Las Vegas name) how much I liked them and she sent me home with a couple of extra.  Bless her!  I'm not a huge fan of bananas.  In fact I hate everything about them but the banana nut muffins here changed my mind.  It's worth a trip to Egg & I just for muffins.To summarize, great food, fun local ambience, extremely friendly staff.  I'd repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat...

Restaurant name  Thai Basil

Review Text :
The minute I walked in I felt like I was in Thailand.  No wait, I felt like I was in Japan.  No wait, I felt like I was in Vietnam!  If an independent restaurant could steal anything from American corporate restaurants, it is this identity crisis.  Let's get one thing straight; Thai Basil does not serve Thai food.  They serve Asian-styled American food.  However, I feel that Thai Basil, even despite the name, advertises itself as a fusion restaurant above everything else.  Normally I am hard on non-authentic Thai restaurants, but this one really is just an Asian fusion restaurant, thus I will rate it as such.We ordered the 'Thai" iced tea, the Drunken Noodles ($5.95), Panang w/beef ($5.95), the Thai Basil Chicken ($6.95), and a Philadelphia roll just to try.  We also tried the cream cheese wontons, which were a slightly better version of the ones you would get at Pickup Stix, although they were a little bit over cooked.  They came with a non-homemade, sugary sweet and sour sauce that didn't really impress me.  They also offer Pho here, and its probably the only Pho in all of North Las Vegas!  The "Thai" iced tea was the first clue that this wasn't a Thai restaurant.  It was normal brewed coffee over ice with a lot of sugar in it.  I could feel the slight heat from the freshly brewed coffee as the ice cooled it down.  The second hint was that they had soy sauce, but no real Thai chili peppers or fish sauce.  They brought us a thinly ground chili powder, and some sort of chili "flakes" upon our request for Thai chili powder.  The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  The beef Panang was lightly sweet, perhaps a little too sweet for some hardcore curry lovers.  While it was a thick-soupy consistency, it had a definite Indian flavoring to it.  The beef was very tender, although perhaps a little bit fatty.  The Thai Basil Chicken was more of a Chinese dish, with a very light but sweet marinated sauce on it, along with cabbage.  The chicken was well prepared, and very tender.  There was no spice involved in the dish, as one might suspect from a Thai dish.  Probably the worst item that we had was the Drunken Noodles.  The noodles were a flat noodle that you would see in Americanized Chinese restaurants, and the sauce was pretty flavorless.  The noodles were too dry. The Philadelphia roll wasn't bad at all.  I am not an expert on sushi, but it seemed fresh, and they stuffed a lot of salmon and cream cheese in the roll. If this were a purely Thai restaurant, I would give them 2 stars for the Thai food.  However, since this is more of a fusion restaurant, and the food was for the most part acceptable, I am giving a generous 3 stars. The prices are also extremely cheap, although the portions are a little bit on the smaller side compared to other restaurants.  I would consider coming back for the sushi, but definitely not the Thai food.If I had not tried the drunken noodles dish, this place would've gotten 4 stars from me. I've always got the same thing whenever I come to Thai Basil and loved my signature dish. My better half, on the other hand, gets something different every time (pho, the Thai basil dish, a bento box, chow mein, etc.). He's never completely happy with his meals here, so that's another reason for the three star rating. Out of everything he's ordered, he likes the Thai Basil Chicken dish best! THAI BASIL TOFU ($8.59): Love this dish. This is my regular order. You can't go wrong since it's the namesake of the restaurant, right? I like the veggies in the dish and the texture of the tofu. The spiciness level is perfect and the portion is plentiful. I love how the rice comes in a pyramid shape. 4/5 DRUNKEN NOODLES ($8.99): I ordered this dish on my most recent visit. Very bland and I didn't like the way to tofu was cooked. I won't order this again. 2/5SERVICE: The staff is quiet but attentive. 3/5VIBE: I like the feng shui going on in here. The restaurant is cloaked in shades of greens with bamboo accents. Worth a Return Visit?Yes, but only for their lunch specials where I can get a spring roll with my Thai Basil Tofu dish for $7. 95! Go elsewhere for drunken noodles.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #140

5/27/10Service alone deserved 5 stars!  Our server didn't even bat an eyelash when I asked for specifics on dish preparations (though, she did go to the back a couple of times to get the info), and the manager even apologized for the noise coming from the bar area due to NBA basketball finals- he even offered to move us to a quieter section if that was our wish!  We started w/ complimentary edamame, then onto the wonderful calamari http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roys-restaurant-chandler?select=nqSeC4BhUb4SVYbZlctbiw#nqSeC4BhUb4SVYbZlctbiw and continued w/ the Sweet Home Waimanalo salad (loved the creamy herb dressing- so tasty, we would've been happy to order a plate each and call it a night!), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roys-restaurant-chandler?select=roCbXZ4rpCLb104MFuoZOw#roCbXZ4rpCLb104MFuoZOw and finally to Roy's Trio (hibachi salmon, blackened ahi, and misoyaki butterfish).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roys-restaurant-chandler?select=Y2CqA0n2v7LOl7eE2Vz8vA#Y2CqA0n2v7LOl7eE2Vz8vA  For another $4, we enjoyed a serving of macadamia nut-crusted mahi mahi, too.  These beautiful servings of fish offered about three to four bites each of pure bliss!  They came w/ their own sauces: salmon/Japanese citrus ponzu; butterfish/forbidden black rice and sweet ginger wasabi; ahi/spicy soy mustard butter; mahi mahi/lobster butter.  These bites took us through varying complex, lovely, fun aromas and flavors AND textures (from melt-in-your-mouth salmon to steak-like mahi mahi!).  We enjoyed our meal so much, it didn't feel right to order dessert.  Does that make any sense to you?  I hope so, bec. I'm at a loss to explain further!If you haven't tried Roy's, do yourself a favor and make a reservation to visit during Restaurant Week coming up in September!First off, I will NEVER patron Roy's in Chandler ever again!! Please read on to see why...A friend and I went for Aloha hour and it was awesome. Everything on the HH menu is only $5!   We enjoyed everything from the food, drinks, & service, that we decided to come back and try their dinner menu.9/4/2010My friends tried the Hibachi Style Grilled Salmon, they both were quite pleased. Perfect portion size, above average quality but yet still a bit pricey. Nonetheless, the dish was quite satisfying. For my meal I had the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish.  It came with black "forbidden" rice and bok choy.  Each flaky bite was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Excellent choice!This is where it gets ugly...As our average service was about to conclude, the waiter drops our check off. I ask him for another cup of coffee and as he pulls his hand back from delivering the check, he knocks a quarter glass of wine all over my friend and her phone. He proceeds to apologize and cleans a portion of it up, then walks away. He never returns for the coffee I asked for, nor did he offer to refill my friend's $8 glass of wine. I gave him time to reconcile as I saw him pace back and forth but to no avail. I had to chase him down for my refill on coffee. Despite my friend getting wine spilled over her without compensation, our party decided to reflect our displeasure through our tip (~8%) opposed to an open, verbal complaint. However, our waiter wasn't pleased with his gratuity. He came back to the table after he discovered his low tip. YES! He actually had the nerve to return to our table as if he didn't understand why he received a low tip! He spilled wine, which we had paid for, on the customer without compensating for it! What did he expect?? He came back to the table asking if we were displeased with his service. Astonished by his ignorance, we explained to him what we were displeased with. Get this... He didn't think spilling the wine over my friend wasn't a big deal because he thought it was a small amount and that she was finished anyway. Imagine a waiter spilling a paid for glass of wine over you and justifying it because you were almost done anyway. Absolutely ridiculous! Plus, what did he expect from us at that point. Did he expect that we would change our minds and tip him more? The waiter apologized once more and we just got up and left.Our server, THOMAS  the absolute most ungrateful, inappropriate & rude bastard of a server I've ever encountered!! The manager was of no assistance either. Just a note, in the Service Industry, there is no verbal apology that is acceptable. In the Service Industry, the only apology comes in the form of compensation. The manager apologized but asked if we would like to have gift certificates. That's like saying "May I say 'Sorry' to you?" He should've given, not asked to give. Putting the onus on the customer is an insult. We declined since acceptance would paint us as opportunists.Bottom line you expect above the standard level of service when you're shelling out $25-40 per entree.  So even though the food was great, the horrible experience with how we were treated is cause enough to never return to this location.  It's like being slapped in the face but saying it's okay because the food was wonderful...NO THANK YOU!!03/31/11Had planned to partake in Fleming's happy hour (had a giftcard), but came here instead when I saw how busy it was at the bar (and I didn't want to sit outside in the heat).  I knew Roy's had a quasi-HH (free edamame-- what kind of HH is that?), so I had resigned to have Roy's tasty Waimanolo (sp?) salad.  Surprise, surprise!  Roy's now offers four food items (ahi tuna, calamari, Wagyu sliders, and beef skewers!), as well as a few wines by the glass and ALL of its signature cocktails during happy hour for $5 each!  I've tried the skewers before and wasn't too impressed, but I knew the calamari was very good, so I didn't go for that (even though I really wanted to have some).  No, what I had my eye on were the Wagyu beef sliders, w/ caramelized onions and, wait... what else did I read?  Sweet potato fries??  Oh, yeah!  My name was all over this dish!  I also placed an order for chardonnay, but I changed my mind when I saw that I could try another of Roy's signature drinks-- the last ones I'd tried many, many months ago were my espresso martini and a friend's lemon martini I'd sampled.  I was doubly-excited when I spotted Roy's Hawaiian take on the classic sidecar!  This happy hour was going to be FUN!The Fred and Ginger cocktail did NOT disappoint!  It contained Hennessy VS cognac and Domaine du Canton ginger liqueur w/ a candied ginger peel garnish served in a martini glass.  It was beautiful to behold and so very delicious to sip!  'Twas a shame I couldn't finish the whole drink-- had to save some room for the sliders and fries (and the dessert I hadn't even planned on having later on!).  I really liked the sliders-- there were two of them, one on either side of the mini-Chinese takeout box filled w/ seasoned crispy sweet potato fries.  The sliders tasted like Whoppers (back in its heyday in the early 80's) kicked up several notches (LOVED the crispy/chewy pretzel buns!), and the fries were seasoned w/ herbs and even had a bit of cheese drizzle here and there!  I would definitely order the cocktail and app again, and for $5 each, they're a steal!  (I almost did not want to yelp about Roy's happy hour, bec. I wanted to keep this a secret for a little while.)Thinking back, the cocktail and app would've been enough to satisfy me for the rest of the day, but I didn't really want to leave Roy's just yet ( had planned to write a review or two), so I broke down and decided to try the Chocolate souffle ($9.95), Roy's take on the chocolate lava cake, but w/ homemade vanilla bean ice cream and a raspberry coulis.  This item is baked to order, so if you are on a time limit, you should place your order in early, as it takes about 20 minutes to bake.  Was it worth the wait?  Hmm...  I liked the outer edges of the chocolate cake, which had the chewiness of a soft, fresh-baked brownie.  The lava center was definitely gooey and rich, and it tasted like hot brownie batter.  I think I'd have enjoyed the cake and its lava center a lot more if the accompanying vanilla ice cream was of a better quality.  I didn't care for its texture (not creamy enough), nor its flavor (vanilla bean specks were absent and the vanilla essence wasn't strong enough).  This dish cost as much as the app and cocktail combined, and I didn't think it was worth the price.Can't wait to go back here for HH w/ friends!This has forever and a day been my favorite Restaurant, my daughters as well.So when I asked her where she wanted to go for her Birthday , this is where she choose. Now we had not been to this location ever. Just some of the others around the Country and Hawaii.Plus it had been well over a year since we had even visited Roy's, but they were the shiny star of my memories. Every thing you could ever want in a Seafood Restaurant.When I made the reservation they asked if it was a special occasion, I told them it was Rachel's B day. When we arrived they told her Happy Birthday and gave us special menus on the inside it said Happy Birthday Rachel and the date. Wow, I thought that was pretty amazing.Our server was an amazing girl that thought of every thing. The manager even came over to wish my daughter a Happy Birthday.All the drinks were usurper! The food was truly amazing!! We had the Canoe for two for starters, even though there were 3 of us, there was more than enough. Plus, Mario got a salad which he said was delish!We had the Butterfish , the Mahi Mahi , and the Old School combo,which was 4 fish dishes on one large dish.Mario had that one. Every thing was perfect, I mean everything. For dessert we had the Chocolate Souffle and they even treated the Birthday girl to a wonderful Creme Burle, with fresh fruit and chocolate cake. They even put Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce on her dessert plate.Yes it is expensive but, at least you are getting what you pay for . Great service and Great food.First and foremost service in this restaurant is amazing.  I opted to sit at the bar and the bartender, Matt, was excellent.  He provided a really good run down of the menu and zeroed in on great recommendations given my appetite.  I chose the weekday prix fixe ... Which was a ton of food for a really good price.  For the price of any entree you get a three course meal.  The shrimp dumpling appetizer was okay, not great but tasty.  The alternative "surf n turf" with prawns and pork loin was bleeping deliciousness in my mouth.  The plate was beautiful and everything (absent the cold tomato side) had a purpose on the plate.  I would come back again and again just for that dish.  I was so full I had to grab the dessert to go... It made a spectacular breakfast ;)

Review Text :
I just got a hankering for a Vegas trip again, which reminded me that I never reviewed Triple 7. How can that be? Oh yeah, it's probably because I had a few too many of those amazing microbrews and had a slight lapse in memory. I had some Vegas pals always telling me that this was THE place to go for cheap dinner and amazing beer, and I always would reply, "Don't bother me. I'm playing blackjack." Well, one day the blackjack dollars ran out a bit too quickly, so off to Triple 7 we went. And we were pretty famished (and sober) when we arrived, so we went to town on that menu...Meatball sliders, garlic fries, nachos grande, Prime Rib ($10!!), and, of course the microbrew sampler - you get five 5oz pours for $5. Can't beat that!When the food starting arriving all six of us got a look of dread in our eyes, thinking, "Dear lord, what have we done?" If Vegas is about excess, than we sure as hell were doing something right, because this was a MASSIVE amount of food...and mostly pretty damn cheap and amazingly tasty too. The beer? Ah, the beer. It's so good when it hits your lips. It really is. The Porter was my fave, but the night we went there was also a brewmaster's special that had upwards of 9% abv...I think that was the one that really did me in. We left that place full, tipsy, and more than satisfied. Can't wait to do it again.Had a working lunch meeting here last week.  I had my favorite dish, the Chicken Philly Sandwich w/Salsa Ranch on the side and Fries.  It was as good as the last time I was here.  We arrived when they opened at 11 am to beat the lunch rush and to have some quiet time to meet.  Everything worked out perfect and ran into a few old friends while I was there.Will I return?  You bet.The Triple 7 Restaurant & Microbrewery was conveniently located inside my hotel, the Main Street Station Hotel. I came three times in five days. To the restaurant. Not in my hotel room. Please get your mind out of the gutter.My 11 day work trip to Las Vegas lead me from The Strip to Old Las Vegas. It's definitely not a place to be "seen in the scene." But "Old Vegas" has to be experienced. It's full of charm, character, and characters. Seriously, the sun goes down and the weirdos come out to play. It's freaking awesome.Anyway, this place provides good service, good food, and good service at great prices. What's not to like about that?The menu has a variety of dishes and house brews. There is something on the menu for everyone. And it's all super cheap. My meals consisted of the fish and chips, fish tacos, and a bacon cheeseburger. It was good, good, and super good.Speaking of good, the service was as well. The servers were helpful, patient, and never screwed up an order, even if we had a party of 8 or more. Nice.Anyway, if you are off The Strip and exploring Old Vegas, this is an inexpensive dinner option. And the variety of beer will keep the drinks flowing and the party going.Viva Las Vegas.I feel like i always end up here, although i've only been here twice. It's inside the Main Street Casino in downtown. Its nice cuz they have a pretty large menu, lots of sports TV, beer and not too crowded. Their cheesy Garlic bread is super yummy.I had their chicken and avocado sandwich with sweet potato fries. They give you huge portions!This place is awesome. A locals favorite for years. I get a half pound hot dog with chili, onions, and cheese that comes with fries and it hits the spot every time. Pizza here is really good too. The place gets packed even tho they have plenty of seating but don't let the large crowd keep you from stopping in because they seat people quickly. If you are a beer drinker then you will love this place. Cheap, yummy food and good times.Triple 7 Microbrewery serves its purpose in DTLV.I stopped in while in the area for a power lunch with a coworker that lives in the area before my return to OC last week and although the old school kitchy Vegas look was welcoming, the food was rather underwhelming. The menu is expansive and I think that the kitchen is running by the "Jack of all trades, master of none" mantra. I decided the San Fransisco Burger was the safest bet after some considerable consideration. A Beef Patty is Charbroiled and then mated with Swiss, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Lettuce, a house sauce and toasted Sourdough. They nailed the temperature and all of the ingredients were of good if not great quality. With that said, it was a little boring if not an all out yawn. A mediocre burger in a fun environment nets a 3 star review all day, everyday.Review #777    Yelp Review 777 only appears once in a Yelper's life. I couldn't think of a luckier  place to write about for the landmark Yelp review 777 than 777 Microbrewery and Restaurant in the downtown Las Vegas.   Where Yelp review #777 appears once in my lifetime, the Triple 7 Microbrewery appears often. The surface parking lot at Main Street Station is my parking place of choice when I visit the Fremont Street Experience. The deal is that you have to buy $5 worth of food or drinks to validate the $5 to use the parking lot. Usually I make a beeline to the Triple 7 for a lucky cold one or two before a night on Fremont Street. The problem is that the beer is so inexpensive causing me to buy two to cover the validation. For example, currently draft beer is $2 during football. That was the case yesterday when I drank a large draft strawberry beer that came out to  $2.16 after tax.    Triple 7 is an upbeat spot to enjoy a couple of Lucky cold ones. The atmosphere is rock & roll music, professional sports, bar talk, and the 1800s railroad station motif that permeates Main Street Station. Yesterday I'd take in U2's "With or Without You" between glances of a soccer and baseball game. Triple 7 is a cavernous bar and restaurant with high ceilings bordered by two large bars and a microbrewery. The large space in between is filled with tables. From past experience, the bar on the right is the quiet bar that is frequently closed where the bar on the left is the party bar. Regardless of where you sit, a lucky strawberry or any microbrewery beer tastes good.   Yesterday, I took my Triple 7 experience to the next level by returning for dinner. Besides being a microbrewery, it is the unofficial cafe of Main Street Station unless you count the cafe in its sister property The California. After spending time in the Fremont Street Experience, I returned for dinner. Let me say that I was impressed. I ordered the meatloaf which included a vegetable of choice and mixed vegetables for $8.99. My choice of vegetable of the day was a baked potato. I added soup of the day for an additional  $1.99. Complimenting the food, I passed over a beer for Pepsi. The chicken gumbo soup with saltine crackers was of the same high quality as their beer. But the meatloaf was the bomb. The quality and quantity satisfied my expectations. The tasty mushroom gravy with genuine mushrooms brought the meatloaf to a level that exceeded my expectations for a microbrewery restaurant. The baked potato that included butter and Land O Lakes sour cream was  mutant. I don't recall eating a baked potato this large. Ultimately the soda glass was huge. All this came out to around $15.25.    Throughout dinner, the waitress was attentive and friendly. Additionally she did not make the error of serving the soup too close to the entree or rush me.  When I drink a cold one in Triple 7, it is "Cheers " to good luck. In conclusion Review 777 is an Internet toast "to good luck and good times."

Restaurant name  Popeyes

Review Text :
This is one of the better Popeyes restaurants in this part of town. It is a full service location and not part of a stinky gas station or quickie store. The inside is decorated with jars of chili peppers and other fun ingredients and there is a bigger seating area than some of the others stores. Usually stop in here when I'm in the area picking up some industrial parts for the shop. It is close to several vendors and a quick and easy meal when my stomach is growling for some Cajun yummies.Normally order something off the Spicy side of the menu and get several Jalapenos to wash things down. The dark meat is a treat and I like to get a bunch of thighs and avoid the less juicy white meat. Must say that the Red Beans and Rice are also a favorite and like to save them for dessert.Service is always super friendly and you will see some of the same people working here over the years. The orders come out pretty quick and the food is consistently very tasty.Watch out for the bus load of school kids that walk over during their lunch break. The place can get really busy and the wait times can take longer than usual. Whatever happened to the lame brown bag lunches that we were forced to eat back in the days? See ya there next time and remember Tuesday they have their 2pc chicken special for super cheap. AYEE!3.75 STARS

I hate to give my peeps 2 stars, but this cafe just didn't deliver.Enter your typical strip mall, into a very small store with a few tables along the walls and a counter.  Loud Vietnamese patrons sat around "playing cards" (it's a euphemism), smoking and  talking loudly.  You know you're in a relatively growing, but new Vietnamese neighborhood when there are a lot of "card houses" in the area.  The kind of place you walk into and they're a little surprised you want to order food.  I don't think they speak much English and looked at me and my Caucasian husband as if we might be lost.  FYI, we tried the Banh Mi Cafe up the road, but they don't serve banh mi anymore and this was an even more awkward entrance than where we ended up - strange goings ons that I don't want to know about.We ordered the white ham sandwich and an iced coffee to go.  The coffee was good (as it is at most, ahem, card houses), but skimpy.  It filled only half my cup.As for the sandwiches, they use traditional Vietnamese bread, not the long french Vietnamese baguettes, which is fine, except mine was pretty stale and chewy, as only a stale Vietnamese baguette can be.  The meat, veggies, peppers, cilantro etc. were all pretty good.  If only they baked their bread fresh, in house.  Your best bet is Le's Sandwiches.  It's a little out of the way for me, but worth the drive.

Review Text :
Best high-end restaurant on the westside? It might be a toss up between Marche Bacchus and Vintner Grill. Thanks to some much needed vacation time between Christmas and New Years I had the pleasure of dining here for lunch on a weekday.The place is hidden in an office park and doesn't look like much from the outside. But, as soon as you step in you'll feel like you've been transported to the some posh, elegant, urban metropolis. With its white couches and ceiling there's a airiness about the place despite little natural lighting. Black and green accents throughout the comfy interior add a modern touch. Of course you'll be reminded that you're still in Vegas when you see the video poker machines along the bar.Lunch was excellent. There's a good selection of wines by the glass and the strawberry caipirinha shouldn't be missed. I'm a sucker for carbs and the bread basket they brought out didn't stand a chance. Among the selection was a brioche, pretzel bread, cranberry bread, and one with jalapeños. They were accompanied by an olive tapenade.Following the bread basket was a cheese and meat platter ($25) with prosciutto, salami, a house-made camembert, goat gouda, Saint Andre triple creme cow's milk cheese. The triple creme was the standout among the cheeses. The salami had an almost jerky-like texture which I didn't care for. Their selection is an interesting mix of familiar and not so familiar items, some of which are house-made and seasonal. Your best bet is to tell the waiter your preferences and let him choose for you.Their appetizers, flatbreads and some entrees are available as half orders, which is convenient if you want to try many things. We tried a half order of the pan seared crab cake ($8) with tarragon cream, roasted peppers and mache. The plating with the single crab cake sitting atop the cream sauce was beautiful and the flavors were equally as good. If you don't expect a Maryland style crab cake with jumbo lump meat (which this is not) you may be impressed.My wife had a half order of the spicy chicken sausage flatbread ($7) with romesco sauce, leek confit, marjoram and truffled ricotta. A half order came as 4 slices. The crust was more chewy than crispy, but still tasty and generously topped with quality ingredients.My dish was amazing -- the braised lamb bolognese ($11) with black pepper tagliatelli, truffled ricotta and fresh grated nutmeg. It wasn't the most visually appealing dish to look at, but it didn't last long enough for me to take a second look. Wonderful flavors with tender and savory chunks of lamb and fresh pasta. The dish is reason enough for a return visit.Service was solid but a little stiff -- probably because they're used to serving dudes in suits most lunch shifts. No matter, I'd be glad to come back for dinner or have some small bites out on their patio when the weather warms up.4.5 StarsSo here are the facts, keep in mind my reservation was set a week in advance for my 1 year anniversary, it took 30 minutes to merely get sat, 30 more minutes to get my first cocktail and starter, and then another 45 minutes after that to get my entree. All the while the large groups of 5 or more are getting sat instantly, served in minutes and catered to. We were ignored and put on the back burner because there were only 2 of us and are a younger couple.   I'm tired of going to a restaurant held in high regard and when we get treated like crap we get to hear excuses like, "well, your table is saved the group before you is just hanging out though and we are double booked tonight". (Snobby hostess that needs a reprimand for her terrible people skills and attitude.) Or, "I'm sorry that everything is taking so long, we are just backed up and I'm not too sure why" (Waiter trying hard to cover up for managers neglecting their patrons.) This is an acclaimed restaurant but can't keep on top of their shit on a Saturday in December? Is that a joke?  My experience was completely unacceptable and I will never ever suggest anyone to go here simply based on principle.   Thanks for ruining my anniversary.First heard of Vintner Grill during my real estate group's cocktail party launch of Diamond Cake magazine. Finally made it around to having dinner here last Saturday. It is tucked away in an office complex off Charleston. The entry is unassuming and easy to miss.The decor is upscale chic modern. We were seated right away as we made reservations from Open Table off Yelp.The clientele that night seemed to be predominantly retiree age with a few scattered specks of youth. Our observation was that most of the women in there looked miserable. (You can marry for money but it doesn't buy happiness). You must come dressed up here or feel dramatically out of place amidst the money crowd. Luckily we came prepared.It took a while for someone to finally come over to bring us a menu and take drink orders. The cocktail menu consisted of old timer favorites with modern ingredients. For such a fancy place, they could have utilized a classier menu holder, rather than a plain clipboard.The selections seemed standard when comparing to previous posts of the menu with some slight changes. One of our favorite things was the butter dish with wells of infused olive oil...a welcomed forbidden treat after a week of "clean eating". The bread selection was very nice as well...get the brioche and try the cranberry bacon loaf. We each ordered the butter lettuce salad with warm Brie. The salad was a little difficult to eat because of large leaves but the encrusted Brie was good.I ordered the Mediterranean sea bass with haricot vert (French baby green beans), potatoes and chopped olives. The fish was fresh and light just like a sea bass should be, the veges were a nice accompaniment and retained their crispness. My wife ordered the veal scallopini with angel hair pasta. I tried some and it was delicious. Lean, thin veal cutlets in a wonderful marsala sauce. I would order that the next time. The wine was a Malbec that was smooth and light. They bring the bottle to the table to pour. The waiter seemed a bit too touchy feely for our comfort but not too creepy lol. Service was slow at some points. The prices are Strip prices without the Strip feel. As a local, I would rather spend my money on a restaurant on the Strip next time for the same quality of food with a little better service and much better ambiance.Shame on me for not eating here sooner! Vintner Grill is in a business complex and can be easy to miss, but you will not want to. I was surprised upon entering VG, it had  a modern beach feel to it. The patio chairs were very roomy, comfortable and had pillows. If eating inside isn't your thing they have cabanas outside, but only a couple so if you want to make sure and get one it would be best to make a reservation. If cheese & wine are your thing then VG is the place for you! They have a selection of over 400 wines from different countries. They also offer 30 different beers from around the world. When it comes to the cheese, the menu says VG has one of the largest selections of cheese in Las Vegas! They also have a nice selection of house cured meats. If you are interested in buying their cheese online instead of at the restaurant you can go to the following website http://vgcheese.3dcartstores.com/ to place your order.Out server checked on us often and was very nice. A man came around with a bread tray and offered us a complimentary variety of breads and left some butter and oil on the table. The bread was delicious, but it would be easy to fill up on this stuff so I just had a few bites. After looking over the menu it was hard to decide since so many things sounded tasty. I chose the "Classic Cobb W/Grilled Beef Tenderloin Salad" that had a bacon-blue cheese vinaigrette. This salad priced at $14 and had green onion, hard boiled eggs, hearty blue cheese crumbles, fresh greens and of course the beef tenderloin. The vinaigrette was so good! The beef was cooked perfect, tender and flavorful.  I couldn't stop eating this salad it was just so good. All of the flavors meshed well together and I will happily order it again! I was having lunch with a friend who ordered the "Grilled Lemon-Marjoram Chicken Salad" also priced at $14 and she enjoyed it. Vintner Grill is the perfect place to have lunch with a friend, date night with that special someone, or celebrate an occasion with family and friends. VG has a private party space and also offers catering.I'm not sure why it took me years to try Vintner Grill but I'm glad I finally did. I've been back a couple times since for dinners, and drinks and appetizers, and each time was a unique and a great experience. During warmer days and evenings, I highly suggest sitting outside because they have a beautiful patio. Some of the sitting areas are close to the fire pit, while others are more secluded and would provide some privacy if that's what you are looking for. The inside of the restaurant is also really elegant and nice. It reminds me of an upscale restaurant in Miami because of the predominately white furnishings. Food here is fresh and made with care. The standouts I can recall are: -The bread and butter for the table is amazing. -Cheese and cured meat platter - You choose from a list of meats and cheeses, including their in-house homemade cheeses (if available), and they serve it with dried fruits and jams. -Lamb ribs appetizer is delicious quite a large portion for an appetizer.-Octopus - Perfectly grilled and seasoned as a salad. -Pork Belly - who doesn't like thick cut bacon?-Beets with Lavender Goat Cheese - Love floral in food! I would certainly come back anytime for a glass of wine and appetizers with good friends.I thought for some time before assigning a five-star rating to this one. And after my extensive contemplation, I am confident in saying that this was a five-star experience. If the criteria for five stars is "as good as it gets" then I'd say without reservation that Vintner Grill is as good as Vegas gets. Here's the breakdownAMBIANCE: 5FOOD TASTE/QUALITY: 5FOOD CREATIVITY: 4SERVICE: 4.5Overall, what I like about Vintner Grill was that it delivered on providing an experience. And there are are not many places in this town (off-strip) that even attempt to do that. The overall aesthetic is a modern take on a light Art Deco/1930s decor. Everything from the black and white checkered floor to the white and pastel green color scheme worked to set a mood from the moment you walk in. If you're reading other reviews, you already know the restaurant is located inside a business center--and it's that very juxtaposition between the bland stucco sameness of the business center and soft, light and glossy interior of the restaurant that left me feeling transported. The contrast of the business center location totally works in Vintner Grill's favor by creating an immediate expectation of luxury and quality. And Vintner delivers on both fronts.Our party ordered and shared:Two of their signature cocktailsCheese and meat platterLamb bologneseNY stripHalibut on couscous and orzoWhite bean hummusTiramisuCarmel upside down cakeTurkish coffee cheesecakeWe were thoroughly pleased with all but one dish-and even that dish (cheesecake)  was fine. The dishes were not overly creative and clever, but they were all seasoned well,  made with high quality ingredients, and prepared with skill.  The food was delicious. The seafood was fresh and buttery while the steaks were tender and cooked perfectly. This was one of the two best NY strip steaks I've had in this town. The bolognese was heavy and the truffle oil threatened to over power the flavor of the sauce, but the richness of the lamb and sauce made for a dish that most people at our table called the best of the night.The service was considered, the food was delicious, and the decor / atmosphere was luxurious.  I will definitely return to Vintner Grill.One of my favorite places in town!The setting is very sexy in the best of ways. If it's your first date take her here because she'll appreciate your style, and if you're looking for a special spot with someone you've known for a long time, she'll love it & it should guarantee a fun evening. It's all white with black & silver touches and yes it's trendy but bottom line the food is great & the service is usually perfect. It's the perfect balance between feminine & masculine touches. I've been here many times & the only complaint I have is that sometimes the service can lack (when there's large parties). This has happened to us several times. What's great about the service here is that usually the waiter knows things are backed up & that's when a complimentary starter or dessert will pop up. It's always appreciated. Let's get to the food. I've tried nearly everything & I love it, especially my mans NY strip that comes with crispy potatoes (crispy perfection) and balsamic reduction drizzled over everything. Hands down one of the best items on the menu. The portion is massive so ladies just have a few bites from your partner. I typically order the scallops which always change a little depending on what is in season (it's always delicious). And we never skip starting with the cheese. They have a wide selection and it always comes with a side of jam (this one happened to be apple cinnamon) amazing! Don't skip the cheese...There's also a beautiful outdoor space that you should take advantage of when the evening weather is nice. It feels like you're in another world and its the perfect sunset dining moment. If you haven't been here yet it's an absolute must. Make a reservation because evenings are always busy here.This is a great place for people watching, especially if you want to grab a few cocktails and play spot the cougar on a prowl. The ambiance and decor are very old school Vegas and the vibe is very Mad Men-esque. The design is simple with a gorgeous patio for outdoor dining and interior that boasts secluded booths with TVs playing old black and white motion pictures.We arrived on a Thursday night assuming it would be pretty mellow. WRONG. It was some company's appreciation party so the place was pretty packed. We were able to snag a table without having reservations. I would strongly recommend reservations just to be on the safe side. We were seated and shortly after the server came by and took our drink order. We started off with a bottle of Fiji and I had their G&T and my husband one of their martinis. The cocktail prices range from $10-$15, but are masterfully prepared.We started off with a 3 cheese plate and went solely based on our server's recommendations. We opted for a soft cheese, blue cheese, and a firm cheese selection. All of them were phenomenal. There is also a 5 cheese selection option for $25 if you'd like to sample more. The 3 cheese selection was plenty for the two of us to share. The platter is accompanied by warm brioche along with raisins and marmalade. I chose their roasted pepper with crab soup as my starter dish. The flavor was extremely unique, but once my taste buds adjusted I thought it was wonderful. It was creamy, rich, and had a generous portion of crab.I opted for the lamb bolognese as my entree, husband went with the Mediterranean Sea Bass with heirloom potatoes. I appreciated the bolognese, but found the flavor to be a little too rich for my personal taste. The lamb and ricotta combination just made it overpowering and quickly filled me up. The sea bass was perfectly cooked. It was flaky and flavorful. The service was to the point, offering some great suggestions. Initially i thought the server appeared aloof, but I think he was just swamped. He was happy to help with our cheese selections, and our water was constantly refilled. Their pacing and scheduling was on point.I'd like to come back here for lunch and try the cobb salad that my husband keeps raving about.  Overall, I think this is a great date spot that's sure to impress.Dine among sexy and the sexy cougars.  Off strip in the Summerlin, you won't see it from the main streets, just off Charleston & everyone's favorite to say street, Hualapai ("Wall-a-pie").  You'll be surprised how they've sandwiched a fine dining place within a corporate plaza and offices.The food and service is top notch.  I've been a handful of times, catching happy hour to dining first class all-the-while mainly with Summerlin locals.  White leather, browns, greens, chandeliers sets the ambiance ablaze.  Plus, their is a blaze of fire with outdoor firepits in luxurious outdoor patio seating.Recommended============1.  Roasted Beet salad with lavender goat cheese, mango, hazelnuts and mustard vinaigrette dressing (5.0 stars, $10)2.  Italian Sausage Flatbread with burrata cheese, roasted peppers, pesto sauce ($12, 4.5 stars)3.  Wild Mushroom Risotto with preserved lemon, pepper, and shaved pecorino ($24, 4.5 stars)4.  Braised Lamb Osso Bucco with couscous, shallots, and swiss chard ($32, 4.5 stars)Conclusion=========With service always pro, food great, this is a great off-strip place to save a few dollars without skimping on experience.  Shhhh...hidden secret.  Parking Tip: you can valet, or park a ten spots over and not have a problem in the lot.

Restaurant name  Zaw's Asian Foods
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Best Asian food in the city!!!! Though there are a few (and very minor) drawbacks: Must pay cash, place is old and a bit dirty on the customer end,  this food is fabulous! Fresh chicken, beef, shrimp, pork and veggies (also tofu dishes as well). Forget about that hammered-thin chicken filled with MSG you see so often in Asian fast-food restaurants. You can see them prepare every morsel of your food; 100% fresh! Zaw's is as fresh as it gets. Like spice? Get it as hot as you want (if you ask for spicy, it's gonna be SPICY). I have tried many of the items on the menu and found about 5 that I rotate every time I order. Trust me!!!! I have been eating there for over 12 years. once you find your dish, you will be craving it at 6 in the morning. Once Sonny, one of the owners, learns your name and the dishes you enjoy, He will recognize your voice on the phone and know your order before you can make it. The three staff: husband, wife and brother are loving, personable people who deliver great food for an unbelievable price. Recommendations:1) Order by phone. When Sonny says it will be 45 minutes, it will probably be close to an hour and 15 minutes if you want to just run in and pick up your food. If you go "on time" you will wait as the make your food fresh right in front of you. Don't worry! Your food is given to you hot and fresh; don't get discouraged as other customers come in and get their food before you. It is ALWAYS busy, but these customers have waited at home for at least an hour and 15 minutes... worth the wait.2) Try it more than once and try several dishes. This IS NOT you average Asian food take out. It may take 2-3 times to find what you like, but...worth the wait.3) If you enjoy a bit of spice DO NOT ask for extra spice. The food is a tiny bit spicy in all the dishes I've tried (about 20 different dishes). To add spice it to get it SPICY (which I love). 4) Do not concern yourself with the restaurant itself. It is old and a bit dirty, but once you eat the food and meet Sonny and the other staff, you will know that the food prep and kitchen is well up to standards. There is a reason it is take out only and so popular, not just with people who enjoy a hole-in-the -wall food place, but all walks of Pittsburgh people who enjoy great food.5) Be a regular customer. Sonny and his family make you feel like you are the only customer that matters at Zaw's, but here is a secret: he does it to every single return customer (and there are a lot of them). Feel free to adjust your meal to suit your needs. My wife asks for all-white meat chicken in the General T-so's Chicken (know it's not spelled correctly, but this is not your average meal) and I get extra onions in my Pork Lo Mein .Try it a few times, find what you like and I promise you you will not be able to live without Zaw's Asian food.P.S. I had it last night!

I was craving hummus for lunch. I was shopping at the mall and wanted something close...Big Fat it is. We sat down and ordered our water and tea. My dining partner wanted to see a wine list, so the waitress brought it over. Then she decided not to return for 15-20 min! We asked to taste two different wines, the waitress brought them over and my friend decided on one. Well, the waitress then took away the tasting glass, still half-full?! This chick was in a zone. We ordered the chicken soulvaki and the hummus trio. The hummus was really bad. It was gritty and flavorless. The chicken was so dry that my friend actually chocked on it!!! While trying to swallow our lunch we noticed that the bus boy would leave the side dishes on tables if they looked clean, for the next guests to eat off of, eeewww!! There we no towels in the bathroom when we got there, so I told the waitress. I went back to the bathroom about an hour later and still no towels?? I told the "manager" who was just as useless. My iced tea sat empty for quite awhile until I flagged down our space-cadet waitress. I used to come here and sit on the patio with my dog....never again...

This update is long overdue.  Was here for dinner last night with The Better Half (TBH) and four friends.  We were pleased to see many of the same familiar faces working there. We were greeted like old family members coming home for the holidays.We started out with a bottle of Chianti before we ordered dinner.  We had all night and was enjoying the company, so our waiter ran down the Specials list and then gave us time to decide.  I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer ($9) and special ordered a Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Sauce ($14.95)...not on the current menu, was on the old menu from a few years ago, but it's our favorite and they have no problem whipping it up.  TBH ordered the Escargot ($8.95) and the Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Sauce ($14.95).The Portobello Mushroom appetizer was excellent....the Mushroom was juicy and the Sauce that came with it complimented the dish well....it was a Tomato based Sauce that didn't overpower the dish.  It's a nice sized portion that can easily satisfy two people or four people with a light appetite.The Gnocchi of course was perfect....which is why it's our favorite dish here.  The Gorgonzola Sauce was rich & creamy, but not too heavy.  The texture of the Gnocchi was just right....not too soft, which is a common mistake that many restaurants make.For Dessert, I shared a Tiramisu ($6) with TBH and I had some Coffee....which is why I'm writing this review early in the AM.  The Tiramisu was very good......light and fluffy, just how we like it.The service is awesome.  The server remembered us, even though it's been over 7 months since our last visit....made us feel special.  One thing about this place is that they are always willing to please their guests.  Two of our friends had special order dishes that they were more than willing to accommodate.  This was in addition to our Gnocchi order....which the server remembered how we like it and didn't ask for much direction on the order.Will I return?  There's no doubt about it.I had been so excited to try this place based on all the great reviews from fellow Yelpers. When the Groupon popped up, we snatched it up. I really wanted to love this place. I have to admit, I was a little (er, a lot) disappointed. We ordered the Prosciutto di Parma e Burrata appetizer to start. This was the highlight of the meal. The dish was good. I ordered the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese. It wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped. I wasn't a big fan of meat sauce. Just a little on the bland side. My fella ordered the Petto di Pollo ai Funghi e Cipolline Borettane all'Agro and felt the same about his dish being a bit bland. My mom got the Lasagnette al Forno, which was probably the best of the three entrees we ordered. The food just felt underseasoned, which is odd for Italian food.As another Yelper noted, the decor is a bit dated and I felt the food prices were on the expensive side for what you get.The service was fantastic. Everyone at this restaurant was so welcoming and friendly. Attentive was the word of the day here. Even as someone who prefers a little anonymity in a restaurant I felt their attention was welcomed.The service definitely outshone the food here, unfortunately.

I am in limbo about Gilley's. I love country music, I enjoy people watching, I tend to not care where I go after enough drinks, and so Gilley's would seem like a perfect place for this. I might not have had enough drinks in me to prepare me for the sensory overload, but I just felt out of place. The drinks are definitely Strip price. The cocktail waitresses, clad in bikinis and chaps, make their way around the floor rather often. One of the aspects that turned me off the most was that I signaled to be cut off when my friends were ordering drinks and the girl ignored me and brought me a drink anyways. I was planning on leaving soon and wanted to sober up, but the sale was more important than my wish. This has happened a few times on the Strip and that is a main deterrent  as to why I avoid  touristy attractions.Been here a few times for parties while in Vegas. While I can say I'm a huge fan of the uniforms and beer prices, watch yourself on the liquor. Prices are night club high!WHEN YOU GO- Go for the beer, country music, mechanical bull and the servers. Don't go for the authentic BBQ, the real sh*tkicker bar ambience or real cowboy/cowgirls. This is Vegas. This is also the Treasure Island Hotel-Casino. This ain't the real Gilley's.Lower your countrified expectations just a little, have some beers and enjoy the views.

Review Text :
This place has an AYCE menu now. I only started coming here after seeing the big sign outside the window. This menu must be fairly new because I've never heard about it before and it was the reason why I decided to finally check out this place.The AYCE menu is great with lots of quality appetizers, rolls, sashimi, to name a few. I noticed they had a lot of non-seafood items on there in case someone in your party is not really the sushi type. Here are a few items worth trying:Poke salad- deliciously served on some seaweed salad and a lil on the spicy side. Not too spicy but had a nice kick.Beef ribs- if you like Korean spareribs, you'll love these. One order per person, understandably so cuz they'd probably lose out if they served unlimited amounts of these.Snow white roll-shrimp tempura inside topped with yummy whitefish sitting on top of a tart and tangy sauce. Might have been ponzu, now that I think of it.Dynamite-the usual baked scallops in mayo but their version had big chucks of mushrooms and was covered in cheddar cheese. Very tasty!I can't remember not liking anything I ordered. Kaizen is def taking place over Sushi Tachi as my AYCE sushi spot in North Town. My only gripe is they don't offer half-rolls like Sushi Tachi. This sucks for me because I dine alone very frequently and this place makes it hard for me to try a lot of different things. If they offered half rolls i can try several different ones without risk of being scolded for not finishing or have to pay for the leftovers. Which I came close to doing the very first time.I used to come here all the time way back when they first opened and did not offer AYCE. I've never seen this place get busy so, there's usually just 1 or 2 servers working. On my last visit, the server didn't even bother introducing herself - ok, fine. But what aggravated me was that she tried ignoring me every time I want to order more food. She was quick grabbing my empty plates and before I could even open my mouth to place another order, she's already gone - seriously?The food here is pretty good. I tried some of their rolls, skewers and some nigiri from their AYCE menu. But with the poor and slow service, I was falling asleep while I was eating.Bacon Scallop Asparagus Skewer:1 skewer per order. The scallop is so little and the asparagus has seen better days but it's AYCE so, not a shocker. 4/5Chicken Katsu Roll:I was craving for some chicken katsu but they didn't have it on the menu - ordering this roll was my only hope of eating chicken katsu. It has imitation crab, chicken katsu, cucumber and avocado with eel sauce. 3/5Salmon Killer:Spicy salmon and cucumber inside, and salmon and jalapeno on top with ponzu, spicy mayo and hot sauce. It's not as spicy as it sounds. 4/5Drum Roll:Chopped deep-fried salmon crab mix and cucumber inside, and salmon on top with garlic ponzu sauce. 3.5/5Sunrise Roll:Spicy tuna inside, and salmon and green onion on top with ponzu sauce. 4/5Salmon Nigiri:The fish was pretty fresh and served at the right temperature. The cuts were decent. 3.5/5This is definitely not one of Vegas' best sushi restaurants but if you're in the area and you're desperate then. this place will do. AYCE is $22 at lunch time (11:30am-4pm) and $27 at dinner time (4pm-10:30pm), half rolls available, items in red are not part of AYCE, and they charge for leftovers.

Review Text :
My oldest daughter took her mom and sister out for a belated Mother's Day lunch to On the Border on Bell Rd. I stayed at home and waited for any left overs. When they returned, they gave me a bag that was quite heavy and I thought they felt bad for me so they purchased an entire entree for me. Wrong...It was their left over entree's. I was hungry so I opened the bag and sadly discovered about 7 lbs. of what tasted like canned refried beans and partially eaten enchiladas and burritos. None of it was flavorful cold so I reheated it in the microwave and there was absolutely no improvement in flavor so I tossed it. Sounded like a brick when it landed! YUK!!! Save the trip and go to Fry's and get some $.99 Banquet T.V. dinners. I felt really bad for all of them especially on this special occasion! Oh well, at least I know where NOT to go if they take me out for Father's day lunch. I hope my daughter isn't angry at me for writing this but I wanted to give you Yelpers a heads up! They should rename the restaurant  "Borderline Mexican Cantina" Ha Ha

Review Text :
The food was OK.    Buffet style. What really left a bad taste in my mouth wasa.) Having my complete credit card number left on the receiptb.) Getting hit with a $100 phone call charge to my credit card.  When I called my bank to investigate, it turns out somebody had charged a $100 phone call from London to INDIA on my credit card.  c.) It turns out it was somebody from this restaurant.  Stay away from this shady place.  There are plenty of other honest Indian food businesses in the metro Phoenix area.I have had Udupi bookmarked for about three months and I cannot believe it took me this long to make it over here, especially since it is less than seven minutes from my apartment. I had dinner plans with an out-of-town friend and he mentioned being in the mood for Indian. The stars aligned and we ended up here. I started out with a hot black tea and Mixed Vegetable Pakora as our appetizer. The deep fried potatoes and veggies came with two awesome sauces; one reminded me of A-1 sauce with a little sweet tang. The waiter was extremely friendly and did not take offense to our slaughtering of the names of the menu items. He even made a bread suggestion and explained what each of the sauces were made of. We opted to go with the Batura bread, which happens to be a giant deep fried poof of bread that tastes like a sopapilla. It actually looked like a giant jellyfish when it came to the table. As an entree we went with my personal fav, Mutter Paneer, which was EXCELLENT, and Udupi Special Spring Dosai... basically thin crepe chutney spring roll type things. They were good, but not great. Our food came out quickly, the service was attentive, the prices were reasonable and I was REALLY impressed with the taste, portions and quality of our dishes. I will be back to Udupi for sure, this place is amazing!

For all the years I've been traveling back and forth to LV, there hasn't been a time when I didn't stop by this place.  The oxtail soup is why I always go here, and evidently the reason why everyone else goes here.    After a long drive from California, this dish surely hits the spot.  With tender oxtail meat, carrots, celery, ginger, peanuts in a flavorful broth....I have reason to sleep well afterwards.  There have been a few times when the meat doesn't fall off the bone though.  But most of the time it does.  With 2 scoops of rice and a side of cilantro and minced ginger, about $8 is still worth it...even when I used to pay about $6 back in the day.  I've also ordered the steak graveyard special, breakfast, and the banana fritters platter.  For $4, you can't go wrong with these cheap eats.  They definitely fill you up after a long drive or after gambling all night.  The service here is okay, pretty friendly staff.  Expect a long line at around 11 PM, when the oxtail soup is available, but if you're there around 3 AM like I usually am, its smooth sailing.  If you end up waiting long, many "locals" will tell you that it's worth the wait.OMG. I absolutely love oxtail soup! My Mom used to make it when we were kids and she rocked that dish!So, after a long night of dancing at Tao, a bunch of us headed here for the famous oxtail soup!There was a long ass line and it was 4 am. I think we waited about 30-40 minutes. I was tired and cranky already, so wasn't too happy for the wait.But, when we sat down and ordered, the food came within 10 minutes. It was so good! I loved the oxtail, perfectly cooked and huge, seasoned well and had good meat and some fat on it. There were about 6 oxtails per soup, but I was only able to finish 3 1/2 tails. I loved the minced ginger and cilantro on the side. It gave the soup a nice kick. Sigh.. I wish I could have some now. $8 for a bowl of oxtail goodness!pix- http://pandaliciousforme.blogspot.comFirst time I came here was over the summer of last year. Boyfriend was craving Oxtail soup and wanted me to try it since I have never had it in my life! It was a little after 2:00am when we arrived here, and no joke this place was hopping. The line was long and the wait was about 15mins to get a table. Everyone was there from old to the very young. The hostess was nice as she sat us toward the back of the dining room. Now I am not one to complain about where I eat, but some of you might turn your nose up and the place. First of all, this is not new Vegas, its old Vegas. Things are well taken care of in this place (think Denny's) but have an older feel. They have midnight specials, which cannot be beat by anyone else around town! Cheap prices on good cooking!Our waiter was nice, as he brought us water and our silverware! Boyfriend ordered two bowls of their oxtail soup and two sides of rice. When the waiter brought our bowls to the table, all I could think was. How am I going to finish all this? There sitting in front of me was a piping hot and smelling delicious oversized bowl of  the tenderness looking meat sitting on the bone (psst don't tell anyone but I found out that it isn't really ox meat it's the meat from a cow)with cilantro, carrots and mushrooms. The side bowl of sticky rice was piled high. The rice was okay did not eat much of it, but the soup was fully loaded with flavor definitely leaving the bones in makes the broth that much better. Since this was my first time eating the meat from the soup, I was not as graceful as my boyfriend was while eating it. Instead, I tore into it with a knife and fork and when that did not work, I used my fingers to get the meat off the bone. Yes, I am not happy to admit that but just could not think of putting the bone near my mouth and chomp chomping away at it! Not 100% full we decided on having a little sweet snack before leaving. Ordered the banana fritters, which were pretty filling as I could only managed to eat two before being totally full!Make a note people before coming here: Oxtail soup is not served during the day it is only served after 11:00pm...  This place is totally worth going to DTLV for late at night!WHO: Anyone & everyone. As a matter of fact, bring the entire family!WHEN: I believe this Cafe is open 24 hours a day? Correct me if I'm wrong please!WHERE: Downtown Las Vegas inside the California Hotel.WHY: Personally... OXTAIL SOUP!WHAT: One random night while my family was in town. We were stuck in a situation, and the situation being... WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO EAT!! A light bulb must have lit up in one of my cousin's heads when she mentioned we get the infamous OXTAIL SOUP FOR ONLY $9.99! It was a unanimous decision, so this is where we went.They have one of the best graveyard deals ever! You cannot get oxtail soup for 9.99 anywhere! The catch is, it starts at 11pm to 4am I believe? I came here on a whim another time during the day and was bummed because they didn't offer it. It is specifically on the GRAVEYARD menu. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get anything else because our tummies were QUITE SATISFIED. The soup comes with a bowl of rice, which is the filling part. SO GOOD!I will go there soon and try the other tasty meals they have! The menu looks bomb! HAWAIIAN FOOD FOR THE WIN! =) But in meantime, if you are looking for a late night grub after the clubs, this has to be it!!I will leave you with this...OXTAIL SOUP!Like I promised I came back to give their oxtail soup a second try.Refer to my first review and stop reading it right when I taste the soup. Then go back to this spot.IT WAS NOT SALTY! Not only was it seasoned just right, but it finally justified what everyone else has been raving about! I guess the first time I had it something wrong definitely happened. Im glad I came back to verify!My wife orderd the New York Steak dinner. They cooked it medium rare just like she requested. The green beans that came with it was bland but who likes green beans anyway? Anyways, MY SINCEREST APOLOGIES TO THE MARKET STREET CAFE AND ITS EMPLOYEES FOR MY RANT IN MY FIRST REVIEW. I know I dont have to apologize for someone else's mistake, but I wanted to make sure you guys got the right review you deserve.So, yes, I will be looking forward to taking new people to your fine establishment to experience hopefully the goodness of your oxtail soup!For the past 10 years, it has become tradition for us to come here each time we're in Vegas and we ARE in Vegas at least twice a year. What we come here for?? OXTAIL Soup! Served only from 11pm to 6am, the soup is just the perfect way to end a long night of partying in Vegas. It's a simple beef broth cooked with tender oxtail, carrots, celery, and peanuts. What makes this dish superb?? Cilantro, ginger bits, and Kikkoman soy sauce. Eat your meat and soup as you would with rice but add the seasonings on top of it. Ooh la la! It makes all the difference! It is served with two small cups of rice on the side but the bowl of soup itself is huge and can be shared by two people. Imagine what great value this was years ago when they were serving it for $5! Now it costs $10..hey, blame it on the economy! Nonetheless, it's still a pretty good deal. Oxtail soup is not the only good thing here. They have quite an extensive menu of breakfast options that are of great value, too. SERVICE: We already know most of the servers here by face and they are always prompt and quick despite the unholy hours to be working. There can be a line to get a table but don't fret, it moves pretty quickly. Until our next Vegas trip...Mahalo!Thanks to friends who flood my Facebook wall feeds with local Vegas eats!After a long night of partying hard during our first night in Vegas, it was time for a night cap meal. 3am and my cousin and I had anti-hangover food in mind. That's were I remembered the oxtail soup at the Market Street Cafe inside the California Hotel.When we arrived around 4am, we were about the fourth ones in line. But, the dining area was packed. Our wait didn't take that long since we were only a party of two. Once we were seated, I searched for the oxtail soup entree. I read the fine print on the menu regarding the oxtail soup special. The menu states that the soup is currently served from 11pm to 9am with a $9.99 price tag. With it being 4am, I was elated to try it out!Our waiting time for our food was around twenty minutes. It was understandable since the cafe was always packed. When our food arrived, it looked like I had one big piece of oxtail. But that wasn't the case. Under the thick cuts of celery and leaves of cilantro, more pieces were under there. There were also meat pieces embedded at the bottom of the huge bowl! The meat was that tender! This dish was also accompanied with a small plate of white rice. This place knows carb control. As for myself, I would have filled up my bowl with rice until there was no broth left. The broth of the soup had me in shock! It actually tasted like how my Dad makes his oxtail soup, but with different vegetables. Full of flavor and the right kind of saltiness.Market Street Cafe had my home cooked meal waiting for me. But having my Dad pop out the kitchen, that would have been just too weird!Anybody with a drop of Filipino in you, take note!  I don't know about the rest of the menu, but if you can manage to stay up past 11:00 p.m. (I know, I know, so take a nap), you must treat yourself to a huge bowl of rich oxtail soup.  $9.99.  As good as Mama made, maybe better?Market Street Café is located inside one of the smaller, older casinos downtown, The California Hotel.  We went on a rainy Monday night after a show, and there was absolutely no line to contend with. I consider our timing lucky after reading all the reviews about the wait.The bowl is a deep, ~ 8" bowl, filled with lots of meaty, fall off the bone oxtail and an exceptional tasting beef broth.  It also had carrots and celery.  I don't know if the veggies are always this way, but ours were slightly undercooked, still crunchy.  Just the way I love it.  You are also given a bowl of steamed white rice, a small cup of cilantro and even smaller "pill" cup filled with pulverized fresh ginger.  Sink your teeth into those bones, then slurp away!If I had any complaints, it would be.... I couldn't finish it.  Ended up bringing half of it home with us.  And.....our dogs suddenly forgave our being away for 3 days, they were in hog heaven with the bones.  And the leftovers were just as good as the first time around.  You have far better odds of feeling like a winner by joining the soup squad than gambling. Yum!Just one of the largest menus I have ever seen in a really long while.  Just about everything is already on the menu.Breakfast - I loved getting the steak and eggs or bacon and over hard eggs.My dad liked his pancakes.Sandwiches were good.  Burgers were good burgers.  Fries were normal- just fine.  Most of the food was just good cooking.  Normal- and not too out of the ordinary.  Most of the food is good normal ordinary.I get it that this could be a really un-fun job.  But all the staff were really friendly and had their speals down pack for us and knew all the normal questions that they must get asked 50 times a day.  Still it is so nice to see a smile and hear other things besides the ringing of casino bells for a while.It's about 3:45am, and after a successful night of partying and drinking..drunchies came a knockin'.We were originally waiting in line at Secret Pizza..and when we heard it was $26 for a box..we were said, "HELL NO!!!" & decided to come back to the hotel and eat.Waking up the next day and thinking about it, it's kind of an average price for a box of pizza lol. Anyways, we immediately got seated..and it was still on and crackin inside MSC.My friend and I shared the chicken tenders with fries, and all of the food came out fairly quickly. I think we all got the same thing lol.Though they REALLY skimped out on the fries, like literally less than a handful, the chicken tenders were delicious. Crunchy, chicken was juicy and flavorful, and that ranch made it allll the better!Our waiter for the night was this sweet older gentlemen...so cute!Def enjoyed my meal here.

Let's See....  Horrible service from a skanky girl, serving food that belongs in a correctional facility.This had to been one of the very worst dining (for lack of a better word) experiences I've ever had, anywhere.Can't I post anything lower than one star??

Sierra Gold invites you into a very comfortable atmosphere with good quality food & satisfying craves to enjoy whether one might be there for televised sports, video poker, or simple just sitting down at the bar or amusing seating area.First thing to keep note: HAPPY HOUR everyday from 3pm-7pm & 12am-4am (50% off all drinks & pizza)As for the food:_Thin crust pizza (not a fan, but just got sold with the quality & outcome of the pizza that's served here)_Bucket of wings (so many favors, garlic parmesan is a favorite)_Bucket of curly fries (gotta love'em)_ZOOKIE (too good to be true! The warm white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whip cream, & dizzled with chocolate/caramel just hits the spot to that sweet tooth crave)Service could have been better, but what do you expect at midnigt: top noch service? (minus 1 star)I have yet to try more & what's best: this local spot is open 24hours!!!

My wife & I have been going here since 1985. The salsa( I'm a huge salsa guy ) In my opinion is the best salsa in the valley. Their chips are always served hot and taste fresh. They are so good I could make a meal of  just their chips and salsa. We pretty much stick to a few of our favorite dishes. After I make a pig out of myself on salsa & chips I start my meal with a bowl of Albondiga Soup (Meatball soup with fresh vegetables).For my entrée I usually get a  SIZZLING platter of beef Fajita with grilled vegetables. My wife usually gets a Chimichanga.  Both dishes come with a side of guacamole, sour cream and Spanish rice.  In addition the Fajita comes with corn or flour tortilla. As for the flavor of their food, their dishes are bursting with it. The food here is always cooked to perfection, tasty, fresh, delicious and served hot.  The service is usually awesome. In fact my sister who lives in Rhode Island always makes it a point to stop at Valle Luna to get her Mexican Food fix. WARNING: If you get there during normal dinner time you're going to have trouble parking and you're going to have to wait to get a table. FOOD: Drool worthy Arizona-Sonoran recipes!!! Always fresh, consistent, and served promptly.  PRICE: Very reasonable. SERVICE:  Service is usually good but they can get very busy. However I must say the wait for food is normally pretty darned fast considering how busy they can be at times.  CONCULSION: We've had our share of lousy over-priced Mexican restaurants. This place has been a go-to eating spot for outings with family and friends for years. Parking can be a challenge when they are busy but I feel their food is so good its worth trying to get a parking space.   RETURN  FACTOR: 100% We keep coming back! because we love this place.************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again if a friend or family member wanted to go. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!If you've read any of my reviews, it's no surprise that I take into account the fact that Valle Luna is what it is... it's not backed by some culinary genius mixing up roasted pepper foams to top off a taco. This is downright classic, fried, greasy goodness.There is some history to my love of the Mexican food. I originally wanted to be a chef so at the young age of 12 I got my first prep cook job in a small town at Zapatas Mexican Restaurant. It wasn't long until I was 13 and running the kitchen at night. I'm sure this was illegal, but who cared in Page/Lake Powell, AZ?Long story short - I ended up pursuing another career, the owner passed away and the new ownership screwed up the recipes and menu. Since then, I have been on an endless journey to find my 'Zapatas' here in the Valley. The closest I had found was El Minuto in Tucson. And then one day, my brilliant friend and co-worker invited me to lunch.That's when...I met Valle Luna.It's been a dirty love affair ever since. A time warp back to my youthful days at Zapatas. The chips are fried in-house. The shredded beef tacos are everything I remembered them to be. I finally have found a reincarnated Zapatas!!!!This is true Sonoran Mexican food as it was meant to be.I could probably get my elite status revoked for saying this...but it dawned on me that as much as I've eaten here over the years I have never reviewed Valle Luna. Valle Luna is one of those places you just kind of take for granted. Like a sweet guy who maybe isn't exactly your type and is in the friend zone and  is always around until he disappears and then you are like "Where'd you go?". My analogy isn't the best,,,but I know what I mean!So it always makes me smile when people "tell" me about Valle Luna. "There's this good little Mexican place on Cave Creek"...."Oh...Valle Luna?"...."Yes!"Valle Luna is a place where I have had many a happy hour and super casual dinner. I prefer the cantina as I feel the service is slightly better in there...(not that I have had poor service in the restaurant it is just "happier" in the cantina.) Like my daughter told me just last night when I pointed out I like the cantina better...She said, "Yeah...the restaurant is for old people". I replied with "Yeah, and we are NOT old", which is funny because...well...I am actually old and was appreciative that my daughter didn't point that out like she normally does.I love their seafood taco dinner with cod as well as their steak tacos. I also love that you can substitute calabicitas for the rice/beans. That gives Valle Luna a star right there. They have a really good Happy Hour menu too.So if someone mentions a Mexican place they want to go to on Cave Creek-by all means check it out!

Review Text :
The BFs coworker is a bit of a foodie and declared this to be his favorite over the other AYCEs, even better than our favorite haunt. We were in the area and decided to go for dinner at $26.95 pp.-NIGIRI-*Albacore- even though it just says plain, it kinda comes slightly like "cajun albacore" that other sushi spots do. It has a bit of pepper, thin slice of jalapeno and ponzu. It was pretty tasty and fresh so we ordered quite a bit. *Super White Tuna- was pretty fresh*Yellowtail- decent, but not as fresh as other ayces I've had.Spicy Octopus- this is a mix of thin sliced sweet vinegared tako, jalapeno, masago...must for the fans of tako no sunomono.(Seared Pepper baby tuna- this was peppered tuna that was freshly torched. I like this kind of stuff, but the BF thought the sear makes it a bit chewy.*Mackerel- This was totally the star and what impressed me the most. Every have mackerel where it is just kinda dry, fishy, and very salty? Not here. It was fresh cut off a fish and not bought salt packed/salt cured. I almost never order this since it rarely gives me satisfaction...I got several orders. I have not been this pleased with mackerel aside from sashimi I had at Ichiza. The chef puts ponzu on it which makes sense to me since at home I squeeze lemon on mine and soy and helps a lot of people with the strong flavors, but if you want it pure make sure to opt for dry. It was amazing alone with some fresh wasabi. * Sashimi Yellowtail...odd, but these pieces tasted better than the nigiri. * Sashimi Albacore w/ Jalapeno- it was rolled with thin sliced red onion as well which gave a nice bite to it. -ROLLS-*Salmon Skin handroll- it's a comfort staple I end every AYCE meal with. Love. *Albacore Crunch- this was spicy tuna roll with albacore topped with sweet onion fried onion strings with a spicy garlic ponzu. The fried onions wasn't what I was expecting when the BF said it has "crunchies" and made for nice texture and a bit of a sweet flavor element. We're not big on rolls, but some perked out interest. However we were too full for more. -APPETIZERS-*Monkey Brain- mushroom with tuna and creamcheese fried and served with a spicy cream sauce. This was really good, with a lot going on that went well together, but I can still taste the separate elements. *Softshell crab- I love these things. Poor crabs. I must have had 10 of them. *Hamachi Kama- it was fresh fish. I think Island Sushi down the street takes the prize though since they cook theirs much longer which makes for crispy skin. There were parts of this skin that was just fatty and rubbery still so I left it alone. *Butter Saute Scallop- it comes on a hot plate in butter and herbs. They weren't rubbery or overcooked. This is a very plain app, but good to me. Sometimes I just want scallops simple. I put a tiny bit of soy into the mix and it was some good little bites.*Kalbi Ribs- these were cooked on a hot plate. They were pretty soft and had decent flavors*Firecracker- wonton crackers with tuna, avocado with spicy sauce and a sweet kinda honey sesame sauce. I liked these, they did get pretty spicy- fire cracker indeed!We ended with green tea tempura ice cream and mango mochi. I don't get why they put chocolate sauce on my mango mochi...its best to leave a good thing alone so maybe tell them to lay off the sauce. Also was limit one contrary to a earlier review by Patrick D. stating no limit.-SERVICE-Our sushi chef was nice, the owner (also working at the sushi bar, on the other side) came to check on us and even the sushi chef working aside the one in front of us also checked on us. Food came out in a good amount of time even though they were busy. The servers cleared plates fast! I mean sometimes I would be trying to move a plate out of the way and there's someones hand grabbing at it nearly missing a few degrees of me being doused in sauce. However, I'd turn around to ask for some appetizers and they're gone off. Someone snuck in hands to refill drinks fast as well. They didn't really check on us to see if we needed stuff from the kitchen so we flagged down if we wanted stuff. Then when we were ready for dessert, we were ignored when we asked and our sushi chef was too who shouted and pointed to us saying "Dessert". And it wasn't because they were busy, in fact, 4 of them were standing by us or milling about picking up an order. We were held hostage for a bit til I was able to catch someones attention. It was just very odd front of the house service. Also, the ladies weren't very personable, one even seemed a bit cranky at how "big" our orders are which was polarities different from the cheerful sushi men. I wouldn't put several orders if I didn't think it was so hard to put in a order.Overall- I think this is a good place with the nicest ambiance and pretty plating. I get why the BFs coworker recommended it. However, my favorite place still remains because of the awesome service on both sides of the bar."Wa-Wa" (sound of failure).  Sushi wa-da-fa!?!  I got held hostage by a sushi bar!!! and not in a good way!I came here with good intentions - going to Terri K's first UYE, sitting in the "bamboo jail" table with 12 other awesome yelpers and yelper friends, eating raw fish galore.  However, it did not turn out that way.  We came early (6 PM reservation) but could not leave until after 9:30 PM.  The only reason this gets one star from the restaurant side of things is that our bus boy was awesome.  He was polite, refilled drinks super fast, and cleared empty plates like Flash.The service was deplorable.  We really only had one waiter, and he only liked one half of the table.  That half happened to include a lot of people that speak his language, so he spent all of his time taking their large orders and giving them food.  These are all my yelp friends, and I am glad I got to be with them, but the server only waited on them essentially.  When it came to our table, he never gave us what we ordered - 30 minutes passed and we had never received items, whereas our companions on the other side got several orders in and food was coming out in group portions.  The waiter argued with me after I asked 3 times for my mackerel sushi, one of the 3 things I ordered...after waiting 30+ minutes - he finally said he already brought it to the table (but it was someone else's order) and said I never ordered it.  After I asked for it 3 more times, couldn't he just put in another order?!  When I asked him a question about an item, he answered and ran off before I could order food.  I never got to order more than once, and most people on my side of the table had to re-order food or wait forever to order.  If only we spoke Korean!The payment was a disaster too.  We asked for separate checks (for parties of one or 2 - we all did AYCE so it was same price all around) and we asked before we ordered and again before we asked for the check.  We were refused.  Our waiter gave attitude to Bobby Y. when he brought our credit cards and cash that added up exactly to the bill with gratuity.  Another waiter came over and Jieun spoke Korean with him - he said if he rings all of the cards up, he cannot put in any orders for other guests and they are BUSY (well, we were already there 3 hours hello!) so it would take him awhile.  Instead of going to start ringing our cards up though, he stood there and kept repeating the issues with their system - so I told him to go do it already!  It was an igloo in there - when Eric R. asked for them to turn the a/c up, I think that caused our waiter to hate us.  I had to borrow Nelson Q.'s jacket to survive the hours of hell.  I finally went to our car and put the heat on for 10 minutes.  The only reason I ate enough was that Jane shared some of the food from her side of the table with me, very generously (amaebi, ikura, saba, oysters) - because I never got my full and only order from the 6:15PMish range.The upside -hanging with great people and meeting new people (Jane, Maria).  The envy - Terri K. bolting after convincing jerk waiter to give her a separate bill.  The downside - Wa still has a sticker on its door saying "People love us on yelp."  I call BS on that!SUSHI Waa--heres my order? Sushi wa-s the server ever gonna take an order?Sushi wa-it. Sushi wa-tttt theee FUCK?!Im sitting in "bamboo jail" as I write with all the Yelpers here for a UYE. We started at 6pm, it is now 8:50pm as I start this review and we are sitting waiting on them transacting everyone out.Food is still decent, however service is rude and inefficient from our main server. One half of the table was getting service and the other half where I was sitting was kinda ignored a lot more, waited more to put orders, etc. He'd take their order, leave, come back with something for them and then we would have to try to flag him. We'd wave him, he'd say he'll be back and doesn't come back to us or he would walk passed us like we didn't wave at all. A few people had lost orders and instead of saying something kind like "sorry, let me go check on that and get it out"....it's more of remarks like we never put the order, you got it (no someone else got it) ,etc. One of our Yelpers asked three times to get her first order when the other side already on their 2nd round of orders. I was gonna do 3 stars but now with tge transactions, I'm miffed. First, they wont split the bill and kinda told us we had to just deal with it because they're busy.  We computed what we all owe and wrote in the back which cards to charge what. Now something with POS being the only one for orders and transactions so they don't want to back up orders by transacting all us out so they'll transact when orders aren't coming in. We had a Korean speaking Yelper go talk to him and he was rude about it so she went to talk to the manager who said he will do it in a bit. We had to wait for him and explain everything. It took like 20 minutes of discussing things and explaining how we wrote down what before they went to the back to start. We have no choice but to wait. I'm sorry, but one thing I learned about restaurant hospitality that turnover is important because waiting for a check lowers the impression farther than waiting a bit for good food. People are done and want to just go. We finally got our receipts back and......they charge my credit card for two drinks and two AYCE. We wrote everything down clearly on the back on to receipt. We put the last 4 digits of each card to identify them and what amount to charge to each card. HOW is that NOT clear enough? They charged me for someone else. Okay, so basically then they should give me some cash back then bring back the cash people some change. Well, first time they not only gave me less than what I was owed, but also no change for people with cash. They finally gave it and we left at 9:40pm.50 minutes to transact is pretty crazy long. I know it's easy to say that well, it's a pretty a-typical effed up situation. That maybe with the busy place and a waitstaff that doesn't micromanage it well it went down south fast. However, I do have previous visits where I do specifically state how odd the service was odd, not friend and inefficient so that holds true that the waiter service isn't that good here. Also, it got super busy on my last visit towards the end of my dinner and I also waited 20 minutes to get a mochi and 15 minutes more to get my check back to sign so I was held hostage prior to this. So no, it can happen to you in some degree. Please retrain the staff....and HIRE some good servers. The busboy was polite and did more than just remove plates by checking orders and refilling drinks. PLEASE make him a server and maybe make your rude server a busboy until he learns how to talk to people. I don't deny the AYCE is good, but if you go then don't go at peak hours, don't sit at a table- ONLY with the nice sushi bar guys and do cash if you have a party splitting the check. Look at how thorough I was in taking pictures and reviewing individual items because I wanted people to come with my last review. However after this incident I am not recommending it or coming back. I was frustrated all throughout the meal and exasperated at how I was charged and then shortchanged cashback. I haven't felt this way about a dining experience in a long time so 1 star isn't out of line.There are many AYCE areas in the area including my favorite, Island Sushi whose staff is pure aloha hospitality.Update- Owner sent a apologetic note....I give him kudos for that and would've given a star for his professionalism. Then a week later I get a anonymous note from someone in henderson talking about me giving bad reviews and how dare I "destroy families". Given that I only have 15 1 star reviews out of nearly 500 and havent given a bad review in ages, it made me wonder. Then I found out other people got the same message that dined with me here so it doesn't take two to figure out our crabby server didn't like what we said. SO unprofessional and cowardly! Your server really made sure we don't come back.I'm sad for 3 reasons.1. Sushi Wa is a far drive from my residency and from work.  But because my friends raved about this place, I really wanted to take the time and drive to try it.2. My favorite kind of sushi which is the simple Salmon Sake Nigiri was laid on top of a super huge portion of rice and more importantly, the fish was NOT fresh.  HUGE disappointment!3. My favorite roll which is the spicy tuna over crispy fried rice here was bland!  The fish looked like it has been out for days and they don't use fresh jalapeno?  Makes no sense.  I was a bit disgusted.I also had their Yellowtail Nigiri; also not fresh.  I tried their garlic edamame; no taste and not even a hint of garlic.  When you say there is going to be garlic in a dish, I better taste it.  It's as if they like they completey forgot the ingredient and it's in the freakin' name.  Boo!  Then, I had their Ultimate Garlic Tuna Roll...and THUN THUN THUN.....again, no taste of any garlic.  The roll even sits on a bowl of soup that only makes it even worse because the soup base doesn't taste like anything but yuck.  I couldn't believe my dismay!The one star goes to one appetizer: Fried Oysters, and one roll: Volcano roll.  The volcano roll was a little too much on the saucy side that if I had to finish it myself, I would feel guilty for my because of all the mayo clogging up my heart valves.  But because it had sauce, it was the only roll that had any flavor.This was a huge disappointment.  Not only the taste, but the fish wasn't fresh.  Fresh comes first!The wait  staff though was really nice, and the place is decorated nicely; kind of too fancy though.  Also, they over do the food presentation.  They need to work on the food taste rather than the presentation.  Just because something looks good, does not mean it tastes good.   I'll end on a positive note though.  They do have coffee mochi for dessert.  Not many AYCE sushi places have this mochi flavor.  If my friends convince me to go back to try their orders, I don't know.  Because the fish might still be from today.I am giving one star for a reason...  I used to love this place, food quality was good and service was great.  But that all change today, and it was unbelievable what the server had told me.  The Nigiri was not fresh today, food was ok.  The service I would give 0 star if I could.  Every time we are trying to order, the server always give us this bad look.  And we don't really eat that much, trust me.  The worst part was the server lie to us in our face saying there is a limit of the Ice Cream per person...  Which is not true and I told her I have been here plenty time.  She immediate change her story saying it is not limited "BUT I THINK EACH OF YOU HAVE 1 MOCHI ICE CREAM AND 1 REGULAR ICE CREAM I THINK THATS ENOUGH FOR YOU GUYS"  I seriously start to laugh and tell her forget about it.  And this is my first time in my life left a $0 tips.  I thought it's AYCE!!!!  As a business owner, I feel sorry for Sushi Wa owner to have staff like that.My friend and I were looking to try out a new AYCE sushi place. Although Sushi Wa didn't have as high a rating on Yelp, my friend wanted to give it a try. There are so many sushi places on Eastern, almost too many options. This place is adorable. It seems like a nice, high end sushi place. When we arrived there was basically no one in the place, but by about 20-30 minutes later and the place was pretty busy.We both ordered AYCE and each started off with Baked Lasagna and Mussels. Mussels were pretty good but neither of us cared for the Baked Lasagna. I've had better at any other place I've been. There was a lot of cream cheese on top if that's your thing, I'm not that into it so I usually take half of it off. Regardless of that this roll doesn't compete with surrounding spots. There is definitely some kind of distinct, additional flavor being added and I'm not really into it. It wasn't bad, just not as good as other places I've been. We also ordered the Fire Cracker ($6) and it really good. Equally as good as any other place I've ever had it. I highly recommend trying it. I don't think it's as spicy as it sounds, but there is definitely a kick to it. Popcorn Scallop was also pretty good. The sauces they served with it were ok. Beef Teriyaki roll was ok. My friend liked it more than I did. I don't think I'm ready for a meat/sushi infusion yet. Rose roll was pretty good, description says that it's a baked baby lobster on top of California roll with eel sauce. I'm not sure but that doesn't sound like what we got. It was a roll covered in a lot of stuff, I tasted scallops, there was definitely a really good creamy type sauce. This dish looked kind of messy, but as actually not that hard to eat. The only thing I didn't like about it was the red onion that was mixed on the top. They were pretty easy to remove but one snuck through on my last bite. Screaming Orgasm was pretty good, but again I've had equal or better at other places. My friend ordered the Las Vegas Roll, I didn't try it. 4 Kinds of fish, crabmeat, avocado all completely deep fried. It's not my thing. I don't mind some light tempura, but I'm more of a raw sushi kind of girl. I did try the sauce that was in the bowl because my friend didn't like how spicy it was. I usually like anything spicy, but this didn't have a great flavor. So for my first visit here, I'd say it went ok. I mean I don't think I'll be rushing back here. I feel like I can get better value at any other place. The best thing about this place is the ambiance. Service was ok. Servers seems to be friendly, but also ambivalent. It's also one of the more expensive AYCE places that I've tried. I don't think that mixes too well with the level of deliciousness. Sushi quality seemed legit, but I also want quality flavor.We came here on a Saturday evening and ordered 2 AYCE1. Regular salmon skin hand roll2. Spicy salmon skin hand roll3. 2 orders of soft shell crab4. Short ribs5. Pocky roll6. Superman burrito 7. 2 orders of yellowtail sashimi (4pc an order)8. Hamachi kama9. Rose roll10. Nabeyaki udon11. Energy roll12. Green tea and strawberry mochi for $69.27- Seated right away. Pleasant welcome. Friendly. Smiles. - Chefs are kind. attentive. entertaining. Choi! Great guy. - Salmon skin hand roll was was like Dohs. Not good. Not crispy. Poor. - Soft shell crab was small. Fair. - Short ribs a bit too much fat. - Pocky roll was amazing. Loved the avocado and presentation. - Superman burrito was flavorful. Didn't look like Superman or a burrito. - Their sashimi order was fantastic! thick slabs! Best for AYCE - Rose roll was fulfilling. Shove it all the mouth deal - Nabeyaki udon was great! Best AYCE soup. Ridiculously hot. - Hamachi kama was a bit oily, but still crispy. Maybe I'd stick with salmon. - Energy roll was okay. wouldn't get again. - Nice cuts on mochi. chocolate drizzle. - I felt that there was collective effort to try their best to ensure a good visit.- Definitely coming back for more!

Pizza... good.  Service... good.  Atmosphere... good.  What I didn't appreciate?  Being followed outside & accused of not leaving a tip on a $116 bill.  We left $38.  Funny thing is, our group of 6 were all restaurant managers/servers and would never think of leaving less than 20% on a bill for just ehhhh service.  Want GREAT pizza, GREAT service, GREAT atmosphere?  Try Pizza Brutta on Monroe Street.  (am unaffiliated by the way, just my neighborhood pizza joint that never dissappoints.)

Ahhhh..Makinos.... My first initial favorite sushi buffet!  (Too bad you are in vegas otherwise I'd be there once a week!)I know that real sushi fanatics don't believe in sushi buffets, but for huge fusion sushi fan like myself, Makino's is heaven.First of all, the price for lunch is about $14, and Dinner will run you about 20.  I think the weekend pricing  is like $17 and $25 respectively.Sushi selection... it's got everything you would want.  Various types of California roll mixes, simple nigiri sushi, and other tasty variations of fusion sushi that you can indulge all you want as long as you can stuff it!  I can't tell you what my favorite roll is because the sushi chefs gets creative all the time, so everytime I went, it's always something different!  For those non-sushi fans, they also got a very nice hot dishes.  The tasty selections includes traditional shrimp/vegetable tempuras, fried oysters, steamed white fish, white wine clams, BBQ riblets, Fried rice and Yakisoba.  All are very tasty!  So you definitely will not feel left out if you are not into the raw fish deal.The dessert section is ok... all the cakes and sweets taste generic (as if they were taken out of a box from trader joes or something), but they do have the bomb red bean ice cream which I always have some at the restaurant, and have to have a cone to go as well.  But you will have to ask for it (that is the only problem because it's not self serve)Lastly, for those that craves sweets, there is a chocolate fountain that you can literally dip anything into  (If you believe in spider roll covered in dark rich chocolate.. I guess go right ahead.....)  But you can definitely dip as much as your heart desires!)This location that I'm rating (in the  LV outlets) and the off the strip location (Decatur) to me taste comparable.  Therefore, either one you go you should not be disappointed.  However, just remember that this is a buffet, so for those hard core sushi fanatics, please leave the mindset of having the top notch fresh sushi like you would at a $200 a night sushi restaurant mentality at home so you won't be disappointed, but just enjoy how much you are paying for such tasty creations drawn up by Mr. Makino."AYCE SUSHI!!" (pops head up)That light bulb in my head shined bright when I heard we were heading to an AYCE sushi place (+ more). This restaurant, located in an outdoor shopping mall/outlet in Vegas made me yearn for sushi as I saw their sushi display. They had other sections, such as, a soup section (miso soup, etc), hot foods with mussels, noodles, etc, but all I cared for (besides dessert) was just  sushi.  Everything looked good, but there weren't any labels of what exactly each sushi was. Luckily I had an eye for sushi, being that I LOVE sushi, and was able to distinguish what each roll had. Everything looked fresh.. or so I thought. As I sat down, I devoured, well, tried to devour each roll. I couldn't eat everything from each piece of sushi because geez, there was SO MUCH RICE. C'mon people, where is my fish?I didn't pay for rice! I literally had a pile of rice chunks on my plate, just so I didn't get full off of rice. I need to make room for other things like dessert! Plus the fish didn't feel or taste fresh at all. But I guess that happens when you're at an AYCE sushi buffet +more. If you've been to Todai, then Makino's is like or perhaps a little bit better than Todai's quality of sushi. I honestly don't think my $16.95 (wkend lunch price) was worth it. But I did eat it any way, and managed to eat some of the tempura shrimps they had, which weren't that bad. The best thing that this place offers, besides good service, was their dessert! Yes, there are cookies, mini cakes (that are what ever), but they have GREEN TEA ice cream.. and drum roll pls..... RED BEAN ICE CREAM, one of my favorite flavors, EVER! Oh man, I felt like I was in red bean, green tea heaven. I have never in my life been to a place that offers all you can eat green tea and red bean ice cream. NOM NOM NOM, is exactly what you heard after going back two times to get more of it. Too bad it wasn't mochi.. or I would have stuck with dessert the whole time I was there!A couple of us with a slight hangover and couple of us really hungover, made our way to the Las Vegas Outlet Center to meet up with some Japos.  Sweet.  My kind of get together.We dragged our feet inside and plopped down on our seats.  Get our drink orders in and venture to the food.  Not that much going on as far as quantity goes.  I grab some udon and do some surveillance on the sushi.  The set-up looked like a busted up lip.  What a mess!  Some people are just vultures, I tell ya.Some say I'm way too picky with my sushi.  You want to know what I tell them?  Too bad.  I'm telling you anyway.  I tell them to eat fat bowl of sh%t, straight up.  Besides, my otosan (father) was a sushi chef way back when.  So there.  Suck a fat one, you haters =)Anyways, the stuff looked like you would expect from an AYCE sushi dig.  Only it's better than any of the stuff that I've had from a buffet on the Las Vegas strip. Man, have you guys ever tried that sh%t?!  That stuff tastes like an uncooked potatoe. The udon was better than I expected.  I threw in some tempura in it, because that's how I do.To top it all off, I had green tea ice cream.  Only, they gave it to me in a cone.  I've never had it any other way than in a bowl.  So that was kinda weird.  It wasn't maeda-en stuff, but it was aiiight.This place is better than Todai, that's for sure.The girl here makes sure you will not go thirsty.  It is the desert after all.When your stuffed you can waddle yourelf to all the surrounding shops and gather up all your Ed Hardy gear.  If that's your thing.  Hopefully it isn't.West west ya'll.As a sushi lover who lives in Vegas, this was actually my first time ever eating at Makino's. It was just a bunch of family members on an adventure for the nearest food place, and this happened to be what we found. Its a good place for a group of people to just go and grab lunch. One positive is it is all you can eat sushi for $16.99 lunch!! If you aren't a sushi fan, there are a couple of alternatives, like teriyaki chicken, fish, and other dishes. One of my favorites was the whole "build your own miso soup". The soup came out of some sort of tea dispenser, and you got to put whatever else and however much tofu you wanted!! Thumbs up all the way!Oh I also can't forget the dessert! There was a variety to choose from, but I believe the favorite was the fondue fountain where you can "chocolate-up" fruits and marshmallows. Overall, I was pleased with it being just a whim!

Review Text :
I went to Eleven on Friday night for a late dinner and got some delicious food but rather bizarre service. We made a reservation, but got there a bit earlier than expected, so we asked the hostess about getting a table overlooking the bar if one opened up, and went to go sit in the lounge to have a drink. I had a delicious Red Ruby martini with pomegranate and blood orange, and the bf had a Pear-secco, which he enjoyed. We didn't have to wait as long as expected, and were taken to a table on the upstairs patio. It was a nice night, but the space was pretty generic and there were open tables in the area we'd asked for, overlooking the bar, so we asked to be moved. When we got to our new table and started perusing the menu, I noticed that the tasting menus weren't there, which I'd read about online. I finally asked about the tasting menu and the waitress said that they don't serve it on the patio, and asked if I'd like to see it. I did, and it was what I ended up ordering (the vegetarian one), but I felt the whole situation was weird and uncomfortable. I just wished the waitress talked a bit more about the food in general. She never talked about what was on the menu, told us about what was good or tried to elaborate beyond the most basic answers to questions we asked. The bread server, on the other hand, told us all about the three different bread selections, the type of wheat used in each bread and what made them unique. It was more in line with what I was expecting from the waitress and left me thinking, "someone needs to give this guy a promotion, stat."The meal itself was very good. It started with a taste of grilled cheese from the chef, then I had an artichoke soup and mushrooms on toast. I then had a small bowl of fettuccine in an olive sauce, which was a bit too olivey for my tastes, and a delicious grilled mushroom on black rice. I had the wine pairings with the dishes, which I liked--and it ensured that my glass was always full--and I got the chocolate peanut butter pretzel for dessert, which was a bit crunchier than I was expecting, but tasty. I'm sure our experience would have been different with another server and another host, and overall I was really pleased with the quality of the food and the thought put into the dishes, especially the vegetarian tasting menu.Full review in Blog:Calling the restaurant I was informed that the Chef's Table was generally for groups of 4-6, but if no one had booked it for a given night they'd be willing to seat a solo for the standard price of $100 for 9 courses - placing my reservation a couple weeks in advance I was glad to find out that Mondays were generally quiet and I'd have the table all to myself.Somewhat disappointed as my only vantage point of the action in the kitchen was through a small slit in the tiles, I was promptly greeted one of two servers who provided the cocktail list and filled my water.  Professional and courteous I will note that service throughout the evening was mostly competent, albeit not overwhelming - a course was delivered without silverware, water reached empty twice, plate clearing was a touch slow.  Fortunately, as part of the Chef's Table experience I had the honor of receiving all of my dishes (and excellent descriptions of preparation and ingredient sourcing) from Chef Chad himself.Shortly after the chef's departure the bread-lady arrived with a woven basket featuring three house-made breads.  Browsing the online list and realizing Eleven takes orders for breads and confections all I can say is that the bread basket gives me a good idea why - all three of the options were excellent.  From a sweet yet toothsome Currant Semolina Sourdough, to a rustic and aromatic Carraway Wheat, to a heavenly moist Sea Salt Focaccia each of the options was excellent...and while my primary server wasn't always on the ball, I was never for want when it came to bread.The third course of the evening would provide the first "wow" of the tasting - an impressive accomplishment given the simplicity of the dish.  Served proudly and with great description by Chad the House Cured Prosciutto with Three Sisters Mesclun, Vin Cotto, Olive Oil was sublime - the nutty notes of the silky pork only enhanced by the slightly bitter greens, acidic yet sweet vin cotto, and smooth olive oil.  A new passion of the young chef I was even given the opportunity to see the curing area after my meal - a small section of the wine vault with meats aged anywhere from a week to nearly a year - a return visit for charcuterie at the  bar would certainly be on my agenda if I lived locally.The final savory of the evening would be my favorite, as well.  Large in portion and bold in flavor, Elysian Field Farms Lamb - Sous Vide with Crispy Lamb Neck, Anson Mills Polenta, Golden Artichoke, and Mint was marvelous.  Nearly raw yet sizzling hot, the lamb itself was not as gamey as would be expected and the crispy wrapping of neck lent plenty of texture and savory flavor.  Acting as a bed to the butter-knife soft lamb was a chive laden and creamy polenta with the slightest hints of mint and mace.  Flanking the protein along with a savory lamb jus were crispy artichoke hearts - pan seared and creamy within, a vegetal composition not unlike the lamb in terms of presentation.I was next greeted by the pastry chef who presented me a trifecta of her favorite desserts from the menu.  Titled on the menu as "Tasting" the trio contained miniature versions of Eleven's Famous Peanut Butter Pretzel Candy Bar, Banana Cream Pie with Tapioca, and Brioche Bread Pudding with Cinnamon and Strawberries.  While I will note I'd have preferred received all three as separate courses (time and temperature reasons only) I will also note that the lady has talent - each option was stunning.  Creamy peanut butter with chocolate ganache and salty pretzels, caramelized bananas with hand whipped cream and graham crackers...and oh the Bread Pudding.  With finger-thick slices of buttery brioche caramelized and doused in a salty cinnamon caramel reduction, the only thing that made it better was the ice cream, a smooth dollop of spicy cinnamon that melted slowly over the hot pudding.Looking back on dinner at Eleven the word the two words that come to mind are "American" and "Competent."  To be fair, in my experience I've never really had a tasting menu that I would call "American" without pronounced flourishes of French or Mediterranean - the Chef's table at Eleven was almost like going to CUT or a similar high end steak house and getting a tasting...the food varied from very good to excellent, but certainly did not re-invent the wheel.  For $100 the quality, presentation, and ingredients were certainly worth the price - but at the same time, I can't say I would rush back.  That said, Chad is an excellent Chef with a lot of potential and the space at Eleven is beautiful - I'd certainly go back for some a la carte selections and dessert anytime.Officially, our favorite restaurant for Brunch. We have been here a few times now and are always very happy with the choices. We always go with the prix fixe. I have enjoyed the pumpkin squash soup, the beet salad, the crab cake sandwich, the pork huevos rancheros, and chicken sandwich served with the killer fries, just to name a few items. BJ has tried the New York strip and eggs, shrimp, leek, ham & cheddar omelet and loved every minute of it. We always swear that we are going to try the Eleven burger or the grilled sticky. But something else always manages to catch our eye. They also serve a bread basket with a yummy croissant and random tiny little muffins with an ever changing delicious homemade jam and flavored butter. Kudos to Eleven for serving up the best brunch in town!Delightful.  That's the word that comes to mind.  From the first step in the door with the welcoming fireplace and soaring ceilings, to the soothing sage greens and wood, to the inlaid tables, to the professional and friendly service, to the exquisite food.  Five celebrated a special occasion together this afternoon....Eleven made it even more special.We started off with the roasted beet, Belgian endive, Maytag blue cheese, hazelnut salad.  It was beautiful!  Gorgeous jewels of golden and ruby beets sprinkled with soft, salty and sharp bleu cheese, crisp, crunchy endive, sweet hazelnuts, lovely apples and a drizzle of molasses vinaigrette started us off beautifully.  Entrees....well, 4 out of 5 voted for the strip steak salad and all raved about the beef!  I opted for the lobster roll sans the roll, please.  Beautiful mesclun, which I understand was the first of the season and locally grown, was piled high with succulent chunks of Maine lobster dressed with a fresh lemony vinaigrette.  The lobster had been cooked perfectly...tender and sweet.  Absolutely heaven.  Oh!  And the housemade, fat dill pickle rocked.  Mmmmmhhhmmm.On to dessert.  We were a little more diverse in dessert selection, but only marginally.  3 out of 5 ordered the molten lava cakes that were accompanied by hazelnut ice cream - housemade, of course!  All three wore happy little chocolate smiles the rest of the day.  Our 4th was all smiles over the apple crumble pie with roasted cinnamon ice cream and I....well, of course I had the creme brulee.  In this case it was pumpkin creme brulee.  Warm, toasty spices infused the lovely, soft custard with that gorgeous, crunch of bruleed sugar on top.  I do love a good creme brulee....this ranked right up there with the best.A round of coffee and those adorable little macaroons brought to the table left us all happy as clams.  Delightful.I could live here! I could live here if they would also feed me 24/7....wouldn't that be livin' the dream? I can't even get to the food before I tell you how amazing it is inside! It has that cool urban loft feel. I love the outdoor seating. I love the huge garage door that opens up the entire restaurant. I love the upstairs intimate dining area. I love the bar area. I love love love it all! Remember to keep an open mind and an open wallet, because you'll need it! First off, cocktails....hello! I ordered the Summer Strawberry and my friend ordered the Leven-ade. We were so confused because the waitress set them down in front of us and I had the yellow colored drink and she had the pink colored drink. We thought she had mixed them up.  But she hadn't.  I swear mine tasted more Lemonadie and tart and my friends tasted more fruity. So to solve that issue, we switched! And all was right in the world again.... I had heard over and over again that the portions were incredibly small. So with that being said, and not wanting to be a cheapskate by ordering only an app, I ordered the Asparagus Salad. The portion was big to my surprise...and utter joy. Score one! The asparagus was fresh and crisp with balsamic drizzle and pieces of thinly sliced pork (properly called Lomo...which I totally had to look up the meaning of, don't worry!) and parmesan. Perfection! I ordered the Tuna because I can rarely resist tuna if it's on the menu. It was perfectly cooked....or uncooked. There's really no other way to order Tuna then to order it rare. Go rare or go home! It was fantastic! It really out shined the mixture of rice below.  I also really liked the slight green olive taste in the dish. Score two!  My friend got the Hanger Steak rare as well and it was equal in amazingness.  I, of course, had to try it!   I'm a fillet girl all the way, but the way the steak was cooked made the flavor just right! So we left, empty wallets but full bellies. And I'm totally ok with that!This is it. This is without a doubt in my mind and my wife's, the number one restaurant in Pittsburgh.Everything about this restaurant is outstanding-  the ambiance is very sophisticated and  wonderful, the service is educated, informed, efficient, unobtrusive and helpful.We have dinned here numerous times for business and for pleasure. We have had outstanding lamb, veal, pastas and seafood. Chef Stevens never disappoints and when we get the tasting menu and often we do it with the wine pairing it is a dining adventure. Sometimes we ask the chef to add an extra course to the tasting menu and he always obliges with something superb. I should mention that the deserts are amazing.The experience is EXCITING AND WONDERFUL.Seriously!  All you happy hour gurus like me, listen up!!  They have updated their happy hour menu so that now you can get ANY gin or vodka martini for $6.  This includes Belvedere, Boyd and Blair, etc.  It used to just be Stoli but now it's anything.  My jaw dropped.  This is HANDS DOWN the best happy hour in Pittsburgh!!  Not to mention the dynamic menu (changing weekly) and array of good wine, cocktails and food (oysters!) on HH.I've also had dinner here twice.  They send out birthday coupons if you are on their mailing list for a free entree (up to $30 value).  Hello!  This is killa.  I used mine in Dec.  A friend emailed Big Burrito saying she didn't receive hers and they faxed a letter to the restaurant for her free dinner a month later.  Best customer service.  I really can't say enough good things about this place.The overall theme of Eleven is balance.The pork belly was like a gift from God: the saltiness of the grits balanced by the sweet maple gastrique; the soft tender pork belly enhanced by the crispy apple slices; and the brown color of the seared belly offset by the bright greens.  Truly a perfectly conceived dish.  Did I mention that it tasted AMAZING?The scallops were the only thing that didn't blow my mind.  They were good, just not out of this world.My main dish was hands down the best lamb dish I've ever had.  If you like lamb, get the lamb.  Again, perfectly balanced.  The lamb, smoked shoulder, mint, lamb bacon, and red onion marmalade could all be tasted in different combinations.  You could make every bite different and every bite equally amazing.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly executed, and beautiful to look at.Finally, there's a reason the chocolate-peanut-pretzel candy bar is at the top of their dessert menu.  This is not your kid's Snickers bar, THIS IS YUMMY TIME FOR ADULTS.  It all comes together and again, is perfectly balanced.  The cold sweet ice cream, the salty smooth peanut/preztel filling sitting on a thin dense brownie (acted almost like the crust).  Truly an incredible finish to an amazing meal.The service was outstanding and probably the most personable service I've ever had.  Our waiter Daniel was extremely courteous, informative, nice, and helped make our night one to remember.***Eleven's food is not exceptionally creative or original, but the food here is good, fresh and reasonably priced for an upscale lunch***Eleven is part of the Big Burrito group, which has many notable restaurants in Pittsburgh.  This one is an upscale spot next to the John Heinz History Center.  The restaurant has a nice contemporary decor.  There is a slightly open kitchen.  The main dining room makes a good use of green and there is comfortable seating along with white tablecloth.  The room also has high ceilings.  In some ways, the room reminds me a little of a cross between Tavern and Lucques (though Eleven lacks the inside-and-outside like atmosphere of Tavern).Eleven's lunch menu is very inviting.  There is a great collection of starters--some nice sounding salads but also scallops and crab cakes.  Their entree section features a mix of gourmet sandwiches and burgers as well as plates with proteins like lamb and fish.The bread at Eleven was standard stuff--not much of a crust, not much of a chew and even a little bit dry.My starter was good.  I had the seared scallops, which were garnished with fingerling potatoes, pearl onions, spinach, sorrel, and sauce gribiche.  It was a very generous portion for a lunch starter.  I thought it was good.  Everything tasted fine and a lot of the ingredients were good.The scallops were nicely seasoned and had a good outside crust.  They were tender, but the scallops lacked the moistness of the scallops at Lola.  I liked the pearl onions and I thought the sauce gribiche was briny, sour and good.  I also liked the spinach.The fingerling potatoes were too big.  They were not bland and definitely not raw, but the insides of the potatoes were not as tender as they should have been (4 stars for this dish).For my entree, I had the Elysian Fields Farm lamb t-bones with a salad of radicchio, arugula, endive, fingerling potatoes, and idiazabal cheese.  Elysian Fields Farm is a great producer of lamb (the farm is located just an hour outside of Pittsburgh).  I once had their lamb at Sona and it was exceptional there (they also provide lamb to The French Laundry).The lamb here was good.  The lamb was like little porterhouse steaks.  There was a New York strip part that was flavorful and juicy but also with a chew and less tender texture than the filet mignon-like portion, which was very tender.There were two t-bones and they were a tad uneven.  One was seasoned a little too heavily while the other was not as juicy as I wanted.  Still, the lamb t-bones were flavorful and good.The salad was a very bitter salad with the radicchio, arugula and fennel.  I did not mind the bitterness, but I think some would.  I liked the cheese and they did a better job with the fingerling potatoes here, which were sliced and tender (3 stars for this entree).For dessert, I had the chocolate-peanut pretzel candy bar, which was surprisingly  good.  The base of the candy bar was a decent though not great brownie.  There was a very good and creamy peanut butter mousse as well as a thin layer of a dark chocolate bar.  There was a decent chocolate ice cream on top as well as peanut brittle and very good pretzel nuggets that were topped with smooth melted chocolate.There was also a caramel sauce.  The dessert tasted pretty good and while there were a lot of sweet and rich elements, the dessert did not get too rich or too sweet (4 stars for this dessert).The meal ended with a coconut macaroon, which was mediocre and dry.Service was good.  My server was pleasant, personable, polite, and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.Prices were about what you would expect to pay for an upscale lunch.  When considering the many high quality and premium ingredients used, this lunch at Eleven was probably a little less expensive than equivalent places in LA.I liked my lunch at Eleven.  While the food was not exceptional, my starter, entree and dessert were all at the very least good.  The food was not really creative or exciting enough to make me want to come back, but I think this is a good option for an upscale lunch in Pittsburgh (they had a pretty good lunch crowd on the day I went).There are several metered spots along Smallman Street.  There is also a paid lot for the Heinz History Center, which is $5 per day.I absolutely loved my first trip to Eleven for lunch a few weeks ago, and I cannot wait until I'm rich and can go again.I love the upscale feeling, but you can also go in not super dressed up (at least for lunch) too.  At lunch time on MLK, the place was pretty quiet, but I'd imagine you need a reservation at dinner time.  The service was fantastic.  Our waiter was very friendly, especially for a more upscale place.The actual food isn't particularily creative, but it's delicious.  Everything is fresh and hot, and I really enjoyed the entire experience.  I ordered the Crab Cake Sandwich ($14).  It was a substantial size, and it tasted amazing.  My friend ordered the Eleven Burger, and it looked equally amazing.  Our waiter was telling us that when he comes into work, it's always some new cooking adventure in the kitchen, and he is always excited to try the food.  How many servers and people in the restaurant industry can say they'll eat where they work?  I won't eat where I work!  If that isn't enough proof enough that Eleven is amazing, I don't know what is.We wanted dessert, but we could not make up our minds.  So our waiter said he would suprise us.  All desserts, at least at lunch, are $10.  They are also all meant to be split, which our waiter was kind enough to share with us.  He surprised us with two ice cream sandwiches- homemade pumpkin ice cream between two ginger snap cookies.  I'm salivating just THINKING about them.  AMAZING.  Highlight of the meal.I loved Eleven, and it's definitely some of the best dining in PIttsburgh!  Check it out.Good for happy hour! The first time I came to Eleven was for lunch in December and I wasn't that impressed. The second time was today for happy hour with two friends. No wait and it was a great day, so we sat outside. I wasn't in the mood to drink, but friends got the Ruby Red and red sangria which they both enjoyed. We shared the oysters, Blue Bay mussels (comes with kielbasa), calamari, and onion rings. The oysters were tiny and salty, not exactly how I like my oysters, but still decent. (No need for the big plate though.) Mussels were good; I especially enjoyed the soft center of the fried sourdough. The calamari was great, no complaints. I thought the onion rings were just okay; I usually prefer my onion rings to be more substantial (thicker). For the price, the portions of the mussels and calamari were large, but not so much for the onion rings and small oysters. Still, Eleven is a good option for happy hour if you're Downtown! Taste | 4Atmosphere | 3.5Presentation | 3.5Service | 3 OVERALL | 3.5Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher this year, I decided to go to Eleven to redeem it.  Two friends accompanied me for my visit on Sun., 12/13, and I was able to given them each a $10 off voucher, so we all were able to receive a discount on an otherwise pricey dinner, which is always nice.  Overall, we were quite impressed with our experience, as the details below will show.Although we all decided to forego appetizers, we were served bread from a bread basket containing three varieties.  Of the three types we tried, I enjoyed the sea salt focaccia best.  The only thing that's a bit strange is that, instead of placing a basket on the table, they dole it out by the slice, but you can request two slices at a time if you so desire, as I did.The night of our visit, the entree list was pretty seafood heavy, so all three of us ordered seafood entrees.  My friends ordered the seared salmon and the walleye pike ($28 each), and I ordered the seafood tasting ($36).  The seafood tasting consisted of a crab cake, a sea scallop, and salmon topped with shishito peppers and salt and vinegar chips over some seafood chowder.  The crab cake was generous in size and consisted of lump crab meat with no pepper and very little filler.  It was definitely one of the best crab cakes I've had, which is saying something given that I went to high school and college on the Eastern Shore of MD.  The seared salmon was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside, just as salmon should ideally be.  The sea scallop was also very large and meaty, and tasted appropriately (I must confess I'm not a huge scallop fan).  The chowder and chips made for a nice presentation and accompanied the main components of the dish well.  The only component of the dish that I didn't really care much for were the peppers--but then again, I'm not a big fan of spicy green peppers.  I tried bites of my friends' entrees, and they were both delicious, as well.After finishing our entrees, we sprung for dessert.  I was torn between the warm dark chocolate cake and the candy bar desserts ($10 each), so when my friends ordered the former, I went for the latter.  I'm really glad I went for the candy bar dessert, since it was absolutely delicious!  It consisted of chocolate olive oil cake, chocolate malt ice cream, and peanut butter sauce, and they even included a piece of white chocolate on which they wrote happy birthday because I mentioned that it was my birthday.  I also tried a bite of my friends' dessert.  While it was delicious, I enjoyed the candy bar dessert more, so I made the right decision.Needless to say, my friends and I very much enjoyed our dinner at Eleven.  The quality of the ambiance and service matched that of the food, making for a comprehensively wonderful experience.  I've since learned that the head chef will be leaving in a couple of months to start his own restaurant.  I wish him great success in that endeavor, and trust that the new chef, who currently heads Casbah, will be a worthy replacement.  If you're looking for a classy place to dine, I highly recommend Eleven--it easily makes my top 10 restaurant experiences in PGH.

Review Text :
Ok, Ok, I gave 'em another chance. Let's just say last fall I had a shrimp fried rice that disagreed more with me than Rosie ODonnell disagrees with Anne Coulter. After several hours bowing to the porcelin god, I vowed never to return. Well, everyone deserves a second chance, rice, er, um I mean, right? Plus it SO convienent to my job and home. Pork lo mein has become a fav of mine and I actually crave it. For about $7 I usually have leftovers I can enjoy later. My bf Rickie is a spicy man so he loves spicy food, his craving, the Sun Devil chickien with gobs of jalepenos. We enjoy the crab puffs as well. Pretty standard Chinese fare, but the place lately has been spotless and the service great. It's tiny and probably does more take out and delivery. I say they're worth a shot if you're in the hood. Chow Chow yelpers!A-OK!!I've enjoyed take-out from Siu Wok four times now and haven't been disappointed. Very inexpensive for the amount of food you get. I have created 3 meals from one lunch special. The Pepper Steak was really yummy and perfectly spicy. The Kung Pao Steak was quite good as well as the Szechuan Chicken. (I'm noticing a spicy trend here). The lunch specials are served with fried rice, an egg roll and (2) crab puffs. The only thing that annoyed me was the "crab" puffs. OK,  not only is there NO crab in them, there isn't even a hint of "Krab" in them.... you dig?? Call them what they are...... cream cheese puffs, thank you. I'll eat them anyway..... no need for deception. Yesterday I had the Teriyaki Chicken for lunch. I questioned it immediately because it looked *interesting*. I actually joked to my lunch date about what I was eating and that I didn't believe it was chicken at all but in fact the victim of some "ghetto backyard, dove massacre"... alas I was wrong. I'm just not used to eating only dark meat chicken and let me tell you, it was fucking delicious. In closing:good cheap eatscream cheese treatsbomb dark meatsnow if only they had crushed ice.....I ate lunch here with my friend John, and I have to agree with him that 4 stars is a good rating for them. I like the fact that they are very accommodating to vegetarians. You can order anything from the menu, and they will replace the meat with either crispy or boiled tofu. The portions are also huge! I could not finish my dish. It was totally worth the money,  it is a clean restaurant,  and very inexpensive too. Not the most authentic Chinese food out there, but for the price and the amount of food that you get it is excellent. It is also close to the light rail, so that is a big plus.Siu Wok has been a favorite for quite some time.  Sadly, today's experience knocked them off the list.My co-workers and I decided we needed a tasty meal today so we placed a delivery order through Siu Wok.  We were happy when the meal arrived much sooner than the 45-minute delivery estimate.  Our food was hot and smelled delicious.  We were all enjoying our food when one co-worker made a stomach-turning discovery: a dead fly in her food.  We all immediately stopped eating, repulsed by the large fly nestled up to a sliced carrot.I immediately called Siu Wok to complain and spoke with Jennifer.  I told her what happened and asked for a refund on the entire order.  She said she could refund the contaminated meal but would have to speak with the manager for authorization on the other two.  She called back a few minutes later and said she was only given permission to refund the $7.95 for the extra-protein meal.  She seemed to understand why I was disappointed but said her hands were tied.  I asked her to relay to management that I was very disappointed in his lack of attention to the matter and that Siu Wok had just lost a considerable amount of business, as our office frequently places orders there.Instead of Siu Wok being out $23.44, they have lost an office full of customers and gained a negative Yelp review.  Doesn't the fly look delicious??I have done the research for you & happy to tell you that Sui Wok is the best Chinese food in Phoenix! Consistent. Inexpensive. Fast delivery & damn good food!  We have dined in once but have had countless dinners & work lunch delivered over the past 3 years. I even had a party of 20 catered from Sui Wok. Every time it has been great! Sweet & sour pork, vegetable lo mien, honey walnut prawns, & vegetable chop suey are my go to items. Egg drop soup is good as well as the sizzling rice soup. The combo dinners are enough food for three meals! Can't beat that!I have recommended this place to a lot of people and always get a good response! Even a picky New Yorker who knows good food from China Town NYC. Huge delivery area!! 43rd AVE- 40th ST & Northern- Buckeye.Give Sui Wok a try!!  I guarantee you will have it again!

Review Text :
Horrible, terrible foodborne illness.Shoulda turned back when I saw a kid put his whole fist into a jello after wiping his nose. Sure, they replaced it, but... one person manning a three mile long buffet cannot snuff out all the snots.How bad was it you say? Oh, well, when the PARAMEDICS showed up at my house, they thought I was a goner. During the ambulance ride I profusely vomited on, and shat on, the sexy EMT. The sexy ones always show up when you are projectile... anything. Almost ten hours and two bags of fluid later, I was allowed to leave the hospital."Oh, but Anna," you say. "How could you have possibly known this unfortunate illness was the result of excessively greasy pizza, premade salad and buffet style fruit?" Well, the neighbors who had gone around the same time also spent a few days wrestling for the toilet. If we could sell explosive baby poop, we would have been in business. Amazing Jakes was the only food within a week that we all shared... I'm going to go ahead and place the blame there.That pizza tastes exactly the same coming up 24 hours later. Thanks there Amazing Jakes. I am now thoroughly terrified to set foot in a buffet place again.Have to agree with some of the reviews here. You should only go here if you want to lose a lot of weight quickly from vomiting and the other end all night long. Dirty dirty dirty. Everything is dirty and nasty and on top of it all they charge you way to much. Chuckie cheese is a cleaner place then this and I would not want my dog eating off the floor of this place.  I am sorry to be so harsh, but this is the sad reality of this place.  If you own the place and are reading this, fix it up a little - do a better job and more people would probably come.  Think about quality and your kids eating and playing there.I was not amazed. Nope. Sometimes it's fun to act like a kid again. I love Dave and Buster's, but we were in the mood for go karts and it was too hot outside for Fiddlestix. I saw a deal online and should've realized then it was too good to be true.We got 3 hours, some video game credits, and a meal for about $20 each. When I was reading the description online, I was picturing this: large pizza and salad buffet (ok, I wasn't really expecting a lot from this), indoor go karts, bowling, 18-hole mini golf course, rock climbing wall, indoor roller coaster.. I was sorely disappointed.As soon as we walked in the door, I noticed everything seemed cheap. A lot of the paint here is sloppy, and in areas the floor is messed up. The furnishings are well worn. It looked like there used to be a large grocery/big box store here that was repurposed.  I'd already paid for our tickets online, so we proceeded.First, we ate the buffet. There were grubby grubby children all over- I have no problem with kids (or I wouldn't have come here in the first place) but there was no supervision whatsoever at the buffet, and some children don't know enough manners to be by themselves. I stayed away from a few of the items for this reason- not enough tongs and too many dirty hands touching noses and foodses!The "salad bar" was pathetic. Plain iceberg lettuce and not much to go with it. The pizza wasn't much either, very bland but I can see kids liking it. The pasta was the same, along with being overcooked. For dessert I had an ice cream cone and a rice krispie treat...those are hard to get wrong. We each got a beer- it took about 10 minutes just to flag someone at the liquor counter down. Eager to go be "amazed", we quickly drank the beers in a faux garden and then made our way onward. We went to the other side of the building to start our "fun". To let our food digest, we decided to go for the mini golf first. Probably 75% of the holes are just simple variations on straight lines and zigzags. The landscaping is pathetic..I think maybe it was supposed to be beach-themed? I felt like I could build something better in my backyard. Again, it was totally unsupervised so kids were running from hole to hole, going in the wrong order, and getting in the way. Next, we tried the "indoor roller coaster". If you've ever been to a fair, it's a Himalaya. It's a very old, rickety, bumpy Himalaya. I had bruises on my legs after riding this. I was somewhat worried it would fall apart while we were on it.By now, we were getting a little low on time and decided to go over to the go karts. There was a long, long line that seemed to move so slowly. They only had 4 karts, and only ran 2 at a time while the next 2 people sat waiting. We soon saw why- this go kart track is just a small oval. We decided to make the best of it, and anxiously waited our turns. At long last, we were racing! Well, that was until they decided my fiance was driving too fast and *electronically slowed his car*. That pretty much took all of the fun out of it. After that, we used the credits on our cards- the games were not a great value so they were all gone within about 10 minutes. I didn't even win enough tickets to get good junk candy, so I ended up giving my card to a coworker for his kids. Initially, we had thought about bowling after our time expired (you have to pay extra). However, by the time we'd been through the whole experience, we wanted to get out of this dump and back home. Amazing Jake's may be good for kids who don't know any better, but it's not a good place to try and have fun if you're just adults who wish they were kids.It doesn't really feel fair to give Amazing Jake's 4 stars, because there are really two experiences going on within those walls.  You've got the culinary struggle, and then the action from all the games/rides.Based on food alone, they'd get a generous 2 stars, with the only saving grace being their limited salad bar.  All of the other pabulum aint fab-u-lum.  They should could call it "ween cuisine", cuz all it takes is one time Cuz, and you wont be back no mowww (what you say!).  Mushroom fettuccine sounds delightful, until you get a punch from whatever that whacky-ass oyster essence is.The pizza was a train wreck... a train wreck with fatalities... that spilled like 1000 gallons of ammonia, which threatens to asphyxiate the nearest small town.Man, go to Cici's buffet.  See what those playas bring to the table for $5, and then try to replicate.  Better yet, take $100 from the till and hit the nearest Little Caesars.  Daaaang!The dessert case proudly boasts "Freshly Baked"... what you don't know, is what month it was freshly baked, cuz Money, it wadn't today.And I know the difference between ice cream, frozen yogurt, and frickin ice milk.  Ya hoodwinked me, G!  But in the eyes of a 4yo, this place is almost as fun as Disneyland.  She was sooo excited to go on all of the rides, so if you've got a little adrenaline junkie too, the mini coaster will hold the pinnacle of thrills.And one word of advice.  When you're leaving, and you see that free photo kiosk hanging on the wall, where you can email the photo to yourself... the touch screen is way out of calibration.  Check the email address twice before you hit send.  Even after checking it, you still may not get your portrait sent to you... and that makes daddy sad.

Review Text :
If you are looking for a detailed review of the sushi here, I can't help you.  I am not a sushi eater.  You may tie me to the whipping post now.  My husband, however, LOVES sushi.  He would like nothing better than to live in Japan again.  And I will say he is very impressed with Dozo.Since our relationship is not all about me, I allow him to take me to dinner here once for every 20 times I make him eat Mexican food.  And I admit, I always enjoy it too.  They have a great menu in addition to sushi.  I always have a combination which is tempura with your choice of entree.  Fantastic tempura every time.  I've tried the katsu chicken, terriyaki salmon, and plum chicken as well.  Service is excellent.  The servers actually seem to appreciate your business and the sushi chef always thanks us as we are leaving even though we're not sitting at the sushi bar.  Relaxed, casual atmosphere.  No need to ho up to come here.  Very enjoyable.I don't miss much about Portland...but what I do miss, I miss a lot!With specific regard to good eats, I miss Lew's Dairy Freeze where they sold almost mystical coney island hot dogs...what the hell did they put in that sauce?!?!? It was great!I also miss Sumida's...Sumida san was sushi chef of the first water...trained as a sushi master since boyhood, he was the real deal.I loved to go to Sumida's for lunch and watch sumo on the big screen TV (Sumida san had a satellite dish...live sumo:) and eat until I felt like I was going to explode...so good, so relaxed, so "homey"...I even got know who was who in sumo:)Flash forward through SF to Scottsdale and directly to Dozo!No sumo on the big screen, but everything else is right at Dozo.Robert, the sushi master and owner is as scrupulous about his fish and process as Sumida san was and the results show in the sushi and sashimi...beautiful feasts for the eyes and a treat for your palette:)I had a business lunch there yesterday (that's right, I am getting to pick the lunch spots again:)I had the sushi and sashimi lunch...a bargain at $13!...nigiri sushi and sashimi, along with a salad and miso soup:) The sushi and sashimi are chef selections and always presented beautifully, created fresh for you, in the moment, by the sushi master:) I was going to go into detail about what he made for me but you know what, your sushi experience will be different and you should go to Dozo and try all of it...I have:)It's a sublime experience...I think a good sushi master knows what I want better than I do:)My lunch companion was not a sushi fan and went for the salmon teriyaki...he pronounced it some of the best he's ever had...always a reasonably good indicator of satisfaction:)There is not much more to tell you about Dozo...I don't know if it's the best in town (I hear good things about Yasu), but it may be the best in Scottsdale:)If they had sumo on the big screen, I might never leave:)Domo Arigato, Mr. Roberto:)Don't let the "I used to be some sort of restaurant with a drive-through" appearance fool you - Dozo is a GREAT spot for Japanese food.  A place where the food is tasty, the staff is friendly and it is not over-styled and trying to be a nightclub.  The word dozo can be translated as "please", as in "be my guest".  My friend and I have certainly been made to feel very welcome on (multiple!) visits.  Sushi?  Oh yes!  Consistently fresh and nicely presented.  Try the yellowtail sashimi, albacore tataki or maybe a Dynamite roll stuffed with slightly spicy scallops.  Your taste buds will thank you.  Not a fan of fish in the raw?  No problem!  Dozo has an extensive selection of cooked items, including a to-die-for hamachi kama (yellowtail collar) served with a light, citrusy ponzu.  Wait, forget that part.  Don't order that or there won't be enough for me!  :)If you like loud music, shot girls and lots of California rolls topped with gooey sauces, Dozo is not for you.  That is why I like it.Itadakimasu!!Had a craving for donburi!  So I came in here with my son.  The menu was extensive good chocies between sushi and non sushi items.  We were not that hungry so I ordered one dish to be shared between my son and I.  I felt bad for the waitress and she couldn't help but give us a stare.  Luckily, my son was so charming and loving and funny that by the end of the meal he had totally won her over and I left a tip amount as though we had ordered two entrees.The only disappointment was of course the donburi.  The donburi I crave for and remember is a donburi from long ago when I was a student at Ann Arbor where they would pile on the rice in a big bowl and pile on top a big pile of gooey mixture of onion, egg, and chicken.  It was soooo good!  I haven't been able to find the remembered donburi anywhere else since then.I think I need to recreate it in my own kitchen to satisfy not necessarily my stomach but my memory.  Not kidding.

Review Text :
I felt somewhat sheepish eating here.  Really?!  You are from the bay area and you go to a SF style restaurant on a Vegas vacation?  Yes, bitches.  Because it is so fucking good.I had kobe beef for the first time at this gorgeous restaurant.  My mouth was delighted!  Ever since then, the beef I have eaten pales in comparison.  Mouth not happy!Yes, it is expensive, but worth it.  If you are going for a high-end dining experience, this is a good spot.do you want to be one of ocean's 11 or nick cage in leaving last vegas? if you choose to be the former, do not spend that last $60 at the poker or roulette table. here's how you should spend that $60 and still could feel like a winner even after you lost everything. - order a 3 course prix fixe dinner from nobhill for $40 - pay about $15-$16 as tip for their impeccable service (you'd feel like a high roller) - the rest goes to the city and the state, unless you know a way to avoid it... nobhill indeed is the best thing happened on the strip. where else can you enjoy a piece of michael mina for under $40? p.s. - this review is WAY overdue (like about a year!), but better late than never, right? :) i don't have that photographic memory so the review cannot be elaborated, but trust me, you'd rather bet on michael mina for $40 than anything else in vegas.What to do when you're in Las Vegas and already missing home? Stop by the Nobhill Tavern by Michael Mina of course ! A sumptuously designed restaurant distilling the essence of what a tavern should be by adding a modern twist.  Alcoholic beverages to accomodate  weary travelers and a comprehensive fusion cuisine to satisfy any palate.   The long walls of panelled glass draped in a dark forest green fine haberdashery provided the intimate dining cubicles complete with soft lit lighting and music to soothe the spirit. What I tasted from the menu: Shared lobster rolls- perfectly seasoned and just the right homemade mayo and herbs to highlight the sweet lobster meat on light pillow bread. Delicious. Striped bass cooked perfectly crispy skin and translucent white meat, simply salt and pepper seasoning- perfect with delicious broth. Sides of Green kale and cannelloni and kidney beans ( a bit too salty). The highly recommended lobster pot pie was as sublime as what our server described it as being. It is comparable to the Plaza Athenee Lobster except the domed buttery pastry covering the lobster "stew" was replaced by a heavenly souffle. The lobster consomme was delicious and velvety smooth with hints of the remaining essence of cognac stewed in the mirepoix juices for hours and hours. Dessert I tried was the Tarte Tatin- but found it substantially redone that it lost the simple goodness of what this tart should have been. Just full bold caramelization of the apples on a buttery dough. Their dough was hard and overly seasoned cinnamon and cloves. It doesn't need to be a purist to really say that it was just a poor rendition. Minus one star. Other mentionable: Drinks were well made with special attention to the Martinis andour attentive server provided impeccable service.PS. It was a wonderful start to celebrate NYE. Woot Woot! :-) Happy New Year!!!UPDATE: We want to thank Nobhill Tavern's bartender extraordinaire, Michael, for making our wedding's cocktail hour so spectacular. You see, Michael, maker of my favorite cocktail in the world, the Cable Car, aka spiked Orange Bang, aka spiked Orange Julius, gave us a crash course last fall on how to make these frothy wonder drinks. From our first sip, two years ago, to our 50th, all made by him, we knew that this was what we wanted for our signature drink. Michael graciously made that happen for us.He took a good chunk of time out of his day to show us step-by-step directions, tricks and tips. It probably helped that since we see him EVERY TIME we're in Vegas and knows us by name, we're almost family. The reason he was so vital is because Nobhill Tavern's Cable Car can't be duplicated. Trust me, I've searched, tried and sipped. We even had one at Caesar's Palace, just to compare, and it was absolute swill. Everyone we've ever taken to Nobhill Tavern has gotten absolutely hooked on their Cable Cars. I'm not talking, "yeah, that was pretty good," I'm talking, "do we have time to go back to Nobhill Tavern?" and "since we're in Vegas, can we stop by MGM and get some Cable Cars?" Nobhill Tavern really crafts a work of art and we can't thank Michael enough for making our signature drink, the toast of our big day! PS Their food is pretty damn good too, unfortunately, since those super tasty Cable Cars sneak up on you, I can't recall specifics from any of my meals other than I recall it being yum. I def do recall that the service was spectacular because those Cable Cars were coming out to our table lighting fast as if on a conveyor belt.If you want to see Michael in action, minus some extra special instruction, see here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvCWP3mjZRkWith suitcases in hand we checked this place out to satisfy my curiosity about Michael Mina. I've heard his name thrown around here and there when the conversation is about restaurants. Why is he famous? Why does have so many restaurants??NEW ENGLAND CRAB & LOBSTER ROLLS ($17) - 3 pieces of warm bread with crab & lobster goodness on top. Scrumptious!SEARED FOIE GRAS ($25) - It was perfectly seared and buttery. It also had an apple compote that made it super sweet, super yummy!FRENCH FRIES ($7) - Perfectly salted and perfectly crunchy.BEIGNETS ($9) - So warm, so soft, and so sugary! Then I dipped it in the chocolate caramel sauce....ohmanohmanohman, I was in pure ecstasy! The salty caramel ice cream was a delightful bonus to this dish!CHRIS-TINI ($14) - There was something beyond sweetness, something odd and sour that made me a bit dizzy. I liked it!SUMMER FLING ($14?) - So good yet so bad...The first sip wormed its way into my brain and made me giddy!SERVICE - There was 1 to 2 people standing in each corner watching the dining room. At least they were on it when we needed something. But as the restaurant got busier, we saw less and less of our waiter. We had to flag him down when I wanted to order dessert, when we wanted more drinks, and when we were ready to pay. But my tummy was happy so I wasn't upset with the wait. And props to the manager for hiding our suitcases in his office.After a few appetizers and drinks I kind of understood why Michael Mina is known by a lot of foodies. AHHHH...dining here was a great way to end this Vegas trip! Now I'm curious about the other Michael Mina restaurants!

Restaurant name  Eden's Grill Inn

Review Text :
Eden's Grill is, without question, home to some delicious, homemade Middle Eastern food. Not since going to the houses of friends of my father many years ago have I tasted food like this. I should clarify...There are great Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix, but a lot of the places have food that tastes like restaurant/deli food. This is not bad at all...restaurant food can be very delicious. But, then there are places that serve food the way "Mom" makes it. It's that special little bit of love that I'm talking about. In the case of Eden's Grill, "Mom" IS making the food. Well, not my mom, but the mom of the great waitress that served my table today (So sorry I didn't catch her name.). For our lunch, Bobby T and I went for a side of hummus and baba, a gyro plate and a beef kebab sultani plate. The hummus and baba were solid, loaded with garlic and topped generously with olive oil. The gyro plate was also solid, the meat wasn't too dry and the veggies were definitely fresh. Above the previous two menu items stood the beef kebab sultani. Each bite had the two of us smiling because it was so good. The kebab meat had flavor infused into the core of each piece...never did I chew a bite and not get the flavor of the marinade. It was awesome. We also got to taste some of their hot dolma. I have only been served hot dolma at three restaurants, and each time they have been great; definitely worth trying if you're a dolma fan.There is one last thing that we tried that everyone needs to come to Eden's Grill for though, and that is the rice - basmati w/ golden raisins and chopped almonds. The rice especially tasted like it was made with love and not just by a chef. I still crave it as I write this (good thing there was plenty left over). I'm excited about this "new" find for me, and I think other Yelpers should be as well.I feel like part of a new secret club after discovering this tasty little hot spot.  It's even spelled homous (not hummus), so you know you've hit the authentic homous jackpot here. (say it with me... hhhhhhooomuuuus)I went on a date here, he picked the place.   Bonus points to him!   If you do go on a date here, or if you generally want to speak to anyone after eating here, you may want to pack a toothbrush and mouthwash.  Hellooooo garlic!!!      Don't get me wrong, I love me some garlic, but consider yourself forewarned!!    That goodnight kiss could turn evil real quick, so if you want a second or third date, pack your breathmints!  =) We split a plate for 2 which was the beef, lamb and chicken.  We both thought we just ordered the beef and chicken, so the lamb was a little bonus.  And I'm glad, because the chicken and the lamb were definitely the best!   While the order says it's for 2 - it's actually probably a portion for 4 - 5 people.   We ate until full and then took two to-go boxes.  I ate it for lunch and dinner the next day.  I'm STILL oozing garlic from my pores. The saffron rice was delish.   Servers were non-invasive, but still attentive and friendly.  Loved the neighborhood vibe here - people walked in and were obviously regulars, there was a big birthday party going on, overall just a nice, relaxed vibe.  Great for a date or for families.Sincerely,Uninspired in PhoenixI've had Eden's Grill Bookmarked for a while now, seeing as I do enjoy a good gyros and today I happened to be just round the corner and hungry. I pulled up Yelp, went to my bookmarks, low and behold a nearby 4.5 star! I quickly decided, "That's where were going" and away we went. Now many of my reviews come from inspiration, something seems to catch my attention. Maybe it was the amazing house made ketchup, perhaps the superior service, or the cooked to perfection polenta. Inspiration sometimes comes also from a crude wait staff, under cooked chicken, or runny macaroni and cheese. Today, I find no inspiration and thus, this spot gets filed as Vanilla. Not quite one of my favorites, but an OK choice if it's easily accessible and no alternative choices to speak of.Upon arrival the wait staff seemed to be hours deep into a game of poker. Showing neither excitement nor distain to see me enter the dining room, they certainly had an amazing poker face. "Two?" she asked, then escorted us to one of the eight available tables in a dining room of ten tables. $7.95 for a gyros and (salad, fries, or rice) seemed like a square deal to me, so I ordered up a "gyros with a salad - and please, no onions or tomato." I knew I could break that poker face of her's; although, I didn't expect it to be in offense to me wanting no tomato on my food. It's rare I get asked "you want no tomato?... on your salad!?" with a sneering look of offence, as if my personal distain of tomatos somehow reflected poorly on her or the kitchen staff. Sadly, the salad; having fresh lettuce, cucumber, and a "barely there" amount of feta cheese - just enough to "call it out" on the menu as an included ingredient, was bland. Adding salt and pepper to a salad is never a sign of a good salad or dressing. Along comes the gyros, and tasty as it was, the gyros meat was sliced super thin - no problems if you like it that way though, and it was also topped with the onions I specifically requested to be omitted from my meal; I quickly picked those off myself.Maybe it was an off day, maybe it's just me be picky, maybe there were forces at work here that wanted my meal to be "pretty good, but uninspired", but this 4.5 star place seemed a little over stated, IMHO. It's possible I'll come back again, but hailing from central phoenix, it's rare I'm up this way, and more rare I'm up here and looking for something to eat.Happy Yelping Phoenix.This is a really nice Mom and Pop family owned restaurant with several Best of PHX awards. We have both been here several times and it is always really good. Mom does the cooking and her recipes are executed and seasoned to perfection.Located in a small strip mall next to the hardware store. This place is small but cozy and very simply decorated. They have an assortment of table sizes based on your group. The larger tables can easily accommodate those bigger family occasions.Normally come here for lunch and get one of the specials. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable. You can also request something off the dinner menu if you wish. This is a larger menu with items that are a little bit more fancy.My favorite so far is the Moroccan Chicken. She makes mine extra spicy and it is delicious. The Kebabs are also very good and the Salads are humongous. Mom's top secret Rice is so good that it just melts in your mouth. It is covered with toasted raisins and almonds and is at the top of my list to reproduce at home.Service is very friendly and helpful. You are always told to make yourself at home. They go out of there way to answer any of my questions or request.Food is always fresh and tasty and we always leave feeling full. Still have not had a chance to try out any of the many tasty desserts. Good reason to come back sooner than later. YUMMO!4.25 STARSI can't believe I've never stopped in here to have lunch before. This restaurant is family owned, laid back, and the owner personally serves you. But let's talk about the food. I ordered the chicken pita for $7.95 and when my friend told me the portion was generous- she was not kidding!  We shared the entree and there was still enough left over for me to take home for another meal!  The chicken breast cubed were tender and full of flavor. Look at the photos- you will not be disappointed by the food served here. And the lunch specials come with a side salad and a drink. All for $7.95!  I will definitely be back again. And again and again!  Hidden gem!!!Mom and I arrived to find EG bustling during lunch (it was around 1:15 pm).  There were around ten tables of different shapes and numbers of chairs.  Our server Noreen was amiable and eager.  She took our orders of water and left us to look at the menus.  I didn't find the lamb entree Mom mentioned, and when I asked Noreen about it, she said that while it was only on the dinner menu, she could get the kitchen to cook it.  Mom balked at the price ($18.95), so we stuck with the lunch menus.  She wanted to try the Gyros (#6), which came with "Mom's Rice with toasted raisins and almonds, grilled bell peppers, onions and tomatoes."  (No pic taken- sorry!)  The menu also mentioned that fries came with the order, but Mom's entree came without it.  I unfortunately did not know, or I would've asked Noreen about it.  I ordered the Chicken lunch combo, which was a chicken pita and choice of side (salad or fries) and beverage for $7.95, as well as Mom's Favorite Appetizer Platter ("tabula, falafal, and potato cake"), $13.95.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=brmcSOiLLJM3Girn0_3nXw#brmcSOiLLJM3Girn0_3nXwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=iP5cjNX1xAP9xQBZfa2RNQ#iP5cjNX1xAP9xQBZfa2RNQMom enjoyed her meal!  She ooh'ed and ahh'ed over the rice (which I tried in spite of a rice allergy, and yes it was good), as well as the pita that the lamb and beef slices were served on.  She preferred it over the standard pita that came with the appetizer plate.  When she mentioned to Noreen that her pita tasted better than the other pita we had on the table, Noreen kind of leaned in and said it was made in-house and that they cost a $1 a piece.  I asked Mom to break off a tiny piece, and sure enough, it felt different (thicker, more doughy, and a bit greasy) and tasted fresh from the fryer, making the store-bought pita seem like cardboard.  I didn't like the greasy aftertaste, though, but I did appreciate the flavor of butter in the beginning and the pita's textures.  I also enjoyed my chicken entree, which had juicy grilled chunks of chicken, strips of greens and tomato and onion slices (which I picked off before taking photos). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=1o5oZXbNdAK7_YNDihQ0Vw#1o5oZXbNdAK7_YNDihQ0Vw  The "white sauce" was a nice accompaniment, although the chicken didn't need it.  Mom and I split the side salad- it was good, although I found the dressing to be too tart.  I enjoyed- tremendously, I might add- the potato cakes that came in the appetizer plate... Wow!  Am I glad I spotted that Yelper's tip to order them!  They're basically button-shaped croquettes filled with seasoned and juicy ground beef.  Definitely a must-try!  I also enjoyed the falafel, even if they were a bit on the dry side, and a bit harder-to-the-touch than other falafel balls I've tried.  The sauce it came with was too bitter.  The tabula was too tart!  I could only bear about three small forkfuls before walking to where Noreen was, standing behind a counter, to tell her about it, and that perhaps the kitchen should taste it and understand what I mean.  She offered to replace it with "homous," and I took her up on it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=E5NYPbb9moOZyX2VMl9kpg#E5NYPbb9moOZyX2VMl9kpg  It had a pleasant mouth-feel, but again, I found it a bit sour.  Noreen later came back to say that the I was right- the tabula was very sour, that it needed more parsley, and to thanked me for letting them know.  Mom agreed with Su-Shien's review I read to her about size portions-- they were generous, and Mom likes generous servings, especially when they taste as good as her entree!  She wished she'd ask for more of the rice, instead of the homemade pita that we were sent home with, with an accompanying charge of $2.  I told her we could always go back for more...Last, but not least, we had some baklava, two pcs., $4.  Mom and I split one- it was perfect!  Loved the buttery, toasted, and flaky crust, and the rich, walnut filling.  It was so good that I could've eaten the second piece in a heartbeat, but also so satisfying that I didn't feel the need to overdo it.  A great way to end a good meal.I'd return back just to have more of those potato cakes! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=6RVy7cQMG8RVosc6PvM3fQ#6RVy7cQMG8RVosc6PvM3fQI've been coming here for quite awhile now and was surprised by my review of this place. I love the family owned business. The mom and the brother is in the back as cooks, the older sister is the owner, and the younger sister is the hostess and waitress. They are all from Iraq and their food is all from the Middle East. I've notice they've upgraded their place. Walls painted, nice new floor, with nice new table tops. They got rid of those gaudy pink table clothes. I really like their decor. A lot better than before. We always order the potato cakes. It comes with three in an order, garnished with cucumbers, and tomato slices with a yogurt dipping sauce. It's so good. It's crispy on the outside with a meat filling on the inside. Put some of that yogurt sauce on it then I'm in heaven. To die for. Really like it as you can tell. Me an my wife always order one dish and we split. It enough for two people. I could probably eat a whole dish but would be totally stuffed but sharing is perfect. Today we had the chicken and lamb kebab. It comes on a bed of rice with golden raisins and almond slivers with grilled vegetable which included green peppers, tomatoes, and onions. Lamb was so tender and chicken was so moist. Really good. Loved it. They used to give even bigger portions with about two or three scoops more of rice but their portions are just perfect. One thing is their prices stayed the same with smaller portions. Doesn't matter to me cause it's still enough for two. Just love the grilled lamb and chicken. We've had their deserts before but not tonight even though they have some of the best deserts. They said they used to own a bakery back east and bake a lot of their deserts so if you have a chance try their deserts. You won't be disappointed. So this place is small with about 10 to 12 tables. Very busy on the weekends. Great food and friendly service. Sometime they can get busy and sometimes come off as not being as friendly but the service is good. So trust me. I love this place and will for sure be back. Enjoy.

Review Text :
Serrano's is to Mexican food as Friday's is to American food.That is to say Beans and Rice are to French Fries as Corona is to Budweiser.What I mean is Chimichanga is to Cheeseburger as Salsa and Chips is to Bread and Butter.So you have Quesadilla to Pizza as Margarita to Cosmopolitan.In summary, Two stars is to restaurant ratings as Die Hard is to movies.  It'll get the job done but it won't be memorable or soon repeated.

Just like the best places to get a Chicago dog IN Chicago, this spot is one part good food, one part hole-in-the-wall atmosphere, one part genuinely friendly service. They've got good prices too.The namesake dog is done right on the requisite sesame seed bun, get yourself more than one or upgrade the size. If you're not in the mood for that, grab a Philly- the small is sized just right for a solo diner, and the bread is sturdy and fresh. Add on a side of chili cheese fries (with liquid cheese, not shredded!), ask for white onions on top. If you really want to take it back old-school, get a pizza puff or a supreme tamale and let the flavors take you back to childhood.Bonus points for having Green River soda, Dusseldorf mustard, green relish, sport peppers, Giardiniera, and other treats to stock up on at home. Their daily $5-$6 meal deals are worth the trip, too.

Disclaimer Alert:  This review is just on their donuts, not the main restuarant. That being said, by the looks of their menu, there's an extensive line of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Prices look decent, especially since America is inside a casino.  We arrived around 7:30 AM and there wasn't much of a line.  So, I'm sure we'll be back one day for some real food. As for my review...it's all about their donuts. I tried their maple bar with chocolate drizzle and some of their cronuts.  The maple bar wasn't as good as it looks.  The donut wasn't fresh, it was lacking any flavor, and for about $3, way to expensive.  However, I think America's has some of best cronuts that I've had in Las Vegas. I have my favorite out there, but America had a unique taste to their's.  Their cronuts were layered with the outside of each layer having a crunchiness to them.  It was moist inside each layer and as you get closer to the center of this hybrid donut, it's even softer.  There's a uniquie citrus taste to these cronuts which appeals to me.  America may have bad maple bars, but sure made a huge comeback with delicious cronuts. PS:  Additional photos of America's cronuts can be found here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donut-crawl-ii-las-vegas?select=IWJfpUAAiQK3e4zSSwB2Wg#IWJfpUAAiQK3e4zSSwB2WgYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (057/366)We stopped here for breakfast one morning since we were staying at the New York, New York. The hubby got the all you can eat pancakes for $7.95. The first go around, they bring out a stack of three pancakes. After that, it comes in a stacks of twos. The hubby ate five pancakes in total. He said that the pancakes were light and fluffy.After reading so many articles about the famous croissant doughnut, I had to try it. This was the first time that I'd seen a Cronut in my life. It's truly the best pastry that I've had in a long time. Yes, it must be really bad for you and really fattening, but it's so good. It's hollow on the inside, which makes it light and airy. On the outside, it has a sugary glaze, and is flaky and crispy. It really doesn't get much better.I like the decor of this restaurant. While it's not fancy or sophisticated like fine dining, it's bright and clean. They have this piece of artwork that hangs from the ceiling. It's a map of the United States and has decorations of what each state is known for. Alaska and Hawaii is off to the side and have their own little section. At first when I didn't see Hawaii on the map, I was disappointed. I'm glad I looked over to the side and saw it.

Review Text :
With expresso running through my veins...I guess it would be an understatement to say that I am always in search of a good coffee shop to make my next destination.  A friend has been telling me to try this awesome place out...of the 5 mins i was in this place..I was terribly disappointed at the customer service they provided.   I ordered 3 shots of expresso with 3 pumps of toffee nut over ice.  Seeing the price of the triple shot (2.50 + flavor shots)...I questioned the girl helping me when she quoted Over 3.50...She told me that if i order this over ice...it costs more than if i ordered it hot. (#1 reason I didn't think it was right).  So i told her to just give me a cup of ice on the side.  She charged me $2.81.  i was fine with that... I got my drink and poured about 2 tablespoons of half/half in my espresso.  Then the owner came up to my table, and said that if i poured milk in my drink next time and poured it over ice, he'll have to charge me more.  (#2 reason i didn't appreciate this place) I was a bit confused so i asked for clarification about my drink and to my disbelief, he said the next time i came in his shop and ordered my three expresso shots with flavor shots, I'd need to pay for if I add a splash of milk to my drink since he has something on the menu like that. First of all, The amount of half/half i added was nothing amounting to the 80-90% of milk which goes into a latte (its was literally only a splash), I order the drink I wanted like any good customer would and used a bit of the condements (which i thought was free to customers who purchased something from the menu) on the side...and to have the owner come over and haggling me about it was unacceptable to me. Although there might have been a small difference in price (0.50), I didn't order the latte because it wasn't what i wanted.  He rudely made it a point to tell me that he'll be charging me for a drink i won't be ordering.    I was upset so i returned the drink to the girl who helped me and told her that although the expresso was good, I wasn't coming back.  Totally no sense of customer service...for a $0.50 difference...He lost must more since I won't be bringing them any business.   I recommend Saxbys in Henderson.  I live only 2 miles from this coffee shop and I drove over 30 minutes to visit madhouse coffee.  NEVER AGAIN.******   Update 8/18/2011*****************************8I honestly don't think the owner was trying to be a pest....in retrospect, he was trying to ensure that his place stays in business.  But a tip for a consumer would be, there are better ways to approach the situation.  It really isn't good business to charge someone more for ordering expresso over ice vs. Expresso hot.  Secondly,  I order what i order with coffee because I like the taste of it.  if there was a stipulation as to how i should order my drinks because management doesn't like it simply because he isn't able to weed a penny more from me, I just don't come back.  This only employs other coffee shops that don't do that.  I pay less, but in return, I give quite a bit of tip. :)It's a quite a figurative slap in the face when you support a company through purchasing the product often, promoting the company on websites such as yelp, and getting to know the staff and even establish a relationship with the owner and then get a BRUSH OFF that leaves you feeling snubbed, and worse - unappreciated.I get it.  The owner wants to enjoy his music.  The SAME music that was playing the previous night at the SAME very loud decibels.  I enjoy loud music - I WORK IN A CLUB!  That's fine!  NOT at a coffee house.  Everything I loved about this place - the relaxed atmosphere, the chill crowd, the great place to sketch client work and play my DS - gone.  I spent years giving my money to great drinks, sandwiches, and conversation with the overnight baristas.  Instead is pounding dubstep music, baristas who complain about the owner's repetitious music, and six dollar drinks.  Don't get me wrong - I will pay good money for great product that wants me there.  But after politely inquiring about the volume level being turned down and having a barista tell me no and the owner refusing to even look at me - I'm done.  It's not called entitlement - it's GOOD SERVICE.   I say hello to staff, order my drink, chat for a few minutes, and get to work, sometimes ordering a sandwich or snack.  Apparently, that's not enough to justify the music getting turned down.Add this to my previous visit when I was accused of owing the store MONEY when they confused me with another customer whose card didn't charge, making me wait for twenty minutes while the staff ran around calling individuals, then finally made me a drink and sent me on my way.  Incredibly frustrating.I'm frankly just disappointed in this establishment as this used to be a staple in my routine and I'm not returning anytime soon.  I'll give my money to Sambalatte or hell, the ItsAGrind down Durango.EDIT: Be sure to read the owner's response.  There was nothing polite or professional in response to my review, my opinion, labeled "crying."  Lowering the volume to music that I ENJOY is a little is a "dramatic change" that is selfish and self entitled.  Really?  Again, disappointing on all fronts.There's something off about a place if they try to charge you twice the price for a drink if you want it iced instead of hot - especially if it's a simple chai latte. In the end, I settled for a regular iced latte and it tasted like 95% milk and 5% coffee. Not so good.I bought a two drinks, which amounted to 1 hour of wifi (why isn't wifi free in the first place?) and the cashier insisted that I could only get the 30 minute wifi code. What even.I only tried this place out because so many people told me it was amazing. I really don't see it. The only thing I like is that it's open 24/7 and has a nice vibe to it. However, the whole drink ordeal and the customer service put me off - the employees only really talked to the people they already knew and the cashier was the opposite of friendly. I really wanted to like this place but I just can't. Maybe if I were a smoker I would appreciate the expansive outdoor patio more, but I couldn't even take advantage of that feature.Bumping this up to two stars because my friend got tea that tasted decent. If I ever go back, I'd probably stick to the tea.If you have money to waste on mediocre food & service ..this is the spot for you.My husband and I were invited by friends back in November 2012. At first we really enjoyed it, then started noticing unprofessional attitude by the owner, such as alcohol on the breath, and shouting at the staff in front of patrons. The owner's claims that former patrons just "hung out" without purchasing anything is erroneous and inflammatory; furthermore, these patrons are personally responsible for bringing in many new customers.I fully expect to have the owner remove this negative review; that is his prerogative. However, just know this...word gets around Marco.This joint packs tons of character in such a small space. With art covering the walls and a quirky type of jazz coming out of the speakers, the atmosphere is simultaneously fun and mellow with friendly baristas to match. Small groups will find it more spacious outside on the patio, but there are a few tables inside. Solo sippers have more freedom with all the counters and barstools along the walls. If you don't intend to get cozy, MadHouse also has a drive-thru; if you do, it's open all day and all night.Their sizes have normal names! A medium blended drink comes in a 24-ounce cup, the equivalent of a Starbucks venti in size, but its contents are full of creativity and taste. Their grasshopper is a subtly minty mocha combination. I like their crushed coconut mocha, but have much more of their menu to try. I've only indulged in their blended drinks, but their brewed coffees and sandwiches tempt me every time! If you want to use their internet, let them know when you order and you'll receive a one-time use code. The time limit is based on how much you spend (e.g. $4-7 = one hour of WiFi, $10+ = four hours), so the more you pay, the longer your WiFi privileges stay. I haven't settled on a favorite drink yet, but I've discovered my new perch.Yelp 100 Challenge * 100/100 Madhouse coffee is located less than a mile away from where I live and I can't believe I have kept myself away from this Hippie, San Francisco-esque coffee shop for so long!Late Thursday afternoon and pretty tired out from schoolwork, I came here for a More Cowbell sandwich treat - roast beef folded into a slice of herb infused focaccia bread and topped with cheddar, lettuce and tomatoes - and a Nutella white chocolate frappe. As if they weren't filling enough, I made an effort to take myself out of study mode to appreciate the cool artworks around the cafe and random funny deets on the cashier. That fed my artsy soul pretty well and I came out of there physically and spiritually refreshed. For $10 or more spent, you get a wifi code. There's a patio out for peeps in need of a smoke and did I say this cafe is open 24 hours? Coming here to study again soon and get things done!Items selected:Croissant Bread PuddingWhite Chocolate Raspberry MacaronAlmond CroissantNutellamisuAmericanoWith 9 on the Plate not yet serving up sweets and myself running low on caffeine it was to MadHouse Coffee that I walked after dinner and always hoping to find a new, local coffee shop to love and support I'll simply say that save for the kitschy décor and 24-hour service there isn't a whole lot to like about MadHouse at all.  Locally owned and operated with a menu of drinks both classic and novel plus a collection of "pastries baked fresh on the premises" it with a simple Americano that my experience began and faring well enough at a mere $2.50 it was onward to pastry that I moved, the promise of '100% Charent Butter' ostensibly promising the quality of Echire but not a single item better than average, with one in particular an early contender for worst thing I'll eat in 2014.  Starting first with a $3.24 Almond Croissant it would be hard to imagine something more doughy and less crisp coming from 7-Eleven and moving right along to a $2.50 White Chocolate Raspberry Macaron with decent crackle yielding gummy crumb and sweet 'frosting' of a non-descript flavor I sat and wondered exactly what was going on; a brief reprieve found in admirable, albeit microwave-heated bread pudding drizzled in light caramel.  At this point sitting with half a macaron and 2/3 of the croissant unfinished it was last, and certainly least that I moved to the 'nutellamisu" and while certainly not the prettiest presentation nothing could have prepared me for the taste - an acrid, sour, and questionably spoiled cream cheese 'pudding' debauchery of the Italian classic that tasted nothing of Nutella or Tiramisu, a second bite of the $3.95 cup yielding similar results and landing it plus the remaining pastries in the trash as I left the store thankful I'd not yet finished my coffee so as to cleanse my palate.So, we're leaving lunch when the coffee craving hits me and I pull up Yelp to find MadHouse Coffee. The whole way there, I'm thinking I have been here before, and not until we pulled up did I realize we came here a few years back when it was It's A Grind. From what I remember, it's definitely changed. It's a fairly small spot and even though it's a little hipsterish, I dig the art on the walls and some of the quirky little knick-knacks lining the counter.The menu here is pretty big and naturally, the first thing that caught my eye was the mention of Nutella in multiple items. They've got quite a few unique items too like mocha frappes in Cake Batter, Red Velvet and my pick, the Monkey Mocha, which is peanut butter and banana. While both the peanut butter and banana flavor were really good in the drink, it was a way too watered down for me. The wifey had the Cake Batter Mocha and it was so insanely sweet, I don't even know how she drank it. I also got what they call the Nutellamisu and wasn't a huge fan. It didn't taste anything like Nutella and I think it may have been old. It was ok, but the taste just wasn't right and the ladyfinger portion of it was super soggy.My biggest reasoning for the two stars is the employees. Whenever I go somewhere that has an open kitchen or whatever you call it in a coffee shop, I tend to watch what everyone's doing. Not because I want to nitpick, but because I'm legitimately interested and intrigued by what goes on back there. So, as I'm sitting there watching the two people back there work, I notice the girl keeps eating food behind the counter. And she kept doing that thing where when you eat something crumbly, you're almost putting your fingers in your mouth to catch it. Well, after she does that...she goes right to making something else and touching other food that was for a customer in the drive thru. Coupled with their not so friendly attitudes, it seemed weird and gross to me that she's back there eating, but not washing her hands. It was enough for me not to want to try anything else on the menu, including the sandwiches, which looked pretty good too by the way.Prices aren't terrible, but they aren't great either. A medium blended drink will set you back about $6, which made our total bill just under $18 with two mochas and the Nutellamisu. For me, there was very little to like here and unless I was in the area at some weird hour craving coffee, I probably won't be coming back.We ordered two drinks and two sandwiches. I really like that they offer Almond Milk, but dislike that it is an additional $1 extra. (That is outrageous!) I ordered the Green Card (Turkey, guacamole & minus the bacon for me), and the bf ordered The Very Charming Pig (Ham, Swiss, Cream Cheese and Bacon) I ordered mine with no bread and he ordered his on Focaccia. His Focaccia had an upcharge vs the ciabatta, which would have probably been fine, if it wasn't for mine being the same price as normal without either bread. I get a little frustrated at these restaurants up charging for every thing, just because they know people prefer it. I'm sure we'll be back to try it again, but probably just the coffee side. Neither of us was overly enthusiastic about the food. Although I do like that they are open 24/7. I even noticed they were open on Christmas. Although I felt bad for the girl holding a sign out to inform everyone they were open Christmas morning.I'm MAD ABOUT YOU...you know who you are.  I'm also mad about this coffee spot.  I thank Antonia and Renzo for introducing me to this place.  Very hip Urban vibe with a fair amount of indoor seating and plenty of outdoor setting.  Love the decor!  The art on the walls that were made by local artists, kinda Urban hipster...very cool.  I've noticed plenty of locals come here to chill.  Being 24/7 makes it more inviting, and par for a city that never sleeps.  Madhouse has a great selection of goodies such as hot/cold coffee drinks(including the water drip cold brew), sandwiches, and various desserts(made in house), even macaroons. They also have Hookah to Relax you while you get Jolted from your coffee...hmm            One Vegas scorching summer day (is there any other?), when I first laid eyes on you, I mean Madhouse.  You know, Vegas=my ### is on fire=something COLD to drink.  I chose the NUTTELA WHITE CHOCOLATE MOCHA.  Later finding out it was a local favorite.  I can taste why...outstanding drink...an absolute must try!   I also had the LOONEY TUNA, which I wasn't too crazy mad about.  It was good, just not great.  Didn't taste the red apples, almonds, and for sure couldn't tell what 'few secret ingredients' they're talking about on the menu item description.  I like my tuna very looney, creamy with a lot of flavor and texture. The CROISSANT BREAD PUDDING was a tiny bit dry, but good.  I like my puddings tender and moist to the touch, yet firm enough to keep its shape.  Now I know why I'm mad about you.            What a great coffee house!  From a Yelp bookmark(never been, but looks good), to a regular(looking forward to going again)...already have 2 under my belt.

Restaurant name  Elephant Bar Restaurant

Review Text :
Lest some readers of this review think that I've suddenly lost my touch or perspective, I can only say in my defense that I have seen the woefully low overall Yelp rating for this establishment and read many of the low-rated reviews, but must nevertheless ignore them and honestly report on my recent trip to the Elephant Bar.   I don't know whether I had an atypical dining experience, or if Elephant Bar staff took heed to recited complaints and improved their food and service, or if other reviewers just encountered a bad day there, but my overall experience was enjoyable, and all dishes I sampled were tasty.  I began with very good Macau Shrimp Noodle Soup, sporting mushrooms, green onions, white onions, bok choy, and fairly large shrimp in a lightly spicy broth.  It was an unusual and interesting Asian-flavored dish.  For my entree, I selected Chicken Marsala, which included a nicely grilled chicken breast, pappardelle noodles, and a mild traditional Marsala Sauce, accompanied by a good cooked tomato half and sauteed spinach.  It was a filling and satisfying display.For dessert, what turned out to be a very big order of Strawberry Shortcake tasted good but I could have done without the thin Strawberry Sauce.  I also tried a friend's Creme Brulee, and it was very good.Service was friendly and on the whole very efficient.  Food and drink orders were correctly fulfilled.  But entrees arrived a little early after appetizers and soup.  And, on the initial bill the server had forgotten to credit Senior Explorer card discounts.  This oversight was quickly corrected.  Judging by this one personal encounter with the Elephant Bar situated in Henderson, and several previous good dining outcomes I have experienced at Elephant Bar restaurants throughout Southern California, I expect to return here fairly soon for other fare, like the tantalizing Chicken Lettuce Wraps with glistening moist bits of chicken, diced water chestnuts, unblemished green shells of lettuce, and peanut sauce that one of my tablemates simply was not willing to share.  Boo!  Hiss!The Elephant Bar is a place that I visit when other people make the choice to eat here.  It's in Henderson and popular with the work friends because we just head over after the work whistle blows.  I came here for dinner recently and as is usual for me, I searched their menu online beforehand to see if there was nutrition info available and there was.  I decided that I would either go with their chicken lettuce wraps or the petite sirloin, based on calories and protein content.  They happen to have a gluten-free menu as well as a "lighter" menu, which I appreciate.  Once there, my friends and I had great service from our waiter the whole time.  I went with the petite sirloin, which came with vegetables and a parmesan baked potato for only 450 calories and 36 g of protein--right up my alley.  It was a tasty meal and I was more than impressed with it since I didn't know if it was going to be good or not.  This is only the second time I've been here in maybe a year.  Between them, my friends had the mongolian beef and the shrimp and crab louie salad, with the mongolian beef looking like something I'd try the next time.  The pals also had a coupon for free strawberry shortcake with the purchase of two entrees and I had a sample taste of that:  delicious!  The bill came to $43, without the dessert being charged--not bad at all for three people.  Overall, this place has a lot of options on its menu, enough to satisfy everyone's palates and dietary needs.  I hear the happy hour is great, so I'll have to return and check that out sometime.Happy hour? Let's go to the Elephant Bar!  Located in the District directly next to the GVR, it's easy to find.  There is plenty of parking in this area.  I usually have better luck parking in the back for easy access to the restaurant.I've had good visits the majority of the time I have dined here.  They have great happy hour specials in the bar area.  The food has been great and pretty consistent.  The french onion sliders are fabulous.  Simple and Wonderful! The nachos are plentiful and great to share.  The buffalo chicken wontons are just ok to me.  I'd stick to the sliders and nachos for happy hour.  Their market cobb salad entree is delicious.  The chicken has a great seasoning which makes this salad yummy.  The service here for us has been hit and miss.   Sometimes my drink is empty for a while.   I've noticed on a few occasions during happy hour the bartenders are more interested in talking to each other than their customers.  Hmmm.  But mostly they have been good and attentive.It's a chain restaurant but it's one of those that I enjoy!We came on a Sunday evening and ordered 1. 2 Mango Swirls, 4.50ea2. Artichoke dip and chips 3. Kona BBQ ribs 4. Crispy shrimp and white rice for $37 (Used the 2 for $20 coupon that I received in the mail) - Seated right away. Hostess was pleasant. - Dining area very clean. Comfortable seating - Server was very nice. - We ordered one Mango Swirl, but she instead gave us 2. Didn't really feel like disputing since the drink was so delicious. haha. - Artichoke dip was average. Needs more artichoke. Not enough chips. We asked the server that handed our food for more chips and she said okay, but never came back with them. fail. Wasted dip. - Kona BBQ was exquisite. Loved how tender it was. Needs a bit more BBQ sauce. Not finger-licking enough. The meal also came with peach cobbler, fries, and cole slaw. - There was a mix of potato and sweet potato fries. Not fresh, but not old. Could be better. - Shrimp and rice was good. Reminded me of Pei Wei. Rice a bit harder than normal. Needs more water or change it to 3 ladies. haha. - Portion was enough for the dine. No extra. - Pleasant meal. Great location. Will come back with coupons. Rewards membership available.Came here for a quick bite with Cesar Q.  and some work peeps.  The ambiance at this restaurant/bar is great!  Love the safari theme.  The staff wears pretty cool safari type shirts with denim bottoms.We were greeted at the door and promptly seated in the back just off the kitchen.  There were 5 of us and apparently this was the only place for us!?  Whatever our food got to us quicker I suppose.We were lucky that there was someone in training so we had 2 servers.  We were asked what we wanted to drink and quite quickly we got our beverages.  Placed our order with ease.  The servers did a good job.I ordered a dinner salad and baked potato as my entree.  The salad was fine, nothing special.  My stuffed baked potato was good but the outside had been burnt with crispy black spots on it.  Such a let down.  We spilt one tortilla soup and I can say it was really quite good.  I'm not overly impressed by this place.  It's pretty ordinary something like an Applebee's type place.  Everything appeared to be pre measured.Would only come back if I have to because of work or drinks.

Review Text :
Once upon a time, there were Q'doba restaurants all over the place.  Now, you have to look for them....it's like an Easter Egg Hunt trying to find one.  Luckily, the Yelp app on my iPhone found one relatively nearby.  I made the trek to seek out their Queso Steak Burrito, which is one of my favorites.  I think they put crack in their Queso Sauce.....that's the only explanation I have for wanting to drive a ways to grab something from this joint.It didn't take long for me to finish the Queso Steak Burrito and a Side of Chips.  The Chips were *bleh*, but the Burrito was awesome.  I'll definitely be back.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ePxLE7eU4kRoags_ytAAg?select=vA0CDhsc27IY9r2zUjBUXAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ePxLE7eU4kRoags_ytAAg?select=aopb2citCn_x0UF-KeMI2AReturn Factor - 90%

Review Text :
I really wish that I could make this my go to bagel shop...but as the saying goes, 3 strikes and you're out. Prior to todays visit I would give Owens a solid 3 stars. They're Bagels are nothing to rave about...but they do have a pretty funky/unique space and they do offer tons of sandwich options. Personally, I don't really care for all these crazy sandwich combinations. I just want a GOOD bagel with some cream cheese...maybe an egg sandwich. I'm pretty sure if you take two pieces of card board, load it up with the grubby bubby or booty bagel options, or add avocado, tomato. etc - it's going to be tasty. If that's what people are into, that's cool. I'm more about the actual bagel, ya know? I've been eating Bagels all my life up in NY and I can honestly say that I was spoiled with the amount of great options that I had up there. And yes I get it, this is Charlotte -- Not NY. Now I'm not a professional, but I'm pretty sure this place skips out on one crucial step of the bagel making process - the poaching step. I do understand that boiling equipment is super expensive and also takes up lots of space. I'm pretty sure that they just brush their bagels with some water and a little baking soda (similar to what you would do with a soft pretzel) and then hit them with steam once they're in the oven. It's easy to identify an imposter by looking at the bottom of the bagel since steam wont get to the bottom of the bagel once its on a pan or in the oven.  LESSON OF THE DAY: If the bottom is much harder and darker than the rest of the bagel, you're eating a roll with a hole, not a bagel my friend! The bagels here almost remind me of one of those Thomas' bagels from the super market. But anyways, enough about the bagels.Today's experience brought them down to a 2 star rating - I ordered a bacon egg & cheese (with salt, pepper, ketchup) to go and I got a small coffee - My bill was  $8.39. The word "pricey" doesn't usually come out of my mouth....but I walked out of the store thinking to myself..."dear god, did I just pay almost $9 for a bagel & small coffee?"I get to my office, sit down and go to enjoy my sandwich, which for that price should have been wrapped in gold foil. Slowly, disappointment began sinking in (insert worlds saddest song on worlds smallest violin here**)1) My sandwich was pretty small - hey, it is what it is. I wouldn't complain about it being small if it at least tasted delicious and the order didn't get screwed up. 2) The eggs reminded me of dunkin donut egg sandwiches - you know, those premade egg patties that get nuked in the microwave. 3) Lastly, they left out the salt, pepper & ketchup!!! The SPP is crucial on my egg sandwiches! BEC with salt, pepper, ketchup...doesn't seem like a difficult order. Anyways,I'm happy that most people on here have had a great experiences here... I wish I could feel the same way. Long story LONGGGGG, It's safe to say that I won't be coming back to Owens. As I mentioned earlier, I really wish I could make my go to spot since they are around the corner from where I live...but it does look like I'll have to take a 10min drive elsewhere when I'm in the mood for bagels -- (wont name drop other businesses as I don't like to do that).Hey.  You.  Owen's is terrible.  Don't go there.Not buying it, huh?  Well... I guess we couldn't keep it a secret forever. Owen's is hands down the best specialty bagel sandwich shop in Charlotte.  Listen, that's a big statement from me.  My family has been in the bagel business for over 50 years.  We owned one of the first bagel shops in New York and LA before Brueggar's and Einstein's came in and demolished everyone.  You want a good bagel in Charlotte?  Owen's or Poppy's.  That's it.All you need to know is if you can dream it, Owen's can do it.Fan Favorites:* Grubby Bubby* Booty Bagel on BlueberryPersonal Favorite:* Bagel, Egg and Chive Cream Cheese (add salt and pepper) on Everything.Other Important Notes:Dogs are welcome, but not preferred inside the actual bagel shop.  You can write on the walls.  If you're going with two people, best to each get your own sandwhich and then share a Booty Bagel for dessert (Yes, I most certainly believe in breakfast dessert).My only wish is that they had better coffee.  But for how good the bagels are, I'll drink it.Cheers to the fat kids!

Review Text :
Went here this afternoon because ever since I've heard that Wynn has added vegan options to his menus, I've been dying to try the vegan matzo ball soup. Walked up to the counter with a friend and asked for the vegan menu, which is just three items but the soup was the only one I was interested in. My friend was also curious so she ordered it as well, and I also got a side of fries. We chose our seats and waited. The soup was brought out about 15 minutes later (the cashier mentioned there would be a wait) in huge bowls on square plates. It was definitely the perfect amount of soup especially for the semi-high price tag of $6.95. It was essentially three medium-sized matzo balls, vegetable broth with small bits of carrot and celery. The vegetables were nice and crunchy, not soft and overcooked. The matzo balls were really good and held their shape well, they didn't fall apart easily. The fries I got were salty and crunchy and very good, but kind of a small portion. The soup tasted very good, it had a little bit of a tangy kick and my friend (a non-vegan) and I loved it and would definitely come back again to order it. Very tasty and a nice meal that just satiates you perfectly. A little pricey, but totally worth it!We came here during our recent stay at the Wynn for some late night dessert. They had these huge slices of cake in the display cases, so we figured between the four of us, we could easily polish one off. Now, when I saw huge, I am talking seven layers of cake and seven layers of frosting. Huge.At $11.95 a slice, it was a little pricey. Because there were so many of us, we justified that it would have been more if we had purchased individual items on our own. So we went with it.Upon ordering, we were greeted by a fellow named Dylan who was less than helpful. When we asked him questions about the menu, he just shook his head or muttered yes or no. Whatever. My friend asked for a glass of water, he ignored her. She asked again after the transaction, and he slammed it in front of her. Maybe it was us. Nope- the next group of people weren't from the US and were having a some trouble communicating their order. Did Dylan help? Nope. They asked a question about a sandwich and he just pointed to the menu and said, "whatever's up there, is on it." Thanks guy- I'm sure that helped.Now, only Dylan was less than pleasant. The other lady (who I interacted with while getting some drinks), Denise, was super friendly and helpful. She greeted people at the register, asked if we were having fun and thanked us for coming. Complete difference.Now, I did take off a star for service (was going to take off more, but Denise was the saving factor)- but the rest of the stars were taken off because of how bad the cake was. We went with the Strawberry Shortcake version that was made with strawberries and white cake. The cake seriously tasted like it had be sitting in the fridge uncovered for quite some time or next to a macaroni salad. It definitely didn't taste like sweet cake- but something that should accompany a salad. I think it was sitting for too long next to too many different ingredients. It acted like a sponge for all the other flavors. Gross.I guess the cakes in the display case are just for looks- such a bummer that something so beautiful tasted so rancid. For being the Wynn, I expected their standards to be a little higher in food and customer service.Overpriced (duhhh...it's the Wynn) deli. All the usual suspects in deli-style sandwiches, for around $12 each (fries/side not included).The gem here is the vegan burger! For $9 you basically get a vegan Happy Meal: a little gardein "cheese"burger that tastes/looks just like those little McDonald's burgers, a side of French fries, and a little chocolate shake. It's a filling meal, and alllll vegan....which is great for me, because I looooove me some milkshakes, but my inability to digest lactose normally makes them an ugly proposition!!!It's not really gourmet foodie-food....but it's solidly good, for being vegan -- and the price is great. I will probably have this again!I could never pronounce the name of this place. I don't even know what the f*ck a Zoozacracker is! I always thought Zoozacracker sounded like a racist remark people would use in Queens or the Bronx or something. I've probably come here once every year for the last 4 years. I wrote a review about this place about a year ago but the filter ate it, claiming I was a worker here. Finally wanted to figure out what a Zoozacracker is, so I googled it. Found no information. Decided to break the words apart. We all know what a cracker is, but what the f*ck is a Zooza? Well, according to google a Zooza is some dude who provides an individual legal proof that they are the owner of a horse..or something like that. Still, I have no f*cking clue what that is supposed to mean! Combining Zooza(Horse licensure litigation specialist guy) with Cracker(Saltine Square), doesn't make a shred of sense. But, nothing does here. The interior design looks like either a David Lynch movie, or the room where Debbie Harry starts rapping in the 1981 mtv music video, "Rapture". I know "irony" is the big thing these days, but I don't f*cking like irony. It sucks. The interior design can ironically f*ck off!They got this burger that they pack with coleslaw, thousand island, and swiss cheese. It's not bad. It's extremely messy though. The Rueben is also pretty good, but I don't think there is one New Yorker alive that would say it can compare to Carnegie, Weiss, or Greenberg Deli(all here in LV/Henderson). The first time I ever came here was with my poker buddy in 2009. We had accumulated about $15 of comps. The bill came out to like $17 and the lady at the counter waived the extra $2. They had excellent customer service back then. Came back a few months later but this time they made us pay the balance. Of course they charge for every little thing. I've been to kosher delis that would charge for a side of thousand island for my New York Sky High, so I'm not surprised. Actually, I won't be surprised if they start charging for the water and the pickles soon.The first time I decided to eat here, I asked multiple Wynn workers the question: "Where is Zoozacrackers located?" None of them knew the answer. Most of them didn't know what the f*ck I was talking about. One guy even told me that Zoozacrackers was located at Koval and Flamingo.... When I finally found the place, I couldn't get in because in front of the entrance was Antonio Tarver. He was piss drunk and having an argument with some chick who was dressed like a stripper. Typical day in Las Vegas.....I had been eyeing this place for a while because I heard the pastrami and corned beef was good here. Wrong! Maybe it used to be? First, they have no signs posted showing where this place is. They have the usual signs saying which way to go for what, but nothing for Zoozacrackers Deli. I finally looked up the number for Wynn and called to ask. I explained that I was standing in the casino and needed help finding this place! The woman who answered was polite and guided me to the correct place. Zoozacrackers Deli is attached to the sports book. The music being played is so loud that hubby and I had to yell at each other to have a conversation.I walked up to the line that was somewhat long, but it moved fast. The woman who took our order was very friendly. Priced at $12.79 I ordered the "1/2 Deli Sandwich & Soup Combo" and because I wanted a Reuben it was $2 extra. I wanted to try their lemonade, but not at $5.50 a glass with no refills! The sodas are $3.79 each and you get free refills. The food took a while to come out, but when it did I couldn't wait to try it.Reuben Sandwich - This was just flat out gross. All I could taste was swiss cheese and grease. The corned beef had no flavor. It looked good at first until I started to eat it and noticed the meat changes from a good color to fatty parts and gray colored parts. It just didn't look or taste like quality corned beef and the grease was all over my hands. The sandwich is supposed to come with sauerkraut yet it was in a small dish on the side of the sandwich. What the heck? Why wouldn't they have just put it on the sandwich to begin with since I didn't ask for it to be left off or anything? Weird. Also what is up with the size of this sandwich? I know I ordered the half sandwich, but when you have places like Greenberg's and Carnegie in town putting out the type of sandwiches they are, I can't see why anyone is coming here. Where's the beef?!?!?! I felt sick in my stomach from the grease and right after leaving ended up feeling sick through the night. No good.Tomato Bisque - Size on this is great. The taste is blah. I expect more from a place inside the Wynn and was surprised at how dusty and dirty this place was. I did see a lady going around sweeping the floor, but a rag on the surrounding stuff would be awesome. Our total was $38.76 for 1 sandwich, 1 half sandwich, 1 bowl of soup and 2 sodas.  With other places that put out a much tastier sandwich and portion and the fact that I got sick and felt the price for what I got wasn't good, I wont be back.Zoozacrackers Deli inside the Wynn was the most feasible option for a dinner date before catching Le Reve because we only had 45 minutes to spare and Zoozacrackers is just a stone's throw away from the Wynn theater. WYNN BURGER ($11): The entire meal is vegan. Literally the exact same menu option is offered at Society Cafe inside Encore for the same price, but with poorer presentation here (plastic cups instead of glass, etc.). This meal is the cheapest option on the menu because it comes with a chocolate milk shake and fries. Everything else on the menu is served a la carte. I asked for lettuce on my burger and they obliged. I happen to like the chocolate shake but my husband begged to differ. Smh. 3/5PRO TIP: If you're going to order the Wynn burger, walk on over to Society Cafe for a way better experience!ZOOZA BURGER ($15.49): Expensive for a burger, but my better half gave it his approval. It's pretty gigantic too, so at least you're getting your moneys worth. 4/5FRIES ($3.99): Taste like Burger King fries (not necessarily a bad thing). 3/5VIBE: Upscale Denny's minus the servers + counter service for ordering. I was surprised at how slammed this place was on a Sunday night at 9PM. It's connected to the Sportsbook.  SERVICE: It was near impossible to catch one of the servers for a refill. The option to go up to the registers and ask a cashier for a refill is an option but they were so busy tending to the never ending line of customers we didn't want to bother them. The Deli is pretty much self-serve. Worth a Return Visit?Our grand total came to $37 and some change. I'm not planning on coming back, but if you're in a rush or are trying to keep your dining costs at a minimum while you're at the Wynn, Zoozacrackers Deli will do.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #105Zoozacrackers is one of the less expensive options inside Wynn Las Vegas. They offer deli counter service. Sandwiches, burgers, salads and soups. You order at the counter and they bring your food and drinks to your table. Free refills are offered and the food is decent. One of the better deals to be had in this otherwise upscale resort.

Review Text :
We were in search of an authentic sushi bar where they serve high  quality fresh omasake menu owned by a Japanese sushi chef but knew that none would exist on the vegas strip.  After all, Vegas isn't exactly known for sushi.  I found Sen of Japan on Yelp and noticed their high rating from 60 reviewers and voted as the best sushi restaurant in Vegas by Zagat.   Well, worth the try!!  This place is around 10 minutes away from the Vegas strip.  We sat on the sushi bar and ordered the Omakase.  Our sushi chef's name was Sunny.  I would have to give him 5 stars for excellent service.  He was very attentive and worked quickly to serve not just our dinner but also the orders he had to full fill from other customers.   The sashimi were all nicely plated and were topped with different garish on each fish.  The layout of every dish was so pretty but the taste was even better.  I loved the way they prepared the rice where it was perfectly moist and wet.  Some places gives you a glob of dry rice that ruins the whole experience.  Omasake was $55-$85 per person depending on how much you wanted to eat.  I was full when I reached the $55 mark.  After the last toro fish, I felt content.  LA offers higher quality sushi places but for being Vegas, it was good enough for me to rate them at least 4 stars.  If I were in Vegas again, I'd come back here. If you're sick of all those typical hotel buffets, go try Sen of Japan.  I don't recommend ANY sushi restaurant on the strip.  Those are catered to non asian customers who don't know the difference between sushi or sashimi and are content with previously  frozen fish.I used to go to Sen of Japan all the time when it first opened, but hadn't been in quite some time because it isn't very close to my house and it's only open for dinner. I've recently been twice, however, and am happy to report the food is as good as ever.Both times I had the Black Cod Soy, because going to Sen of Japan and not getting the Black Cod Soy is like going to Italy and not getting pasta. It's a buttery piece of fish with a caramelized, but not overpowering, sweet exterior. Each bite melts in your mouth it may be the best piece of fish you've ever tasted. The pickled shoot that adorns it is also fantastic and offers a complementary acidic element ($13.75, add $9 to top it with fois gras).Besides the cod, I sampled a few other old favorites, the home-made Japanese Pickles and the Mushroom Salad. The pickles are made from yamagobo (similar to a carrot), turnip, Japanese yam, cabbage, and something reminiscent of a caper berry. Each piece has a slightly different flavor and texture, but all offer a colorful, crunchy start to the meal ($8.50). The mushroom salad consists of a warm mound of gently sauteed mushrooms, including enoki and wood ear. It has a heavy dose of yuzu that makes it taste bright, and a bit tart ($7.75).The sashimi is of the caliber of Raku, but here you can have rice with your fish at the full service sushi bar. The spicy yellowtail hand roll ($4.80) is bursting with flavor and filling, but a new favorite is the Sashimi Combination Salad with Garlic Vinaigrette ($12.95). Impecably fresh slices of normally mundane varieties, including tuna and salmon, are arranged around a pile of delicate Japanese greens topped with finely shredded radish. A light dose of garlic vinaigrette and sprinkling of capers complete the masterpiece.Another surprise favorite was the fried calamari with onion (around $9). Tender strips of squid are paired with onion slices then beer battered and toped with slices of jalapeno. These taste like onion rings of the upscale variety.The sukiyki was the only thing I wouldn't order again, but that's probably because I'm partial to preparing my own sukiyaki at Swish (review to come later). Overall, however, Sen of Japan is a place you should try at least once, even if it might be a little inconvenient to get to.After much debate, and lots of help from great Las Vegas Yelpers, we decided to dine at Sen of Japan last night.  This was my second visit, so I thought it was best to dine with the Omakase menu.John was our waiter, ask for him when you go.  He is knowledgable and just a genuinely nice person.  The national championship game was on the tv behind the bar, so I had everything I needed for a great meal.We opted for the $85 Omakase, which was 7 courses:Kanpachi sashimi with Oysters - Like Butta!  Smooth and succulent, the kanpachi was served with a dash of ponzu, fried garlic chip, and micro greens.  The oyster was served with a garlic slaw of sorts.  The oyster was flavorful and light, and a great way to start the meal.Sashimi Salad w/ spinach and micro greens - Tender and delicious cuts of salmon, tuna, and red snapper nestled around a bed of spinach and micro greens with a light vinaigrette.   This dish was fine, but forgettable.  The sashimi was cut very small, which affected the presentation a little bit, but the flavors and quality still shined through.Fried Fish Eggroll - This wasn't an egg roll at all, but I am lost for words to name it.  This was various fish, not sure what wrapped in a shiso leaf and fried topped with tobiko.  A little dry and my least favorite bite of the night, but it was very creative.Baked Black Cod in a soy sauce topped with foie gras and a shiso pepper - Best dish all night.  The cod was perfectly cooked to retain some moisture and finished in a light soy sauce.  The foie on top made the fish even more decedant.  The chef nailed this one, it was an evolution of flavors with each bite, and I wanted more.Filet in mustard ginger sauce - Cooked closer to medium than medium rare, this dish was executed well.  Nice amounts of salt and the right amount of mustard, let the beef shine through instead of other flavors.  Various nigiri - Tuna, Salmon, Kanpachi, Ebi, Snapper.  All delicious and perfect.  I didn't even use soy sauce with these, it just felt wrong since the fish was of such high integrity.Dessert - Chocolate souflee with homemade green tea ice cream - Great soufle, the chocolate oozed out as my fork pierced the fluffy cake.  The green tea ice cream was made with matcha and complimented the bitterweet chocolate in the soufle wonderfully.  I was so full at this point two bites was all I could handle.Sen of Japan is close to being perfect.  It provides great individualized service, superior quality product, and creative execution.I really don't like giving out 1-star reviews, but I have to be honest. I did not enjoy my SoJ experience. In fact, I was frustrated. The sushi itself was pretty good. We went during happy hour (currently 10:30pm-1:30am Mon-Sat), so the prices were great. Unfortunately, to put it lightly, the service was lacking. I'm too frustrated to bother with details. I hesitated even writing this review in the first place. The bottom line for me is that there are plenty of sushi places in Vegas with good to great sushi and good to great service. I don't need to return. Luckily for SoJ, they have enough of a following (100+ reviews) that my lowly 1-star won't affect their stellar average at all.I don't get it.Sen has 4 1/2 stars with over 100 reviews.  It's Michelin rated.  What it doesn't have is food to match.  Our party of five was eager to try what was purportedly one of the best sushi restaurants in town.  We drove all the way from Hendo - in rush hour traffic - just to eat here.  On the way, we decided that we should do the omakase and let the chef put his best foot forward.  Here's what was served:1.  Yellowtail with peppers and garlic chip - the presentation was wonderful, but the flavors were overpowering.  The ponzu was too strong for such a subtle fish.  The addition of garlic and a spicy habanero (or jalapeno?) just kills any chance you can taste the fish, let alone feel the texture of it while your mouth burns.  2.  Mizuna salad with salmon, tuna and albacore - This would have been a nice dish, had it come before the spice of the yellowtail.  In fact, this is how good, fresh fish should be served: with very little detraction.  As an individual dish, however, I'd rather just have thick cuts of sashimi instead of thin cuts of fish with a salad on the side.  3.  Soy Miso Block Cod - really good execution of one of my favorites.  Only downside was that I didn't have a bowl of rice to go with it.  By itself, it was supremely tasty and buttery.4.  Fliet Mignon tataki - this was good and tender, but lost in sauce.  Fliet has zero flavor profile, so covering it with any sauce really just makes the meat a sauce delivery vehicle.  Chalk it up to personal preference. Also a personal preference: I would really have liked it to be medium RARE rather than medium well.  5.  Miso soup with clams - delicious.  This was the highlight of the meal.  The combination of clams and miso just hit the rights notes or flavor and smell.  Really good stuff.  I could have just had a couple bowls of this with miso cod and called it a night.6.  Nigiri - The fish looked and tasted fresh, but the texture of the salmon was slightly mushy.  The rice was really good, with just the right about of koshi that makes me happy.  +1 for the rice.7.  Chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream - I love green tea ice cream and this didn't disappoint.  The souffle, however, was another matter.  It was hard and nowhere near as fluffy or light as it should be.  IMHO, if you offer it on your menu, you need to execute it well or don't bother.Being hungry after all that, we ordered two additional rolls:8.  #24 (Shrimp tempura with tuna on top with pineapple wasabi) - This is one of my least favorite rolls...ever.  The sushi itself probably was good, but the sauce killed any chance me wanting to take another bite.  It was too sweet and too much of it all over the roll.  9.  #25 California roll with soft shell crab - this one at once pretty good and also fairly standard.  I'd probably choose this if I didn't know what else to try.I liked this place, but it's a tough sell at 4 stars.  Out of 9 items, only 2 stood out as things I would make it a point to order again.  I've read the reviews.  I've heard the raves.  I finally tried Sen.  I just don't get what the fuss is all about.I have a rule of thumb when it comes to passing final judgement on an Indian restaurant: the quality of food should be based on their a la carte dinner entrees rather than their buffet since the drop-off between the two can often be quite steep.  I believe there is a Japanese restaurant corollary in that one should judge the quality of food based on their omakase (tasting menu designated by the chef) rather than their a la carte menu items.  Of course, there is usually a hike in price in both cases but sometimes you pay for what you get, and what you get here for omakase is definitely money well spent.One would never guess that tucked away in SW suburbia lies a restaurant opened by Hiro Nakano, the former head chef of Nobu (Hard Rock Casino) and was listed in the 2009 Michelin guide.  I met up with some work colleagues and since my boss was treating the group, we decided to indulge in the $55 omakase experience (an $85 option was available, but one should not test the limits of generosity when being treated to a complimentary meal by your superior).  Probably the most interesting question I have ever encountered when deciding on the omakase was being prompted by the server as to how many times I have had the omakase specifically at their restaurant.  Apparently the chef likes to vary the dishes so as to create a different experience for the diner much like a video game character advancing to higher levels of play!  Apparently the variations can go up to "level 5" and possibly beyond so I found this to be a ingenious incentive to return for repeat tasting adventures.  A couple members of our party were second-timers so it was cool to get a preview as to what I would be expecting after my first omakase here.  I'm sure the chef would be more than willing to mix and match specific items since the theme to this idea is thoughtfulness towards the customer.Items I could recollect along with occasional sidenotes with regard to the level 2 menu.1) Hawaiian yellowtail marinated with yuzu soy:  unctuous and refreshing with bright notes of citrus from the yuzu, very nice start to the meal (level 2 was japanese red snapper)2) Sashimi salad- delicate slices of assorted fish mixed with shredded daikon and greens in a subtle onion vinaigrette--very clean flavors3) Miso Black cod with grilled shishito pepper- perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the fish pretty much melts in your mouth and goes well with a nice salty crunch from the pepper (I think in the $85 omakase, this dish is accompanied with grilled fois gras....talk about umami overload!)4)  Sliced filet mignon served with grilled asparagus-  found this one to be slightly underwhelming since while being cooked medium rare, was a bit under-seasoned and would have liked some asian flavors to be incorporated (the second-timers received a similar cut but was topped with a spicy chili sauce so I'm thinking that version was tastier)5) Miso soup with wakame (firm seaweed) and mini button mushrooms-  the cute little mushrooms are not only tasty but also provide an artistic glow to the otherwise cloudy earth-tone broth. 6) Nigiri assortment- fairly standard with a couple tuna sushi rolls, one regular shrimp and mackerel nigiri, and pairs of salmon and tuna nigiri....nothing mind-blowing, but helps to fill you up with the added load of rice.7) Chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream-  nice way to round out the meal.  Souffle could have been more fluffy, but definitely a unexpectedly pleasant flavor combination with the green tea ice cream...I got a chance to taste the almond frangipane cake with pineapple sorbet in the second timers dessert course and that was equally exquisite.I'm thinking I may have omitted one more sashimi course, but as one can see, this is quite a spread for $55 and I definitely did not go home hungry.  Folks residing in this part of town should definitely take advantage of having such a fine dining option nearby and for those trekking from across town, definitely a nice introduction to omakase at a reasonable price with opportunities to "level-up" with subsequent visits.  Be sure to also take advantage of their excellent sake selection.The Skinny: so-so sushi and incorrectly cut sashimi (2.5) service is shamelessly trying to upcharge you and ignore you when you don't feel like playing along(1) value: given the fact that I've been to Korean sushi joints that served similar product, their outrageous prices do not match the quality of the food. (2)My hubs and I came here about 2 years ago to sample their Valentine's Day omakase. Although there did appear to be a lot of cooked items, the quality of the food was enough to make us contemplate coming here again last week.We arrived with a friend for some good eats but were disappointed on many levels.First of all, the service is highly lacking. Our waitress had the annoying habit of always trying to get us to order more expensive items on the menu. No, we do not want a miniscule bowl of edamame you want to charge $4.50 for when I can get a massive bag of it for less than $2. No, we do not want to order alcoholic drinks. No, we don't want any of your appetizers.After we kept politely declining her suggestions, she pretty much ignored us until she wanted to us to clear the bill. Which was frustrating because she didn't even bring out a bowl of rice that came with our meager meals. Not to mention that they removed our small plates when our food came out. Let me tell you, it feels totally ghetto eating out of their massive sashimi bowl because you are likely to drip soy sauce on the other pieces of fish. Not cool. Not zen. All ghetto. Sorry, but it had to be said.Enough about the shoddy service. More on the food.Our friend and I ordered the Sashimi Special Combination ($29.95) while the hubby got the Shin's Special Plate ($19.95).For $19.95, the only special about Shin's Special Plate is how epic a rip it is. Although beautifully presented, the fish texturally, lack the firmness of really fresh product. The size of the fish on the nigri was also on the thinner side. Although the seasoning of the various fish was varied, the pairing of flavors were only okay in my books. Nothing terribly innovative. And for 7 pieces of nigri, it is very expensive.The sashimi special combination (sashimi plate, bowl of rice, miso soup) for $29.95 is also very expensive for what it was. The thin slices, the small portion size left me very disappointed. Top it off with fish that wasn't the finest quality (I went on a Thursday - no excuses!), I cannot recommend this dish to anyone.Overall, it's disappointing because there are very few decent sushi joints in town. But between the shoddy service, the lackluster fish quality and the skimpy portions, this place gets a 2 star.Let me begin by saying that I liked this restaurant's design and rolls I had were actually quite good.  Although I was at the sushi bar, the waitress who served drinks and edamame was actually fantastic.Why only 2 stars then?  Funny you should ask.While sitting at the sushi bar watching one of the chef's prepare someone else's nigiri, I happened to catch him proceed to throw the fish down on the preparation surface to flatten it a couple times, and then some error in trajectory resulted in the 3rd throw landing on the floor in front of him.  He picked it up, washed it off in the sink, looked right at me, and then laid it neatly across a rice ball.  It went onto a plate with several others and off to a table it went.  Call me crazy, but there is no 5 second rule in restaurants!  Washing it off doesn't change that rule!So, a few minutes later, while conversing with my dinner partner, the same chef, who appeared to be more tenured or the ranking official behind the sushi bar, called out to the waitress behind us and scolded her abruptly about a customer waiting for a to-go order.  She happened to be directly behind me and not only was it rude and inappropriate to do so in front of customers, but it totally stopped our dinner conversation dead in it's tracks.  She responded that it was being taken care of and went about her business.  I think I just sat there with a dumbfounded look on my face.Sufficed to say, there are many excellent sushi choices in Las Vegas.  I prefer one that takes values sanitary practices in preparation of the food and where the staff is a little more pleasant to one another.This will likely be my first and last visit to this establishment.Wow this place is ridiculously amazing. Stumbled upon this little gem last night and wasn't expecting much. I'm very picky when it comes to Sushi and this place blew me away. First off the service was impeccable. Everyone knew English and our waters were always kept full. Also when we were through with a plate it was taken away immediately. My cousin and I shared 3 rolls. Spicy Salmon, Spicy Yellowtail and one that had caramelized onions on the top infant remember the name but it was Delish! You could also tell the ingredients were very fresh. Located on the corner of Desert Inn & Durango it's very assessable. I suggest this place very highly to anyone looking for outstanding service and fresh sushi.Sometimes places leave you speechless and it is okay. Sometimes you don't need to drone on and on about how good the food is. Sen of Japan leaves that almost perfect impression on me and it is hard to put it into words. Starting out with the Hawaiian style edamame is a must. So is the mixed seafood cucumber salad. From that point, it only got better. All of the nigiri was fresh, a generous slice, but could have held back on the dressing. At points, the rice was falling apart due to how much sauce was on some of the pieces. My friends that I had dined with had prefaced that Sen's miso black cod rivals that of Nobu's. I had to get it and for $14, it is a steal. The steak with the sweet soy based sauce was freaking fantastic. Dragging the meat through it to dab on my rice was not enough. I should have been as smart as my dining partner and just tipped the plate over my rice. You need to save room for the chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream. It is magnificent. The nice crunch from the shell to the gooey center pairs so well with the homemade ice cream. I died so many times throughout the meal.I cannot complain about one thing that hit our table. I call that a win with around eight different fishes, a few appetizers, a couple of entrees, and two desserts.Sen of Japan is a neighborhood gem! If you are lucky enough to live or pass by this area often you have to stop into Sen. You'll become a regular for sure. The quality of the fish that you will find here is outstanding. The food is also prepared very well. I've never walked out of this place unsatisfied.The ambiance of the restaurant is somewhat romantic...the lighting is dim and the music puts you at ease...perfect to where you can hear the other party but not have to constantly be conversing to avoid awkward silences. My favorite item on the menu is the Black Cod Miso with Foie Gras. The dish is just delicious! The sauce is so addicting!!! Sweet but not too sweet where it overpowers the fish...I found myself dragging the last piece all over the plate to make sure that I had every last drop. Their desserts are also amazing. They serve Bubbies mochi icecream which is a popular brand that comes from Hawaii !! Their chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream is a must try for those who love chocolate!! The souffle is made to order and served hot fresh out of the oven. Out server always suggests this to us while we are ordering our main dishes so they they could get a head start.  It is perfectly gooey and lava like on the inside and crisp on the outside like a delicious souffle should be.They also had a wide variety of Sake to choose from if you enjoy that with your meal. Overall the service is fantastic. The food is impeccable. Sen of Japan just does it right. *****1030-130 happy hour!!!Located on the westside way up by Desert Inn and Durango Sen of Japan is cool find. The restaurant is big with plenty of room but with minimal decor and hard chairs.We ordered two of the Omakase $52 and some sushi items. The Omakese was good except for the generic fish that came with the sushi course. The last course of molten chocolate cake was excellent.

I love going out. One definition of an extrovert that I heard recently is that your batteries are recharged by being around other people. You don't need alone time. That's pretty much me. The idea that I just need to chill out and be by myself is a totally foreign concept. But I've heard enough people talk about it that it must be real. So that said, you would think I would love this place. It offers the most Jack-rasses Scottsdale has to offer per square foot. Last time I was there, which was very recently, I played some crazy human tetris to get back to the bar to pay my tab. I bumped into 84 pairs of fake boobs, which is not really a complaint, 500 asses, of which only 321 were women, and I pretty much was sweating like a seagull on fire on the 4th of July, which ruined my perfectly coifed and excessively huge hair. I paid $20 to get in. I said "Twenty. Fucking. Dollars." You should have seen the look on the face of the money-taker. Apparently, she thought it was totally reasonable. $50 for 5 drinks. I didn't cuss at the bartender. Now, it's not all bad. The burlesque dancers' asses are sublime. A true delight. Coconut creme pie for my eyes. Some super hot girl kept staring me down. I would have talked to her if not for the music that requires screaming over and the fact that it would have taken me 20 minutes to get to her and she probably would have been gone and the women I was there with probably would not have appreciated it. And the music wasn't bad. That said, do your wallet, your senses, your sense of space, your intelligence, and your friends a favor and go somewhere else.

My dad and I stopped in here on a Tuesday night for dinner a few weeks ago, and we both felt this place was just ok.  There was nothing wrong with the food when we ate it, but it was about $50 for two of us with a tip.  Too steep for non-memorable food.I ordered a shrimp burrito ($12) that was ok.  The amount of shrimp was decent for the price, but it was just beans, rice, and shrimp.  My dad ordered a burger that was also fine.  We then ordered 2 slices of cake.  A chocolate cake, that was supposed to be super chocolate-y, was flavorless.  The red velvet was slightly better, but at $6.95/slice, neither was worth it.  My dad ordered a beer that was ok, but overall, most of the food was something you could make at home.I wouldn't come back here except for the Vegan options, which bumps this place up to a 3 star rating.

I haven't been to Red Robin for a really long time and we decided to give it a try tonight. I guess I would describe this place as a family friendly burger joint. A lot different from Paradise Valley Burger Company, Hop Doddy, and Zin Burger. All are gourmet burgers but RR is a family friendly with lots of bright colors, always kids and I guess reasonable prices. Our server was pretty good in greeting us, getting our drinks, and taking our order. Not bad. I ordered the Smoke & Pepper Burger. Nice thick juicy burger with bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, pickles with a nice BBQ ketchup. Not bad. I thought that it was pretty good with a little kick to it. Also, comes with steak fries. They give you a little bit of fries but then again they have bottomless fries. You just have to ask for more. My wife ordered the fish & chips. It came with four good sized pieces of fish. And nice portion of steak fries. The fish was moist and tender. Tasted pretty good and filled my wife. As for my son, he ordered the Whiskey River BBQ chicken salad. Chicken and avocado in the salad over a BBQ salad dressing. He had to ask for more BBQ dressing but he loved it. Ate it all. So must have been good cause he such a picky eater. So good food, decent service (not great but not bad either cause I had to ask for refills), and a very interesting ambiance. It's very loud. Not super fun but family loud atmosphere. Young and old. So I enjoyed it. Like I said if your looking for a different atmosphere from the other burger joints then this is the place for you. Plus it looks like they have good desserts even though I didn't try them. Enjoy.I'm usually down for Red Robin as I love a good burger, but my recent visit to this location had me running for the door.Red Robin is great spot for some pretty decent burgers and chicken sandwiches. The bright colors and décor scream family friendly and they definitely go out of their way to please young children. (The TV in the floor is cool touch) On an average visit you will hear their rendition of the birthday song several times. Fortunately, there is a full bar and good happy hour for the grown-ups. It had been a while since the last time I was here so I convinced some friends to check it out around lunch time. We were promptly seated by the host and greeted by our server, little did we know that this was going to be the last time we saw her. I decided to get my usual, the peppercorn burger and onion rings to share. After we made our selections, we waited for our server to return... and waited and waited and waited.About ~20minutes later one of the bussers came over looking confused and asked if someone had helped us. He acted like we had just taken menus from the front and just sat down randomly. Soon after a new server appeared, for whatever reason she seemed annoyed that we were there; as if we had done something wrong. For whatever reason our food came out in waves; after the onion rings I was the first to get my food. We were expecting the other two dishes to come our soon but they took almost 30 minutes. My friend who ordered the bruschetta chicken sandwich was brought out the fish and chips instead, I have no idea who they mixed that up. They brought out her correct order later but our other friend and I were long finished with our food. My request for an additional serving of the "bottomless fries" also seemed to have been quickly forgotten as well. Not sure what we did to deserve the neglect but it sucked.

I've lived in Dormont for 3 years and have never hit this place up. Why? Well, there's absolutely no good reason! I love Mexican food too, so this means there's been a lot of missed opportunities to eat tacos. While I feel like there's always a great debate about what's "authentic" Mexican food, I always feel like I can't chime in. I know that there are taco's I like, and taco's I don't like. A lot of it for me has to do with flavor. So my knowledge isn't on what's "authentic" but what is tasty to me. I had the taco platter where you're able to choose from a plethora of different meats. Sadly, this did not include the "new" fish tacos, which I was bummed about. I went with the spicy chicken, pulled pork and portobello mushroom. They come dressed with lettuce, cheese and onion, in a flour tortilla (you can also get a hardshell). While the mushroom was a little blah, the spicy chicken and pulled pork were awesome. What made them awesome was the meats, of course. They were seasoned fantastically and cooked perfectly. I kept saying over and over how good they were. I also had a side of guacamole and salsa. The salsa is more of a pico de gallo, but I dig that kind. I also thought the gauc was very good. Plus, they have a whole wall FULL of hot sauces you can choose from. I'm literally in sauce heaven here!Their beer list is small, but they have some good drafts, like the Pumpking. I mean, there's nothing like a taco and Pumpking... I kid, I kid. I also kept going back to the drink menu and looking at this Apple Pie cocktail made with moonshine. You're only allowed to order 2 per person, assumably so you don't run down the street naked or something. I threw caution to the wind and ordered one. It was delicious and not once did I taste any kind of alcohol. You definitely could end up in the danger zone. Glad I stuck to one. The service was incredibly friendly and I'm excited to make this my new go to Mexican joint in Dormont!

I want to give this place two stars. It deserves two stars, HOWEVER, I have decided on 3 for the sheer fact of the sale of cheap tacos and cheap beer. I will be first to say that I strongly dislike the semi-douchey scene of Loco Patron, but what can one expect when they're in an OTSCO bar that is frequented by barely legal drinkers? So I set my thirty year old snobbery aside and went for some cheap tacos. When I walked in to what I thought was a restaurant, I was carded! WTF? There was a 7 year old kid munching on his taco, watching my carding go down. We locked eyes for a moment while the bouncer flashed his light on my ID, I think the child was mocking me. I was wondering why he was allowed in. Oh well. After that puzzling moment, I met the gang. While the conversation at the table was rousing, I couldn't help but notice the coke-ho dancing without any rhythm or to the music that was in her head at the bar in front of us. She was really working it too! I tore my eyes away from the train wreck to peruse the simple menu. I ordered off of the regular menu to get some shrimp tacos. They were pretty flavorful! I was rather surprised. I also ordered a steak taco off of the "Taco Tuesday" menu to try. Again, another pretty good, flavorful taco! The rice and beans were just alright. Nothing too amazing. I guess my overall impression is that Loco Patron is a great place to meet some friends if you're broke on a Tuesday and you're hungry and want a beer or two! I wouldn't rush back to visit this joint, but it would do in a pinch.

Happy Hour review:I was skimming through Christine O's review and elated to see "happy hour every day from 4pm-6pm and reverse happy hour from 9pm-close....all appetizers are half off and mojitos, house chardonnay/cabernet, and all beers on tap are only $3"  Thinking to myself that it sounded great and the rest of the reviews were awesome I decided to try it out this weekend. The plan was to meet my girlfriend there about 4:00, but after traffic from the game and the roads being tore up from the light rail we arrived about 5:15.. Parking was ok but finding the actual restaurant was a little confusing, point being if you've never been here before allow yourself some extra time.. The appetizers were excellent, they normally range from $8-$27, and at 50% off you can't beat the price so we indulged. We tried the teriyaki tenderloin (served with ginger and rice), the blue cheese and bacon chips that was drizzled in chipotle cream sauce and the scallop lollipops. The portions were generous and I can't wait to go back and try the calamari and the artichoke crab dip. Wash that down with $3 mojitos and you have yourself a very happy -  happy hour!I already really liked Kincaid's as a fancier dinner option, but thanks to Sunny B (who went to check out their happy hour based on the information I saw on the door when I was there for dinner), I tried their happy hour, and I was impressed enough to bump this place up to 5 stars. There is a list of 10 or so appetizers that are pulled from the regular menu, and all are 50% off during happy hour. Drink specials (mojitos, margaritas, draft beers, house chardonnay/cabernet) are actually $4 now, but that's still damn cheap! It's also worth noting that even outside of happy hour, they have a short bar menu that is much cheaper than their normal fare. We had five appetizers (macadamia-nut encrusted Brie w/ sliced house bread, fried calamari, sweet potato fries, teriyaki tenderloins w/ rice, and Kobe meatloaf sliders), one margarita, and two glasses of wine, and our total cheack was $38.50! That would be a sweet deal even if the appetizers weren't good, but all of them were excellent and quite filling. We essentially got a full dinner, which always makes for a successful happy hour!Our server, Jennifer, was also super courteous and attentive. She was available when we needed her but didn't rush us either. We also really appreciated when she offered me a second glass of wine "at happy hour price" even though it was basically 6 pm already. If you live anywhere near the Collier Center (corner of 2nd Street and Washington), work downtown, or have friends that work downtown, you will want to check this place out for happy hour. We couldn't believe how empty Kincaid's was, despite offering these crazy and wonderful happy hour deals, but I'd like to believe that after this review, it won't be! Check it out - you won't be disappointed.The entrance to the parking garage is on the southwest corner of Washington. Pay attention, people. This is important. Yeah, I know - it looks like it's on 3rd Street, but it's not. That's a service entrance. The actual entrance is the one that looks like an exit. But it's not just an exit - it's the entrance. My first pass I drove right by it thinking it was the exit and the entrance must have been on 3rd Street and had to go around the block. But it was 5 o'clock. And there was a Suns game. Fuck the Suns. Took me 20 minutes to go around the fucking block. So my second pass I turned left on 3rd Street. And 3rd Street's a one-way going south so I couldn't just turn around. Another 20 minutes around the block. Third pass I was so pissed it was my third pass I wasn't paying attention and thought 3rd Street was 4th Street and drove right by it again. Fucking shit, man. Why is there no 4th Street? What the fuck happened to 4th Street? Jesus Christ. Who built this fucking city? Burn them. Find them and fucking burn them. Are you paying attention? Pay attention, people. This is important. I don't want this to happen to you. I care about you. Well, most of you. Some of you, anyway. Whatever. The entrance to the parking garage is on the southwest corner of Washington.The food's okay. Little pricy. Cool presentation. I'll upload a pic of our app later when I've had some time to cool off. Make sure you go with someone you that makes you smile, that's what made it for me. Sorry for all the fucks.What a midweek treat. Georgie S and I met here after work on Wednesday to enjoy their happy hour special: $4 beer and a few select cocktails. I had arrived a bit early so I dove face-first into a pomegranate margarita. Nice, good, but a bit too sour for my tastes; nevertheless I don't regret trying it. Afterwards I moved to my trusted BFF Guinness. :doe eye: The appetizers are half off, which was a treat since they aren't exactly cheap. But, it's not your typical happy hour fare. This is high class/high class, like let you meet mama and introduce you to papa. After laboriously narrowing our choices down to one a piece, Georgie and I decided on the teriyaki tenderloin and grilled jumbo scallop lollipops. Both were melt-in-your-mouth good. We both had two beers and our bill was around $35. However Christina P received a $20 gift card. She wasn't able to use it before it expired so gave it to Robert M. He is out of town on business this week so he gave it to Georgie. As the card was being redeemed, it was showing there was no balance on it; had someone snarkily used the balance of the card and passed it along? Hork, imagine the possible hours of dramady! But, alas, the card turned out to be valid so, with tip, our evening was $11 each (with tip) for a fine afternoon.

I came here for dinner tonight with CM and a few of his friends.  One of them organized the dinner and chose Smallman St. Deli due to its proximity to the Manor Theatre, since several of them were planning to see Avengers there afterward.  Although CM and I didn't see the movie, I was excited to try the deli since I'd heard good things, and had been favorably impressed by a catered sandwich from there.Everyone in our group ordered different things, with some people opting for breakfast foods, and others opting for sandwiches.  Since I like to try whatever a restaurant is known for on my first visit, and I don't eat beef, I ordered a turkey Rachel ($10.99).  CM opted for a Yellowfin tuna sandwich ($8.99), and we also split an order of pasta salad ($2.99).  The Reuben came on toasted Rye bread, and was stuffed with a generous quantity of turkey and cole slaw, which was of the creamier variety.  It was pretty good, but I was hoping for bolder flavors--then again, to be fair, turkey isn't known as a particularly flavorful meat.  Also, pieces of the cole slaw kept falling out as I ate the sandwich, which is one of my pet peeves--I like a sandwich that sticks together!  CM's sandwich surprised him a bit, since he was expecting fried fish, but it was filled with tuna salad; however, he didn't mind, since he hadn't had tuna in awhile.  He ordered his sandwich on pumpernickel with all the fixings, and came to regret the latter decision since the fillings, like the cole slaw, had a tendency to fall out as he ate, and he didn't want as many banana peppers as he was given.  Although I didn't ask anyone else directly how they liked their food, judging from the speed with which they ate their meals, I think it's safe to say that they liked them.  :-)At the time of our visit (5:30pm on Fri.), the deli was pretty empty.  We hoped to take advantage of the pleasant weather by sitting on the open porch, but the doors were locked, and none of the employees could find (or wanted to bother finding) the keys.  Service was pretty efficient, given the size of our group--we received our sandwiches about 10 min. after ordering.  I felt that the prices were a tad high, but then again, the quality is better than at other delis I've tried, so I can't complain too much.  Overall, we enjoyed our visit to Smallman St. Deli, and would definitely return--I'd love to try the desserts some time, since I've heard they they're delicious!

The wife and I used to frequent the SanTan location often, when we lived in Mesa. We always had great service, and the place was always clean.However, after moving to to the N. Phx area we tried this location, as it was the nearest.We were in for a shock, it was a completely different experience.We were seated fairly quick, and immediately noticed that the BBQ sauce assortment looked as it had not been cleaned in years. Every one of the containers had crusty discolored sauce caked on the tips. It was disgusting, but since we don't eat the sauces we were willing to overlook that.The table was not clean, it had obviously gotten the two second wipe down. This is unacceptable at a BBQ place where most food is messy.So, the food. I can't comment on this as we were never served, or even waited on.We sat in our booth for a solid 10-15 minutes watching several of the wait staff walk by us, look at us, and do nothing.The most annoying part were the seaters. They had 3-4 seaters huddled around the little podium, and one (the tall/larger one) kept looking at us. It was obvious she knew what was going on. Other tables around us even noticed we had not been waited on. None of the seaters bothered to do anything. There was no manager in sight either.We got up, and proceeded to the door, when the taller seater woman blurts out "Leaving Already?"I turned and said "We have been waiting for 15 minutes, and have not even seen a waitress." She kinda gave a "whatever" look and said "Have a great day!"So, after frequenting the SanTan location and receiving nothing but great service and a clean place to eat, we are NOT going back to the Peoria location. We drove ~10 miles to get there, and had to take our money elsewhere because they couldn't be bothered to serve us. We frequent places we like, and get good service. We eat out nearly every night as we both have busy careers and don't like to cook. Famous Daves Peoria lost out on "regular" customers, and we will not recommend them to any of our co-workers, or friends.Had a family get-together in Vegas and we were all craving some BBQ. Whipped out my handy iPhone Yelp app and sure enough, I was directed to Famous Dave's. (This app has been so fricken useful in so many ways! ) I ordered a rack of their famous ribs, some corn bread...well actually that's a lie. All 16 of us ordered 4 All American Feasts, which comes with some amazingness; Brisket, Beans, Coleslaw, Ribs, a Whole Chicken, Potatoes, 2 corn on the cobs and... I think that's it. Nonetheless, I was in heaven. Nom nom nommm. The end.I still had $12 on my gift gard so I stopped by and grabbed a BURGER on the way home since this week I had already tried all the BBQ.It was a tough choice but I went for the Devil's Spit Bacon Burger!No Suprise! It was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. Cooked to perfection medium well with a nice layer of bbq sauce cooked into it Topped with a toasted bun & cheese,crispy bacon,lettuce,tomato and crunchy Hell-Fire pickles.I don't think I took 1 breath until this thing was GONE!I can't wait to go back for another! Maybe they need a drive-thru? What is the BEST Chain Restaurant Burger you've ever had?Red Robin vs TGI Fridays vs Famous Dave'sI'm gonna check more thoroughly.So it is hard to decide for me what I wanted especially at a BBQ spot. I wanted to try everything since I don't know the next time I'd be back. I had some of they larger platters with a sampling of a few items which was corn, ribs, chicken, cole slaw, bread, corn bread muffins, fries and brisket.  As much as I tried every sauce, it was hard to pick one I truly liked but I seemed to stick with the sweet and sassy. I wasn't a fan of the sauce as much as I was the meat. it definitely hit the spot and sent me immediately home to go to sleep. I also like the interior set up with hunting gear.

Review Text :
2 WordsBone-in Ribeye 2 More wordsTruffle Fries2 last wordsThe Steak and FriesOk, so that's 4 words, but it's really only about that Ribeye and the fries.  I never knew a Bone-in Ribeye existed till I ate at N9NE. It was like something out of the flintstones, HUGE and DEEELICIOUS. I couldn't  finish it. I was definitely full from the appetizers. We had a cold shellfish platter, fresh and amazing. They have wonderful seafood at a  steakhouse. But my favorite thing was the truffle fries.  I'm not a huge fan of fries but these fries could be an accompaniment to my death row meal. Everyone knows this place is modern, sleek and sexy.  It adds to the dining experience.  If you don't want to go for a long drawn out dinner, opt for the bar and have one of their specialty cocktails and an order of truffle fries. If you opt for dinner, the Bone-in Ribeye is the way to go. *Special shout out to Andy & Tiff for taking us out to an incredible dinner.If I were God and I was faced with the task of writing Heaven's menu, I would draw a significant amount of my inspiration from the folks over at N9NE. Most restaurants, like most people, have an area of weakness. In my two visits to N9NE, I have yet to find theirs. Everything is good. The scallops are fantastic, the lobster mac and cheese is... well, lobster mac and cheese, the cocktail list is inventive, and, while you'll be hard pressed to find less than stellar service anywhere in Vegas, that at N9NE is a step above the rest. Food, service, cocktails, ambiance... N9NE is the complete 5 star package.The best of the best? The surf in turf is stacked (cited from the bottom up): mashed potatoes, a mouth watering filet, and de-shelled lobster, which is then topped with a truffle cream sauce. Yea.If I were to dare speak a bad word about N9NE, it would only be that as rich and heavy as the food here is it doesn't always make for the best "party till the sun comes up in my barely there Vegas-only attire" precursor. After dinner in both of my experiences I felt a lot more like going and trying out the plush hotel beds you pay an arm and a leg for and never use than I did raging. In an effort to keep the party going, I suggest a round of espresso cocktail shots for the table.Prices are steep. Luckily money and calories aren't an object in my heaven.If you enjoy eating at pretentious, overpriced, lackluster steakhouses, then N9NE is perfect for you.  If you're a sensible person who enjoys good food and getting value for money, stay away from N9NE.The appetizers were boring and unoriginal, comparable in quality to most sports bars or your average Applebees.  The steak was well overcooked, and I find it hard to believe that even if it were cooked properly, it wouldn't be any better from a filet you can buy from any grocery store and cook yourself (I should note here that I had their signature "world famous" filet - or whatever self-indulgent tagline they were using to describe it that particular night).  The decor of this place must be funded by the Massengill company, because it reeks of douche.  There is a big difference between trying to be modern, trendy, and chique, and trying too hard and falling on your face.  Maybe if they focused more energy on the food versus trendy mood lighting, this review would be different.  The only good thing that came out of my visit to N9NE was our waiter, I only hope that he's taken his talents to a restaurant worthy of him.This is the worst meal I've ever had at any fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas, period.This may come as a surprise, but I am a mere mortal. Being a mortal (even if just barely), I do have my weaknesses. One such weakness would be a well prepared steak. I have set upon a mission to slowly but surely try all of the amazing steakhouses this town has to offer. My next box to check off was the absurdly spelled, but well reviewed, N9NE Steakhouse at the Palms. If you don't enjoy reading, I'll give you the conclusion off the bat. This place is pretty bomb! It's definitely worth checking out. However, as is the case with a lot of good steakhouses, it isn't cheap. But it's well worth it. I started with the Fried Chicken Won Tons. They are pretty awesome. You get like 6 or 7 crispy Won Tons on a long plate over a little bit of blue cheese with a nice hot sauce on the side for dipping. It was a great starter. They also have like 3 kinds of bread, I tried the pretzel bread which was great, I also sampled a delicious soft foccacia bread. Then I ordered the massive, aged Bone-In Ribeye. It was cooked perfectly and was nice and juicy. For sides, I opted for the Mac and Cheese and the Gnocchi. My god, these sides did their absolute best to outshine that magnificent cut of meat. The Mac and Cheese was so rich and creamy. The cheese was a perfect blend of creamy, cheesy, richness. A nice complement to the rest of the meal. But honestly, as unexpected as it was, the Gnocchi stole the show. It is a potato gnocchi in the most incredible truffle cream sauce. Each tiny bite just melts in your mouth. Just thinking about it as I write this review a day later almost brings tears to my eyes. I have some left over in the fridge and I think I'm about to reheat it when I'm done here. It's side dishes like this that could make N9NE appeal to everyone, even those kooky vegetarians I've been reading about on the internet. Not sure if there are any Vegan dishes, but this place is friendly enough that they probably can accommodate.I saw the dessert menu and there seemed to be some amazing options. But I couldn't fit another bite of anything in my already stuffed, yet thoroughly satisfied stomach. This is a mission for next time.So you know the food was outrageous, but how was the service at a place that seems like it could easily be a typical pretentious Vegas establishment, with a nice decor and celebrities coming in daily? It was actually phenomenal. The bartenders are super personable and talented. I'm bad with names but I believe it was Anna and Kerry. The manager Christian was also very friendly and accommodating. In closing, this place checks off every aspect that I feel makes a great restaurant. If it was a little cheaper, I'd probably eat here every day. That's probably for the best though. I can't wait for my next visit, there's much more on the menu that I have to try. And obviously the Gnocchi Round 2.When finding out I was moving back the the Vegas, in no way did I think of going to The Palms...for ANYTHING. Well, maybe a Ditch Friday...and GBDC...and the Pearl...and the diner rueben... OK, fine. I would've been at The Palms. But I didn't see a 5-star meal coming from here. Enter N9NE.  Through the grapevine (yelp) I heard about this $65 AYCD 5-course prix fixe and since I had a date to impress, to N9NE we went! On a Monday at 6:45 the place was nearly empty. It's an odd looking spot. A giganto bar in the middle of the dining room and little to no decoration to be found. Any who, before I could really look around a friendly white coated waiter came over with some menus. I didn't even snag a look at it and went straight for the prix fixe. Off the waiter went and returned with a white wine. He went into a speech about it, but I stopped him and told him to pour first and ask questions later. He obliged, filled the glasses tall and went on his way. Class personified. The service was terrific throughout. Here's how the meal went...Amuse Bouche: Potato and celery soup - Small cup came out and wasn't as heavy as I expect most potato soups to be. You could definitely detect the celery flavor. Starters: French onion soup and garbage salad (a salad with a bit of everything) - LOVVEE both of these in concept and N9NE did them well. Bits of bleu cheese, olives, salami, tomato and others all over salad is always a good time. The soup was on point. Gooey cheese and salty broth make me a happy camper.Fish: *Note: I am buzzed at this pointStriped Sea Bass (Sautéed, Escarole & Beans, Black Garlic, Pancetta, Extra Virgin Olive Oil)- This was solid. Crunchy top with light bites of fish underneath. Next time I would probably skip this step and leave more room for the meat.  Entree: *Note- I am drunk now and the red wine has entered the picturePrime Ribeye Steak with grilled asparagus and parmesan mashed potatoes  - This bad boy was cooked perfectly rare and had was served in a plate of its own juices. Smooth move. If that wasn't enough, it was also served with 3 side sauces (Creamy Horseradish, Au Poivre and Béarnaise Sauce). Don't even bother with these. Although really salty (IMO), the crust was extremely flavorful and the piece was easy to cut. Not the best steak I've had this year, but doable. Dessert: - 3 mini pieces of a peanut butter cup, carrot cake (bomb!) and cheesecake. All fun, but you should prob be full by now. So, about those 5-stars. The food was FAR from perfect, but the experience was great. Anytime I leave a place full, tipsy and satisfied with a lady in hand (who was feeling the same), I'm more than just 'a fan'. Let's call it a generous 5 with a suggestion to have your next date night here. Tip: check out the worlds smallest TV's in the bathroomTrendy high end steakhouse inside of the Palms. I was taken here on a date and had an amazing experience...so kudos to the guy for choosing this joint.The service was great. We had a reservation and were greeted at the door. They were still getting our table ready so we decided to get a drink at the bar, which was right by the front of the restaurant. For our appetizers, we got the rock shrimp and garbage salad, which were both, fabulous. The server helped with suggesting those.I ended up ordering the bone in rib eye, which was cooked perfectly and had so much flavor, with a side of the mac and cheese, also just fantastic. He got the filet, which was good too but nowhere as amazing as my rib eye. I most likely scared him with my appetite for meat ...but what can I do? I love a good a rib eye.New look.  New menu.  Same vibe.Updated contemporary décor in a dining space where line of sight for celebrity sightings is as important as the LED mood lighting.  High energy, loud, for the young and young at heart.  Quality steaks but, "not your daddy's steakhouse".    The new menu sees the addition of dry aged beef,  contemporary cuts and steakhouse staples such as a  beautiful braised short rib and a classic 3lb lobster thermidor.Starters fail to impress.  Secondary to conversation or an after thought kickin it with your buds, the flavors are correct, the presentation OK, no WOW factor.  The fried rock shrimp OK.  Perfectly cooked but the accompanying lemon aioli increases the oily mouth feel.  The lobster pot stickers with bok choy, shitake mushrooms and a chile ginger soy sauce, not memorable.  The king crab and gruyere stuffed shrooms, a tasty bite but the cheese masks the sweetness of the crab.The steaks.  All USDA prime, wet aged (except he 35 and 50 day dry aged rib eyes), very well trimmed.  Excellent sear.  Even cooking.  Accurate temp.  Standard cuts are, well standard.  Great bone in fillet and porterhouse.  The 35 day dry aged rib steak is tender, and pleasantly nutty with hints of cheesy aroma and a wafting umame finish.  The 50 day, meltingly tender with a pronounced bleu cheese aroma.  Some funkiness at the edges, not for everyone.  The standout, "Barry's Steak".  A simple grilled rib cap.  Tender, packed with flavor.  Served with complementing cipollini onions and shishito peppers.For entrees, the "Kobe" short rib is excellent.  Not true Kobe beef but, perfectly braised, not stringy, finished with a horseradish crust served with curried root veg and a Cabernet sauce, the earthy flavors marry well.  The lobster thermidor, a classic in every respect.  At three pounds, massive, with firm but still juicy meat enveloped in cream and cheese.  Simply put, good eats.For sides, the creamed corn, adds a great sweetness to any steak.  The broccoli and cauliflower gratin with a cheddar cheese sauce complements the dry aged steaks umame finish.  The highly touted lobster mashed potato is good but far to rich as a side dish to steaks.  It steals the show.Very good service.  Steakhouse proper despite the cool vibe of the place.  Very good wine list.  Vegas resort prices.A steakhouse that understands what not having "Las Vegas Blvd" in its address means.  Translated:  it's less expensive, omits baller ingredients but manages to keep the vibe of the Palms.What an amazing experience I had while at N9NE Steakhouse at the Palms! If you haven't visited this place yet, set a date as soon as possible! I can't wait to go back for round 2!Here are the highlights:1. The hostesses are actually nice! This seems so rare in the fancier steakhouses.  It was a nice way to start the night.2. Awesome bartenders and strong drinks!  We actually arrived a bit early, so we headed to the bar for a cocktail.  It turns out it was Ladies Night, which is every Wednesday.  They had several drinks for $5 and apps for $9.  Not too shabby!3. The atmosphere is beautiful! The GM, who stopped by our table to chat, told us it was recently remodeled.  It is very pretty and the new booth seating is quite comfy. Nothing is better than great food and being comfortable as you totally pig out! 4. OhMyGoodness the FOOD!!!!! We had some awesome food on this visit.  I think I got pictures of almost everything, but they don't do the food justice.  Everything was fantastic! I am still thinking about my amazing Classic Ribeye and the Hot Potatoes Austin Gratin.  Of course, the memories of the Crab Stuffed Mushrooms, Potato Gnocchi, Creamed Corn, and Buffalo Chicken Wontons keep fighting for space too! Ok, I just drooled on the keyboard!5. OhMyGoodness the sommelier and the wine pairings for the night!  I am totally not a wine person.  I have never really acquired the taste for wine, so I usually just skip it all together.  This night though, we had an awesome sommelier take care of us for dinner.  He made me totally rethink my stance on wine! We started with Pierre Joliot Champagne to celebrate some fun stuff going on in our lives right now and then it just keep coming.  I can't remember the names of all of the of other wines we had, but they were all fantastic! If you have the chance, ask for Marco and his sommelier services for the night.  He is totally worth it!6. The desserts! We had the Banana Pudding Pie and the S'mores.  Both were so fun and yummy.  I would have to recommend the s'mores though because it was so much fun!  You get fire at your table, in-house made marshmallows in plain, strawberry, banana, and chocolate flavors, and graham crackers already loaded with chocolate! Yummy!7. We even got to meet the Chef! It's always so much fun to have the Chef come out to meet you.  Nice touch N9NE!8. I almost forgot to mention the Béarnaise!!! I love love love Béarnaise sauce.  The Béarnaise sauce here was ah-ma-zing! My sister and I were fighting over the last drop.  The other three sauces were tasty and I would recommend you get all four and play around with them, but the Béarnaise is definitely the best of the four!9. And last by not least, the service! Our server was fantastic! Everyone we encountered through the meal was great.  Everyone was en pointe and giving 110%.  This is really what sealed the deal on this fabulous meal.  We felt like royalty the entire meal!!!This meal was easily in my top 5 of all time.  My sister and I had such a great time! I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone that would listen to me!I have no idea where to start; My boyfriend and I ate here on Saturday night, we were staying at the Palms, checked in late, it had been a long day , we decided since it was so  late we would ask the front desk at check-in how they felt about Nine Steakhouse and Nove Italiano, most seemed a little more pumped on Nine so we decided to give it a try, I really wanted to like this place based on the feedback we received at Check-in, but unfortunately I was utterly disappointed!!!!For starters we had the oysters on the half shell which was ok; the garnishes were a spicy cocktail sauce and some sort of wine sauce that you drizzle on the oyster, pretty good.Our waiter was somewhat pushy we had just received our glass of champagne to go with our oysters and he was ready to take our wine order and food order, let us enjoy one thing at a time! Can we savor the moment, please, since it would all go downhill after this! We placed our order:  Organic Fire Chicken for myself and My boyfriend had the 18oz Prime Bonein Ribeye (35 Day, Dry Aged). To share: Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Mac and Cheese and Garbage Salad, we were hungry! Organic Fire Chicken, the concept was good, I see where they were going with this, however the chicken was dry I paired this with a Merlot which was much needed to assist in washing down the dry chicken. Prime Bonein Ribeye steak - My boyfriends first thought I can cook a better steak, but whatever he takes it down no complaining, he hates complaining.  Lobster Mashed Potatoes - Way too fishy for my liking, didn't mesh well. Mac and Cheese - I've had WAY better, in fact my Mac n cheese is better!  Garbage Salad - wouldn't know, never received it! Basket of Bread - Full of Gnat Flies, two lingered around long enough to take a picture see in pictures #307We complained to the waiter on the things we were unhappy with and let him know we never got our salad, he said I'm sorry about that, we told him about the flies he said "I'm sorry about that, its summer". No buddy it feels like summer, it isn't summer yet!  Offers us a free entry to the Ghostbar, what a joke! We couldn't even get into the lounge "they were at capacity". Back in our room - my boyfriend starts feeling sick, next morning I'm vomiting!! Great, We've been food poisoned or picked up a bug from this place! Never would recommend this place to my worst enemy or set foot in this place ever again!!!!  Who is running this disgusting establishment? We should of spoke to a manager, but my boyfriend the guy who hates to complain preferred to pay our $246.00 tab and move on, well I can't move on especially when I am still grossed out on food 4 days later, so here I am on yelp! Just don't eat here, there is way better out there, trust me!Happy 5 year anniversary to me and my beau! And this was the perfect place to celebrate it at!We got seated with Sandy (Thanks Carl I.). She was amazing, she really hooked it up! We decided to start out with Moscow Mules. Best moscow mules ever! They bring out a copper cup with vodka and the ginger beer bottle and pour it in front of you. Oh how I love ginger beer! Sandy also brought us out some toasting champagne. Cheers to another 5 years!Cesar salad came out with some bread. The bread was so good. It was different kinds. I picked up one that had onions inside the bread oh that was really good! Only thing I didn't like about the salad was it had big chunks of bacon. Like really BIG fatty bacon! Another round of moscow mules and champagne...My eyes watered when our food came out. I got the Surf and Turf -- 8oz filet mignon, Maine lobster on top with white truffle aioli and it laid on some Bomb mashed potatoes. Or I think it was mashed potatoes! The meat was cooked with absolute perfection. The lobster was not minimal but a lot and paired well with the aioli sauce. My mouth waters as I write this review. The beau got the 18oz bone in ribeye that had been dry aged for 35 days! It was ginormous! I don't know how he finished that thing! We also got the Lobster Mashed Potatoes as our side. Yes I know.. Lobster again!! Yes lobster again! I love lobster. Best decision yet! Because that dish was so fantastically delicious! Again, there was loads of lobster. Next time I'm gonna get the Lobster Mac N Cheese! We were absolutely full. But Sandy brought us out some dessert! Smores! They brought out a small fire stove device, crackers with dark & white chocolate, marshmallows and sticks! we had a mini campfire at our table. Stay with caution though because I almost burned the restaurant down twice. I'm exaggerating! Overall, a great anniversary dinner. Thank you N9NE, thank you Sandy, thank you Carl I., and Thank you to my beloved beau for the amazing night! Can't wait to come back!

For a 24 hour cafe in a hotel, this restaurant is not bad at all!  Here's a quick list of the Pros and Cons of this restaurant....PROS: The food! The swiss cheese and chicken sandwich is excellent! Very tender chicken, with a pesto mayo spread and all the fixings.  Also served with huge pickle and very good friesPaying the cashier up front; you don't have to wait for your server to keep coming back to you for the bill and then back with your change or cc.  Huge seating area, this is a must especially in a big casino like the ExcaliburFriendly servers and cashiers.  CONS: Nice, but SLOW service.  The line to get into the cafe especially during peak times can stretch out into the casino floor. You don't really know who your server is, one person comes to take your drink order, the other takes your food order, one person delivers it, etc.  But as long as you get everything you need, I guess it doesn't matter huh?  Definitely a fan, especially for the chicken sandwich!

Review Text :
Visted twice in the past few weeks.  First visit was for happy hour, and I tried three items at $5 each: the house margarita, the churrasco (steak skewers) cooked medium-rare, and a Tex-Mex take on eggrolls.  LOVED the margarita... one of the best I've ever had!  Really liked the eggrolls (pork, carrots, black beans).  Can't say the same for the skewers, though, as they weren't cooked enough- chewy texture and still pretty bloody, actually.  Yes, I ordered them cooked medium-rare, but I've ordered steak burgers at the same temperature before at a few other places and all came out very edible.  These weren't.  If I were to order them again, and I probably won't, I'd go for medium to medium-well.  On the second visit, I had their cheeseburger, cooked medium-rare, with smoked gouda (wow!), sweet potato fries as the accompanying side, and (subbed) chipotle mayo.  I found the buns used very, very tasty- loved the grilled texture.  Last, but certainly not least, the sweet potato fries were superb!  These were light, non-greasy, no cinnamon-sugar coating, and easy on the salt.  I loved it both ways- at times plain, and other times dipped in the chipotle mayo.  Should I ever have a craving for SPF, I'm heading to Cafe Carumba!  Very friendly service and clean women's restroom.  I'll definitely be back!If you go to Cafe Carumba try the charuscurra (sp) sticks.  And the rocky point pizza.  And the spicy jalepeno sausage slider things.  And the mini chimis.  And the...well try whatever you can but unless you are with a big group for an event you may not that far through the offerings.I attended an event at Cafe Carumba and I was impressed with the food and the service.  I would keep them in mind for corporate gatherings or even a small meeting (they have a private room for such things).The staff at the bar was great as were the servers.

What is the name of every fourth male born in Greece?George!George, who I believe is the owner, took care of us over lunch the other day... When we asked his name, he responded with the trivia question above!  He is quite the character.We started with a dip sampler platter that had 4 dips:  Tsatziki, TaramoSalata, MelitsanoSalata, and one more... but it wasn't hummus.  They don't serve hummus at Greektown.  The dips were accompanied by perfectly warmed pita bread.  I could've made a meal out of the pita and TaramosSalata, but I had a Greek Salad as well.It was the perfect lunch portion.  A tad bit on the overdressed, garlicky side, but luckily I wasn't planning on kissing anyone that afternoon.I don't live near Greektown, but if I'm ever in that hood again, I wouldn't hesitate to return!
Mantra Masala=A quiet nicely decorated Indian restaurant in the southwest area of town.  We were the only diners on a Sunday night (which usually isn't a good thing), but they are hidden away.The Husband and I shared:* Lamb Biryani "Baked casserole of basmati rice and lamb richly flavored with saffron." ($16.95) - The Husband has a special liking to biryani and immediately looked through the menu for this item.  He ordered it spicy and definitely enjoyed it, more so with the leftovers the next day.* Malai Kofta "Mixed vegetable dumplings in savory creamy spiced sauce." ($12.95) - I'm all about any kind of creamy sauce and there are very few I don't like in Indian cuisine.  Their version was super tasty and really good with the garlic nan bread.  Yum!  I chose medium for my spice.  It also came with rice.  The dumplings were just okay though.* Garlic Nan "Leavened bread baked with fresh chopped garlic in the tandoor." ($2.95) - When going nan, garlic is the only way to go.  So good, I could only wish for more.Overall, the food was pretty good.  Our waiter was definitely attentive, until he got stuck on the phone with a to go order.  It is rather expensive for the two entrees and condiment we ordered, even with an Entertainment Book coupon.  We'd consider going again, but definitely know why the Indian lunch buffets do so well in the city.Oh boy. A rare bad review. Let me state clearly that I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt. At first I thought "Maybe it's because I'm here on (insert any day of the week but Monday)", or maybe because "I'm here (alone/with a date/with colleagues)" . a half-dozen "benefits of the doubt". No more! I'm never going back.No cocktails, no beer, only wine. "Lunch Specials" are advertised, but apparently no lunch buffet. In no way could this restaurant be considered competitive. Not in the West End of London (by far!), not in Silicon Valley, not in Washington D.C. ,  and not even in the desert wasteland of Indian Cuisine that is The Southwest Neighborhood of Las Vegas. Even in a field of 1, this restaurant doesn't rate.  Unless you live in the Southwest Neighborhood, you would never know this place exists except for listing conglomerators with apps in the app store. And that's probably just as well . Service is consistently slow, though courteous. This is truly the only Indian restaurant west of Decatur but you would never know it. Ask for a booth or table right next to the telephone...so you can listen to the chirping of the ringer ring of the hook the -entire- length of your dinner. This is a classic example of a poorly-run restaurant that gives Las Vegas restaurants a bad name.  Why is the phone ringing off the hook? Because everybody from a 10-mile radius is ordering from one of those UHAUL-style food delivery places and this is the only Indian-cuisine restaurant in the area. Is the food authentic? Is the food fairly priced? Is the wine list good? I  think the answers to these questions is "probably, yes", but really what is "authentic Indian cuisine"? If you read the original owner's numerous publicly-available print-media articles you would conclude there is no more  "authentic Indian cuisine" than this restaurant. I  don't think most people who are frequent customers choose to eat here because of this restaurant's value, authenticity, or wine list...and really couldn't care less about the poor service. I  think most frequent customers of this restaurant eat here because they work in the nearby Dignity Heath San Martin hospital complex, they live in the traffic-jam-central nearby housing developments of  Mountain's Edge or Rhodes Ranch (both developments notoriously crammed to the gills with more residential units than can be supported by the surrounding businesses causing huge infrastructure problems... ) or any of the mega-complex apartment villages that plague the Southwest Neighborhood. This restaurant will never attract a sufficient level of tourist traffic because of its location, and there is no alternative restaurant of this ethnic specialty within any reasonable amount of driving time, and the residents of the aforementioned housing developments and local employers like the hospital are totally accustomed to poor quality and poor service, so this business will always remain. The ambience of the restaurant holds no value for a romantic liaison, a business conversation, or even a large gathering like a UYE. Only those with a LOT of time on their hands come here at night. Like only retirees and families with multiple children bother coming here at night (which describes the predominant makeup of those who live in this neighbourhood). I  doubt anybody but the management of this restaurant and Yelpers who will never have the chance to visit this restaurant will ever read this review. That being said, I offer one piece of advice, and I  bet you can't guess what it is.... Is it "Try the Lamb Vindaloo" or "Save room for a Mango Lassi"? No. It is simple: Bring a bottle of water in your purse when you come here for dinner. Better yet, just go next door to Teriyaki Madness and save your money.(Why is this restaurant's ambience poor? The telephone ringing constantly, for starters. Secondly, the interior design seems like it was designed in some computer game like "The Sims" or by midgets with vengeance against tall people. Also, the second booth has cloth so thread bare the stuffing is poking out. The booths are placed so close together you have to be a little person to fit into them without feeling like the table is poking you in the stomach and I am by far certainly not a candidate for weight loss! The "mantra" here should be "if you have time to lean you have time to clean" but it is, sadly, not.)
Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant=Heading to the heart of Las Vegas's Chinatown, I'm checking out Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant for their dim sum.  It's about 1 pm on a Saturday and this restaurant isn't as busy as I had hoped.  (Not a good sign.)My friend and her dining companion are already enjoying their Pineapple Buns with Egg Custard when we arrive. This is definitely a good sign!  (I'm not sure if the buns were hot when they came out, since I arrived a bit late.)  I enjoyed the sweetness of the custard, but the BF found it to be too sweet for him.We ordered their standard shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings.  Both were standard.  They even had the Shanghai dumplings readily available as well.  They were tastier than Orchids Garden's version, that's for sure! http://www.yelp.com/biz/Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ?hrid=aU3RP30FNJmzdi1e-Ksa-g  And since the red vinegar is left out on the table, you can feel free to drown it as much as you'd like!We also had Chinese broccoli, shrimp on tofu, crab/shrimp puff thing, shrimp rice noodle, and chicken feet in black bean sauce.  All were pretty good.  We even had the salt and pepper shrimp that came right out of the kitchen, so it was nice and hot.  The downside?  Service was blah, I mean really blah.  The ladies never smiled or showed any personality whatsoever.  And the guys working there were not that great either.  They refilled our teapot, but left it on the far end of the table, out of our reach.  One lady was very indifferent as she slid our order across our table.  They were quick to clean up our plates once the bill was settled, which can be a good or bad thing.  (It usually means they want you out of their fast so they can have the table back.)Instead of sending the carts to the back for refills, they have waiters carrying a bunch of dishes in their hands or stacking them up and then placing them on a the cart.  I'm not so sure this is visually appealing.  The bill was about $40 for four, not including tip.  We found this to be a bit more expensive than Orchids Garden and Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine since we know we ate less here.  (The BF wasn't so sure we got the correct bill even since the guy handling all the checks seemed quite unorganized.)Overall, the selection was there, although lacking in desserts.  (I did see the sweet tofu come out, but no custard tarts!)  They did have a few things that some of the other dim sum restaurants didn't seem to have.  Sometimes you get the feeling they are really trying to push a dish on you.  I mean, how often can the congee lady come by asking if we want congee?  Because the restaurant is a bit smaller and they don't push the carts into the back, you'll find the ladies 'idling' by one side of the restaurant, which was pretty much hanging out by our table.  They could really use a lesson or two in customer service.  If they can fix this a bit, I might even be willing to give them a better score rather than a stiff 3 star.There's a reason why Harbor Palace ranks on the bottom of my list of dim sum places in Vegas.It was my second visit ever and it just reconfirmed my experience from the first time I went.Saturday brunch - 11:30 am arrival.  Not as busy as I would expect.  (Bad sign.)We have a large party, five adults and four children.  As a result, we're seated in one of the larger tables in the room set off to the right of the restaurant.We had barely sat down, especially with getting all the young kids seated, when the cart lady was hollering, "You want dim sum!?"  I was immediately put off with her attitude and probably would have left if it was just the Husband and I.  (My Chinese friend mentioned that her mom has a simple standard of dim sum restaurants - tea should be placed on the table before the food is brought out.  And she's right.  Growing up, that's the first thing I remember from my many dim sum brunches.  The waiters ask what kind of tea you want (usually as you're getting situated), and before the carts come, the tea is on your table.)But in this case, we felt so pressured to order from the lady's cart and had baskets of food on our table way before the beverage guy came around to ask what we wanted to drink.  (I will say that he brought the tea and water over quickly and had our tea pots filled the whole time, of course with my help of flipping the cover up.)  We got the typical orders of pork dumplings and shrimp dumplings.  Nothing special here, more dried out from over-steaming, if that makes sense.  We got a couple orders of beef balls and was surprised they didn't cut it in half (I've always seen it cut in half), nor was any Worcestershire sauce given.Rice noodle dishes came by and I asked (in Cantonese) if they had Beef Noodle Roll.  She said they did, looked around, then asked if I wanted the Pork Spare Ribs one.  I said fine, and then she asked about the Shrimp one too, which I said was fine.  (Although she did try sneaking another one onto our table until we caught her in time to just say only one!)  And of course, the beef one never showed up.  I asked for Egg Custard Bun, and she said they had it, but tried passing off some yellow bean one as well.  We did eventually get the Egg Custard Bun and it was not good....hard, dry and old.  Bleh!Deep fried chicken wings were decent the first time around, but even better when we got them nice and hot.  The deep fried salt and pepper shrimp was also nice and hot when we got it too.Other dishes included steamed pork buns, chow mein noodles, Chinese broccoli (been sitting out too long), shrimp and tofu, chicken feet, and steamed beef tripe.  Nothing memorable though.The Husband wasn't eating much from the very start and I had to wonder why.  He discreetly pointed to the HAIR that was sitting on his rice noodle dish.  Oh. Yuck.  (And unfortunately we did not say anything about it then or at the end since we were with guests.  But normally, we would have at least tried to point it out after we paid.  And no, you never say anything during your meal because we all know what happens at Chinese restaurants if you complain.)Overall, Harbor Palace is just not that good. We weren't that impressed the first time and we aren't impressed now.  And the service is beyond bad here.  Sure, I know everyone says you can't expect much on service at dim sum restaurants, but this places leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  It's not even worth tolerating.They do have hot chili oil available on the tables, not just regular chili sauce.  And please stop asking for Sriracha sauce, you know who you are!
La Casa Blanca=I've driven past this place dozens of times and wondered if they were any good.  I found the existing reviews inconclusive so we decided to drop in for dinner one evening.When we arrived we immediately liked the outdoor area and the warm decor inside.  A couple came in behind us and we inquired if they had been there before.  They replied that they had and we asked if it was good.  The husband shrugged and uttered, "Meh.  It's gringo."We stayed and shared an appetizer and an entree.  We were served a small dish of frijoles and a small dish of salsa.  To our surprise the frijoles were rather hot.  Not terribly flavorful, just spicy.  The salsa was ok and spicy as well.As if to continue in the same vein, our enchiladas arrived and the filling was very spicy.  Again, not terribly flavorful, just spicy.  We had one pork enchilada and one beef enchilada.  I couldn't tell which was which for sure.The tacos el carbon appetizer that we shared had so much fresh, raw onion on it that we were tearing up and picking it off.  Strange.Well, now we know and we won't wonder about it when we drive by but we certainly won't be back.I like spicy food that is flavorful not just hot for the sake of being hot and nothing else going on.If it was possible, I would give this place ZERO stars, actually negative stars. My family had hands down the WORST service experience here we have ever had at any restaurant in AZ. The sad part is we had been coming to this place for several years now, and even had my 30th Birthday party with family and friends here last year. We have noticed the both the quality of the food and quality of the service has been severely declining recently. However, tonight's debacle takes the cake for all time worst experience ever. Here's what happened... We arrive at 6:15 and get a table for 5 plus a highchair. We are seated within less than 5 minutes. Server arrives (Sean) soon after we sit down and gets water for the table. We had to wait a while for him to take our order because he disappeared for a bit... maybe waited 15 min for him to come back. Here is where things really start to go south... so we are waiting, and waiting, and waiting... at about 6:50 he comes out and says our food should arrive shortly. Then 7:00 rolls around, still no food. Then the table next to us (about 6-8 people I think) that arrived a good 30 minutes or so AFTER us gets their food. Then another table that arrives after us gets their food too... then a table of 4 that arrived literally 15 minutes ago, gets their food. Now we are thinking something is wrong with this picture.  So we ask for our server, he is no where to be found. So we wait... and wait... and wait... AGAIN. When he does show up, we ask for our food to-go because we have been waiting over an hour at this point (it was 7:20pm) and we had no food and had to go because our baby was getting fussy. He takes my husbands credit card to charge us for our food and says he will bring it right back... 10 minutes later... STILL NO FOOD and no server to be found, which means my husbands card has gone missing. In this time frame I had gone to the front to speak with the Manager with my Mom to let her know what happened and to see if they could locate our server, food and most importantly our credit card. The manager, the sorry excuse for a manager that is, arrives and is downright rude. She never apologizes and only says "we are really swamped" as I look around at half full rooms of people and say "are you serious?". We have been waiting well over an HOUR, all of the tables around us have food, the people that arrived 15 minutes ago next to us have their food. We want to leave and we want our card now. She disappears in the back and never returns. Meanwhile in the dining room... my food arrives (at 7:45pm) and guess what... they put it on FLOUR tortillas, even though I specifically asked for corn and said I cannot have flour because of a gluten intolerance. My husband noticed the mistake and asked the waiter "are these flour? My wife can't have flour, we told you that." and the waiter (Sean) says "well yes, but she can just scrape the food off and eat it without the tortilla." WHAT!?!? You have to be kidding me!?!? So someone with an allergy should just "scrape food off" to eat it?? This is literally no joke... the guy actually said "scrape it off, she will be fine" We then say, we are leaving please give our card back... and the waiter said he didn't charge it. We get home and check our account... guess what?? THEY CHARGED THE CARD!!! For food that arrived over an hour late, was cold, the wrong thing, and most of all this waiter was so ignorant to suggest "scraping it off to eat it". The ignorance and lack of any fiber of customer service or common sense is baffling. Save yourself the hassle and go to a different place where the wait staff is helpful, and the food is much better... or even arrives at your table.I used to live right down the street from La Casa Blanca and my wife and I used to visit once a week but that was 3 years ago. We moved to Gilbert and didn't visit until tonight. Walking in on a Friday night in the past you had to wait but now none of the tables in the front room had customers only the booths were used and the back room didn't have anything going on. I read the past reviews and I was stunned because it used to be a 4 star eats. But now I didn't believe it was possible to have food there without flavor and how do you make Mexican food bland? Is it even possible? But yes it is possible but man they did a great job and the wait staff was just blah. They could not care if we were there if we there. They were not rude just not engaged at all. I'm very sad at what happened to this place. I don't know if it changed owners or management but we won't be returning. Good Luck out there.
The Carlton=Five of us had dinner at The Carlton last night and it was a wonderful dining experience. For appetizers we had: 1 jumbo lump crab cake, 1 beet salad, 1 lobster and crab gnocchi, and 2 house salads. The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake which I ordered, was meaty with crab and was very rich sitting atop of Julianne vegetables. The Dijon Cream and fresh herb sauce it came with was just delicious. The gnocchi was tender and mild which allowed the lobster and crab to predominate the flavor profile. It was served in a Spinach, Caramelized Onions and Tomato-Ketel One Cream base. Very tasty indeed.Salad eaters, house and beet, all said they were great as well. These were all very good size appetizers so you might save some for taking home if you plan on heavy entrees and tend to fill-up fast.With the appetizers we also finished off two lemon cream martinis, one sour apple martini and one Grey Goose on the rocks with a twist, and one Arnold Palmer (AP refills aplenty). All drinks were made well. The had a nice martini list, a pretty good wine by the glass list and a full wine list which comes out on an iPad. Pretty cool approach. I am not counting but they say they have over 500 wines on the list. Enough to match any taste or meal. Later for dinner we wanted some rich, creamy full mouth Chardonnay so the proprietor suggested Sonoma-Cutrer for us. This was delicious and great match with our food.Dinner entrees were hard to choose from the extensive menu which includes some great daily specials which they say usually change every day. Sticking with a theme, I went the seafood route all night and choose the Florida Grouper which was prepared oven roasted and was fresh Parmesan crusted and served with Lobster Pierogies, Spring Vegetables and Roast Garlic Butter. Oh my was this meal ever rich and tender. The Grouper was completely melt in your mouth fresh and tender, and I exaggerate not one bit. The Pierogies were moist, tender and full of lobster stuffing and it went so well with the Grouper. Boy this was a satisfying choice. Three people, were enticed by the 14 oz. medium to medium rare Prime Rib. They all came out looking absolutely beautiful. Jody who is the real Prime Rib  connoisseur said that his ranked up with the best of them. Jody has traveled and lived or visited may cities for extended stays.  He has lived in Las Vegas so he had the opportunity to eat a Lawry's Prime Rib several times. To which I can say when I ate there with him a time or two, and I thought it was the best I ever had. So that puts The Carlton up with the best prime rib places in our judgment.Linda went for the Ahi Tuna entrée, which she said was extremely fresh and tender with the fabulous Tuna flavor one seeks in the best sushi. But it doesn't come naked. It's preparation is fresh Wasabi-Panko crusted with the Ahi Tuna seared rare and served with Curry-Coconut Orzo, Asian Greens, Hearts of Palm-Julienne Carrots and Yuzu Butter. This was a beautiful and tasteful preparation. Had enough to bring home and it served as a special breakfast this morning.I have to say that everything was really outstanding at The Carlton. Topping it off with some personal service, Kevin Joyce, the owner stopped at our table to see if we were enjoying or meals.  Have to hand it to Kevin, his professional staff, and especially Executive Chef Mark Swomley who has been there for 16 years. The Carlton itself has been around for 27 years which I think is a real testament to its enduring quality and service. You can not go wrong here.
Canter's Delicatessen=Days of the $3.99 Las Vegas buffets are gone.  Well I'm sure you can find one, but I'm also sure it'll give you a Kenyan colon.It's all about $16 sandwiches nowadays.  More precisely, the $16 pastrami on rye.After arriving to Las Vegas, the boys and I were famished.  We dropped off our bags in our room that had two....yes...two toilets in separate bathrooms. This is important when you are sharing a room with guys that are all experts in the art of synchronized bowel movements.  Then herded down to the casino floor.  After shoulder bumping all the sloppy drunk girls with runny mascara we made it to the promise land.The pastrami on rye.  Not overly salty.  Tender.  And more importantly, a genorous heap of sensual pastrami.   Just thinking of it makes me yearn for it.  I positioned it in my hands as to where I wouldn't bite off my fingers and devoured it ever so quietly hoping no one would see me.When I looked down upon my empty plate, I was left wondering where my pastrami on rye went. Had I lost myself in it entirely and lost all sense of reality that I was left wondering if it was fictional?I left and the thought of what had happened haunted me the whole night while I was splitting 8's and doubling down on 10's and 11's.  All the while having the surgically enhanced cocktail waitress bringing me vodka tonics. Only to have myself imagine her cleavage was actually a mound of Canter's Pastrami.  Hallelujah.
Baladie Café=I was eating lunch here on a consistent basis for a few months until I moved. After a substantial hiatus, I decided to pay this old friend a visit. Upon entering the cafe, the owner immediatly recognized me and said, "I have something for you!" and ran into the back to fetch a sweater I had left here FOUR MONTHS EARLIER! Sure, it stunk like it had been deep fried, but I was pretty amazed that they a) remembered me, b) held onto an article of my clothing for so long. But I digress- the food here is fresh and consistently tasty, and (obviously) the couple that own and run the place are super friendly. They cook up the best falafel I've had in Vegas, these aren't the usual crusty balls of powdered chickpea and celery salt deep fried until they're but a memory of vegetable many understand to be falafel. They are fresh, bright green balls with bits of parsley and cilantro clearly visible when you bite into them. They also serve great Greek fries, shawarma that is neither dry nor greasy, and good homemade lentil stew. Ample indoor seating, limited outdoor seating. Pet friendly!I brought the BF for lunch...poor thing has been sick and needs some good,simple, healthy foods. We split:A falafel wrap- yummy. Fresh falafel, cucumbers, onions, lettuce, hummus, chili sauce. The falafel is fresh made and not some box mix.A Greek plate which has spanakopita, moussaka, gyro meat, tzatsiki, 2 dolmas, fetta cheese, half greek salad, pita bread. The spanakopita was wrapped individually in phyllo and not cut out of a casserole. I like theirs- it's not greasy like other places. The moussaka came as a surprise....most places it's so dry and taste like it sat around. This was saucy and had a nice balance of spices....I would actually order a whole portion here, which I have never done. I made little sandwiches with the gyro, pita, tomatoes and olive on the plate and tzatziki- all good. Dolmas here are great. I bought a box of baklava to take home. I like that they don't over pour honey on the layer of nuts since that usually makes it so hard to bite through. It's just right amounts of everything. Me loves. So glad I was able to come back...it's been a while since my first visit though I promised to be back! Better late than never, but the next visit should come sooner.This is what YELP is for and the Baladie cafe is for Yelpers!  I can really appreciate a small privately owned place.  I appreciate a place where the owners appreciate my business. It is a small place in a Vons plaza - but the Vons is closed.  I have been by here a million times but never even thought about going in here for lunch. It is a tiny place with 5 or 6 tables.  They have mediterranean food and greek food.  I had the Gyro plate with some fries.  The fries were seasoned and served with a flavorful dipping sauce.  The Gyro plate had all the fixins for a gyro but it was unassembled.  I liked putting it together.   All the ingredients were fresh and flavorful.This place offers a great value.  The food is quality eats... something you would expect in a finer establishment with higher prices.  So for a quick serve place and quick serve prices - you get great food, real plates, and great service!Since I live in the general area it was refreshing to find a mom and pop joint mixed in with all of the chain restaurants.(I have been staring at my computer debating whether I should do 4 or 5 stars...)Baladie Cafe is a diamond in the rough, a true winner in a neighborhood that generally suffers from a lack of great cuisine.  Thanks to Jade and my trusted Yelpers for finding this spot.  It's fairly close to my work, and I can't believe I have found it just recently.I have been twice so far, and each time has gotten better.  First time around I had the Greek Platter, which is a fun sampler of a few different Greek foods.  The pita bread can be separated into a pocket for stuffing your samples.  I enjoyed every bit of it!  The second visit I had the Shawerma wrap with added feta cheese and seasoned french fries, ordered spicy of course.  The wrap comes with a thicker pita bread, pre-wrapped with goodness.   It is basically like a gyro, but with hummus instead of Tzatziki sauce.  I have to say, the hummus is friggin killer here.  I much prefer it over the Tzatziki sauce.  In fact, if I were to find one thing that isn't five star about this place, it would be the Tzatziki sauce.  It is just a little bland to me.  The service is friendly and casual.  This family owned business aims to please.  When we went today with some coworkers, we brought our "meat and potatoes" coworker (basically he has the pallet of a 5 year old).  The owner heard us teasing him as we always do, and when he came to our table to ask if everything was good, he joked, "I'm asking him, not you!" He already knows I'm a huge fan, and his concern was to please even the pickiest eater!Baladie Cafe is exactly the kind of restaurant I use Yelp for. A locally owned place most would pass right over, but for the massive number of positive reviews. I was not disappointed by the food. One caveat before my review; I am not knowledgeable about Mediterranean food, so my review is based solely on taste, and nothing on authenticity.You can get pita wraps, kabobs, spanakopita, moussaka, and platters with a mix of food. Wanting to try a bit of everything, I went with the Greek Sampler. It came with:1) Half Greek salad - good flavor on the dressing, but don't expect many toppings.2) Spanakopita - Savory pastry with spinach, quite good3) Moussaka - An eggplant dish, I don't like eggplant but the meat & potatoes were flavorful4) Pita, Gyro meat, Tzatziki sauce - Best Gyro meat I've had, nice taste on the sauce5) Dolmas (2) - Rice & flavoring wrapped in Grape leaves - Soft rice, nice tasteThe highlight of the night had to be the pistachio baklava. Not too sweet, and not too dry. I ordered 2, and almost went back for more they were so good. I'm trying to decide how often I can go back before it gets to be weird.Once you've been once, you can call ahead for your order, but they have very quick service even when you walk in. I will definitely be going back soon to try something else.Baladie Café is what you get when one of the nicest families you will ever meet move to Las Vegas from Algeria and decide to open a Mediterranean place featuring classic dishes from Greece, Lebanon and Egypt prepared in an authentic style that oozes fresh, clean flavors!I was so happy to come by this place thanks to Yelp! I started with a gyro.  It was one of the more balanced gyros I have ever had.  It is not a carnivorous indulging as the typical American version, but what it lacks in quantity of meat it makes up for  again and again in flavor and...wait did I already say balance?...but that is the perfect word!  The perfect amount of fresh veggies, meat, and sauce!  Their gyros come on traditional Arabic flat bread rather than the pita many of us are used to...which allows for a more harmonious experience of ingredients.I also enjoyed their hummus.  I asked for it a little spicy and they added some olive oil soaked, chopped serrano peppers...too perfect for me!  I tried a friend's tabouli salad...it was on point as well.  They know their classics!  Finally, I asked about their falafel....just inquired.  The owner asked if I wanted to try one, had his wife make one fresh, and brought it out.  It was one of the better falafels I have had.  I would certainly order them in the future...especially in a wrap!I almost forgot about the unsweetened mint Ice tea!  Beautiful, traditional, fresh, bright, clean, and tasty.  (I don't normally do sweet teas though, fyi)The location leaves a little to be desired...It is not in a bad area or anything...just in an older strip mall...a little small and basic on the inside.  Perfect for lunch, not what I'm looking for if I'm going out for dinner...oh yeah, closed on Sundays, so fit it in your schedule Monday - Saturday.Well, After seeing this place on Yelp for 2 years, I finally made my way over. I always forget that there is another Greek place in the area, and I will never forget again.This place is absolutely delectable. We had the -Gyro wrap with the spicy sauce addedHerb Fries w/ some kind of herb dipping sauce that was so different but so yummy.AND THE BAKLAVA. The baklava was so good, so light and crispy with a perfect amount of honey.The ONLY thing I feel is lacking - I wish they would put a little more meat in the Gyros. The pita is thin, which I love. But there wasn't a flowing amount of meat, which is what most places do. So maybe I'll just order double meat next time.We walked in for lunch, and the couple that owns the place quickly greeted us and were very friendly. It's just the perfect little ma and pop place tucked away in this little corner. I can't wait to come back here again and it will be my go to place for Greek food in the NW corner of Vegas. Come here and support the small businesses!!I spent two years on a mission in Athens and a little in Thessaloniki.  I rarely find Greek food I really like.This is very good and it is a sweet little place.  little cafe.  Owners are fun with some Mediterranean personality.  Even in Greece, the food differs from shop to shop.  Excellent here.  Baklava to die for, Feta is  (soft and very delicious!).  Their fries with spices are EXCELLENT.  All was great!I would have to say this is one of my favorite Mediterranean/Greek restaurants. We've visited twice so far and both times have been exceptional. He remembered us like we were everyday regulars. Always friendly! Always fast! Always delicious!The hummus has got to be the best in town. I know when I start craving Greek food then we have to come here for the hummus. Great flavor and delicious warm pita bread. Everything we have had here was just fantastic. The gyros, the half chicken plate, the skewers, the salad... Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmmmm. Baklava available for your enjoyment, but I have yet to try it. The drool is dripping down my face right now... They have a great selection on the menu. I never know what I want next, but he is there to offer up suggestions and ask what I like. It's helpful when your an indecisive person (me). It's not the fanciest or most modern joint, but does it really matter when the food is outrageously amazing? No it doesn't. Get your butt down there and get your Greek on.I stopped in for lunch the week before last and enjoyed what I had, so came back a few days ago for lunch to try something else from their menu. I'm amazed that Baladie Café has been able to stay open with the through the changes of the economy as well the shopping center it's located in going through many businesses opening and closing. I remember when this shopping center first opened and what was originally located in the spot Baladie Café is in now. Other places have come and gone, but Baladie Café remains and has toughed it out the longest in this spot. I noticed the bagel bins (they were empty both times I visited) and couldn't help but wonder if they were still there (they are apart of the counter to the right of where you order) from the bagel shop that originated in the spot many years ago. Baladie Café is owned by a older couple who are genuinely friendly and were very willing to explain what some of the menu items were to me. Greek Salad ($3.49 added as side) - This was a tasty salad, but it wasn't like any Greek salad I'm used to. The lettuce mix was crisp and fresh however it was dressed a bit heavier than I prefer in what tasted like Italian dressing. There was just a single cucumber sliver and a single tomato and no olives!  The menu said it had cucumbers, tomatoes and Kalamata olives, so I was bummed by what I received. I don't actually like anything but the Greek Salad at "The Great Geek" over on Warm Springs Rd in Henderson, so anyone who's had that and then has this salad will notice and see the difference. Lamb and Beef Gyro ($5.50) - Don't expect your typical overstuffed gyro here, they look more like long burritos to me. I actually am not a fan of gyros that are so stuffed that they are ridiculous to eat, so I found the longer, skinnier ones here to be portioned better and easy to handle. The gyro was wrapped with foil at both ends and it was convenient to just pull off one piece of foil and the other piece held the bottom together making it easy to hold the gyro in my hand and eat it burrito style. The gyro had tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce. The gyro meat had really nice flavor. I didn't taste any cucumbers in the tzatziki sauce and it honestly just tasted like yogurt, but the way the whole gyro tasted together was really good. I had this on both of my visits and will definitely order it again. Lentil Soup ($3.99 for a cup) - I could see what appeared to be black pepper in the soup, but it lacked some flavor for me. To be fair, I haven't had this soup before trying it here, so I can't base it on anything other than to say I didn't personally care for the taste. Pistachio Baklava ($1.75 a piece) - This is the BEST I have ever had! I usually experience from other places in town that their baklava is too sticky, hard or just plain tough to eat. The baklava here is made from scratch with love by the owner herself and she should be proud! This baklava was sweet without being overly sweet and sticky and it was so wasn't hard at all. It tasted great and the perfect end to my meal! A box of 6 pieces is $10.Walnut Baklava ($1.75 a piece) - When I first opened the package and noticed the honey at the bottom, I thought maybe this one was going to be sticky and tough. It wasn't! It was sweeter than the pistachio I had previously, but it was very good. They have a breakfast menu and serve mint tea, Turkish and Greek coffee. You can eat inside or phone your order in. Baladie Café is open Monday through Friday from 8 am - 8 pm and is closed in Sunday.Two things. 1) Baladie Cafe has the best fries ever and; 2) the husband and wife duo that manage this local gem are some of the most friendly people you'll ever meet.I have loved Baladie's ever since I first ate there. A friend recommended this quaint eatery to us as the closest thing we could get to a German Doner Kabob in Las Vegas. After eating at Baladie's, my husband can confirm this to be true! What I love about Baladie's is that the food is incredibly consistent and more importantly, delicious! The owners are from Algeria and just radiate warmth. The wife cooks up the meals and the husband entertainingly takes orders. On almost every visit, I've witnessed the owners chatting it up with customers like old friends. Sometimes they give out hugs too! I get the gyro without any meat ($5.50) and a side of herb fries ($1.60). The gyro wrap is smallish in size but makes up for that in flavor. It's actually the perfect amount of food. I don't usually get excited about the cucumbers or tomatoes in gyros, but I do when I'm at Baladie's. Don't even get me started on those fries. I have to hold myself back from ordering two orders of the herb fries. The cafe is intimate and located in a pretty desolate shopping center on Lone Mountain and Decatur. The drinks are self-serve. Customers scoop up their own utensils and napkins, but the owners will always check up on you and ask if you enjoyed your meal. Worth a Return Visit?I cannot recommend Baladie Cafe enough, people! It's one of the best places to eat at in North Las Vegas.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #75I stopped in for lunch the other day and was really disappointed. The nice older couple who ran Baladie Café for years were no longer there and the girl behind the counter told me that there are new owners now and they were given the recipes previously used and were trying to make everything the same. My food tasted nothing like I experienced before at Baladie Café. The girl working I have to say was very polite and nice. I have no complaints with her service at all. Inside however was really dirty and had a funky smell. After I placed my order and sat down to wait for it, a guy walked in and after looking at the menu and asking questions about why the prices had gone up and mentioning that the dining area could use some cleaning he decided to walk out and not place an order. I began to feel nervous about my order, but just hoped for the best. Veggie Gyro ($6.99) - The pita didn't taste fresh and was sort of dry. Inside the veggies were pathetic! Before the gyros were long and skinny, but they still had a decent amount of fillings and this one was a joke! I have never seen such a flat gyro. I know I got a veggie and not meat gyro, but before they still stuffed it with plenty of fresh veggies. This time the cucumbers were shaved paper thin and I had only one of those thin cukes inside. The tomatoes were mushy and some of it was just thin pieces of tomato skin. I had to pay an extra .99 cents for feta cheese that was only put on half of the gyro and had a taste to it that wasn't right. I don't think a lot of what was used was fresh at all. The tzatziki sauce tasted like really bland yogurt or sour cream and it was a terrible, terrible, terrible pass for tzatziki sauce. After 2 bites I was done.Seasoned Fries ($1.99) - Yuck! They were so oily and the seasoning was just way too much. Gyros Platter ($9.99) - Lamb and beef, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, tzatziki sauce and 2 pitas. Well, that's what you are supposed yo get! We only got 1 pita (dry and not fresh), 2 of those thin cucumber shavings, tomato shavings, lettuce and tzatziki sauce. The tzatziki sauce was the same as on the gyro and tasted bland and like yogurt or sour cream. The veggies were sad looking and the gyro meat was way too salty. The meat was more like over seasoned beef jerky. Baklava ($2.25) - They should really stick to the old $1.75 a piece price tag because what I had this visit was rock hard and not fresh. A whole box now costs $12. I'm sad because I never had better baklava before than the baklava I had when the other owners were here. After seeing the inside so dirty and the poor of excuse of food they are putting out now here, I can't see returning.I came to this place because of the ratings And it doesn't add up, place is hot, service was slow 25 min waiting for my food, expensive for the amount and quality.Sorry but thats my experience
Yoshinoya=Japanese Ad featuring Matsui (baseball player) http://youtube.com/watch?v=hIaBeQcZdCMOK Y'all, so I'm not sure why the ratings for this place are so low. This is certainly not 100% equivalent to the ones in Japan, but I keep myself from reviewing sushi places in SF by comparing them to ones in Japan. So.... A lovely warm beef bowl (regular size) sets you back less then $5 here. That, plus a soda, and you're set for a meal and half, if not more. Side order options (not very OG): Macaroni Salad (odd, not an option in japan) Cheesecake Caramel FlanChocolate CakeFrom an excerpt from the Japan Times: "It was delicious," said Tadashi Ishigami, 23, one of the first to mark the return of the dish, downing a bowl at an outlet in Tokyo's Yurakucho district. "I don't care (about the safety of the beef) as long as I can eat it."You see, there was a momentary ban on US Beef (insert joke here) to Japan back in 2006, and GyuDon returned to its glory days in Fall of 2006. But I digress. Sure, they should add curry rice. Sure, they should be open 24 hours and have these orange 'noren'/curtains that welcome you thru the doors. But they don't, and that's okay. Gyu-don of my childhood, available in Rasu Begasu. But not in SF. (-_-) Oh, and yes, the dorktastic part of me spent about 10-15 minutes looking at the black and white photos of yoshinoya shops in the early 1900s. Whenever I drive past one of these.. the old commercial runs thru my head.. Nice to Know Ya, Yoshinoya!I think there's one in San Jose... road trip?Remember: Umai. Hayai. Yasui.(Yummy, Fast, Cheap) http://www.yoshinoya.com/In Japan: Kimchee Beef Bowls are also available. http://www.yoshinoya.com/shop/menu/index.htmlcheck it out.. there's a calorie content sectionShould you be so inclined: available in: The Philippines, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, NYC and thruout SoCal.I finally did it, for Tony T.  I walked to Yoshinoya and got a beef bowl (gyudon) to go.  For whatever reason, the faded building/sign always turned me off, so I expected it to be old and dirty inside.  I already can get cheap gyudon from Japan Creek or just make it at home, so I never saw a reason to come here, though I worked within walking distance for almost 6 years.I spotted Yoshinoya in Japan but never sought it out to eat at one.  The other day, I watched a show called "Fast Foods Gone Global" on Travel Channel, which usually chronicles US chains that infiltrate other countries and make special menus for each country's tastes.  However, this episode was international fast food companies' infiltration into the US, and whether or not menu items were changed for the American palate.Yoshinoya has clearly adjusted its menu to the American palate, but the gyudon is still what gyudon is always - fatty thinly sliced beef cooked with onions in a sauce made with typical Japanese ingredients and served on top of rice, with beni shoga (red pickled ginger) as an accompaniment. I ordered a regular beef bowl (just under $6 with tax, and added beni shoga.  I also sprinkled on some shichimi togarashi and though not traditional, some chopped green onion that was out for miso soup orderers (only because green onions are my favorite vegetable!)The menu otherwise has some odd things (I am not a fan of teriyaki type joints so I do not like the weird vegetables like zucchini in my bowls or stir fries), like vegetables, udon bowls, chicken and combo bowls, and grilled fish - I asked what type of fish and the lady pronounced something weird twice to me that started with an S, a name of a fish I certainly have never heard of in my life and have no idea how to spell...I did notice Yoshinoya now has ponzu sauce (not for the beef bowl but rather the fish).  I liked the to go bowl packaging and the meal stayed hot on my jaunt back to the office to eat.  I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the interior too.  Accepts credit cards for orders over $5.The beef & veggie plate is nostalgic for me...When I was going to OCC I lived off of this stuff. I would buy a large beef bowl & make three meals out of it because I was broke. Every time I have Yoshinoya it takes me back to that time & I think of how far I've come so it's not just about the food but it's also about the memories. This stuff has such a distinct taste & it hasn't changed in years which I love. It's cheap, filling & delicious. The beef is extra thin & I love the flavor! The veggies are a must for me because they are always perfectly cooked & I pour some soy sauce over everything & it doesn't get any better :)There's one location in town which sucks & I'm waiting for the day it comes to the west side :)Worth driving across town for this stuff? My answer is absolutely!
Simply Burgers=Yowga-ga-boing!Excellent variety of signature burger combinations.  In particular, the one I tried (Desert Heat) was a taste sensation.  You don't find too many places offering both Angus and Kobe.The buns were higher quality than your average burger stand fare.  The produce was nice and fresh.  Crisp lettuce, and the tomato was deep red, not that wilted yellow disc you sometimes get with the other guys.Their beer battered onion-rings were perfectly crunchy and great tasting.  The fries tasted great, although they could have been a little more crisp.Great selection of sodas (including Jones brand), energy drinks, and a unique variety of beers & wine coolers/malt beverages.Trendy and clean upbeat environment.  Friendly staff.  The hostess was a cutie.  The grill guys paid attention to our order (I actually received a medium-rare patty).  The manager even came out and greeted us.Maybe I was there on a good night, but you can bet I'll be back soon to try that seared Ahi burger.In-n-out is good, but not even close to this good.~Swoop
Quiessence Restaurant=Don't give thanks here.It's been a while since I've posted, but for anyone who can't remember,  see my motto above. And I get even more pissed when it's expensive bad food! So imagine my mood when we left Quiessence yesterday having dropped $171 for 2, (including tax & tip), on a meal that  was certainly worse than what I could make at home.I had the Date & Beet Salad, the Turkey entree, and the Apple Crisp for dessert. Served family style were, greens, Sausage & Onion stuffing, Roasted Carrots & Parsnips, Mashed Potatoes, and a bread basket.I'll start from the beginning with the salad which was OK. Not what you'd expect for the price, but acceptable. The turkey was brined in an over salted liquid with something odd added. It was moist, but I still left slices on my plate the flavor was so odd.The stuffing had very little flavor at all & was dry. The sausage added nothing but meat so  that the vegetarians couldn't eat it. The mashed potatoes were also over salted. The carrots & parsnips were severely undercooked. Hard as rocks. Or maybe they were overcooked & dehydrated, since a few of them were mush. The greens were good. All of the side dishes were left over. There were 3 kinds of bread in the basket; a dry foccacia, corn bread, & a soaked, with oil or butter, corn bread. They all seemed like they were from the previous day, & someone had tried to save them.We all had the Apple Crisp with Cranberry Ice Cream for dessert. It was also OK.  The Crisp was good, but needed lemon juice to cut the sweetness. The ice cream was an Iron Chef moment.  Not a good one. I removed as much as I could & poured a little cream, supplied for the coffee, on my crisp. Oh, for some vanilla Hagen-Dazs!We were tired of counting pennies, and thought we'd splurge. We'd all been to Quiessence before, when there was a different chef. It's a lovely location, but not enough to make up for the food. On the day that I usually give thanks for the bounty of life,  I started planning Thanksgiving dinner for next year.My wife and I spent nearly $300 and were extremely disappointed with the food and the experience. I can't think of a time in a supposedly high-end restaurant when I just wasn't able to finish each course primarily due to the blandness and unoriginality  of the food. 1. The opener was a ceviche that featured a tough, metallic flavored scallop that made both of us wonder if we were going to end up in the ER (we are HUGE ceviche fans :(  2. The sausage entrée was so forgettable that I actually forgot to eat most of the links.3.  The small meatballs with gnocchi from a taste perspective rivaled some of the frozen selections from Trader Joes. Average and forgettable.4. Both desserts were chocolate and were good, but nothing special.5. We noticed that the hostess kept seating customers including ourselves in the back room near the bathroom (which smelled terribly and looked as though it was in need of a cleaning). The maître d' left most of the tables in the best part of the restaurant empty for the majority of the night. No comprendo.6. Our server was friendly, but seemed disinterested and on two occasions plates were slapped down on our tables with no verbal description (where is the passion and interest! This is part of the tasting menu experience!) 7. Timing of the food and wine flight was off. With the exception of the Justin port, the wine selection was average and not a good value.My wife couldn't stop talking about how poor the food was the entire ride home. Not a great way to celebrate our Valentines' Day.Bottom line - this is our second time at Quiesscence and definitely the last time. What an utter disappointment.As you can tell from my profile, I'm not one to write a bad review - if you don't have something nice to say...But I can't stop myself from sharing my experience at Quiessence - especially when considering the price.On our anniversary, I thought it would be great to take her to a high-end spot like Quiessence.  I looked at the reviews (first time social media has let me down), it looked legit, and I set it up without telling her.  I made a reservation, let them know it was our anniversary asking for a nice table and offering to pay a little more if there was something special they could do.  For our near $300, here's what "special" means:- A table by the door. I seriously can't believe they cram a table there, everyone who walked in was basically on our lap.- After taking our drink order, it took 20 minutes before our waiter returned, and with just one of the drinks.- We ordered, received our appetizers in ok time, and then waited another 40 minutes until our meals began coming out (we ordered special courses - big mistake)- Each dish came out somewhere between warm to cold, for sure sitting around-  Even if warm, the quality was not anywhere near the caliber of what a similarly priced meal at any other high-end establishment around town would be.- Tip was included in the bill at over 18%Seriously, unreal, when expressing our disappointment, we received a "sorry."  Even if it was an off night, there's just too much here to ignore. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!This review could easily have been a 5 Star review...easily...except for SALT.  Just about every dish was extremely over salted.  In fact, the waitress said that she gets that same complaint a lot.  I put this at the top of my review for two reasons...1. I hope the chef reads this and starts to understand that he needs to reduce the salt, and 2. so YOU will make sure to tell the waitress you don't want your food over salted.Otherwise...WOW what a great restaurant.  The location is on a farm that grows all the vegetables and most of the items you eat in the restaurant.  The atmosphere is cozy, romantic, wonderful.  The service is excellent, and the servers know their stuff!Your best bet is get the chefs menu with a wine pairing and see what shows up at the table.  There is no better way to eat dinner here.  The presentation was 5*, the variety and freshness of the food was awesome.I really loved the experience, and will be back.Huge waste of our time. I made a reservation and requested a romantic table for two. When we got there the hostess sat us next to a table of 4 ...who were extremely loud. I get that...they were all having fun. We asked to move to a table outside, but was told that they were all reserved.  This wasn't a very big place, but the outside area was very pretty and was lit by candlelight. We sat for maybe 5 min and the hostess came back and gave us a wine list and then....nothing. We waited and waited, hostess came back again and asked if we had questions about the wine list. I said I did, and she said she would try to answer but didn't know much about wine. Hmmmm, ok. Still no server. At that point, we then decided to leave.  Very disappointed for a couple of reasons...1. I would not think it would be so difficult to be acknowledged by a server, after all, they are there to take care of our dining accomadations.2. We were on vacation and this place was very out of the way.  We waisted part of our evening and when vacationing that is the last thing I want to do.3.  Hostess never said..."Is there a problem?"  She saw us leave, we walked right past her.
Raising Cane's=I can't believe I'm giving a fast food, chicken strip joint five stars!I feel...I feel...good about it. I mean, come on, for just a few cents over six bucks you get This box http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=orF-6gO8zteljlzAFq-OqgFilled with some of the best fried chicken strips (5 strips) I've ever had http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=4wdej6Xl7xL5BL8w3dsEbAPlus fries and Texas toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=K8h0AZmAa9S5SC93VmpVjQAnd Cole slaw and an amazing dipping sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=5OyWMqG6JdeX0AgfE8yNOwAnd this gigantic sweet tea http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=Vhnh9U2Q_Xh9N8aanZf6ZgIn all honesty, Raising Cane's does serve up some of the best tasting chicken strips I've ever had. And definitely the best I've ever had from a fast food joint. Every strip is fresh and prepared after they're ordered. They're super crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle but the best thing is there is zero grease on these strips. The fries were also nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle. The toast, slaw and sauce were all amazing too. Oh, and their sweet tea is perfect. Not overly sweet. Perfect. Prices are dirt cheap and service is fast and friendly. Majors thanks to Dru "DirtySmoke http://www.dirtysmokebbq.com/" C. for putting this place on my radar. You're right, Dru, it was amazing. Check out Raising Cane's for yourself next time you're in Vegas. Trust me, it's worth leaving the strip for.I LOVE CHICKEN FINGERS! I could probably eat them every day of the week! But sadly, that dream is not going to be reality anytime soon!Reading some of my other Vegas Yelp friend's reviews, I bookmarked this place in hopes I could talk Minh into going before we hit up the outlets, which by the way is in the same area as this place!Don't look for anything fancy here; it's just a good ol' drive thru fast food joint. Except when you walk in ::drum roll:: its clean smelling and clean looking! All the employees are actually happy to be working and even greet you! Since we were having a late lunch, we decided to share a meal and went with ordering:The Box Combo:Four Chicken Fingers Fries Coleslaw Cane's Sauce Texas Toast Regular DrinkThere is plenty of seating inside, we found a booth but wasn't 100% clean. Maybe we sat down too quick. An employee was walking by so I asked him if he would not mind cleaning out table. Instead of the rude yeah okay. He was nice about it and even said sorry that the tabletop was not totally clean. Our number was called and Minh went to go get our food. When he got back to the table, the box was huge. The smell was inviting and the taste was the best! The chicken tenders were lightly seasoned and juicy! I had a bite of the coleslaw and that was pretty darn good too! Texas toast was out of this world yummi (I paid dearly for it over the next couple of days since I cannot really eat bread anymore) but it was worth it! Light and buttery this toast was thick!The Cain sauce had an interesting taste; it was a unique and went well with the fries (which were not oily) and the chicken strips!Raising Cane's was built from a dream one guy had. When others turned him down for loan he didn't give up instead he hustled and built his dream on his own. Todd Graves story is amazing along with his dog who the business is named after! I'm hoping that they will bring this urber rad fast food joint to sunny California soon, otherwise this will be on my list of must have again before we go shopping!!!"Hey!"Don't listen to a word I say"Hey!"The screams all sound the same"Hey!""Though the truth may vary"this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore"--------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------It is a chain and the same food is offered here as everywhere else the company operates. We're not here to discuss the food ...Although, I must mention that the coleslaw is close to inedible. You may think the truth may vary on this account; however, you will be finding that you are sorely mistaken. Coleslaw's nasty.What are we here to talk about then if not the food? --------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------ServiceThe service at this Raising Cane's is exceptional for a fast food chain. They are usually so friendly, they might even inch out In-N-Out for friendliest service in this category. They have employees cleaning other patrons' messes (more on that later), bringing patrons their food, retrieving patrons' finished trays, et al. They are truly best in show (ahem, pun intended) when it comes to service to customer. Which leads to ...CustomersI have never met a bigger group of obnoxiously loud, rude, messy people. Not in an elementary school cafeteria will one run into such mayhem. They leave enormous messes on tables, under tables, on seats, under seats, et al. They are the loudest day and night, weekday and weekend. The first time I patronised this location, I imagined it was because teens from a nearby school come here to act like idiots. "Damn, these kids really need to get the fuck out of here" is what I thought. It was not the kids. It is epidemic. It does not matter what time of day I visit. This location consistently has a cockfighting ring aspect to the ambiance in terms of noise and messiness. The employees are running around trying to clean all the preposterous messes left behind; however, it is a losing battle. This location is a lost cause. --------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------I don't expect enough peace and quiet to be able to meditate at any fast food establishment. But, I also don't patronise a restaurant -- fast-food or otherwise -- to acquire a rare headache or feel the urge to stuff tissue in my ears so that the decibel levels can be mitigated. --------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------Pro Tip: Is it necessary to scream at the top of your lungs when your food buddy is sitting right next to you? Shut the fuck up ....--------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------Rating: Three-stars, "A-OK." (Start throwing some of these yokels out.)--------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------Postscript. First hand experiences ... first hand experiences ... I have to slip in more first hand experience accounts for the flaggers. I have walked through the front door of this Raising Cane's during business hours. I have ordered from the counter. I have sat down and eaten my food. (Check the check-ins, fool.)
Mac's Broiler & Tap=With a little trepidation... I will leak my new favorite breakfast spot.  Mac's is a nice little neighborhood bar, nice selection of brews on tap, good food of a great variety and excellent staff.  Its location is what helps make it a standout, it is in one of the best strips in all of Phoenix.Book-ended by Tempe's best bookstore and Tempe's most in-touch record store, this is the perfect place to start or finish a weekend morning.  The thing about the breakfast here is that it has two of my favorite qualities:  good and cheap.  Not cheap ingredients, nope.  Apple cider bacon, pecan pancakes, heavy and delicious huevos.  All of their offerings center around 6 bucks.  In Tempe, which is notoriously over priced in the early morning offerings, that is very cheap breakfast.The light enters the room just right in the morning, casting amber hues around the room as you sip coffee, listen to pretty bad music and enjoy your hearty breakfast.  Take a stroll to Trader Joes, buy a few albums at Hoodlums and work up an appetite for Tott's (which is right across the street).About 2 weeks ago I moved into to an apartment complex that is 1/4 mile away from the intersection of Guadalupe and McClintock. At this intersection there is upwards of 10 different dinner choices, the majority of them chain restaurants or fast food. Being of the "shop local Tempe" mindset, I ventured to Macs Broiler & Tap, a mom and pop joint sandwiched between 2 of my favorite places in Tempe: Hoodlums Music and Changing Hands Bookstore. I figured since it was in such good company, I would give it a go. I walked in the door and walked to the (empty) hostess stand where a sign read "Please wait to be seated." Being a good drone, I did just that, I stood there looking for the hostess for a good 3 minutes, waiting to be seated. Finally a girl busing tables looks over at me, apparently confused over why I'm just standing there, and says "You know you can just sit where ever you want." So I go and grab a table, situate myself. And I wait. And I wait some more. About 10 minutes later a waitress comes over to me and tells me that she will be right with me. Five minutes later, she comes back and asks if I would like a menu. At this point, I've now been in the place for about 20 minutes. I wanted to say "Yes, that would be just dandy. I would like a menu so i can order some food, which is the reason why I've been waiting 20 minutes." I bite my tongue and just say "Yes, thank you."The waitress grabs a menu for me, doesn't stick around for me to ask for a drink, and walks away. She returns with a water 5 minutes later, putting it on the table as she walks by, not stopping to ask if I had any questions or want something other than water to drink. By now I've looked at the menu, figured out what I wanted, and wanted to order. I try flagging her down, finally catching her attention, only to get a curt "I'll be there in a moment." She meander's her way over, takes my order, and goes to walk away. I stop her and ask if I can get an iced tea with my meal and the look she gave me had to be akin the one she'd give someone who just demanded her 1st born child, a combination of confusion and incredulity and disbelief. A bit later, she walks by again, nearly drops my iced tea onto the table (she never stopped walking), and continues on her way without a word. Armed with my glass of water and my reluctantly given iced tea, I began the long wait for my order, the Chicken melt sandwich. Continuing what appears to be the M.O. of Mac's, I waited for my sandwich. And I waited. And I waited. Then, get this:  I waited some more. I waited for over 35 minutes for my food, and not once did my waitress come around to see if i needed more water (i did) or more iced tea (I didn't, but could have used a top off on the glass as it's free refills). Just when I was about to flag the waitress down to ask why they didn't pluck, slaughter, and carve up the chicken into the appropriate parts BEFORE I placed my order, a she walks out of the kitchen with a plate in hand and brings a plate to my table, puts it down and walks away barely saying a word. In front of me is my chicken sandwich. There was bread, chicken, bacon, cheese, and tomato's. Beautifully, they got my order correct. The cheese was melted, but kind of cold (as if it had been sitting there waiting for someone to bring it to my table), the bacon was very good. The chicken was a bit dry, but by this time, I was starving. All in all I was there for an hour before I got any food, and when I did finally get it, I was not about to voice a complaint and wait even longer. I understand that Mac's is not a fast food joint, nor was I expecting it to be. However, being "Joe, party of One" in a 1/4 full restaurant, I feel that I can expect to receive my food in WELL  under an hour. Hell, just by being by myself I should be in, fed, paid, and out in under an hour. The waitress never checked to see if the food was OK, never offered me refills on my water or tea, and basically pretended I didn't exist. For a local restaurant situated between two of Tempe's best Local businesses, I expected a lot more. Needless to say, I am sorely disappointed with my experience at Mac's, what with high expectations due to positive reviews on here and from people I know. I never got my waitresses name and was basically treated as a nuisance and not as a paying customer, from the minute I walked in and stood at the empty hostess booth looking like an idiot to the minute I walked out the front door.  Bottom line? I could have gone to Trader Joe's to buy the ingredients, gone home, cooked, ate, and cleaned up in the time I wasted over at Mac's. Will I be returning anytime soon? Probably not.There are a ton of things I like about Mac's:1. The BoozeMac's has a solid variety of beer (drafts, craft and imports), wines by the glass and bottle and specialty drinks. Right now they have a cute menu of Holiday Cocktails including Chocolate Mint Martini, Warm and Fuzzy, Raspberry Hot Chocolate, Irish Coffee, Nutty Irishman Coffee, Keoke Coffee and Hazelnut Martini. 2. The FoodMac's has a wide variety including breakfast, appetizers, lunch, dinner, and desserts.Pretty standard bar food and everything I've ever had was really good. For breakfast there is a pretty standard menu of eggs and such. They also feature a great selection of breakfast cocktails which are all super yum!Appetizers:ChimisChipsWingsSkinsShrimpsFried ZucchiniFor lunch/dinner there is a good variety:SaladsHot/Cold SandwichesBurgersPasta From the Grill:Steak RibsSeafoodFor dessert:Fudge CakeKey Lime PieBrownie Sundae3. The MusicMac's always have the Sirius on Classic Rewind which is pretty great to chill listening to classics. 4. The Hours9:30am - 10:30pm Daily5. The LocationMac's is at the SW corner of McClintock and Guadalupe. It's right by my house, so it's perfect! :)What I don't like about Mac's:1. The ServiceI've never ordered anything that didn't take forever to get, including the check. So, don't ever come in if you're in a hurry. Overall, I 4/5 highly recommend Mac's as a great place to chill and get a drink and some snacks.
The Roosevelt=Matt (of Matt's Big Breakfast) has opened this swanky-but-comfy bar/restaurant/tavern/ downtown. The building is a beautifully resurrected vintage house -- perfect!Cool place to hang out and relax. Grab a seat (if you can) in your room of choice. There's a giant communal table in the back and an amazingly wallpapered (you'll see) chamber up front. Terrific craft brews and a nice wine list. Haven't tried the food yet, but the menu features a comforting, upscale twist on the normal bar fare. Great reason to hit the downtown stretch on nights other than First Friday.Matt's (of Matt's Big Breakfast) new bar.  Located in a cozy vintage home, this is my new favorite bar.  Handpicked beer and wine selection make this an excellent destination for downtown snobs (not rippin, I tend to be one of those)  Best of all, Matt has jumped on the smoking ban before it even takes effect, this means you can enjoy your beer without having to breathe in all that nasty ass poison you smokers keep pumping into the air.  Seriously, Lesley and I went to a dinner party recently filled with smokers, in a non ventilated home.  Jesus, God, how do you people stand it?!?  Smoking is gross, The Roosevelt is cool.Why are places in Phoenix in buildings that look like abandoned houses?  I swear every time I go there I drive around in circles before I find what I'm looking for.  And they don't have signs.  Whats up with that? Anywho, we made our way over here for the Yelp event and I have to say that I enjoyed it.   Once inside I actually felt like I was back in Boston; slanting floors, doors that aren't quite even, nooks, crannies, crown molding.   Its dark for sure, I could barely read the specials on the board but whatever the $5 wine was, it was good.  Its an interesting hybrid of a lounge and bar which works when you have a diverse group of people.   Despite the fact that it was 100 degrees outside I ordered the tomato soup and grilled cheese.   It was fantastic. Do we get cold rainy days out here?  If we do,remind me to come back here for it.  The soup was a creamy tomato but very yummy.   My husband ordered the Dagwood sandwich, I'm not sure what was in it but it had a lot of meat.  He actually took half of it home! (But they really didn't give him a proper container for it, it was like a hot dog to go container so the sandwich barely fit and leaked in our backseat. Boooo.)   To say its out of the way for me is an understatement but if I was planning a night in Phoenix or heading to a game I would stop in for sure.It pains me to do this, but after recent experiences I feel it's necessary to comment on the Roosevelt.  I would have previously considered myself a loyal patron of the Roosevelt, but after tonight I am done for good.  Let me preface this story by saying that I arrived last night (a Thursday) JUST before a brutal storm hit.  A bunch of us were literally trapped in the Roosevelt as the storm went on outside.  The air conditioning cut off , but eventually the storm subsided and the power came back on.  At that point, I was somewhat happy that I was no longer trapped in a small, sweaty house, so I grabbed a refill and started talking to my friends.  As I was talking, I felt a tap on my shoulder, and I turned around to hear the owner telling me to "be quiet, we can't hear the music," referring to the exceedingly mediocre folk rock act that had started performing in the front area.  Now, I love live music, and I have no problem with giving the performers an appropriate place to play, but after sitting through a storm for an hour and sticking around for some drinks, I would expect to actually be allowed to speak.  Unfortunately, Matt clearly doesn't know a thing about good business or about treating his customers well.  I've been coming into his bar for a year and a half and the guy has never once had the courtesy to say hello to me.  All I've ever gotten from him is a "be quiet."   A guy who doesn't recognize his good customers doesn't deserve to have them at all, and unfortunately for Matt, he won't have this one anymore...I don't know why I even bother trying to go here. Every single time I walk in this place I end up walking right back out. I tried to go there with Mark J TWICE in December and both times we ended up walking out within 120 seconds. Lame!The Roosevelt is either too crowded, or there isn't any seating, or it's filled with hipster douche bags or the service eats a dick.My recent problems with this place include:- Inadequate seating- Huge waste of space/not laid out well- Staff consists of asshats mixed with a few very cool staffers. Most of the chicks who work here are cool, but I encountered several dick tard dudes.- Why is there a security gaurd/rent a cop here at all times? He is nice but it is too creepy for comfort. What is this? The Arizona Mills Mall?- The suckdom ruined my birthday- Mean people giving mean looks hamg out here a lotOn the flipside the beer selection is good and I ate here once a looooooooooooooong time ago and I think I thought it was good. I can't remember because it was so long ago. I'd love to eat here again but I can't seem to tolerate this place for more than a few minues before I stomp on off and out the front door.Do better Roosevelt.As confused as the seating is in this place, the decor, ambiance and product are spot on. Cozy furniture when you get a spot. Extremely delicious bar food. Choice selection of beers and wines. The Roosevelt is a charming place. Spending a hour here can renew your faith in Phx.LOVEI am certainly adding this place to my growing list of favorite downtown bars. The vibe was so spot on, I could probably come here 3 nights a week and not be mad about it. I love the seating, even though it makes absolutely no sense. Comfy couches and chairs big enough for Brad E. and I to share and fit both of our badonkadonks in.. trust me on that.. junk. in. the. trunk.  I ran into Joel L. here also, which is always a pleasure. Apparently the tomato soup and grilled cheese is absolutely phenomenal, and I am craving it more than anything in the entire world right now. The bartender boosted my ego about 63 notches by telling me what a lovely redhead I was, so thank you sir. You are the most wonderful person of the weekend. Their beer list is also killer and the outdoor seating area is big enough for a frat party.I honestly cant wait to come back here. If anyone, I mean, ANYONE is in the mood for The Roosevelt, call a bitch, I am so there.I know some people reaaalllllyyyyyy love The Roosevelt.  I *like* it.The atmosphere is great.  I love the wood throughout, especially in the front of the house.One big table????  This is a pretty popular spot.  There was a fairly large party at the big table and I was meeting at least 4 other people.  There was some space at the end, so we took a seat, and I was inwardly hoping they left soon.  There is definitely room for a small corner table or two in this back room.  Why aren't there any???The food was under the headline "Snacks" and I was a bit scared of that because I was starving and the prices weren't snack prices.  I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup.  Both were excellent.  They use gruyere and fontina cheeses.  The tomato soup tasted fresh and had small basil leaves in it.  It was filling enough for being a "snack".I'm not sure if anyone ordered it, but a bowl of potato chips and two different dips came out after we had eaten.  One of the dips was bleu cheese and DIVINE!The bathroom?  Blech.  It was very cold...not as in temperature, but it did not go with the rest of the place.  It felt institutional.  Plain, white walls with 8 nails in a row on one wall.  Kind of random, since the nails weren't far enough apart to hang anything on them.Service was ok, a bit confusing.  We had two different women serving us and one claimed "This is only my third shift".  Don't tell us that.  Make us think you know what you're doing.The Roosevelt is s-e-x-y, sexy. I can not believe it's taken me this long to write a review of a spot I tend to frequent but after spending, geeez, I dunno, maybe 4 hours here on Saturday night I was just smitten enough to sing full praises. Historic home turned bar, The Roosevelt is dark, romantic and the perfect place to spend hours drinking wine, (by the glass or bottle) or beer (from their fairly extensive beer menu) while getting to know that special someone... or, stop in for a nightcap after dinner or a night out downtown.The Roosevelt offers small plates that are all quite tasty, my favorite being the Bacon wrapped Dates. I love turning people on the wonderful world of dates, and bacon and cheese is the best way to do that. The setup, as mentioned in previous reviews, is awkward. But hey, this was a home that has been converted to a bar and you are sitting in one of the three bedrooms. I'm not really sure how else it could be done without knocking out walls and ruining some of the sexiness....don't do that...I'm a smitten kitten Roosevelt, dare I say, full of smit!I just want to let everyone know that this is not a restaurant. It's more like a bar with snacks. I found this place on yelp because people were raving about their grilled cheese sandwich and creamy tomato soup. They had drink specials this evening and a snack special. A grilled cheese with bacon $4. Since I don't eat shredded swine flesh, I was forced to buy the grilled cheese without the bacon paired with tomato soup ($8) because their policy states that no modification allowed. Not really impressed with the soup and the sandwich was just okay. They use Fontina and Gruyere cheeses on Pullman bread which was edible, but not the best. I guess I've had better though, but I was hungry so I ate it. I gave the soup to my friend 'cause it was too salty. As far as the bar, I didn't really dig it because it was too dark and too loud. They also played this jarring music which made it hard to have a conversation and enjoy the food. I would have given them a higher rating if it weren't for that silly policy and the dark room. It was very hard to eat in the dark.So my friend and I finished our drinks and went over to Bliss where we had a better time.Had 1 drink here once last fall with my business partner after a meeting downtown.  It looked cool from the outside and she had been there before and liked it.  I did not.  The concept is cool -- I love old houses and re-purposed edifices and was stoked to try it.  We walked in and it was kinda dead.  There was 1 group of 4 people in the front room chatting and I felt like we walked into their living room and interrupted a private conversation when we entered.  The bartender saw us walk in and walked out thru the back.  We saddled up to the bar. When she returned she didnt greet us or even acknowledge us and then proceded to throw atttitude when I asked what beers they had.  She couldn't recommend anything.  She poured a crappy beer for me (just dumped it into the glass -- my 3yo niece could give a better pour), and a weak drink for my partner and walked away again. The service blew. The whole experience blew.  Not again, my friend.I must be dreaming, 'cause this place is just too cool. Tucked in side an easy to miss house with a barely noticeable sign even during the day, find yourself sipping down a bottle of your favorite libation or have them pour you a locally brewed craft right out of their ice cold taps. Like many of the stops along Roosevelt in Downtown, The Roosevelt elevates the cool of the area by a factor of ten.After having one too many and falling into a happy stupor, I slipped back tipping myself off the edge of the seat. I must have gotten quite the knock on the head. Waking up dazed, confused, and aimlessly wandering about Roosevelt Row in downtown. That must have just been a weird dream I am awaking from. "How on earth did I arrive here?" and "why am I so hungry?" I wondered. Good thing the Roosevelt is just down the way, I decided to stop in for some of their tasty appetizers to squash this ravenous hunger.  Maybe I'll have their grilled cheese or tasty deviled eggs. mmmm.Time seemed to slip by faster than reality did. Getting up to leave, night turned into day in almost the blink of an eye, and it was a scorcher of a day. The temperature displayed on the electronic board down the street read 109, but my internal thermometer told me that surely it had to be at least 153."Here's my chance", I thought. "This unsuspecting Phoenician strolling my way is my ticket out of this hell." "Excuse me, do you have the time?" I asked interrupting him mid whistle. "I guess" was their response, and as they looked for their pocket watch, I pushed them over quickly grabbing their sun shading umbrella. That guy must have had a little vampire in him, because no sooner than the umbrella began shading me from the streaming rays of sun, did he burst into dust and was whisked away by the scorching winds. All that was left was a pile of dusty clothing and a pair of half scuffed shoes.Suddenly, the ground gave way underneath my feet, opening an endless chasm of despair. I fell into the dark abyss, only to find myself suddenly waking from this crazy dream and on the floor next to my bed. Maybe next weekend I'll go easy on the brew, or maybe I'll wake in a few minutes to the calming sound of ocean waves lapping against a sandy island beach somewhere. Only time will tell. ...Beerception
Regal Beagle=drunk at kona someone in our group shouts, "LET'S GO SING KARAOKE!!!!!!!!!" it was the best idea of the night, obviously. we called a bunch of karaoke bars and all had the lame response of only on sundays or thursdays. don't they know wednesday nights are where it's at?!?! we finally found this place. and they had karaoke. on wednesdays. they might have it every night. in fact, they should have it every night because that's the only reason to go to this bar. it is really skanky but a freaking blast. the patrons are unattractive but fun to sing with. and that's all that matters when you're trying to rock out to dixie chicks. good times.also, i don't think i'd ever eat here. i dont get the food vibe from this place. i've never had their food but just from hanging out in there i know i wouldn't touch their food. but that's just me i guess.
Bougainvillea Café=I come across this hotel many times when I drived by here and I see the food specials on the huge sign.This is my final meal in Las Vegas before heading back to the airport. So I decided to return to the Terrible Casino for their $9.99 specials .i.e. Full rack of Baby Back Pork Ribs.  The special is at this 24-hour diner called the Bougainvillea Cafe; located in the Mezzanie level (one floor above the casino-level). There are a ton of other specials too. But my target was definitely for the Baby Back Ribs specials. For $9.99, I get a full rack of ribs drenched in BBQ sauce, a corn on a cob, a side of mashed potatoes and a toasted sourdough bread. It's not Cattlemen's, Claim Jumper or any of the finer steakhouses version, but it's decent for the price. The rack's end has some dried and burnt pieces and the middle has some moist and juicy meat. The Mashed Potatoes were ok, but the corn on the cob has no comment from me (I didn't eat it).Baby Back ribs: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zWo2a6QPIuC-sSJURJ02Hw?select=YfTx7RS2XOIajziImauY_QMashed Potatoes: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zWo2a6QPIuC-sSJURJ02Hw?select=Ncrz_y20hwY2l4zmi6enUwMy meal was ok for the price. But if you want cheap eats, come here. I may give this diner a second chance and try something else.
Village Seafood Buffet=NEVER FAILS...Every time I come to Vegas I always eat the Rio Seafood Buffet and I have NOT ONCE been disappointed.  Thank you for staying true to the food lovers =)The hot steaming Alaskan King Crab legs are thick and juicy and the Lobster tails are my fav.  They have a huge selection of Sushi and Sashimi =)I've gotten so good at crackin the crabs the people sitting next to me just stared at me in amazement and said, "Wow you're a pro at this!" which I replied, "I should be I've been coming here for over 5 yrs!"  Seriously I think I'd whoop anyone's ass in a crab leg eating contest.... I got it down.... crack the middle part, slide the meat out nice and long ('that's what she said' haha) and dip in butter and into my tummy all in one quick smooth motion!  OMG I am such a fatty!  hahaha  I love itHow do you give four women simultaneous (food) orgasms?First take them to Vegas.  Then take them to Rio and stick them in a long-ass line, make them watch the same loud, lame show twice (and considering that show starts every hour, that gives you an idea of exactly how long that long-ass line was), and force them to see the same freaking faces all around them as they get hungrier and hungrier and crankier and crankier.  Basically the equivalent of taking them to see the English Patient on a first date.When you have about 30 minutes to go, shake things up a bit by getting two of them hammered off one drink from the casino bar.  (After all, it doesn't take much to get them going if their stomachs are *that* empty. http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/wHN6nbeG3TPvQlEAq1jQKw/l)Get them *just* to the point where they're saying, "goddammit, this better be damn good!" (http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/xg4EfS0b8ZOaYD0xwiBL1w/l)...then let them loose.No foreplay, NO FILLER!!!!!!Get straight to the point and take these women to the CRAB LEGS.  We're not talking costco style, salty-yet-still-bland, cut up the side for easy access crab legs...we're talking succulent, taste-like-they-just-came-out-of-the-wild-Bering Sea amazing morsels of heaven.  Seriously, food has never given me such pure joy.  Pure, pure, unadulterated crustacean-induced happiness.My dearest Village Buffet, you were so memorable, almost 2 months later, I'm still trying to figure out how to quit you.I had never been so happy to get crabs.So happy that I ate 8 huge pieces of crab legs (the equivalent of 4 whole crabs).Ugh. I feel like a dirty whore.If you ENJOY this buffet you needa grow some tastebuds!!REALLY??

I ate seafood. I conquered 4 plates. Tummy full, mission accomplished. I've heard so much about this seafood buffet. On our last day in Vegas we decided to eat here and leave on a good note. We came early, it opens at 4pm...there was a line! It went by pretty quick...we paid our $40 and I was ready to feast on some seafood. You name it...they had it...lobster tails, cocktail shrimps, pasta and shrimp, dungeness crabs, snow crabs, oysters, clams, scallops all cooked in so many different styles.  Plus they had a pretty amazing dessert bar as well. Some of my favorites were the shrimp pasta, mac and cheese lobster and clam chowder soup. Oh and they also have a full bar in the middle, which drinks will cost extra. Here's all that I fit in my belly:Plate 1: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=JHYDJO2tNMjYB2fEXnuPegPlate 2: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=9JeXTsQi-KShdc60TDzt3QPlate 3: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=AmMOM91RYw_ALKAux1l0AAMy clam chowder (YUM): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=j_U5C3Ct-GO6MnVTHk8MugPlate 4: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=2G1cBejfRFBv6BUpviFChAThe buffet was massive and I didn't even try everything...I'll definitely be back when I need to overdose on cholesterol.On the fence about this place! Being a self-proclaimed seafood buffet, I expected a great variety of seafood. There were some, but not a whole lot. I'd say, it's comparable to the other buffets. Plus being a seafood buffet should mean good quality and tasting seafood. I'd say, not to par.Seafood to skip: raw oysters (not fresh; looked frozen and thawed), raw clams (sand), crab legs (mushy), lobster tails (non-existent), any cooked fish (overcooked and tough)Seafood to get: Cold mussels, cooked mussels, cooked clams, scallops, shrimp creoleThe seafood made up of less than 1/4 of the food available. Therefore, it was very misleading to be called a seafood buffet. But once I got past the whole seafood ordeal, the rest was enjoyable. The sashimi was pretty good for a buffet. And their meats and pasta were tasty as well. Best of all was their dessert area. I felt like a kid in a candy store! My eyes widened at all the trays of neatly placed desserts. And can someone please get me that gelato machine?!$38 for a seafood buffet didn't seem bad. But after the meal, that price felt a bit steep. 3.5 stars for food and price. +0.5 for our awesome server!UPDATE- ITS "LOBSTER" NOT LOBSTER!!!!!!Remember in my review I said I found a long leg? Yeah, it wasn't a deformed one and it bothered me. Yeah I know this was a review months ago but I HAD TO figure it out as little shit bothers me. I'm very sad to know they did the switcharoo on us and giving us the cheaper stuff. Yeah looked at lobster fishing laws and yeah, I was right about them not being able to harvest lobsters of a certain size so it got me delving further......and so did more research and the lobsters they serve here are NOT the usual "true"(american or spiny) lobster that we all are thinking of (they used to but not anymore). Look at the pale color and the fact that the flat shaped heads or legs are no where to be found which gives it away as a faux lobster or another suspicion is that it is flown in already "prepped" and possibly fresh frozen since the tails all had different consistencies- one okay one, one dry, on mushy, one chewy...wtf and then I stopped after that.  Its a SQUAT LOBSTER.....a Squat is also called a "langostino". It normally is used in very heavy "yum yum" sauced sushi rolls and as a base to make soups and minced meat seafood products and are rarely used in pure tail form as its flavor and consistency is not as great as it's cousins. I also asked a fisherman who said I was correct in my research. Just thought to put that FYI out there incase people were psyched about All you can eat American/Spiny Lobsters. It's kinda a lobster still, but miles different. It's like the difference between getting KRAB and real Crab.The Seafood buffet inside the Rio hotel is a popular one on the strip. (actually, it is not on the strip, but a block on the other side of Highway 15)It costs $39.95 per person. If the line is really long, you can pay $49.95, or ten dollars more, and get in the express VIP line and get in with little wait. This is what I did, because I was meeting some friends who were here 15 minutes before me because I was running late. (Note: The Las Vegas strip traffic is HORRIBLE on a weekend evening! You might move faster on the SF-Oakland Bay Bridge at 8am, or the I-405 past LAX at 5:30pm)The buffet has a huge selection to choose from, and of course a lot of it is seafood. Their are king crab legs, several types of fish in various styles, shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters, clam chowders (New England and Manhattan), sushi, sashimi, etc. Of course, there are offerings that are not seafood, so the meat lover can get something to fill his/her tummy.A lot os desserts or course, of all sorts. I would caution that you be careful with the shellfish,  as it is sitting under hot lights and if they don't move fast, well, you could get some uncomfortable gurgling deep in your gastro-intestinal tract.  The sushi seemed to move faster, so it seemed ok. Your waiter gets you drinks, and general they are good about refills, because they want their tips from you, so leave one for your server if they are giving you good service.**Summary**When this buffet first came out, I was willing to stand in line for an hour just to eat here. Now, even with the locals 25% off special, I doubt I'd ever come back. The lobster tails went from big and juicy to small and dry. Speaking of dry, that word could be used to describe most of the seafood. A lot of the pictures are a little old and show the buffet at its prime. If you're thinking about eating here, I'd suggest going in and seeing the selection for what it is now.**Price/Hours**       - Mon-Fri 4pm-10pm       - Sat & Sun 3:30pm-10pm       - $44.99 Without Total Rewards Card       - $39.99 With Total Rewards Card       - $33.74 Local With Total Rewards Card (25% off as with all restaurants at Rio)       - I believe each card can carry up to 7 guests       - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=N_a1su82sjnkeRg1dzDnyA**Notes**       - Lobster Tails - With the exception of the sterling brunch at Bally's, this is the only buffet I know that serves lobster tails.       - Before - When this place first opened the lobster tails looked like this: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=QHfhDsVRRPcvMzfGDCoBqg       - Now - Now the lobster tails look like this tiny thing between the clam strips and the scallops: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=AmMOM91RYw_ALKAux1l0AA       - Crab Legs - They have both hot and cold crab legs. They are definitely larger than the crab legs at the Carnival World Buffet. However, the hot crab legs were dry and the cold crab legs...well, are cold.       - Oysters - I grabbed two oysters and I could only eat one. They tasted like they'd gone bad.       - Crawfish - Dry and not fresh.       - Sashimi - They have salmon, white fish, and tuna. The only fresh seafood item I could find (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=T4iokj7Ei9oH2fJ1YpzUdA).       - Prime Rib - I actually never had this here, but it's there.       - Desserts - The desserts are really good. They have a spinning gelato wheel and some of the higher end desserts you'd expect like creme brule.**Recommendations**       - I wouldn't recommend this place at its current condition. If they bring back the quality they use to have, I'd easily pay $50. However, I doubt they will.So heres my take on this place.I've been wanting to eat here for a long time and finally got my chance in Feb when I did the buffet of Buffets. It's $45 per person and you can eat at 7 different buffets within 24hrs. $15 Extra per person if you want to eat here. Great deal if you have the stomach and metabolism. They had alot of fish in many ways from Baja, Italian, Mediterranean, Ect...It was all good but for the price of the buffet you would have thunk they could debone fish right. I don't know how many times I almost spit out the fish so I wouldnt choke or have to be rushed to the emergency room. thats probably the only complaint I had.They had tons of Crab legs, Shrimp and Mussels to choose from. Lox Galore too ;)The "Supposive" lobster tail they had was good but they sure were small, plus they even cut them in half. They more looked like these huge prawns i can get in San Felipe, Mexico. But I loaded up on them anyways. It was mixed with regular shrimp too.The sushi station was great. Tons of Tuna, Salmon and Halibut Sashimi ;) Can't forget the Kimchi.The Gelato Station was AWESOME!!! I could have gone back there for hours. It was all great tasting. If you like Creme Brulee, you have to try theres. Very good. There desserts are way better than alot of the hotels in Vegas.So overall I was pleased with my expierence but dont know if I would go out of my way to come back.The other evening, I felt like Bubba in the Forrest Gump movie, shrimp this and shrimp that, and with so many combinations to choose from, hot, cold, on ice, in a spicy broth, with rice, yada yada yada -- it was all glorious.  Of the 152 (or so) items, I may have tasted 37 of them (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-seafood-buffet-las-vegas?select=jrMXFC66ww1lDR1NsQnyMg#YkaPn9HxhtwF0nqv9uWZKA), and returned again for 5 items, and then again for 2 of my favorites, and again for the same 2 favs, and again for the same 2 favs, until I nearly busted.  Clearly, the best dish was the steamed mix of lobster tails (small 2-3" but who cares, grab 30 of'em) and butterflied large shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-seafood-buffet-las-vegas?select=jrMXFC66ww1lDR1NsQnyMg#ml546xqPEKewFaW1blGmow).  This beats setting out nets to catch on my own, or waking up at 4am to go fishing.  When the last shrimp rolled around for about 3 minutes before I could swallow it, I knew the feast was over for me -- I was clearly out of the contest.With varied stations of seafood (hot and cold), and alternatives (a small bit of Mexican, salads, sushi, and Mediterranean among others), a carving station, etc, Village Seafood Buffet is exactly as it states "seafood", and this is the kind of village I'd like to live in.  The rent is a bit high at $44.95 ($5 off with players card).  But c'mon, you know your a play'a...and it's your turn to take that position over, as I've died and gone to heaven.P.S.  For an extra $11.95, you can add AYCD wine or beer during your dining.PSS.  Don't forget to take the Lobster Mashed Potatoes...it's soooo good!This is my second favorite buffet at the Rio.  In fact, if it wasn't for the variety of seafood options that are not available at most buffets, including lobster, I would not eat here at all.  Reasons?  1) it is very expensive and there is always a really long wait.  2) you don't receive a locals 1/2 price like you do at Carnival World.  3) The food is often just mediocre.  I love lobster but the last time I ate here it was overcooked.  The time before that it was cold.  The vultures eating there are pigs and often spill the drawn butter or make a mess of the lobster area.  Also, often times you have to wait for more to come out.I will say that other than the lobster, the rest of the seafood usually tastes great but the bottom line is, if I am going to pay that much for buffet food, it better be darn good. Otherwise, I could just go to Joe's seafood or something similar and get my lobster prepared much better.My frugal meter died here!  I was with a group of people, and they told me to live a little.  Why the heck did I listen to them?  I was living quite well with my money in my frugal pockets!  Why, oh why did I stay and eat here?  I don't care if I did ride with them here!  I don't care if they are the only buffet with lobster, not worth the price.This pricey eating trough has a variety of eating genres for dinner.  There is an Asian section with sushi and other traditional dishes.  There is a Baja section with fajita this, tortilla that, nacho chips here, and nacho cheese there, to name a few items.  There is a Mediterranean section that has a variety of items, including hummus.  Of course you have to have your carving section with the turkey, ham and high end beef, cut by a chef to your liking.  There are truly many options to this buffet, but the price makes me ill just thinking about it!  Too much for even unlimited.  I realized too late that I was crazy.  For a few dollars more, I should have opted for the 24 hour, 6 buffet option.  This buffet is included in the list.  Had I purchased that, I could have eaten at this buffet at night, rested, ate at another buffet in the morning, did some afternoon activities, then ate at another buffet that afternoon, then rounded off my night with another buffet for hour number 23!  Run-on sentence, yes, but very logical still, frugal glee yes!  You live and you learn.  The food on the buffet is decent enough to do the meal deal.  I don't understand gelato, but there is multiple flavors of that, along with many types of desserts to round off your meal.Do you want to puke out of your mouth and ass at almost the same time?  Then definitely pay the exorbitant price to eat at best mediocre food at the Rio Casino Seafood Buffet!Perhaps I was asking for it because I went around 8:45 - the person at the front assured me that they will continue to bring out food until 9:30.  They did continue to bring out food, but the less popular dishes just sat there, and sat there.I don't understand why people come here.All you can eat lobster?  NOT FOUND.  I think I may have found it, but thought it was crawfish.All you can eat oysters?  NOT FRESH!  Avoid not fresh oyster at all costs.  They say oysters are an afrodisiac but there's nothing sexy in watching someone puke.All you can eat king crab legs?  NOT FOUND.  Seriously, where was this?  I only found snow crab legs.  No king crab found.All you can eat seafood?  Yes, but again not fresh.  I found the seafood was more fresh at the Bachannal buffet at Caesars, although the variety was not as good as here.  But why pay more to eat such crap food?  If you're here strictly for quantity or you're someone who likes to puke after eating a ton of food, I can kind of understand..Even if I didn't get sick, I would not suggest coming here.  Spend the extra to go to Bachannal at Caesars - it's so much better and has enough seafood options to keep you satisfied.  If you did the Buffet of Buffets promotion, it's definitely not worth the extra fee to eat here.So after I became ill, someone suggest that I contact customer service.  I sent them an email telling them that I got food poisoning from their buffet and they replied asking me to call some risk management team and they will open up an investigation.  I would have preferred if they just refunded the extra money I paid as part of their Buffet of Buffets deal.  But calling their number and speaking with them for a mere $10 is not worth the effort.  So Rio, you win.  Take my $10.  I hope my puke and crap somehow clog up your sewage pipes.This is one of the best buffets in Vegas. If your a seafood lover like my husband and I the price you pay is so worth it. They have crab legs, served steamed or cold, lobster tails, raw oysters, crawfish, clams, mussels .... The clam chowder is a must have and of course there's non seafood items too like the beef ribs which is so moist and it falls right off the bone. Here's a Tip: I do recommend stopping by the half price ticket counters that you see on the strip to save $11 at the buffet.For those of you who wants to see what kind of seafood is served at Village Seafood Buffet at Rio. I have recorded an extended steady tour of the whole buffet stations:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYl2MEs5bjIThe Village Seafood Buffet is located at the other end of the casino floor. The lines could get very long between 7 and 8pm. As for me, I got there around 7:30 on a Thursday evening and waited about 20 minutes. The price for dinner was $45, so about $15 more than Carnival World Buffet.There were a lot of seafood options to choose from as you can see from my video.To be honest, I really went there for the AYCE lobster, I was hugely disappointed that it was so freaking tiny (see video). They didn't serve Maine lobster instead they served Rock lobster. If you guys don't know, Rock lobsters come from the Pacific ocean and has no claws, whereas Maine Lobsters come from the East coast with claws. Anyways, I still ate a whole bunch of tiny-halved lobster tails to ensure that I got my money worth.They serve a lot of clams, mussels, and crawfish that are not served at Carnival World Buffet.Overall the food was good not great. I believe this is the only place in Vegas that serve AYCE lobster.Like I said before, to decide if you guys want to eat here, I have recorded a full steady tour of the Village Seafood Buffet for all of you guys to enjoy!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYl2MEs5bjII love coming to this buffet. At first, when my fiance suggested it, I thought it seemed a little pricey, particularly because there is a 4 plate limit. We only pay $30 because we're locals. To the tourists who got sucked into paying $50; dunno what to tell you other than, sucks to be you, I guess. When we got there the first time, there was no line, but in times since, we've waited maybe 15 minutes, at most, and I've waited that long at an Olive Garden before, so in the grand scheme of things, not that bad. You can get soda or water, or for an upcharge you can get bottomless wine or beer.  They boast of lobster tails, and they are quite nice, but to be fair, they are not standard sized lobster tails, they're mini, but still good. In regard to the people complaining of the lobster, I've never been there when they were "mushy" or "stale," and they refill the trays with new batches fairly often.   As for the other treats I enjoyed, they had an amazing salmon dish with a creamy cheese sauce, crab legs, oysters, sushi, shrimp, crab, and a slew of other items. The four plate max was more than enough, as I am uncomfortably full whenever we leave this place. My fiance and I are on a low carb diet so we come here to treat ourselves without getting out of control. I don't give it 5 stars because I still think it's a tad pricey, although we're locals and the food is good, I can get the same, or better quality fish for $25 at an all you can eat sushi restaurant. That being said, we go here about once a month.
Pei Wei Asian Market=I ventured again to the the downtown side of I17.  I have been interested in trying a Pei Wei for quite some time but I thought it would be the one at 67th and 101 for dinner rather than this one for lunch.  Miserable traffic, cramped parking, I drove right by the place.  But none of that is the restaurants fault.I got there at 1PM on a Friday figuring the lunch rush would be clearing.  As I walked up to the order desk I spotted 3 different 2 person tables to choose from.  By the time I got my order placed, no one in front of me, all three were being used and the only one open was next to one occupied by a one pretty woman just over 1/2 my age.  I left my number and went off to fill my iced tea glass and in that 2 minutes she was gone and the table was already cleared for the next guest.  Drat, scared off another one.:-(  Over the next 25 minutes that I was there the dining area did indeed clear out some but not as much as I expected.  Between the open kitchen, the music and all the talking I thought the noise level was pretty high.My meal took about 10 minutes to arrive which I think is about right.  I ordered the limited time offering of Thai mango chicken with white rice ($7.75) and an iced tea (soft drink $1.75).  It actually looked like the picture on the web site.  Slightly spicy on the hot side (about what I expected) but more syrupy on the sweet side than I would like.  Chains seem to like syrupy.  The servers were quick to bring dishes out without letting them sit and were keeping the tables cleaned off.Overall I think it is slightly nicer and slightly more expensive than Panda Express.  I wouldn't balk at going there again if that is what was suggested.  If in the right part of town I would prefer to go to Wok n Stix for about the same overall quality and price, and it is locally owned.I feel odd anytime I review a chain, but this particular location has set a pretty high bar for all other locations and they definitely deserve some props.I have eaten at this location dozens of times throughout the years and have zero complaints. Seriously, not one botched order, rude employee or unhappy dining experience.This past weekend I was partaking in a Rock Band marathon and we needed something in our bellies to keep us fueled up. It was about closing time but they had no problems making our dishes. Our food came out without any issues, piping hot and tasty, as usual. We were offered to-go cups in case we wanted one for the road and because we were the last people there, the extra chocolate chip cookies from the day went home with us, free of charge! Definitely a 5-star experience, every time!Definitely falls into the "what where they thinking?" category. Our  neighborhood Pei Wei - a block from our offices and a weekly favorite for 5 years, has changed to Pei Wei Asian Market - a sort of cheap food court concept, without the mall. Obviously this is a more inexpensive operation to run. Portions are a lot smaller, and about a dollar or two cheaper. Not all bad, but many favorites seem to be gone. Plastic has replaced the restaurant-ware, and not cool custom plastic, but basic restaurant supply take-away stock. No green PR there. The warm, PF-asian decor has been replaced by a basic black and industrial box with so much parking lot glare during lunch that it's hard to select your plastic utensils from the self-serve area. The restaurant is now noisy and the seemingly uncomfortable staff calling out order numbers adds to the din. Now in all fairness, we've tried the restaurant a few times since the reopen. The food was fine every time and the flavors good. Not where I'd go if I was hungry, but the value seemed good. Truly, if this was in the mall, it would likely do fine. Unfortunately it's not. Alas we mourn the loss of our local Pei Wei.
Naked Fish's Sushi & Grill=After hearing about this place for a while, I finally got a chance to check it out.  That was Wednesday.  This is Friday and I've been back twice since!! Japanese owned and run, great service - very friendly - but what I care about most is the food.  Here are some highlights from my last three days:- The sushi rice is delicious and very well done.  And the ratio of fish to rice on the nigiri is ideal as many places use too much rice.- Giant clam, still MOVING slightly and topped with a very thin slice of lemon with peel.  Perfect way to start the meal.- I am a devout O-Toro worshipper and they served me the best O-Toro (blue fin tuna belly) I've eaten east of Hawaii.  Melts in your mouth, no need to chew.- Ankimo (monkfish liver) was new for me and is now a new fav.  It's the foie gras of the sea.  Be sure to take a superbite by putting this in your mouth with some of the scallion, pickled daikon and kale at the same time.  Heavenly.- Halibut Fin, OMG, wow.  I've never had the fin before this is incredible.  - Aji (Spanish Mackarel) was delicious and not even slightly fishy.- The hamachi is excellent, top quality fresh fish.  And I appreciated the knife cuts used on top to further tenderize the already very tender fish.  Melts.- I loved, loved, loved the GT-R Roll (Tiger shrimp tempuraand spicy tuna topped with seared albacore, Jalapenos and a spicy aioli.  Garnished with spicy garlic ponzu.)   I don't usually go in for the gimmicky rolls but this spicy one was out of this world.  They finish it off with a BLOW TORCH giving the whole thing a slightly grilled taste.- The Ika ten (squid tempura) was perfectly cooked.  You can dip it in classic tempura sauce or even better: salt and squeeze of fresh lemon.- I saw them butcher the salmon that had just arrived and then they cut me off some of the fatty belly.  Wow.  As good as the best I've had.Good not great:  - I love uni (sea urchin) and this was quite above average but Sen of Japan is still the best I've had anywhere in the world.- Occasionally I've had ikura that doesn't even have the slightest hint of fishiness.  This was not one of them.  But it was good.- I thought the anago (sea water eel) was very good and the friend I was with was raving about it.  - I ordered the Chicken Gizzard (kind of teriyaki-ish) because one of the chefs was telling me that's what he gets when he comes here to drink.  It was awesome, but quite heavy and a bit oily.  Would be perfect while drinking but not as a dish in the middle of a meal of fresh fish!Abalone - Up there with the best I've had east of Hawaii.The miso soup is very good and they serve iced green tea which not all places do.  The prices are quite reasonable considering the high quality.  Also, if you have a special request to eat a certain fish they don't normally carry, just let them know in advance and they will order it if is available.  This is my new go-to sushi joint.  There are a couple other secrets on and off the menu that I'd rather not disclose so they can save them all for me!!!!!  This is 5 stars and I'm not a slut with my 5-star ratings.This place continues to be my at-least-weekly sushi spot.Two weeks ago, on a Tuesday, they shut down the restaurant for the day.  I have gotten to know the sushi chefs there, so when I asked them what happened, they told me that it was because they received a shipment of sub-par tuna that day.  Since so many customers order tuna on any given day (rolls, spicy tuna, etc), they decided it was best to just close for the day rather than try and salvage some of the bad tuna.That is the definition of integrity.  I don't know any other sushi restaurant in town that would sacrifice a day of revenue because of a situation like that.  Definitely not Sushi-Mon or any of the Korean run sushi restaurants in town - no way.  I think that speaks highly of the owner and the importance he puts on consistently serving only the highest quality fish.Other than that, I don't have much of an update.  I continue to order many of my favs I've written about in the past including GT-R roll, hamachi, aji, ika ten.  Lately, they have also been getting in some really fresh moi from Hawaii.  Also, since my last review I have been served some very good uni - as good as any I've had at other places.This place has some of the best sushi I've had in Vegas. I am a REALLY selective person when it comes to where I eat sushi. I only go for the good stuff!! It has to be FRESH and good quality. This place is doing it right!! Their cat's eye roll and kai's roll we sooooooo good. FRESH as anything. My friend also got some of their nigiri and it was perfection. Still- Absolutely some of the best sushi in Vegas. Very impressed!They lose one star because......My only issue was the service. Our server took FOREVER to come to the table and then after taking our orders she NEVER came back again. We had to flag down a random employee just to get the bill. So ridiculous.Conveniently located on S. Durango Dr., on your right hand side, after Twain Ave. in the Parkview Plaza. I got a tip off from a coworker that their Uni is the freshest here and she only dines here for it. So I got curious and my Mom loves Uni.. why not give this place a try.We were kindly greeted by our server, Wanda. Cheerful and direct, she let us know that HH just started and the specials for today. She's very informative and details of each dish was emphasized to the point where I could have envisioned it right before my very own eyes! Our appetite chose the Shima Aji - Striped Jack (specials), Premium Uni from Santa Barbara (specials), Shigoku Oysters (specials), Avocado Roll (HH), Yuzu Salmon (HH), and Yellowtail Jalapeno (HH).My loves:I admit.. all those specials we ordered were FRESH. It felt like we were at sea and they just caught it. Opened, cut it up, and served us ;) Shima Aji had a clean finish.. pure texture as in smooth and rich. If you've been looking for sashimi with no fishy odor/taste and ends with a sweet, calm note.. Shima Aji is the best for Summer! I would order this over and over again. Highly recommend this special while it's around. Premium Uni here could possibly seduce you in falling in love with Uni, itself. Obsessive kind of love. Beautiful presentation. The color of a sliced mango.. deep, deep orange. I get a kick out of the grainy texture that reminded me of a very dry tongue. Say Ahhh!!! Buttery, sweet, and fresh tasting. Surprisingly, it has a hint of floral. It came with a generous amount of 4 pieces of Uni per nigiri order. I was in Uni heaven!!! Layer after layer I was relishing each bite. Definitely order this or you're going to be missing out on something truly pleasurable to your taste buds. So good, sooooooooo GOOD. Yuzu Salmon presentation had bursting, vibrant colors that made the dish so enticing. Nicely sliced and pleasantly clean flavor.Unfortunately, the flash flood warning went off at the restaurant and my phone. So we had to scarf down on our last dishes of Avocado Roll and Yellowtail Jalapeno sashimi. Looking through the window from our comfy booth seating.. those clouds look mean.. destructive mean. I had to ask for the check pronto and told our server, Wanda.. my MINI can't survive any floods.. I have to get going.. and she goes.. then you better go. While the staff yells out thank you.. we took off like ghost rider. This place was packed during Happy Hour (HH) 5p-6p/10p-2a and love the fact that they played some great UFC/MMA fights while enjoying our meal here. My mom was oddly engaged in those matches. Getting my attention with.. Look! Look at this guy get kneed in the ribs!!! I was like what the heck he lost from that?! UFC/MMA sushi action! Naked Fish is as real as it gets for your Sushi needs! Clearly won my heart for Uni Nigiri!!!
Le's Sandwiches & Cafe=I finally am catching up with my reviews after making Le's a semi-regular lunch spot, thanks to Tony C's favorable recommendation.  By now, you have read all about the location, tucked away in what looks to be a dying mall in dire need of renovations where even the parking lot is scattered with weeds growing in between the cracks.Despite the rundown setting, Le's Sandwiches & Cafe serves up great sandwiches.  Fresh bread, good veggies and friendly service.  This is probably the most authentic Vietnamese food establishment I've seen in Charlotte.  I always go for the white ham and pate sandwich.  You can order the bread regular or "long" baguette style.  For those of you new to banh mi, the bread is light and crisp, you can choose your meat and all come with pickled daikon and carrot slices, cilantro and peppers - a surprising taste combination that is simply excellent.  (Take the peppers out unless you like really spicy food; they are hot.)The Vietnamese coffee here is just OK, a bit on the pricey side (I'm used to paying $1.50), a little too dark for me (I've had better), but I must urge you all to try this place.  I tried the Bubble Tea (Green Tea Latte with Boba) - well made, but the boba was a tad hard here and there.Still Le's is quite the find and is the only place I go to out here to fix my Banh Mi craving.  And now, I must footnote to say that if you are in So Cal, go to Banh Mi Che Cali for the best sandwich ever. But, at Le's you can just get a glimpse of what a great Vietnamese sandwich is like.If banh mi is done right, it is the indisputable king of food value.  Le's does it right.You can get a filling #6 (grilled pork) sandwich, on a baguette, topped with pickled carrot, radish, and cilantro, for $3.  THREE DOLLARS.  And it's delicious.If you call ahead and order a bunch of sandwiches (for all your friends/workmates/superbowl party platter), they will give you the option of packing the cold veggie toppings separately, so you can assemble them on your own and avoid the bread getting soggy from the veggie juice in transit.Add to that friendly and speedy service, and everybody's a winner.Top notch!Every time I drive around Sugar Creek and Tryon, I think it is time to try Le's Sandwiches and I never stop.  Today I was craving Middle Eastern food, as much as I wanted tabouli, I decided today was the day for bahn mi from Le's. Yes, today is the day!It is everything a foodie, eatee, adventure eater, tourist, you name it, it fills the void.  Off the beaten path- check, inexpensive -check, fresh ingredients -check, friendly service- check, in a shopping center that feels like it's abandoned - check.  A little sketchy, where you see all walks of life- check. A funnel cake vendor in the parking lot-check.  A group of car detailers in the parking lot- check.  A huge Asian market to stock the pantry -items that are a million dollars at Harris Teeter- check. Props to a simple menu, fresh ingedients, made with love and reasonably priced.  Le is the man.I'm so glad I finally went to Le's Sandwich Shop. While it's definitely not in the nicest area of town and the area looks pretty sketch-tastic, the sandwiches are absolutely worth the trip. I don't want to completely echo what all the other reviewers are saying but here's the low down:-Incredibly friendly owner-The sandwiches are $3 each and are damn delicious. -The baguettes are super fresh provide the perfect amount of toasty crisp -The #6 is delightful. Grilled pork, pickled veg, spicy jalapeno, bunches of cilantro, special sauce. Get one. Get two. Get three to go. It is the best bahn mi sammie I've had in a very long time. Even though Le's isn't much to look at, the sandwiches are unearthly good. If this place was closer to home, I'd probably set up a cot and live there.Yes!  Banh Mi  YES!  YEST!  FANTASTIC and this is my fourth meal today in 6 hours, so I'm not even a little hungry!Mr. Le asked me if I had ever been here and when I said no, he said get the #6.  He was correct.  An EXCELLENT choice!  This one is similar to a Banh Mi I have eaten in Union County.  The #6 is a Grilled Pork with lots of Cilantro, carrots, cucumbers, hot peppers, pickled Daikon on a fantastic Roll (I not not know how to spell Baguette).  As I requested: NO Butter!  NO Mayo!Totally Affordable!  Most of the Sandwiches are under $4.00 and they are plenty big unless you are a Wild Boar in Training like me.  I'm thinking about getting Mr. Le to make a Special Sandwich for me and I'll pay him more than he asks!  I know I'm crazy.I'm the only non-Asian person eating or even ordering here, so that is cool!  Some of the patrons asked me how I like it and told me to come back and get a different one each time!  I saw some more choices I bet I would love!First Note:  CASH ONLY!  So remember bring folding $ No Plastic, No Checks, No Monopoly $!No te: Hopefully you will not need a rest room - Le's does not have one and that is all you should know.  If you have to go I suggest you plan ahead and go right before you arrive.  READ C A R E F U L L Y   You do not want to visit the Mall rest rooms... It is probably not safe in any meaning of the word and in no way can I use the word clean because it does not apply!Last NOte:  Today was my first visit to Mr. Le's, though it was my second visit to this Mall - It has been three or four years since I have been here and it was not in good shape then - It has gone from sketchy to approaching scary.  Le's is nice and clean, the Mall he is located in is the opposite!  I recommend as always: beware of your surroundings, travel in a group, act confident (even if you are not) and if you are trained and certified this would be a time not to leave home without "it" (I'm not talkin' AMEX) Le's is Cash only.  I'm not talking about Cousin It either, though Cousin It may be some help here!Le's rocks.  Unfortunately, those rocks end up in the parking lot of the mall.  If I were to put much thought into it, calling this abomination a mall is a real stretch of the imagination, because the only thing that makes it a mall is that there is one big building with some smaller shops inside.But it is definitely worth braving that parking lot, because the place is worth the trip.  The proprietor of Le's actually started the perhaps even sketchier Thanh Huong on Central many years ago, but decided to move on, and now has this sandwich shop, focusing on what he loves: The banh mi.  Several places in Charlotte supposedly offer the simple sandwich, but when you go to order it, they are often out.They say it is because of the bread.  Interestingly, you can actually buy the bread here at Le's for a paltry $0.60 a loaf.  Regardless, do yourself a favor and order a couple extra.  One for the ride home, one for after you get home, whatever.  That way you do not have to take a few hundred miles off the undercarriage of your car by braving the parking lot when you crave another of those awesome sandwiches.And make sure you get one of the pressed sugar cane drinks too.  It complements the heat of the sandwich nicely, is something you cannot find anywhere else that I know about and is not nearly as sweet as you would think pressed sugar cane to taste.Wanna feel like you're taping your own episode of Anthony Bourdain's 'No Reservations' in Charlotte?  Let's rundown your checklist as we head over to Le's:1.  You, the pious foodie, makes a pilgrimage to a part of town not showcased in the city's tourism materials, where you will be greatly outnumbered by people you never knew inhabited said city speaking a language that you cannot begin to decipher.  CHECK.2.  In search of ethnic cuisine that is either hard to find or lacks authenticity at the more "main stream" food establishments.  CHECK.3.  In a place that, upon first encounter, has you thinking, "There's no way this can be sanitary!"  CHECK.4.  And, after throwing all caution aside, you dig in and find mastery in the most unlikeliest of places.  Nirvana ensues.  CHECK CHECK.That is a trip to Le's and if the above appeals to you at all (along with the Viet-French fusion that is the banh mi sandwich) this is a must for Charlotte adventurers.  No big menus, no table-side service, no inkling this place even exists until you walk thru the rundown bomb-shelter of a mall and stumble upon this bustling corner shop.  Blind trust is finally rewarded.Le's does one thing only and one thing well: the banh mi sandwich.  The freshest of French baguette- crisp on the outside, creamy smooth inside- kept warm till serving time.  The heat of fresh jalapeno and the fresh earthiness of cilantro.  Pickled vegetables layered in between.  Sounding good?   At less than $4.00 a piece, you'll likely find yourself wanting more than one,  but bring your Benjamin's, no plastic accepted here. As Anthony quips, "What can I say, I happen to be an aficionado of the dive bar."  Le's fits that bill and is proof that just because it's a dive does not mean it can't also be a little piece of heaven.Equal parts adventure, experience, culinary safari, near scrapes with overtly life-threatening conditions for any vehicle, and personality. Goodness gracious. I've loved Banh Mi for years, but Le's has sparked a fire-y passion in my little Vietnamese cuisine-loving heart. Made it in on a Sunday afternoon, it was packed, and we were amongst tons of regulars. It was a great. My being green around the gills was easy to spot all the way from the cratered parking lot. Follow instructions on every other review you'll read here. Asian Corner, walk down the (awesomely dirty and strongly loved) hallway, hang a right, and get ready for a sandwich worth it's weight in gold. Now, there are tons of options. I wanted to swing for a grand slam of "Wow! I've never even heard of that!" but decided not to vie with au originale. #6 on a long baguette, please. It was....so good it rendered me speechless and with a face full of fantastically balanced Banh Mi. The bread.....my dear, sweet....it was perfect. So crunchycrispy, soft interior, slight chew. What kind of delicious sorcery made this bread?!?! Just absolutely perfect. The veggie combo -- standard pickle-y carrots, onions, and jalapenos. The pork. I've been missing out on this the entire time I've lived in Charlotte until now. One bite and you'll be a believer. (I've been told to call an audible and add paté to the #6. Next time: Done.) Oh, and much like the aforementioned, suckers are like $3 a pop. I'm a believer. Addict. Cheerleader. Wondrously and deliriously complete now that I've experienced Le's. If you're reading this, Owner/Management/Sandwich Artist, please accept my humble Thank You for all that you do.This is one of my go-to spots. You literally can not go wrong with Le's. I have been here well-over a dozen times and have NEVER had a bad experience. I've even recruited several people who are now die-hard fans of Le's. If you are looking for a delicious banh mi then this is your place. The freshness of the ingredients and crunchy deliciousness of the bread are unmatched. I know that other places claim to have banh mis that are good but to me they just aren't as simple and delicious as what Le's offers. Let me also point out...Le's Sandwiches are a proven hangover cure in my opinion! All for less than $4!To be fair I can not comment on anything other than #6 (the grilled pork banh mi). Don't blame me though, I found what I liked and stuck with it! There are several sandwiches though to suit the pallet of any banh mi fan; I simply prefer the classic.One could not write a review about Le's Sandwiches without commenting on the ambience. Le's Sandwiches is certainly off the beaten path and is tucked away in the Asian Mall off of N Tryon which at times looks like it was abandoned in the late 70's. Don't let the scenery fool you though. Le's Sandwiches is impeccably clean and well-kept. After enjoying a sandwich at Le's be sure to check out one of the Asian markets in the same area. Great stuff and one of the cheapest places I've found Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce!This is what Yelp is all about. Never in a million a years would I have ever found this spot... or even attempted to go here without reading the reviews.I used to drive past this place all the time. I had no clue there were even businesses operating in this rundown shopping center. So I braved the parking lot, knocked the alignment out of my car probably 10 times. And it was all worth it.For the newbies, here are some important things to know:-You can't see Le's from the parking lot. You have to get out of your car and go inside the mall. Go past the Dollar Store at the second Asian Mall entrance. Walk through the hallway. It is on the right.-Cash only-They close at 6-Seriously, the parking lot looks like a serious of bombs went off in it. Be careful driving through it.As for the food, I knew right off the bat that I wanted the #6 grilled pork banh mi. With the prices so cheap and the fact that I survived the parking lot, I knew I wanted to order another one for later. While staring at the menu trying to decide, the super nice man behind the counter suggested the #8 BBQ pork. Oh man, delicious. The bread, the pickled veggies, the meat... both sandwiches were just fantastic. The #8 wins for me.Two giant sandwiches... just eight bucks. You can't beat that.Thank you Yelpers for introducing me to this small slice of Vietnamese sandwich heaven. Can't wait to go back and try the sugar cane juice!Wow...what an interesting experience. I knew the food had to be good if people are willing to traverse such treacherous terrain for a sandwich. I had to swerve around craters, I mean potholes, in the parking lot and then walk through what appeared to be an abandoned mall in a third world country to reach the restaurant.Once inside, I felt a sense of relief. The restaurant was clean and the staff were very friendly. I had the #6: a pork sandwich with pickled veggies and fresh cilantro for $3.75. OMG, what a great deal. The sandwich was simple, fresh and delicious for under four bucks. They must be making their money on sodas. My can of coke was $1. But I can't complain, the meal is the best value I've gotten for lunch in years. This place takes hole-in-the-wall to a whole new level and I love it! It's cash only and most people order take-out.  Add this place to your list. The food is fresh and fabulous.
Johnny Rockets=I was supposed to meet my friend next door at Capriotti's Sandwich Shop.  When I arrived, he wanted Johnny Rocket's instead.  I had read all about Capriott's on Yelp, so I was excited to try it.  I begrudgingly agreed to eat at Johnny Rocket's, but it turned out to be a great meal and experience.The staff were super friendly at Johnny Rocket's.  Especially the girl with the big blue eyes.  She answered all of my many questions that I had because I hadn't been to Johnny Rocket's often.  She filled me on their new food items that I was totally unfamiliar with.  After talking to her, I decided on the Philly Cheesesteak with fries.  It was super tasty, and I was glad to have ordered it.  It turned out to be an unexpectedly excellent meal.It honestly felt weird to be on vacation at a place like Las Vegas with a million restaurants around and eating at Johnny Rockets.  However, I was glad that I did.  I had a great experience and would not mind coming here again the next time I am in the area.Our group got hungry so with the lack of planning, we decided to just go across the street to Johnny Rockets.FOOD - 1 Star: I ordered:- Chili Cheese Fries: These were ok. They were really heavy on the chili and the cheese was barely there. It would've been way better to actually have the cheese on the top instead of under the chili.- Sweet Potato Bacon Cheese Fries: I enjoyed the sweet potato fries myself, but the cheese... if you can call it that... was pretty disgusting. I don't know why they couldn't use real cheese. Instead they used some liquid cheese that you'd find at the movie theater and so it had this weird taste to it. The only thing that kind of saved it was the bacon, but even that was overpowered by the liquid cheese. This ruined my appetite and I had to eat around the cheese, which was almost impossible since it was all over the place.- Smoke House Single Burger: This was pretty good, but smaller than I thought it would be. Maybe I don't come here often enough, but the burger was small. The taste was spot on. You can't go wrong with a meat patty, cheese, onion rings, and bacon.SERVICE - 2 Stars: The staff was friendly, but literally only approached us to drop off the menus and to deliver food. No one checked on us at all during the meal. I need an extra fork and literally had to flag someone down to get it.ATMOSPHERE - 2 Stars: It's your typical Johnny Rocket's setup and my biggest issue with the place was the fact there was no soap in the restroom. I'm glad we had hand sanitizer with us, but that's just gross.RECOMMENDATION: Overall, I'd say you can skip this place. Go to Capriotti's or Joe's Pizza in the same shopping center instead. You'll get way better food for the money you're paying.Shut the front door batman! Damn this is one tasty burger! It is a bit pricy to be honest. The food is amazing! Fries are fresh, and molten hot! It is super cute in here too, like the diners my G parents would take me to when I was a kid. So yes I am a fan of Johnny Rockets.
Sauce Pizza & Wine=Sauce has grown on me... particularly this location since this is the one I frequently end up at for a quick lunch or casual dinner spot near home.I typically order chopped salads at lunch.  The chopped turkey & feta salad is what I had today.  I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch... fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town.  I also like the spinach, pancetta & goat cheese and the veggie & aged parmesan salads.  My husband eats at Sauce often as well... he goes for a salad or sandwich.  Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto & mozzarella panini.  I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.  The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.  Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal... What I like about Sauce the most? Fast, friendly, and efficient service in a clean and casual environment.  The moderate pricing is also a big plus in my book... especially in this economy.I'm still a fan of Sauce and I'm not lowering any stars, but I will say that the changes they have made to the Caprese Salad are not so much to my liking. It used to be my favorite salad and I would crave it. However, I've now had the new version of the Caprese Salad and it's just not like it was. The mozzarella overtakes the salad and the croutons (while tasty) are too fatty for the salad. Mozzarella is definitely the most overpowering ingredient and there aren't a ton of tomatoes. It's still tastes ok, but it's not the same. So, I will continue to hope they bring the old one back!
Opa Restaurant=Just got home from Opa and already writing a review... for a reason.  I don't appreciate the way I was treated this evening.  I came into Opa after purchasing a Groupon back in November.  After leaving a 12-hour day at work I had forgotten to print the Groupon, but of course I still pulled it up on my phone.  When the waiter came over to get the Groupon information he had another girl help him out... I handed the girl my Blackberry after pressing "Use Groupon" and the screen came up with a bar code and code written underneath.  The girl held my phone for a good minute and said "I don't know what happened, it just went back to the main screen."  My Groupon had been marked as used, which is what she intended to do... Then she told me she needed proof that it was marked as used this evening.  I went back to the "redeemed" Groupons and showed her, but of course there was no date next to it.  After explaining to her that she had hit marked as used and I had brought up the bar code for her she refused to take it, and walked behind the bar to make drinks for another table.  When I turned around and looked at her she was defensively bitching to the staff about me as if I had been rude, when all I was trying to do was show her the "redeemed" Groupons that I had.  I finally told them to forget it that we would pay full price and I would take it up with Groupon tomorrow to get my money back.  What a hassle after such a LONG day.  You'd think after all that they would at least comp us a dessert or glass of wine.    SO: 2 glasses of house wine, which were less than mediocre.. a "combination plate" which was also less than mediocre, and a plate of lamb and potatos... which was also less than mediocre.  I would not rave about one thing about this place, I didn't enjoy a second of it.  (Not to mention, all of these less than mediocre items cost us a total of $75... I wouldn't have paid $30 for this awful experience) On top of the less than mediocre food, the waitress that was bitching about me and my Groupon circled our table, wouldn't make eye contact with me or my boyfriend, and had an awful look on her face.  Because of the Groupon situation she didn't refill our water until after our plates had been cleared!   I felt as if I was being mistreated and accused of LYING and trying to use a Groupon twice.  I wouldn't even go back to this place if they offered me a free meal because of this stupid situation.  The dinner was uncomfortable for the entire hour we were there and it wasn't even good.  Then right before we got the bill this awkward belly dancer came to our table and danced for us... Not gonna lie, she was also less than mediocre. AWFUL. AWKWARD. UNCOMFORTABLE. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!Opa is always a great experience including this last recent 3rd visit for dinner with friends.Belly Dancer...Live music...Great food...Fun atmosphere...We ate a lot this visit as we had a party of 12 (6 couples) this time.What we ordered...Tzatziki- A creamy yogurt-cucumber-garlic spread flavored with lemon & pepper.Saganaki-"OPA's Famous Flaming Saganaki" baked kefalograviera cheese.Dolmades-Grape leaves stuffed with rice, ground meat & herbs.Calamari-Tender Squid Lightly breaded and pan fried served with zesty cocktail sauce.Horiatiki Village Salad-Tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, bell peppers, feta cheese & greek olives.Gyros Plate-Slices of beef & lamb seasoned with herbs and spices.Baklava-Greek dessert of honey,& nuts all blended together in delicious filo pastry layers.Bottle of red wine.Long island iced tea, nice and stiff!
Bevier Cafe=I ma having a continued, ridiculous love affair with Bevier Cafe.  You see, I have a class from 11-12 in Bevier Hall, and the cafe itself is exactly one floor below my classroom.  Did I mention I get out at noon?  When lunch is served?  Yeah, you do the math.It's a damn good thing that B.C. is relatively cheap ($4.50 for a major entree, or sandwich), or I'd be broke and panhandling in front of the place at this rate.  The Food Service students run a fantastic local cafe that helps them get hands on experience and gets me lunch time eatin' on the cheap.  There's always a vegetable side, some mouthwatering dessert, and the space is cheery and pleasant if a bit utilitarian.  Bevier's well worth the visit.  That said, it's basically cafeteria style in that you pick up a tray, select your food options, add on bread, dessert, drinks, etc, then pay for your meal.  They'll give you a number, and a smiling food service student will bring you your food--often eerily promptly.  Now, my only request is that you don't crowd up the place when i come charging in all hungry like.  Cuz that's not cool.But go check out the cafe, with a fantastic array of food orders (and a daily changing menu!), you're bound to be satisfied.
Pei Wei=Some of you will look at this review and wonder has she lost her mind giving 5 stars to a fast food faux asian restaurant?  No, I'm perfectly sane as I write this.  I have been to Pei Wei many times over the last year.  Is it authentic?  No.  Is it tasty?  Yes. Is it easy on the wallet?  Yes. Are there healthy options?  Yes. Does my daughter like it?  Yes! I have enjoyed many different dishes here.  Rice bowls, noodle bowls, kung pao, pad thai and everything has been good and I was satisfied. I have always had good service at this location too.  The staff is friendly and accomadating, even on a super busy night. I love that you can get brown rice too.  My daughter and I can eat here for under $20.  That's pretty good for a decent meal.  All these things combined make me want to give Pei Wei 5 stars.  But more than that, my daughter loves their Lo Mein and she will eat every last bite almost every time!  I know what I'm getting when I walk in and I know it will be good.  Authentic or not, I still love Pei Wei!
TC's Rib Crib=If you are a fan of pulled pork or mac n cheese that probably has 10,000 calories in it then this is the spot for you.....and me! OMG, I found this place years ago and have actually celebrated a birthday or two, here. It's absolutely charming in every way. TC's is a hole in the wall decorated like your grandma's house with family pictures, place mats and friendly faces. If you are lucky you just might get to meet TC while you are here! I always get the pulled pork because it never let's me down. It's tender, juicy and shredded to the perfect consistency. You are responsible for putting the amount of BBQ sauce you like on your meat. I also always get the mac n cheese that is to die for. Don't leave out the fried okra, ribs, grilled chicken salad, sweet potato fries, etc. You can wash it all down with sweet tea or Kool Aide. Dessert is not to be missed. At the top of that list is the banana pudding and glazed donut bread pudding. Yes, that just happened! Every single person I have brought to TC's has been back and brought their friends, too! They get the five stars because they are reasonably priced, delicious food, and most excellent service. I love this place!!!!!YOU AIN'T GOT SOUL IF YOU DON'T LIKE TC's!  This place is the real deal Soul kitchen.  I had a little of everything, and took to go what I couldn't finish -- and oh baby, that ain't no problem!I had the baby back ribs, beans, collard greens, mac & cheese (unreal!), and sweet potato pie.  Each was so very good, and at a very fair price.  Excellent service by super nice and friendly gals (special shout out to NicNic and Ducky!).It's a casual place in a mini-mall, but with cute and authentic southern decor.  For a west-coast guy, I no longer felt like I was in Vegas, or back in LA where I live -- this transported me...and I loved it.Oh yes, I'll be back, and I'm bringing ziplocs.Heard of this place through Groupon- they also have Yelp deals and other discount offers available, if you're thinking of going. But I'd like to dissuade you from doing so.For starters, service from the owner is dismal-stopped by last week to use my deal and he was arguing with another Groupon customer, loudly and unprofessionally. I wouldn't have gone back without my discount.The meat here is of such low quality, it's embarrassing. The pulled pork was so shredded that it nearly looked ground and the only flavor came from the sauce. Ribs were mediocre, and for a place named after their ribs this is unacceptable- low quality, not particularly meaty or flavorful, and a bit too charred.The brisket though. As a Texas girl, I know brisket about as well as I know my own grandmother. And I don't know what the hell they're serving here. Meat is not fresh and is cut so thinly that it appears to be prepackaged. Little to no flavor, this is not brisket. I was so, so disappointed.We left more than half of our food on our plates, paid, and left. Owner was half asleep in a booth at the back of the dining room and did not address us at all, despite being the only customers and clearly having an issue with their product.Don't go here- they don't care about their customers or their product. There's a reason they have a million discount deals up and NO customers. Barbecue sauce was tasty, but there's nothing here to put it on worth eating.I should have payed attention to all the warning signs and ran away.  In a strip mall strike one when it comes to bbq. No smoke smell whatsoever.  Strike 2. 1st plate came out fully sauced.  Strike 3. I should have been out of there.  But I had a Groupon.  SighOrdered 3 meat plate with ribs, rib tips and brisket. Came out all sauced and brisket chopped. This is a good way to hide bad bbq. I asked if the sliced brisket and they tried to to tell me it was.  Please sell this to someone who is clueless not someone who had reviewed 30 plus bbq restaurants from great to awful.Finally got my plate and was really unimpressed.  Everything was lackluster.  Rib tips sigh, ribs sigh and the pulled pork okay. It all needed the sauce.  Not good for a bbq place.  No smoke ring or Smokey flavor. I almost doubt there is a smoker on the premises.  Not sure outside of the sauce I would even call this bbq. The sides mac and cheese and baked beans were better than the meats but still not awesone. The one thing that earned this place a second star was the 1 dollar banana pudding. This is worth a stop just for dessert.  As I would never go here for any other reason.  The banana pudding itself earned this place the second star. I would not recommend stopping here of you like good bbq whatsoever.Items Ordered:Sliced Brisket, Pulled Pork, Spare Ribs, CornbreadMac n' CheeseSweet Potato FriesBiscuit"New Orleans" French Toast with Sliced BananasBanana PuddingRed Velvet CakePralineLocated near Norm's Eggs Café in a strip mall off South Durango and featuring "World Famous" ribs with awards in 2007 and 2010 for the city's best barbeque it was with tempered expectations that I entered TC's Rib Crib and although I will say the Motown soundtrack and service were quite pleasant as I watched the Buckeyes obliterate Kent State, little else of my experience was even remotely good - a small, buttery biscuit and a jumbo praline the lone exception.  Obviously the sort of place willing to cut corners as condiments include Aunt Jemima and 'honey' cut with glucose syrup and starch it was in a wide selection of meats, sides, and sweets that I invested and although costs were quite low for most items, so too was the quality - the ribs clearly parboiled without a note of smoke while thinly sliced brisket and pulled pork were nearly indistinguishable beneath artificially saccharine sauce.  Mostly ignoring bland elbow noodles from which I consumed only a few bites and fries that arrived almost at meal's end as well as the $4.50 French Toast was flat and flavorless even with the $1.50 banana and whipped cream upgrade...the latter not supplied as they were apparently 'out'...and moving on to dessert, suffice it to say that the boxed vanilla pudding with only a hint of banana beneath 'nilla wafers is not worth $5.99 and although the frosting on a tiny sliver of red velvet cake was tangy and smooth the cake was so dry it literally crumbled to fork pressure - the majority of it joining nearly half the rest of my order in a waste basket when servers were otherwise occupied so as not to offend.Literally the only patron present just past noon on a Saturday it is shocking to me that a business like TC's can sustain and as much as I try to support locals I cannot fathom a reason to return, particularly given a pricepoint higher than Rollin' Smoke despite quality on par with Famous Dave's.Home cooked BBQ...Maybe I shouldn't be writing this tonight because I'm in not the best of moods & sick but some of my taste buds still work. We had some serious highs here & some serious lows.This is a little place and feels very cozy which I always appreciate. The art & signs on the walls are a great touch. The staff is very nice & and the prices are ok. The meat was great, nice pulled pork and chicken which come in the house BBQ sauce which is sweet with a little kick (this I enjoyed). The baby back ribs were very moist but they were really fatty and I am not a big fan of my meat surrounded by fat. This may sound bad but it's true. The sides we chose were onion rings (fantastic), Mac & cheese (bland :( ), sweet potato fries (awesome) and baked beans (bland). I'm always looking for some bacon, onions or sausage bits in baked beans. The sweet teas were the serious low tonight because it was like drinking straight sugar. We had to ask for some non sweet teas to find our balance. The highest point tonight was the incredible lemon cake. Very homemade and moist, sweet, tart with perfect frosting. The last bite was very memorable so I'm thrilled about that! Overall it was good and as mentioned we love home cooked meals and this felt like one. I'm sick today so my taste buds are off but I can still taste bold flavors. I forgot to mention the cornbread. It was dry :( Some tweaks and this place can have it all.
Olive & Ivy=Four stars for service rendered by Marketplace employee Rene, who helped answer questions regarding my food issues (allergies) and info regarding breakfast/brunch, lunch, and dinner options/times, and also provided gelato samples, including his favorite, Guiness gelato!  Mmm... guiness gelato...If you haven't already done so, do try the German chocolate cake, peanut butter cup, and, of course, the Guiness gelato flavors.  All gelatos are made in-house w/ all-natural ingredients, I'm told.  (I really need to double-check w/ the one who prepares them.)  3 scoops offer the best value ($4.50).  I also bought oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip  cookies ($1.50 each) from the bakery.  I'd skip on the oatmeal cookie as it didn't really taste like oatmeal at all, although the raisins were large and lent so much creamy sweetness to the cookie!  It did contain *, w/c I've an allergy to, so that may have turned me off of the cookie fast!  (1/22/09 update: I was so lethargic at work yesterday, and was literally tripping over my feet walking w/ people asking me if I'm alright all day, and I didn't know why.  I finally figured out why- it was my body's reaction to the * I'd consumed from the cookie!!  Geez!  Sometimes I really, really, really hate having these food allergies!)  OK, back to the review...The chocolate chip, however, was delightful!  Different kinds of chocolate chips in this one, and I loved both the gooey and crunchy textures this cookie provided. I got all excited when I read "cookie sandwich ($3)," on the menu, as I thought it meant an ice cream cookie sandwich, in w/c case the Guiness would've been perfect nestled in between two oatmeal cookies.  That is, before I found out that I didn't really care for the cookie, in w/c case, chocolate chip would be the best option, BUT "cookie sandwich" really denotes peanut butter slapped in between two cookies, and the marketplace was out of peanut butter at 4p, so no cookie sandwich for me.  No worries, since what I really wanted a gelato sandwich!  Ooh, boy, I was really jonesing for a Pot Belly ice cream sandwich then!!I'll definitely be back very soon to try other menu selections.  Patio dining sounds wonderful (I'm told there are couches out there!), but dining outside isn't really all that appealing to me since I do not enjoy breathing in tobacco smoke, and after seeing how dusty and insect-crusted the patio tables were on the marketplace side, I'd definitely be averse to the idea.Dined at Olive and Ivy last Friday night (very romantical date I might add). Our reservation was at 8:30pm, we arrived about 30 minutes early and they were able to seat us right away. It was cougar central in there so I held my date close because he's a few years my junior.... they were eying us like prize winning hogs, or a coupon for 1/2 price Restylane injections. It was insane. I mean people were noticeably discussing our arrival. These women were not even trying to hide the shit talking. So, mad props "geriatric mafia" at the bar. Don't hate!The wine alone is what warrants 3 stars. Two words: Arizona Stronghold. High five for the local support. As far as dinner goes, we ordered the Seared Scallops and Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin with side orders of Mascarpone Polenta and Roasted Mushrooms. My date and I happen to enjoy small plate dining and the server was nice enough to split everything up for us so we didn't have to feed each other. The food was...... get ready for it......... okay.Yes, just okay. The quality of the ingredients were phenomenal but flavor wise it just didn't deliver. Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything horrible to say but sorry, not having something bad to say just isn't good enough for a $170.00 dining experience. I will probably go back and give it another shot at some point. I'm really glad I went with my gut instinct and didn't order the Filet because I am a total fucking steak snob. I have a feeling this review would have read something completely different and dropped in rating. Maybe brunch?P.S. The chocolate martini was sex in a glass....... like actual sex..... in a glass. You figure it out.  :)I cannot believe I haven't reviewed Olive & Ivy yet... I've been numerous times for brunch, lunch, and dinner too!After True Food Kitchen, Olive & Ivy is my next favorite Sam Fox concept... they offer something for everyone no matter what time of day you stop by.  Grab a coffee, breakfast, or snack anytime from the marketplace or sit down to a more leisurely meal on the restaurant side.  They offer a delicious complimentary focaccia with pesto sauce during lunch and dinner... and I've had their Mediterranean greek salad with shrimp on multiple occasions for lunch.  I've also enjoyed a fantastic omelette at Sunday brunch - (yes - they will do egg whites) and fresh fish for dinner if I recall correctly too.  In addition, O&I offers a delicious flatbread selection (great for sharing) as well as a fantastic wine list.Olive & Ivy seems to always have some kind of crowd, so depending on the size of your group, you may want to call ahead.Tammar P and I had no problem getting a table when we met for a late lunch today.  We both went with the Greek salad (she with chicken and me with shrimp) and devoured it.  We declined the focaccia and dessert, so it was the perfect healthy yet filling lunch. I was glad we were on the same page with that!Estelle was our server and she was fabulous... she informed us that we ordered correctly today because during the month of April, when you purchase a Mediterranean Salad, O&I will donate 50% of the purchase to Waste Not (which delivers more than 5,000 lbs of food daily to a diverse group of agencies that feed the hungry, including schools, daycare centers, after-school programs, senior care facilities, transition homes and rehabilitation centers).  Sure makes me feel better about spending $20 per person on lunch!I'm sure I'll continue to rely on Olive & Ivy for many a fabulous meal ahead!Time for an update only because I was invited to a dinner party last night at O&I that was absolutely perfect!  We sat in their beautiful private room, and it almost felt like we were at someone's house in their dining room.  Joel was our waiter and took fantastic care of our group.  As usual the food was delicious!  Last night I had the scallop entree (with bacon, salsify & yellow corn purée) and a side of spinach.  Jared had the salmon (with roasted beets, fingerling potatoes & horseradish vinaigrette).  We were pleased with both, as well as the bread and pesto, antipasti plate, and hummus starters.I enjoyed a glass of Gewürztraminer while a variety of libations went down easy around the table as well including mojitos and beer.  After dinner, we moved the party outside and thankfully, the misters on the patio made this crazy AZ heat bearable!The evening flew by (a reflection of the fine group of peeps I was with), and as midnight approached, I noticed the bar and most of the restaurant were empty... the DJ was packing up and our party moved on as well.  In usual Gabi manner, I headed home to get some beauty sleep.Thanks again, O&I, for another wonderful meal!8/18Came to try Olive & Ivy's happy hour, w/ 50% apps and salads and select wines by the glass.  Didn't know which wine I wanted to have and had to ask if I could sample a few before ordering a glass.  Many servers in other restaurants and wine bars automatically offer samples before you buy, but not here.  Leaves a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended!) when I have to ask.  Settled on a Columbia Valley Riesling, $8, but $4 during HH.  ($8 bottles sold at Costco.) For apps, I had the Chopped Mediterranean salad (orig. $9) and the Antipasti of Prosciutto di Parma (orig. $14- prices on website aren't current).  The chopped salad was fantastic- loved the couscous and feta cheese!  For me, this was a meal by itself.  Had I known beforehand- I placed the two orders at the same time- how satisfied I'd be w/ this and my glass of wine, I'd not have ordered the antipasti platter, which, frankly, I didn't favor too much.  The platter consisted of Prosciutto di Parma, chorizo (Spanish sausage), two cheeses (a blue cheese from Rogue Creamery and a goat cheese, Midnight Moon), two kinds of olives, almonds, and house-made grissini (breadsticks; Whole Foods sells a few tasty varieties).  Of this platter items, I only liked the goat cheese.  (Whole Foods sells Midnight Moon!)  The blue cheese was VERY salty, and so were the chorizo pieces.  (I only like the cured meats pan-fried, when the excess fat can be drained off, and the meats acquire the crispiness I crave.)Should you want to try the antipasti platter yourself, be aware that Olive & Ivy's daily selections vary, and you may not have any say on which two you'll get.  I think it's great to stumble onto a great new cheese, but perhaps those with allergies, say penicillin, may not want to try a new blue cheese (as some blue cheese varieties are fermented with penicillin bacteria)...  It would be great if Olive & Ivy would give customers a chance to either "roll the dice" and not know beforehand, or offer them a chance to choose from a limited selection.While my buddy Mike Z. was in town, we hit a few high spots...by which I could mean that we were high when we hit them...so munchies:)But, no...my drug of choice is KetelOne or Bunnahabhain these days:)One of the high spots was the fabulous Scottsdale Waterfront and Olive and Ivy:)Of all the things that you can say about the Scottsdale Waterfront the most accurate is that it is, indeed, on the water:)I grew up in the northwest and then lived in San Francisco for many years...I've dined overlooking the Mighty Columbia, the Mighty Pacific, The Mighty Willamette.While traveling, I've managed to sup while overlooking the Mighty North Sea, the Mighty Atlantic and the Mighty Mississippi.I'm probably not a good one to ask about the waterfront appeal of the Mighty Arizona Canal:)Never the less, Olive and Ivy is a nice enough place:)It's another Fox Concept (don't you just love the branding and labeling of these kinds of things:)I suppose it would just be too darn simple to just say "Hey, look!...Sam Fox just opened a new place!:)...Yay!"...or something like that...no, it's a "concept"...and if you know me at all (and most of you don't) you know that restaurant nomenclature is nearly a complete mystery to me.Fox Concept is no exception (oh, I get the "Olive and Ivy"...it's sort of Mediterranean, with a what...California overbite?:)...is that a concept?I any event, The Beautiful Carin, Mike and I strolled over for cocktails and dinner, stayed for desert, sat out on the patio (which is very pleasant, BTW:)And we enjoyed ourselves!Well, why not...it was an enjoyable evening...pleasant atmosphere... the service was very good (I sometimes wonder if my reputation as a stupid good tipper is being spread around town...I seem to get great service even in places that don't really have a reputation for good service...I don't know...maybe it's just a coincidence:)At any rate...the concept was hoppin'!:-)Ton's of terrific people watching...people dining, people strolling along the Mighty Arizona Canal, people doing the hook up dance in the bar...dinner and a show...what a concept! :-)We each had a couple of marti's (oh, the joys of being able to walk to dinner!:)We started with a hummus something appetizer and antipasti...The Beautiful Carin and I split a perfectly serviceable Caesar salad and I had a nice risotto, while Carin ordered her standby...roasted chicken (I wish I could remember what Mikey ordered, but I was too busy with my marti's, chit chat and what not:)After dinner, desert seemed like a reasonable idea:)Mike and I each had a Porto, while we all shared something chocolate and another something kind of cinnamon and orange...It was all pretty good, not the best risotto, but good...actually, not the best anything, but still good...all pretty well executed (if not truly inspired)If Fox's Concept is separating me from my money on a fairly regular basis, then I guess it's a successful concept:)Like Minneapolis & St. Paul. Like Cagney & Lacey. Like Nip & Tuck. Olive & Ivy is beautiful and near some water, entertaining and lesbian friendly and full of people who've had plastic surgery. Great space. Fabulous patio. I know. I know. The canal. Ugh. Love it? Hate it? Hey, it's there people. Embrace it! Like the Brady's did cousin Oliver.  And embrace the Eggs Benedict, Egg Sandwich, Focacciao bread with pesto and CENTER CUT CINNAMON ROLLS! You heard me people! Center cut. No non glazed, hardened, corner piece. Service was outstanding. I noticed the patio filled up just after we arrived. Isn't that weird? Does that ever happen to you? You arrive somewhere. Nothing. Soon the place is buzzing and so are you? Anyway. I digress. We were thirsty fashionistas recovering after a night at Scottsdale Fashion Week...i.e. we were pickled and thirsty. Ice tea and water was a flowin' the entire meal. They saw it in our blood shot eyes I'm sure. Eggs Benedict was perfection and had a delightful surprise of basil on top! Rickie LOVED his egg sandwich with avocado...looked great...though he never offered me any...Hmmm..Olive & Ivy. Like Ebony & Ivory. Living together in perfect harmony. Side by side....ok ok ok you get the picture.I'm sad to say that my very first meal in Arizona was a bit of a letdown. Admittedly, the setting is pretty scenic, but I kind of felt like I was in a suburban "upscale" mall restaurant that was trying to be more chic and happening than it could ever hope to be. I went with a Cobb Salad, which should have been a simple choice but the leaves seemed a bit wilted and the entire serving just a tad bland, even after a hefty dosing of pepper on my part. Still, service was relatively fast and friendly, so if I worked nearby, I can see how this could be an alright spot to keep on one's lunch circuit. No doubt about it, the best thing going here is the waterfront.A stylish and delicious option for lunch! We were lucky enough to be able to take advantage of their patio, complete with a little fountain, on a beautiful sunny day, and the yummy food and lovely service added up to a great experience. At first glance this place strikes me as a bit corporate, but at the end of it I felt that they really provided a unique experience. Two highlights of the meal: the delicious pesto that comes out with their free foccacia bread, which must have a wheel of parmesan in each bowl, because it's so rich and wonderful. I also adored the asparagus, mushroom and white truffle oil flatbread, which I shared with the table and immediately wished I had gotten just for myself. I also had the chopped chicken salad, which I found to be disappointing. First of all, there was WAY too much dressing on it, so everything felt drenched and a little wilted. Also, I was initially really curious about the granola that comes in it but I actually didn't feel that it added very much to the flavor and found myself picking around it. I'd definitely suggest this place to anyone who wants some pretty classic salads, sandwiches and flatbreads with a little fancied-up twist!12/2/102.5 stars.Took my young cousin w/ me for happy hour and sat at the bar; This was her first time at O&I.  While I really like the look and the feel of the island layout of O&I's bar, I always feel like a fish out of water when I sit there.  (I've actually tried sitting there a few times when I've walked in solo, but always ended up moving to a table.  If it weren't for my cousin at my side, I probably would've moved to a table again, or, worse yet, walked out of the resto, which I've done before, too.)  Despite a few attempts at getting her to try a cocktail, she declined, and thus I proceeded to just order a glass of wine.  Why it's so hard to get a sampling of a couple of wines before settling on one to order here, I'll never know.  (Just a few nights ago, while at Beckett's Table, my server offered to have me try sips of the two wines I was having trouble choosing!)  Tsk, tsk, tsk!We decided to try the Italian Sausage flatbread and the hummus app.  The flatbread, w/ its tasty and spicy Italian sausage chunks, consisted of a crispy crust w/ vibrant red piquillo peppers and creamy goat cheese-- I'd order this again, even though peppers and I don't exactly get along.  The hummus was equally delightful, w/ house-made pita bread and a "petite Greek salad," which actually consisted of only sliced red grape tomatoes and chopped cucumbers (a no-no for me!) and a ton of feta on top.  Why the salad was piled ON TOP of the hummus, and not on the side, I don't know.  I suppose for the price of the app, I shouldn't expect more veggies used (a bit of lettuce, perhaps?), but it would've been nice to be able to pick the cukes out.  Served as it was, on top of the hummus, which looked like it was baked for a few minutes before getting the salad treatment, spooning the cukes off would've entailed major loss of delicious baked hummus goodness.  And we wouldn't have any of that!I really wished we could've stayed past 6p to check out the celebrity guest bartender, but we had other appointments to keep.  My cousin really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here, and I'd have given this review another 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that our bartender gave us such an attitude when I asked to sample the two wines first before ordering.  FYI, the happy hour menu changed, drastically reduced to only maybe 8 items or less, down from practically all of the apps and half of the flatbreads and a couple of salads that the old HH menu contained.  Recalling this, plus the wine and salad/hummus incidents, I may just have to say goodbye to O&I for a long, long time...Recently had lunch with friends here and ordered a Margherita Flatbread, $12.  The flatbread is really a Pizza....I don't know why restaurants name Pizza different things, just call it what it is!Anyway, the Pizza was very good.  It had a nice Garlicky kick to it and the Sauce was very light.....delish!I had an Iced Tea to wash it down and it was very refreshing....I must have drank 5 or 6 glasses.  The service was great too, nice place to grab some lunch.Return Factor - 90%I'm adding one more update to my review. As I've mentioned before, the Mediterranean Chicken Salad is my favorite salad on the menu but while dining with my Mom I learned a helpful tip that makes the salad even better. Yes it is possible to make it better! Instead of having the salad with the cold chicken, ask them to substitute it with the hot grilled chicken sliced on top. It changes the salad completely and makes it an even better meal!Dreading the long week and need a quick fix before the weekend hits?! Head down over to this behemoth of upscale delight that serves up a tasty Mediterranean menu that will keep your wallet and plastic cards happy .  If you are savvy with the Fox Concept brand, then you know exactly what I'm talking about--another masterpiece done up  by the creators of True Food Kitchen and Modern Steak.+ Happy Hour+ 4-6PM+ Lounge, the Main Bar, Patio (w/ Mist)If you roll up with a clan of say 6-8, try to grab lounge seating which is located in the Bar area, especially in the Summer! the Main Bar is swanky  and spacious.  Once fall hits, the Patio might be the most ideal to enjoy some nice weather.Ohh k, Let's talk food and drinks! the real reason why we even bother, right?+ Sangria: $5, white (lychee, blood orange, peach), red (blackberry, rasberry, strawberry, tempranillo) - decided this be my favorite one of the two, you can get a small sampling before you try, both are not too sweet just right, unfortunately no hard fruits in them but still satisfying+ Flatbreads: $8, there's 5 to choose from, I personally enjoyed the prosciutto crudo (crispy potato, asparagus & fried egg) and piccante (italian sausage & spicy salami), love EGG on my pizzas! spread it over like jelly on a toast!+ Bacon Wrapped Dates: italian sausage & piquillo pepper, you get the sweet and savory, wasn't as crispy but still pleasingI know some in the group ordered some Bruschetta but I did not get to try.  So can't comment much.What could I say about service? Attentive, friendly and eye candy.  Just saying, from the host to the bartenders to the servers.If you were not wow'd by the ultra posh dining and bar area, the bathroom will.  Might be the most stylized toilette I've ever tainted! Let's just say the bathroom stalls have wooden doors!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=IfEvXEYxoJJt5rg7h92FegWith little room to complain, Olive and Ivy sounds to me like a winner, winner chicken dinner to help you get through your slacker ways week! ;-pI can't rave enough about Olive & Ivy. At the recommendation from my broker, my mother and I went out to celebrate my move to Scottsdale. We walked up and were in awe of the high ceilings, the open floor plan, marketplace area, and really modern decor. We had made a reservation and headed out to the patio. The patio is sectioned off in to two sections: one as more of a lounge with big chairs and couches, while the other is more dining-appropriate. As we were seated the overhead lightbulb strands lit up along the waterfront, I was in absolute heaven. If I had been nervous about my move, this little setting put me completely at ease.      Our waiter (which I shall call the Lord of all Waiters) came to bring us water and ask if we wanted anything to drink, we had both decided on Sangria, and he encouraged us to get a pitcher--I always enjoy an enabler. While he brought back our pitcher and delicious, but not Too sweet Sangria, we ordered the Artichoke heart appetizer. He even had this split for us so we didn't have to portion the starter ourselves. The hand grated Parmesan, Artichoke hearts and arugula were outstanding. Both my mother and I had already started commenting on the greatness of the flavor combinations.       The Lord of Waiters stopped by frequently, asking about my trip, checking on our waters, refilling our Sangria as it got low, talking about Downtown Scottsdale....he really knew how to make us feel special. He then brought us house-made pesto and bread; I could've eaten the pesto as a meal in and of itself it was so fresh.        Finally, our entrees came out. My mother got the Sweet Potato Cannelloni while I opted to try the Sea Bass. As I ate my snow peas, sea bass and grapefruit combo in absolute contentment, I caught myself humming along to The Notorious B.I.G. this is when the greatest waiter of all time told us they have a DJ every night that spins great mixes (which I can attest to, I was constantly saying "I love this song!")     To top off our extravagant meal, we had a scoop of Vanilla Bean gelato to split. The Vanilla Bean was upfront, not overpowering but just right. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect meal (or waiter). I can't wait to start getting visitors so I can take them here and show this place off!We stopped in for lunch and I have to say...seriously impressed!  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table but I'm glad the wait didn't deter us from eating here. We just took a short stroll along the water area and by the time we came back, our table was ready. I LOVED the ambiance of this restaurant.  Very rustic decor, open kitchen, large dining and bar area and near the entrance; a section with bench seating with low coffee tables where patrons seemed to be enjoying cocktails and appetizers. I later discovered this was part of the bar. Very chic.  Even with high ceilings and openness of this restaurant, it was still very welcoming.  We were seated near the entrance to the outdoor patio so while we didn't sit outdoors, we felt like we were dining el fresco. This time of the year in Scottsdale is wonderful so we could not be any happier with where we were seated. I ordered a Bloody Mary extra spicy and a margherita pizza (err flatbread) for lunch. The cocktail was made PERFECTLY and had a nice little kick to it...just how I like it.  The margherita pizza was absolutely delicious as well. The crust was thin, light and had great flavor and the toppings just made it that much more irresistible.  I didn't think I would be able to finish the entire pizza but I somehow did. I just could not stop myself, it was that tasty.After complimenting our waitress (which I forgot her name (sorry!) on how great the service and food was, we discovered this is owned by the same company that manages True Food Kitchen, one of our favorite restaurants. We would come back here in a heartbeat....but since this is in Scottsdale and not in San Diego, it will be tough to get back here when we're craving you. So, can you please open an Olive & Ivy out here?Olive & Ivy sounds cool because in SD we have "Juniper & Ivy^ and it's a super cool spot, so we were hoping Olive & Ivy was super cool too... turned out the name wasn't lying!We couldn't decide were to go for brunch so I yelped "bloody mary" and O&I came up so being alcoholics we needed our morning fix...well by the time we woke up and came here it was noon. We were able to make resos through opentable and got seated really quickly. Upon being seated we were greeted by our server and ordered drinks- Bloody Mary & Gin Greyhound. Bloody Mary- good mix to it, it wasn't watery. Garnish was a bit bare, but my second one they stepped up the garnish game (olives, lemon & celery). I love BMs were  you can get a lot of garnishes. My friend hates gin, but he said that was one of the best grey hounds! You can't even taste the gin. They were pretty generous on the alcohol portion as we left with a great buzz. Now on to the food! The house bread that came with pesto dipping sauce made it all better. I love bread with good dipping sauce. Plus one for that! I couldn't decide if I wanted breakfast or lunch as now it's noonish and it's already really hot in Scottsdale. So my friend and I decided to order lunch portions and split it. We got the prosciutto flatbread and the lamb gyro. I'm glad we got both because O&I is mediterranean and it didn't disappoint. The highlight was the prosciutto crudo flatbread with an egg on top. They also had basil and rosemary potatoes on the flatbread. It was soo good and portions were generous. We were able to take half the flatbread back and ate it a few hours later and it still tasted good!*Side note: One of the bartenders looked like Manny Pacquiao,,,and we came on the fight weekend. We really wanted to go up to him and say "hey you're going to be late for your fight" but I'm sure he gets shit from everybody that weekend.
La Salsa Cantina=Out celebrating our friends 1 year wedding anniversary, I wanted a margarita. After checking out a few places we settled on this place. We stood forever at the hostess stand waiting to be seated. Finally a girl came over and took us to a table and gave us menus. Priced at $12.50 (regularly priced $17.50 when not on special) I ordered a strawberry "Margarita-by-the-Yard" and I couldn't taste any alcohol at all. Our friends couldn't taste any in theirs either, so we asked our server when she finally came back around if we could buy some shots to add to it. She said they are $1 per shot so I ordered 2 shots to add to mine. The margarita seemed like it was mostly ice and I just didn't care for it.I figured with salsa being in the name of this place that we would get the standard complimentary chips and salsa, but nope! Chips and salsa cost here! I decided to just order a "Mexican Pizza" priced at $7.95 to munch on. It was a flour tortilla that had a crunch to it with pinto beans, cheese, salsa and sour cream. The beans weren't very warm and tasted bland. Honestly the fresh avocado was the only good part about it. Maybe if their margaritas actually gave people a buzz the food would taste better! Our server wasn't great about checking on us and slow with bringing out our drinks and food. She carded us when we ordered the drinks, but then carded our friend 2 more times and he didn't even order but one drink that he was already carded for. She seemed a bit spacey. I didn't mind the prices at all, but wasn't satisfied with my drink, food or the service we recieved. I canThese guys have the best $4.95 breakfast around, I ate here every morning. Two eggs to order, choice of meat, kick ass hash brown and they even throw in a couple flour tortillas.
Marilyn's Cafe=You can't beat the $3.99 steak and eggs after midnight, but I like going in the morning M-F btw 6-11am for their $6.99 steak and eggs special with pancakes because the service during those times are awesome!  I can't remember her name, but our server was one the best servers I've ever had...and I'm not just saying that because she was cute.  The party in my table came one after another so we all ordered separately.  Our server didn't mind at all coming a multitude of times to take orders and run the food.  She was the best!  The other servers during that time slot rock also.  As for the food, surprisingly the cut of the steak isn't that bad.  I only had to slice off a bit of fat strip on the end, but after that the steak was pretty good.  On the down side, this cafe doesn't have A1 steak sauce.  They have Lea & Perrins which is sweeter, kinda ketchupie, but it isn't A1.  Pancakes were delicious and plentiful.  So plentiful I shared half my stack with my little niece.  Can't wait to come back in Christmas time to take advantage of their $3.99 steak and eggs!Just terrible, even for a 24 hour cafe.  I came here because, well, just LOOK at these other reviews.  This place looks great, right?  Fellow yelpers, how could you fail me so miserably?!I made a special trip.  Not there to gamble, just to have breakfast.  I've had better food at nursing homes.The eggs Benedict was unrecognizable as such.  Is that megaplex nacho cheese?   I didn't even want to try it because it looked so hideous.  Like congealed latex.And the eggs were not even remotely poached.  More like hard boiled into some thing beyond a solid.  As in, like maybe something one would find on the surface Jupiter.  And the grits?  Well, I guess I should know better than to order grits in Las Vegas, but   these were somehow both watery and grainy at the same time.  I kept looking for the hidden camera, because surely I was being punked.Top it off with a bloody mary that was basically clamato juice and (a half shot?) vodka with a touch of tabasco.  ie. about the most uninspired version of a bloody mary I've ever had the displeasure of drinking.  I rarely send back food and then not give them the opportunity to try again.  But this place was clearly beyond all redemption.Another one of Vegas' hidden gems. This one is off the Strip inside the Tuscany Suites and Casino on East Flamingo Rd. It's just located around the corner from Ellis Island Hotel & Casino, another gem of a place for good and bargain eats. Marilyn's Cafe is open for 24 hours and they have a daily special from 4PM - 10PM ranging in price from $7.99 to $18.99. Check out their menu here: http://www.tuscanylv.com/d/tuscany/media/PDF/marilyn_menu/marilynmenu.pdfHowever...there's another special menu from midnight to 5AM. Yes, the special and staple that's ubiquitous of Vegas - The Steak & Eggs. How much? $4.99That's more than a bargain; that's a Willie Mays steal of 2nd base without a throw from the Catcher kind of steal. You get an 8 oz. of juicy, delicious steak and eggs cooked to order. These steaks ain't the cheap kind they serve in Reno for the same price. It's a good-sized piece of steak that's tender, meaty and flavorful. Don't expect a cheap steak for a cheap price, but it was pretty decent quality for the right price. They also have an All-You-Can-Eat pancake for $3.99 for their midnight special. I'd have to say that's a lot of carbs for me, but it's there should you get the munchies. And I have to add that service was impeccable. I forgot our server's name, but he was a nice gentleman that was well seasoned. By that I mean experience and class. Servers from other fine-dining establishments could learn a thing or two from him. He made us feel at home, comfortable and relaxed. So the next time your in Vegas and hungry and starvin' like a broke-ass college student, don't run to the border or any closest fast food joint on every corner. Get some quality instead and your stomach and wallet will thank me for it.While some Vegas hotel-casinos are known for their grandiose buffets, others are more known for their cheap, late-night steak & eggs specials. Marilyn's is an unassuming diner found within the Tuscany casino. Open 24 hours a day, this special only runs midnight to 6:00 am and is off menu. Looking back at reviews from a few years ago, the price of the steak & eggs special has been steadily increasing by about a dollar a year. It was $3.99 back in 2011-12, $4.99 in 2013, and now currently $5.99. Still, it's a cheap deal for a 6 oz. NY strip (see what they did there?), 2 eggs any style, hash browns, and toast (wheat, rye, or sourdough). Don't expect too much because the steak isn't like Lawry's across the street, but it'll do for late-night eats. The best tip I can offer is to order the steak one level rarer than what you usually get. I once received a well-done steak after ordering a medium-rare. My rare order last night came out a decent medium-rare.$5.99 steak and egg special!  We came here because it was cheaper than at Ellis Island haha (only by $1 though).  It was pretty great to finally try a midnight/late night steak and egg meal, and we are happy we came to this restaurant.The meal came with steak, eggs, hash browns, and buttery toast, with plenty of jam to go with it :D  It was definitely a great meal and a great deal!
JJ's Boulangerie=Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2015 #10 - #365If you're looking to have a taste of tacky Vegas themed restaurant then JJ's is your best bet to have some Parisian eats.  Around breakfast time, the lines can be long but moves quickly. It's right across from the Le Village Buffet and offers fake outdoor patio seating. My favorite food to order besides the fruity danish and fruity desserts is the smoked salmon baguette. Having had the smoked salmon baguette just wants to wisp you away to Paris France. I wish other resorts like Treasure Island, Mirage, Luxor and Excalibur can follow what Paris still holds to its theme. I'm talking about restaurants that fit in with the hotel theme. But anyways, JJ's will always be my go to Parisian eatery at the Paris Hotel. I would like to also add that I am a huge fan of their fruit tarts, French eclairs and decadent chocolates.Stopped in for a quick lunch I chose the 8" Italian Sub toasted, the bread was incredibly fresh, crusty with just the perfect amount of chewiness. The toppings were absolutely fresh and the lady working the counter on the bakery side made one of the best subs I've had in a long time, I was only able to consume half of this hearty sandwich but struggled to leave the other half but hey I'm in Vegas and I'm not taking a doggie bag, unfortunately I should of but didn't wrap it up and offer it to one of the many homeless or panhandlers on the strip. My associate tried the pizza and said it was just alright I guess it's all about making the right choices, even the restaurants in Vegas is a gamble sometimes...
Six Penn Kitchen=HOLD UP, WAIT A MINUTE....I promise I won't start rapping, but seriously peeps, I haven't reviewed this place?!  I feel like I'm doing myself and you all a disservice!It makes me very sad that this is only a 3 star place at the moment because I really truly love it!  Maybe it's the connection with my favorite Smiley Guy (Mr. Eat n' Park himself) or maybe it's the FABUlous brunch on Sundays, but I love it!Of course, you can't come to this place without ordering the Buffalo Chicken (or Lobster) Mac n' Cheese (unless you're there for brunch....ok...do it for brunch too!).  It's a plate of oohey gooey goodness touched by God himself I think!  I've had a couple other items worth mentioning, like the noodle salad and lamb chops.  But the Mac n' Cheese....blows it all away.Let's move on to my fav topic...BRUNCH!!  Probably at the top of my brunch list in the city.  Sometimes I purposely have to make myself stay away.  Why you ask?  Because I always want to head right in and order the Cheesecake Stuffed French Toast!  It's always topped with a seasonal fruit or sauce (like apples or gingerbread).  I've also had the Eggs Beni, which are fab in their own right, with fresh asparagus to top it off!  They have a really fantastic rooftop deck that I just visited for the first time.  My first thought is to think....how many people can fit up here...because it would be a great place for a party or event.  But it was a bit tinier than I thought it would be.  Great place to be downtown on a warm summer night though!  But the best part of this place...they always have, out of this world, freshly baked bread!  I've had a different bread for dinner and different scones and breads for brunch and they have NEVER disappointed.  This is thee best touch by far!  If they ever forget to bring it to you, REMIND THEM!!  Believe me, I have, no shame in that game!Service was excellent.  Waitress was top notch.  Able to answer questions.   Folded our napkins when someone went to see some friends or the bathroom.   Another helped with the great wine list.  Hard to get service like this.  The place was full, so surprised how excellent the service was. The caesar salad was one of the best I have had with fresh parmesan, anchovies fresh romaine.  The crab cakes were cooked perfectly and very tasty with a pistachio and apricot crumb.First off, let me say this.  I knew that this restaurant was owned by the same hospitality group that owns Eat-N-Park, but who knew that it would be such a departure?I come here mostly for lunch with my co-workers.  To be completely honest, I love this restaurant but I wouldn't make a special trip "dahntahn" for dinner because of the limited menu.  (My family and friends are generally picky eaters) However, what they prepare, they prepare well and I enjoy the food as well as the decor.Love, love, love their French Onion soup and Sweet Tea Smoked Wings!  I have had just those two items as a meal. (Melted cheese, bread and fat.  Not the most nutritious, but you only live once!)  I'm a wing and French Onion soup freak!You can't go wrong with the flat iron steak (Griglia) or the Crab & Zucchini cake.  If you're in the mood for a sammich, that Cracklin Shank Cuban or SPK Cheesesteak will make you hurt somebody trying to get to either one!Like I said, not a lot of choices like the traditional Eat-N-Park menu, but the food quality and ambience of the restaurant far exceeds the parent restaurant's usual fare.
Ohana Hawaiian BBQ=yeah, . . . no.I've grown to expect a certain level of awesome when it comes to Hawaiian eats in Vegas, which shouldn't really be too unheard of, especially when considering how many folks from Hawaii actually reside here(Vegas is officially Hawaii's ninth island for goodness sake).And don't get me wrong, Vegas does have some amazing Hawaiian eateries.Ohana just doesn't happen to be one of them.Was it because it is a chain place?No, for whatever reason, I'm a little more forgiving about that kinda stuff out here.*Not to say Vegas lacks originality or anything but this town is home to a mini Statue of Liberty, Tour Eiffel, and one pyramid of Giza (complete with Sphinx).What was really disappointing (besides the food obviously) is the fact it is regarded so highly on Yelp and received some really super positive reviews.Chicken katsu, pork lau lau, bbq chicken, and garlic shrimp.  meh, okay, meh, and meh.Oh well, I guess you can't always have a winning hand.Aloha Ohana.
Captain Bill's=Yep, I signed up for Yelp specifically to review this place...My wife and I have 4 daughters, and we rarely get a chance to get out of the house. We called all over to reserve a table for restaurants participating in "Restaurant Week", and none of them were available for our time slot besides Captain Bill's. So we went, and it was easily the worst dining experience we've ever had in Madison, and we've both lived here for 20+ years...She went for the steak ordered medium rare, and it came to her completely raw on the inside. Trust me, I'm a cook, and I know the difference. This is NOT just an uninformed consumer who has no idea. I got a lobster tail that came with no butter, and tasted like the outside of crab shells smell. The best part of the meal was the clam chowder, which came in a coffee cup. The service was very unattentive and slow, even though it wasn't even busy. While I went to the rest room, my wife informed me that one of the young servers came out, put a plate down for a woman, then licked some food off his hand on the way back to the kitchen. I'm not being a jerk here, but this was bad. Especially for the restaurant week prices which was $25 per person and I'm very sure we would have been better off going anywhere else on the list. What I've heard from other people since I've told them about our experience is that "the fish frys are good".I'll never know.The Wife and I went to Captain Bill's with friends in late August. We had heard that the food would not impress us, but that the view of the lake would be worth trying the place. WRONG.Let me start with the view. The little bit of the lake that we could see was, well, pretty lame. It definitely was not an impressive view, so that reason for going was no longer valid.The food. Oh, the food. It was, quite literally, the worst food that The Wife and I have had in years. I ordered the shrimp scampi (since it's a seafood restaurant), only to be told that the pasta would count as one of my sides. WHAT? Shrimp scampi ALWAYS comes on pasta, but Captain Bill's nickle and dimed me on the pasta? Lame. Oh, and the pasta was so completely undercooked that I ended up only having 2 small bites before pushing it away in disgust. I mean, it wasn't even close to being cooked as much as "al dente."The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.We will never go back to Captain Bills, and I do not recommend that you do, either.
Stoudemire's Downtown=Very very poor management. We were there last year for the Suns playoff game and wait in line for a seat like the other 25 people. Some Yanni looking dousche and his fake as hell trailer trash barbie wanna be walked in asked for the manager, proceeded to yank his jock and get a table in less then 1 min. I walked right over to the same manager while he was schmoozing the Dousches and asked why they were so special. (nothing like bursting the ego of a semi-famous dousche) The manager was so embarrassed he escorted me off the floor and proceeded to tell me "they spend so much money here every year that they deserve preferred treatment" I walked out and told every other person who was waiting what had happened and out of 25 people at least 18 went somewhere else. I sure hope the VIP was worth the $500 they lost out on when we all walked. Not to mention the bad press and no repeat business.Save your money and eat a hot dog while watching the game.
Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill=This was a fantastic dinner we had at this rest. that we stumbeled into  as we exited Ka Show at MGM! It was about 9 PM and we just walked in! Got seated in about 10 min ( no reservation) I had pork chop (xlnt) my husband had some kind of a steak ( he loved it ) we split a salad ( very good ) They even had Stella on tap !!! Service was efficient, pleasant and professional.Speciality cheeze cake for desert was awesome!Can't wait 2 go back!Las Vegas.  There are definitely a lot of notable food places in Las Vegas, but there are just as many bad ones and many of them (good or bad) are overpriced.  At the end of the day, I just want to go somewhere that has good service and serves okay food (that is reasonably priced and hasn't been sitting around for too long).  I think Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill fits the bill (at least at lunchtime).I had already had one lunch, but I was meeting up with friends and, well, the restaurant is not a park bench so I felt obligated to order something.  I went with the heirloom tomato salad that came with mozzarella, micro greens, pesto, basil aioli, red onion, and a vinaigrette.  The salad was very fresh.  I've had better mozzarella, but the plump heirloom tomatoes were good.  The salad may have been slightly over-garnished and it was a little too tart and powerful due to the vinaigrette and some very strong red onions.Service was very good.  The waiter was friendly, polite and attentive.  He also seemed very apt at judging the pace of the crowd, which is definitely a strong asset in Vegas since some groups want to get-it-and-go while other groups like to stay for a while and decompress.The space was fine (contemporary and not cluttered).  It felt like a fresh and clean cafe.  It was open to the casino (actually located in the center of the MGM Grand casino floor).  The casino was not that busy, but I wonder how nice it would be to eat at this place when the casino is busy because I imagine that the smoking nearby would be a problem (kind of like restaurants in some states that have non-smoking and smoking sections right next to each other).The portions were big enough.  In other cities, the prices would be a little high for the food being served.  But for Vegas, the prices seemed reasonable.I would say that Wolfgang Puck would top a lot of the generic 24-hour Vegas Strip casino cafes.  Wolfgang Puck is slightly more expensive than those at lunchtime, but they have enough variety on their menu where you can order some less expensive things if you are trying to keep to a tighter budget.  Because of that, Wolfgang Puck is an okay Las Vegas lunch option if you are looking for fresh and decent food (and not simply something to hold you over until your next meal).Wolfgang Puck was our first stop after arriving in Las Vegas. Hungry and tired from the long flight (just kidding it was only an hour) we needed to have lunch and a drink. We had our 21-year-old Grandaughter with us, and found it just weird to hear her order a drink- She was a baby just yesterday. She got carded and took great joy in showing her ID. The bartender spotted it immediately. He surprised her later with a fabulous dessert.I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, and I must say, they were right up there with some of the best. Mr. H enjoyed a scrupulous pulled pork sandwich. Our girl ordered a Pizza. It's true that the old Wolfgang knows his pizza. If this franchise were in Oakland I would start eating pizza.  Now, for baby girls dessert. On a very large plate, a slice of banana cream pie was placed next to a halved Bruleed banana. I believe that was the best banana I ever tasted. I mean really...who brulees a banana. "Nothing says dessert like a propane torch".Yes there was even a dollop of whipped cream. AND, on the plate, in chocolate, was a hand written Birthday wish. What a fabulous way to arrive in Las Vegas.Our experience was so great that we decided at that moment to have our Thanksgiving dinner there. It too was amazing. Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill is located in the MGM Grand. I Highly recommend it. It's not to fancy and not to casual. Great food and great service***Not as expensive or overpriced as the many celebrity chef restaurants in Las Vegas (though still pricey), Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is a decent spot that serves satisfying (though not great) food***Despite the many well-known restaurants (especially those backed by celebrity chefs) in Las Vegas, there are not many that are open for lunch.  That is what makes Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, which is located on the casino floor of the MGM hotel, so convenient.  I believe it is open all day and Wolfgang Puck utilizes better ingredients than a lot of its daytime sit-down competition.Despite its convenience, Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is just an okay restaurant (not a great one).  Most of the dishes are fine and taste good, but I have yet to have something here (in my 3 visits) that felt noticeably better than the food other good Vegas restaurants put out.Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill sits smack down in the middle of the casino.  It is pretty open to the casino with no big walls.  Maybe it was where we sat or that the casino was not that busy, but the smoke-filled casino did not feel that obtrusive here.  The decor has the look of a bright cafe with light yellow and golden brown colors and nice but casual tables and chairs.We started with the truffled (strong truffle flavor) potato chips, which were topped with a chunky and rich Maytag blue cheese sauce.  The housemade chips were flavorful and seasoned right but unevenly crisp--some were crisp and some were soft (some chips were made even softer / soggier due to the heavy coating of blue cheese).  Overall, it was an okay starter though you may want to steer clear if you are not a fan of blue cheese.We also shared the Chinois Chicken Salad, which was tossed with candied peanuts, crisp wontons and a Chinese mustard vinaigrette.  Overall, it was a flavorful and fresh salad with a good balance of ingredients, but it was not as good as the original Chinois Chicken Salad from Chinois on Main in Santa Monica.  The reason was that the salad was over dressed.  It kind of lost its crispness and it was overdressed in the vinaigrette (too soggy).For my entree, I had the BLT, which included maple glazed pork belly, arugula, vine ripe tomatoes, and avocado on buttered sourdough toast.  The pork belly was sweet and flavorful.  I thought it was going to be braised and soft (and then crispy on the outside); however, the pork belly here lacked that tender texture.  Instead, the pork belly's texture was more dense like thick bacon or lean spare ribs.  It was still good, but I would have preferred a thicker piece of braised (tender) pork belly over the spare rib-like texture here.The lettuce, tomato and avocado were all fine.  Like the potato chips, the sandwich was heavily dressed.  I was not a big fan of the sourdough.  The bread was okay, but it was over-buttered and slightly greasy.  The BLT came with a side of cold vegetable pasta salad, which was a standard cold pasta salad.I tried my friend's kabocha pumpkin tortellini with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts and parmesan.  I had a very similar pumpkin tortellini dish at Drago Ristorante in Santa Monica.  The pasta dish at Wolfgang Puck was flavorful and pretty good (probably the best thing we had here).  That being said, I liked Drago's version better because it was lighter, had a more subtle flavor and was less complicated.Service was very good.  The waiter Jeremy was a very nice guy.  He was pleasant and friendly as well as enthusiastic and passionate about the food.  Food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.Prices for lunch were okay.  There were several options here that were around $20 or less.  You would pay about the same at some of the Las Vegas cafes, but I imagine you are more likely to walk away satisfied if you spent your money here.Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill has convenient hours and puts out tasty (though not remarkable) food.  I've been here a few times and the restaurant has shown a lot of consistency in delivering (at the very least) decent food.  That is what makes Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill a decent and safe option for lunch in Las Vegas.  The MGM Grand hotel provides complimentary parking (both valet and self-parking via a parking structure).Sweet baby Jehovah. $7 to throw grilled chicken in a $14 salad? If I'd known I would've smuggled some of the stuff in my carry-on bag. I cut through the breast very carefully so as to not damage the freshwater pearl that must have been in there. I never found it.That was my first night in Vegas. It was a wake-up reminder that I wasn't in Austin anymore. But Wolfgang's is the only sit-down place open after 10:30pm in the MGM. This means 2 subsequent visits, each more stellar than the first. Both exercised my economic know-how.Visit 2: mussels with frittes. Yummmm. Huge serving, enough to share. But saying the word "share" is saying "charge me an extra $4.50 because I don't know what else to do with that money." Dumb. As the words were coming out of the boy's mouth, I knew we were toast. .. toast wedges came with the mussels... Hold on while I yummmm again.Visit 3: we were golden. Linguine with clams for him, spinach side for me. Also known as: we SHARE both of those, in fact combining them for a delicious dish. They should include spinach in the linguine by default; it's all too pale otherwise. At $6 a spinach side, it was a way better deal than getting charged for sharing. And that's how you work the system, kids. Don't let them take you down. You wont win Vegas - you wont take my house, my money or my honey from under me. I'm from Jersey.I came here Sunday August 4th for dinner.  I had the lasagna, 2 friends had the pizza and 2 others in my group did not eat.  It was an average meal.  Fast forward to 10 hours later, early Monday morning, I woke up to a churning stomach, went to the restroom where I proceeded to spew out red tomato sauce from BOTH ends.  It was a terrible morning.  Both of my friends who had pizza woke up and had considerable GI discomfort all morning.  They weren't as bad as me, but they were not enjoying life.  Essentially, our Monday drive home was miserable.  The two who did not eat were fine.  I called the restaurant Wednesday evening, after I felt better to let them know I had possibly gotten food poisoning from their restaurant.  The manager immediately doubted me -- blaming the sickness on too much drinking (absurd).   I had maybe 5 beers the entirety of Sunday.  So unless a server shoved a bottle up where the sun doesn't shine before serving me, I have a hard time blaming it on the beer.  Not to mention, I'm in my 30's...I went to college...I am fairly familiar with alcohol sickness and hangovers.  This was not that.I explained to the manager that there were 5 of us and we all ate at the same places all weekend, except for Sunday night, when only 3 of us ate...the same 3 that got sick.      The manager proceeded to proclaim that you get food poisoning 72 hours after ingestion.  I had to look that up...it's not true.  Why he would lie?  I have no idea.  He just really didn't seem to even being open to the notion that his restaurant got me sick.Regardless, I didn't call asking for anything...I only called to inform them of the events and how my friends and I narrowed it down to their establishment.  The manager asked for my contact info and told me their general manager would get back to me in 24 hours.  It has been 5 days.  Not expecting that phone call...and I'm not expecting to ever eat at a Wolfgang Puke establishment again.I went here with the family for dinner.  The first thin you might notice is that you're somewhat exposed to the public so it can get pretty loud - not a first date place if you want something more intimate and if talking/listening to your date is on your agenda.  We got truffled potato chips, mussels, salmon, bass, beignets and banoffee.Truffled Potato Chips:Homemade potato chips with blue cheese sauce drizzled with truffle oil, Served hot and crispy. I'm not a fan of blue cheese but I liked this because of the truffle oil. 5/5Steamed Black Mussels:Comes with grilled sourdough, chorizo, white wine, garlic and smoked paprika Bernaise. Very interesting twist to a boring bivalve. 4/5Barbecued Pacific Salmon:Served with caramelized white corn, peas, baby heirloom tomatoes,arugula and crispy onion rings on top. I don't like peas so I was busy sorting my peas from my corn.  The crispy onions saved the dish. 3/5Bass: Comes with baby artichokes, white beans in tomato-olive vinaigrette and Romesco sauce. This was more interesting than the salmon. 4/5Chocolate Beignets:Dusted with powdered sugar and omes with a caramel dipping sauce and vanilla ice cream. They look like chocolate cake doughnut holes but they're less dense. 3/5Banoffee:It has the consistency of a cheesecake. Not too sweet. I was very intrigued by this as I've always wanted to try banoffee pie. This is my first taste of it and I was not impressed. I'm hoping this is not the best version of said pie because if this is it then, forget it! 3/5During my last trip to Vegas on biz back on April I arrived after midnight and checked into the MGM Grand. After I dropped off my luggage in the room I ran down to play some blackjack for an hour or so. At that point I was ravenous and needed a bite to eat. This casino is huge but many spots to eat at were already closed for the night. I wandered over to Wolfgang Puck and it was still open. Open until 6 am so its a life saver when drunk and hangry! Pretty decent cheeseburger here. Big and filling. Fries are shoestring style and just ok. A few craft beers on tap about six or so such as Full Sail Amber.Plenty of seating surrounding the floor, and a nice bar area I sat at. The bartender on duty that night was attentive enough and got me my food and drink pretty quickly. Overall, no real complaints here, but a bit on the pricey side. It is in a casino after all. Not a bad spot to grab a meal, especially in the middle of the night when on a gambling bender.One of my favorites at the MGM Vegas.Usually come here with a big group of 12+ and the service is always impeccable and the food is always on point.  Last time I was there I tried:-Heirloom Tomato Salad - awesome (not much of a salad eater, but enjoyed this one) -Spicy Tuna Tartar - fresh and clean flavors-Calamari - a great choice as usual.  -Linguini with garlic, chili, and Grilled Shrimp - my favorite!  I get this every time.Also, their desserts are so delish!  I usually don't venture out of the chocolate zone, but I've experimented here, and my tummy has always been happy with my choices;  Beignets, Vanilla Crème Brule, and Apricot Crumble, all have been fantastico! A bit on the pricey side, but which nice restaurant isn't in Vegas.  At least you wont be disappointed by the food here.Slacking on these reviews,, but trying to get back into it :D. Decided to come here because we were staying at MGM and didn't want to go through the hassle of going to another hotel and rushing back to get ready to go out. I made the reservation day of at around 3 pm for 14 people and told them that we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday and they were able to accommodate.When we got to the restaurant, we were led to this little room near the wine rack. It was nice because there was a sliding door that separated us from everybody else, so we kind of got a private room. When we sat down and looked at the menu, it had "Happy Birthday Eric!" on the top. I was so surprised! 5 Stars for printing out new menus just for us :) Service was amazing. Always checked up on us and everybody who served us was very professional and friendly. The menu is not too extensive, but there was a good variety of food. I ordered the ribeye and the fried calamari. The fried calamari was light and delicious, but I've never had bad fried calamari. The ribeye was very good. Cooked perfectly medium rare. Came with potatoes and some veggies. The glaze was a little on the sweet side, but not too overbearing. I was also able to try the chicken breast and let me tell you, it was the juiciest chicken I have ever had. Probably would get this the next time we come here. The food did take a little while to come out, but I think it was cause they wanted to serve us all at the same time. All in all, food was good, service was amazing, and boy did they make us feel special. Last but not least, we had a party of 14 and they didn't even charge the 18% gratuity!! Our waiter told us that he was leaving it up to us, but of course we gave the 18% for the wonderful service we received. TAKEAWAYS: + service!!!We arrived at the MGM Grand late after a long travel day, we decided to eat here based on a few things, as I stated it was late, I didn't really feel like going outside the hotel and didn't really want to extend the day by a few more hours eating at one of the more exclusive restaurants inside the hotel. I've eaten at several of Wolfgang's Restaurants around the country and I rate them all the same "predictable" don't confuse this with anything negative these restaurants are just a safe choice but not outstanding for the prices in my opinion.We were very happy to see although they were quite busy we were seated immediately, after a few minutes our server arrived he was friendly enough and explained the specials and quickly got our drink ordersTHEN THE WAIT BEGAN!It was apparent that the kitchen was backed up for this hour of the evening but then again it's Vegas, our server did make it back to our table periodically to assure us our food would arrive at some point, then he returned and told us the burger I ordered was very popular and the grill could only accommodate just so many, then he returned  to tell us that no matter how long it takes the chef ( I was thinking short order cook) never rushed any orders to ensure each burger was handcrafted and magnificent. At this point I really didn't care and wish I had made a run to In N Out.After more than 45 minute from placing our order the kitchen delivered our meal the $17 burger was beautiful but slightly well done so I was slightly disappointed since I ordered it medium rare but it appeared to be "well crafted" I guess, this 1/2 pound of ground prime beef topped with fresh crisp lettuce, ripe tomatoes, pickles, onions and spicy mayo all stacked on a fresh pretzel bun had the making of something special but it was a little over-cooked. The server offered to fix it but it was much to late even though he said it would take only a few minutes I wondered how could this be the burger in front of me took almost an hour. The fries that accompanied the burger were delicious and served hot. Would I try them again I don't know there of lots of restaurants in Vegas so the three star are really related to the service mainly the kitchen service maybe it was a bad night at Pucks.Walked in on a late 1am Friday morning.  Basically hungry from our flight and just wanted to that White Castle craving to go away.  Luckily, there were plenty of tables open, so we were seated right away without reservation.  The dining area was set up nicely and clean.  Appearance was colorful,  modern, and quite unique.  We were served by Albert, and he was attentive from beginning to end.  Only that's about it.So, we started with the Truffled Potato Chips ($11) with a blue cheese sauce.  These were superb, but not anything to rave about.  I mean, I love truffle and I love blue cheese, but it couldn't keep my mind off those belly bombers.  I guess the chips and sauce really brought out the saltiness.  Meh, I knew I wanted the tuna tartare instead, oh well.  Now the Ceasar Salad ($13) was a winner, well kind of.  Fresh baby romaine leaves with the Ceasar salad dressing.  Though it tasted great, only I personally thought it was small for the price.  The croutons were big and tasteless as well.  Then there was the Half Jidori Chicken ($28) with vegtables, a potato puree, topped with rosemary au jus, and a side of kale salad.  Now, for $28 this better be the best chicken ever.  It was excellent, but not the best ever!  Full of flavor, but you had to mix it all together to drown the over-saltiness.  Because of these dishes, we ordered their cheapest bottle of white wine, the Nuschese Pinot Grigio ($32).  A suitable choice especially for the chicken and salad.  A surprisingly enjoyable wine.  Thanks again to Albert's recommendation, it made for a good compliment;  And we just killed that bottle!So, overall, I've gone to several Wolfgang Puck locations and this just confirms I'm not a fan of his style.  After spending a total of $103 for two people, I simply feel this place is overrated and overpriced.  This place already put me in the hole!We were a party of 14 that arrived without a reservation on a Monday night. They put us in a private room in the back which was absolutely perfect.  Right off the top, the kids menu was outstanding. It was reasonably priced ($6/entree) and all of the children were excited about the offerings (pizza, pasta, chicken etc).  Every single adult LOVED their meal.  I had a huge salad with fresh roasted chicken and a bowl of chicken noodle soup.  It was absolutely yummy!! The pasta dishes around me were equally as good (piggie me sampled most of them). And most importantly, the service was great. Let's face it, we weren't an easy group and they handled us wonderfully.  This is a solid choice for families or adults smack dab in the middle of the MGM casino  You did good, Wolfgang--our most memorable night out of a 7-night stay. Thank you!I didn't expect the restaurant to be smack dab in the MGM casino floor, but it was. You'd assume that the smell of smoke would overpower any glorious smell that came out of the Wolfgang kitchen, but to my surprise, I didn't smell any cigarette smoke at all.Came here with a MyVegas voucher, which was super easy to use (basically call the MyVegas number and they input it in the system, no need to tell your server about it). Ahi tuna tartare was really good. The black sea same wonton skins gave the dish a nice crunch and complimented the tartare. I'd order this again.The ricotta gnocchi was decent, as well as the linguine with clams. I did get a couple minor sandy clams which was a bit bummer. Some clams were also cooked perfectly, whereas others were pretty chewy. These dishes weren't bad, but I'd explore the menu a bit next time.The chocolate soufflé was to die for. Seriously heavenly and I'm not a huge chocolate fan. The lady at the table next to us was just staring at it and then finally asked if it was good. DUH! Definite recommendation.Our server was nice and staff were attentive. Great experience.Wolfgang Puck doesn't disappoint! And you can have access to his deliciousness up until 6 AM. Open all night long!It's past midnight and there's still a 30-minute wait, so we walk around to kill time. By the time we're seated, we're excited to see whether the hype is true. And it's definitely worth it for good food at this hour. So...what to order?FOOD:---------We started with the **Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers**, which was much larger than one would expect for an appetizer. 5 divine skewers! The meat was so tender it melted in my mouth, and the savory flavors burst forth. What a pleasant surprise! I'm a total carnivore, but the **Vegetable Pizza** really hit the spot. You can't go wrong with oven roasted tomatoes, basil pesto, mozzarella, and Nicoise olives. Sometimes pesto is a nice change.And finally, there's no way we could resist the **Three Cheese "Mac 'n Cheese" **. I thought the price was a little high at $12, but when that sucker showed itself I understood everything. Even the meaning of life. We were again pleasantly surprised by a fairly-sized portion that helped induce food comas all around.Although prices are higher than the super casual cafe around the corner, the quality of food at this hour is really quite impressive.SERVICE/AMBIANCE:---------------------------Crowd is mixed; you'll see people of all ages here. Most are stopping by after a long night in either casual or fancy attire, depending where they came from or where they're headed. So you'll see business suits, skimpy club attire, grungy gym clothes, and even hipsters. You should never be surprised in Vegas.My only issue is with the service. The hosts were polite, but our server took forever to take our order. We must have waited 15-20 minutes in our seats before ordering, and this is after we had already waited 30 minutes outside. He provided great recommendations and our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but he NEVER came back to check on us. When we wanted to pay our bill he was socializing with one of the other servers, so I had to go ask him for it. I'm sure the other staff there are not as negligent as he is. At least I hope not!TIP: Overall this place is great for late night and I definitely recommend it when you're staying at the MGM Grand.DATE TIP: Ohhh yeah, open til 6 AM. Perfect for your Vegas late night date night schedule!
Spotted Donkey Cantina, el Pedregal=Tortilla crusted, hand stuffed cheddar and bacon filled jalapeno shots dipped in a cilantro buttermilk sauce. Enough said. Picture this. Fried jalapenos sitting in a shot glass of buttermilk sauce. You take it out of the shot glass and bite into a fried jalapeno of gooey cheese that's oozing out. Along with the cheese, you taste bacon and southwest flavor. It's so good, you must have another and another and another...until all six have disappeared and you wish you had six more. This was my most recent experience at Spotted Donkey. They are called "Shooters" and you can order six or 12. After tasting them, I highly suggest going with the order of 12, that is, if you're hungry for fried happiness! This still stands as one of my most favorite restaurants in the Carefree area. I've been visiting since I was a teenager and it still has yet to disappoint. Everything here is delicious, especially the southwestern mac and cheese and the stuffed chile peppers. Really, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.Seafood enchiladas in North Scottsdale? Say yes and don't look back! The Enchilada de Mariscos here is comprised of seared shrimp, blue crab, cheddar and monterey jack cheeses, rice and orange pico. And, it's 100% delicious. Be sure to order the guacamole appetizer too. The chips are addicting. Maybe the reason why the location is so far from town is so that you have time to digest on the car ride home. With the 2014 Opentable Diner's Choice award, you can't go wrong.
Bison Witches Bar & Deli=Crap.Crap crap.Crap.Is that not sufficient?  Do you need more than that?  Okay: go there and order a reuben, and see what happens.  First, they'll ask you what type of bread you want.  On my reuben?  I'll take rye, because if it isn't rye then it's not a reuben.  Thank you.Then they will include lunch meat-style corned beef, which just pisses me off.  Because it doesn't taste delicious, it tastes like what you get from a cafeteria.  And then they have thick ass bread, which, in my opinion, is what you put on a sandwich when you don't want people to realize that what's in between the slices of bread sucks ass.Or, the nachos.  They use movie theater cheese (which is a one-star bonus for me, only reason they have 2 stars) but the chili is totally tasteless.  I don't get how people can cook something like chili and send it out to the world when it tastes like nothing.  Not bad, not good, just *nothing.*  Here's a tip: find something that tastes and heave it into the pot.  Just a thought.I hate myself for being convinced to go here over slices.  Because the place sucked a fat one.
Nove Italiano=Last weekend Rose took me to "Nove"  for Valentine's Day.  I know,  I'm a very lucky guy!! ;-)  I'm not really one for super trendy places that are over hyped and under deliver,  so I was a bit skeptical about eating at the Palms. But I have to say "Nove"  knocked one out of the park. We had a tremendous 5 star experience.  The food was incredible and the service was flawless.  A  few of the dishes were just outstanding.  We highly recommend the shrimp covered  with a lemon cream sauce, the grilled baby octopus, the seafood spaghetti and the chicken marsala.  Bottom line...Fantastic food with even better company. It doesn't get too much better.  Prego!I'm generally not a fan of shelling out for expensive Italian restaurants but this isn't your typical place.  It's certainly a 5 star experience if you combine the great view of the strip, service, atmosphere and the walk up to Moon and the Playboy Club afterwards.I've been able to sample a few of the dishes here and have enjoyed all of them.  The standout appetizers would be the baby octopus, raviolo and calamari.  I had the Sunday Gravy pasta the last time which included braciole, sausage, meatballs and pork gravy.  Heart attack on a plate!  It felt so wrong yet sooooo right.  The Nove spaghetti, pansotti (short ribs, brown butter, hazelnuts, spinach) and veal Nove were also very memorable from past visits.  The dessert menu is decent if you actually have room for it.  This would be a great place to take some first timers visiting LV since you could cover a lot they would want to see in one evening.  Just make sure to have dinner a bit later than usual so you can enjoy the festivities upstairs when you're full as a bull.It was Restaurant Week, and after tasting an inventive pasta dish that had a lasting impression on me, and meeting Chef de Cucina Geno Bernardo, at Dish 2011, I was at last dining in the flesh at Nove with Diane.  As soon as I left the elevator at the top of the Palms Playboy Tower, and saw the sleek furniture and breathtaking view of the Las Vegas valley from the wall to ceiling glass panes, I instantly knew that I liked this place.  Hard driving music with a nice modern vibe added to the upscale ambiance.  After various bread products, olive oil, salt, red spice, and requested butter were set before us, we were surprised by a generous assortment of amuse bouche prepared by Chef Bernardo.  Some vegetables and pesto were spread on toast tips, and two cute bent silver spoons had been loaded with heaping spoonfuls of a textured concoction that tasted like smashed pea beans and was cool to the tongue.    A platter of Salumi with savory housemade salami, ham, and great Ricotta Cheese was next, along with very tender Federal Hill Calamari (both rings and tentacles) enhanced by a very lemony Lemon Aioli made per our request.  Ravioli Risotto Bianco with pine nuts and fresh pesto was excellent, and so was a hot and meaty Ragu Bolognese with Rigatoni.Likable Chicken Parmiggiano--more tomatoey than cheesy--harbored a nice surprise: eggplant framing the dish around the edges.  Veal Scaloppini was fine, thinly pounded veal.  A rich side of Death by Potatoes with Marscarpone and Parmesan Cheese tasted like mashed potatoes with pancetta.  It was hot and very cheesy.For dessert, I enjoyed a great luscious Marscarpone Cheesecake with Raspberry Sauce, and Diane savored a very good homemade Tiramisu.  In the midst of our meal, an interesting diversion occurred.  The entire men's basketball team for St. Mary's College strode in and filed past me, to take their seats at a very long dining table overlooking the valley far below, for a scheduled team dinner.  They were in town for the Mountain West Conference's Basketball Championships held at the Thomas & Mack Center.Nove was very accommodating in both the front of the house and in the kitchen.  Our table was held for us after we were stuck behind a car wreck and a two-lane closure on I-15, and arrived 27 minutes after Diane reported the problem via cell phone.  And, besides specially preparing an aioli for us, the kitchen staff kept peppers out of the calamari, and removed chives from Death by Potatoes, also at our request.  Other than having to ask for Iced Tea twice before a glass of the tan beverage arrived, service was excellent.  Even Iced Tea refills came out flying for the duration of our meal, without request.Two unusual events occurred when I paid the bill.  I dropped down a "You've Been Yelped!" card with my cash payment, and the server picked it up, examined the card, and asked quizzically, "What is this?"  I explained that I was going to review the restaurant on Yelp.com, and in fact had already decided that I was going to award five stars out of five.  He then asked if we wanted to meet the chef.  Since Diane had never before met Chef Bernardo, I said, "Yes, if he is available.  But I have already decided to award the restaurant the highest rating."  I wanted to be clear that my review was already decided based on my dining experience and could not be influenced.  Our server told me to wait a minute while he checked, and a few moments later returned and directed Diane and me to follow him.  He led us right into the kitchen.  As soon as the doors closed, about ten smiling white-clad chefs and assistants facing us started clapping and catcalling to acknowledge our presence and give us a friendly greeting.  Then Chef Bernardo came over, and we shook hands.  As the kitchen staff went back to turning out a long procession of orders, Diane and I were given a full tour of the kitchen and even admitted to a refrigerated room.  Before we left we saw a door signed by Hollywood and Las Vegas celebrities.    But we were not through with surprises!  As soon as we left the kitchen, I was asked, "How would you like to see the Playboy Club?"  As a key holder in the late '60s, I said, "Sure!" and after a comp pass was filled out and handed to me, Diane and I were escorted to a private escalator that led to the Playboy Club one floor up.  There we had another nice view of the city, stayed for a short while amid cottontailed Playboy Bunnies and other patrons, and then descended the tower via elevator and soon returned to normal life.How often do you get to be a pastry chef for awhile at a nice restaurant? Well I was one tonight.   More on that later.We always overlook going to Nove because of its out of the way location so it was on our must try list and was it a good decision.We were brought iced teas quickly and they were refilled often during the night.  Then came bread service.  It was three kinds--cheese bread sticks, focaccia, and Italian bread.  We also got a dish with three potential bread toppings and for use during the meal--one container with olive oil, one with red pepper flakes, and one with grated cheese.One of the runners brought us an amuse-bouche--two small bruschetta with freshly chopped tomatoes.  A nice palate awakener for what was to come.For a starter, we order their salumi plate.  Our server, Alex, assured us it could be shared by two people.  The menu said that it was a selection of cured meats and red pizza.  Well, that sounded fine.  What came was almost a meal in itself.  Four kinds of cured meat, parmigiano cheese, and some fresh ricotta.  That wooden server was placed in front of us and then they placed a wood plate with red pizza.  Wow!  So much!  Cured meat platter:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#rfBs4_87H9DVi5r3o0E_9ARed Pizza:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#a_Kw4-9-qjX9ROujm1IhHgWe also had another three compartment dish with mustard, olives, and pickled vegetables.  This was really starting to add up in the stomach and we hadn't gotten to the main course.  Everything was excellent.  We had to let two small pieces of pizza go back with the dishes.For the main course, my wife got the Veal Nove which the menu describes as thinly sliced Scaloppine, Prosciutto, Arugula, and Lemon.  I tried a small piece and it was very, very good.  I ordered a special--lobster ravioli with a seafood sauce similar to lobster bisque.  It was superb!  There was a small amount of veal leftover and Alex and his crew quickly boxed it for bringing home.Now comes my pastry chef experience.  One of their desserts is Make Your Own Cannoli.  You get 5 small sized shells, a small, plastic pastry bag filled with the luscious cream that goes inside the cannoli, and a dish with nine compartments for dipping the ends of the cannoli.  The compartments had raspberry sauce, chocolate syrup, chocolate chips, coconut, butterscotch, toffee, pistachio, and chopped peanuts.  If you're counting and only got 8, it's because two of the wells had raspberry syrup.  Tubes and pastry bag:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#sq32kg1eMJezCQzW7W2dTgDipping dish:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#uKRzAlaK3OKmX0AXS_L4cALike my Yelp friends who work at Jean Philippe at Aria, I wielded that pastry bag like a surgeon uses his scalpel.  In no time whatsoever, I had completed my first cannoli with one side dipped in raspberry.Success:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#YFbqugc1i6Yt0wd4ibBihwMy wife, who hasn't been a fan of cannoli before tonight, ate three of them which left me with just two and I did all the work myself.  That's gratitude I'll tell you.  That dessert was fun and it's a clever menu item!Service was excellent!  Alex and crew were always there to help, removed dirty plates, chat a bit, and do everything as well as they could which was very good!The view, while not as good as Alizé, is not bad.  I had a view of the original Palms Tower and being a local, I was studying the streets to figure out where the things in the area I know were located.This was a very pleasant dinner!  I know I'll be back!  Oh, and I'll be calling Jean Philippe in the morning to check about pastry chef openings.It pains me to give Nove 2 stars. It use to be my go to for fancy Italian. My favorite place in Las Vegas. I would have given every experience before this one 5 stars. Now, I will never return. My first time here was for my boyfriends birthday a few years ago. Since then we had been back for a Chef's tasting with Chef Geno with 15 courses. A few of our favorite dishes included the risotto of the day, Nana's meatballs, chicken Marsala, and the death by potatoes. This was my first and only time dining here since the chef I had grown to love moved on to other ventures. I still had faith that Nove would be a great place without Chef Geno. The menu was almost the same. The crowd wasn't. The waiter even mentioned when we asked, that the new chef was "completely different". Not bad, just not the same. Well I think he was being polite. The exact same chicken Marsala dish looked the same but tasted totally different. The meatballs and potatoes were still decent. The gnocchi was too mushy. And the risotto, oh I wouldn't know as they offered it as the special, and then ran out. I waited 20 minutes and ate my entire appetizer before my drink arrived. And there was no new chef coming out to check on us, see how we liked the food, or introduce himself. This always happened in past times when Nove was not busy. Considering we were there late, and the Chef was in view- it could have happened. Maybe my expectations were set too high, but I have had totally different experiences in the past. All of them made me feel great about spending $150-300 for dinner for 2. Right now I am thankful I had a discount on my tickets from the Lisa Lampanelli show, because I would have been mad to pay full price last night. I really hope N9NE group and Nove figure out a way to put the pieces back together. Chef Geno, we miss you!!What a beautiful venue. I went here for my birthday dinner and it was incredible. We started at the bar and grabbed a couple drinks before getting to the table. We had to wait on a few more people to show up. We order some standard drinks to start the night. After waiting we were seating in a table with a view of the other tower. It was so beautiful. We had some cool big booty bushes. We started the meal with a champagne toast and then also order a bottle. They were clearing some inventory so we got a bottle for like $40. We started with the meatball appetizer and started to order our entrees. I started with a Caesar salad and also ordered the 8oz filet mignon. The Caesar salad came out with full romaine leafs which was different but cool. Everyone ordered something a little different. My coworker ordered the pennine alla vodka and it was yummy. I love vodka. I mean i love vodka sauces. :) During our meals we also ordered some drinks. There were jager shots, lemon drops, Moscow mules, and even the tiramisu cocktail. All the drinks were delicious and make to look exquisite. After some drink I was surprised by some yummy dessert. There was cheesecake and chocolates and just yumm in my mouth. I was really glad we got to enjoy Nove. The manager even stopped by the table and gave us his card. He was so nice and asked about the meal. It was a wonderful experience and I couldn't have ask for a better night.Find the hidden elevator entrance, shoot up to the 51st floor, step out and enjoy the view- floor to ceiling windows highlight a great nighttime view of the city, with the Strip to the far right. Walk into the dining room, and you're greeted by a sexy bar and a wall of candles, for a romantic ambiance perfect for date night.Came here for light bites at the bar- menu has a selection of 9 appetizers for $9, cocktails are $14. We ordered 5 apps and dessert, but left confident about returning for a full meal, particularly one with visiting guests who would appreciate the view.FILET SLIDER: Slider, singular, as in one, for $9. Very tasty with caramelized onions and bleu cheese, but definitely should come in a pair.CRAB AND LEMON BRUSCHETTA: Speaking of pairs, this dish came in an odd presentation with five tiny crostini. Considering most diners come in pairs, it would make more sense to make your apps more sharable. However, this was very tasty with a good amount of fresh crab and light citrus accents.FRIED ARTICHOKE: I did not care for this at all. The few fried chunks were served on a bed of shredded lettuce and accompanied by a "spicy" orange dipping sauce that didn't taste like much of anything. Pass.ARANCINI BALLS: Uh, hold the phone. These were delicious. Four plump balls with a thin crust of breading and a bit of sausage inside with the cheeses. This was a better version than the one I ordered at Giadas, that's for sure. ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS: Holy truffle oil, Batman. Generous portion of sprouts, properly roasted til crunchy outside but still tender. But drowning in truffle oil, and oddly interspersed with bits of blackened bacon? I don't know, it was easily the richest batch of Brussels sprouts I've ever had, but it somehow almost worked. Obviously steer clear if truffle oil is a turn off for you.STRAWBERRY CARPACCIO: Curious name, pretty presentation. Sliced strawberries drizzled with balsamic with a scoop of ice cream and a few sprinkles of granola? It's like a deconstructed parfait but with savory notes. I can't say I'd get it again necessarily, but it was a fun, fresh, and light end to our meal.Service was very attentive without being overbearing. The two bartenders who helped us were friendly, engaging, and humorous. I wouldn't come back for apps, but definitely plan to try their dinner menu. I did not like how the apps were served on one giant trough of a platter rather than on individual plates, which would have been classier and more appropriate for the location.
Philadelphia Sandwich Company=Hot. Cheesey. Fresh. No, I'm not talking about the guests at the opening gala to Phoenix fashion week. We're talking 'bout the cheesesteaks and chicken cheesesteaks we chowed down on after the event. I got  so hungry looking at those skinny models all night. I was this close to nibbling on one's boney thigh. The only thing better than eating these scrumptuous works of art, was having them delivered to the terrace at Hotel Indigo. Yes people. Delivered. Right to our drunken butts. On the terrace. At Hotel Indigo. And how fantastic it is that you choose Cheese Whiz, American or Provelone.? I'm all about the Whiz! How cool and funny and useful is that?During a night of Old Town drinking, a friend and I ducked out for a minute to grab something to eat around 1 AM.  I couldn't tell you where this place is or how I got there (aside from directing you to the map and address shown on the business page here), but coming here had to be destiny.  This sandwich made me complete.  I am afraid to try it sober, as my memories of this sandwich may be crushed.  I can only hope that the next time I am buzzed in Old Town, I can be directed to this establishment once again.I love PSC. Known colloquially as "SANDWHICH SHOP!!!" it's like an oasis in the drunken wasteland of 3 AM Old Town. PSC is open 24 hours, and any restaurant in Phoenix that is such gets an automatic 3 stars in my book, no matter how abysmal their service/food is.Luckily, the sandwiches here are great. And after a few dozen cocktails, they are absolute perfection. Not to say that this is purely "drunk food." It's probably not. I think PSC's food is legit, and I hope that they don't get pigeon-holed into that category, but I haven't ever really been here in the day so I'm not really sure how I would react to the place in the sunlight. But if you couldn't already tell from the previous reviews, this place gets rushed by the drunks when the surrounding bars close at 2. It can get PACKED in here. Claustrophobia-inducing, fire-code-violation packed in the insatiable lust for roast beef and provolone. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait, but biting into a piping hot, mastercrafted 9th Street (spinach, roasted peppers, and cheese) makes it all worth while. Yes it does. Highlight: PSC is the only place that provides an arena for the crowds of BS West, Saddle Ranch, and Axis/Radius to mingle together in intoxicated greasebomb love.Do you like people watching?  This is the absolute best spot to do it if- A. It's Friday or Saturday night B. Between 1am and 3am.You can't hide from the truth of the florescent lights.  Come see the hot mess you and your friends have made of yourselves after a night of fun.  It's okay, everyone else looks just as drunk and sweaty too.  The entertainment value of this place isn't the only reason I go.  I swear by the sobering effects of a chicken cheese steak hoagie with wiz, loud urban music, and the realization that you in fact are not as bad as the girl hunched over her sandwich desperately trying to find her mouth.  I love this place.  I wonder what it's like in the day time, but I don't want to ruin a good thing.Unreal experience... OK, it was after 2:30am, we are both hammered, we are both starving... we call a cab, cab stops right in front of The Philadelphia Sandwich Company on the way home, we stare, drool... look at the huge line and say "screw it"... (in harmony)Get home - several miles north... She takes the dog out for a pee... two folks come strolling by jabbering at high volume.... She askes them to quiet down jokingly, they apologise and give her an extra Philadelphia Sandwich Company Cheesesteak that they had just ordered and didn't need! Complete stangers gave her a PSC Cheesesteak right in front of our condo!!! (they were headed home to chow too).She walks in the door holding the cheesesteak and smiling - I crap my pants and realize that we should have went to the casino that night instead! What are the freaking odds of her walking out at just that moment??? And them having an "extra" sandwich????Mmmmmmm goooood sandwich - Saved me from a life threatening hangover too... WTF!!!Is there a better spot in Old Town for late night, drunk off your ass, gullet stuffing? I think not my friends! Any place where the serving staff can put up with the virtual bus load of people that come in here at 2am on a Friday or Saturday night, deserves 5 stars for that alone. Rae, who works behind the counter, is adorable and likes the witty banter. The sandwiches come out relatively quickly too. I always seem to fall back on the Bada Bing. Italian meats, lettuce, tomato, provolone, and balsamic. It's pretty close to perfect in my book. I hear the chicken cutlet is amazing as well. Sweet potato fries and fried macaroni and cheese should round out your ordering as well. The other perk is the people watching. You are sure to take home or be one of the stories of the night.Eating at places like this one confirms my suspicion that I'm spoiled living in San Francisco. Near where I live there is a place called Phat Philly that uses American Kobe beef and flies in Amoroso rolls for authenticity. Most of the other places in SF use Amoroso rolls as well. The bread they use at Philadelphia Sandwich Company comes nowhere close -- chewy, heavy and generally not good.The beef was whack. Again, way too chewy and not much flavor. There was no hot sauce to be found but I didn't ask for any. The fries were pretty bad and I threw most of them away. I feel a little guilty slamming this place so hard because the staffers were friendly but I call 'em like I see 'em.This is a great place to grab some food after a night out in Scottsdale! I was at an event at Martini Ranch last week, and some of my friends wanted to grab some food after. I still don't know the area that well, so I was happy when my friend Matt C exclaimed cheesesteak! when I asked where they wanted to go.I had a cheesesteak with american, onion, and the works. I was sober at that point, but I'd imagine if you're worried about an upset stomach you shouldn't get a sandwich with three different kinds of peppers on it. It was delicious, and I could only eat half.Service was quick and friendly, with the authentic touch of the guy in the kitchen yelling at people calling them jackasses. It's true the steak could be cut thinner, and the bread isn't the best, but this place fills the late night grub niche well.It was 10:30 pm on a Tue night and after a few drinks at a nearby bar, I was getting a little hungry....so I jumped on Yelp and looked for a nearby place to grab some grub.  I found this Sandwich shop and walked a couple of blocks to check it out.After looking at the menu for a minute, I decided that I wanted a Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich w/Whiz & Jalapenos.  After waiting a few minutes, they brought out my Sandwich.  The Sandwich had a ton of Whiz on it, which is great....but it was light on the Meat.  Usually, places put too much meat on their Steak Sandwiches...not here.  I know Jalapenos isn't part of a traditional Steak Sandwich....and my friends from Philly would've killed me for ordering it that way, but I couldn't help myself....I love to spice it up a bit!The Jalapenos were pretty spicy and added to the flavor in my opinion....good proportion of peppers.  The Steak was kind of bland and the bread was just ok.  I've had better Steak Sandwiches....but this did the job.Will I return?  Probably not.The time has come. I've been holding off on reviewing Philadelphia Sandwich Company for awhile, but it's my late night saving grace and deserves some yelp love. So here it goes. Dear Phildelphia Sandwich Company: My waistline hates you but my late night food cravings after let's say a Halloween block party at Gilligan's and limited hangover the next morning loves you. So therefore, waistline loses in this battle. Love Lindsey Here are some things that you should know about Philadelphia Sandwich Company1. 24 hours. This place is open 24 hours. Pretty spectacular for Scottsdale since I don't think many other food spots literally never close. Not that I can actually imagine eating a cheese steak at 6:30 AM but hey, you never know! 2. Be prepared for debauchery and a line if you go between the hours of 11 PM and 4 AM. Those coherent enough to remember it will have some top of the line people watching to amuse them and those in desperate need of food, Advil, water and sleep will be thanking this place in the morning. 3. The cheese steak sandwich itself is pretty darn tasty! Be warned that it's huge so I suggest sharing unless you've got the appetite. Another tip is to order turkey with cheese. That's pretty delish as well. Since I'm not from Philly nor can I accurately judge how a Philly cheese steak should taste, I will just say this. It hits the spot for a Nor Cal girl like me and while I've only ever eaten it late night (when will power runs away from me), I imagine this would be a tasty meal for anyone craving a little Philly love in their life. And before I go, part of me really wishes I knew about the yelper special (free fries with a sandwich) when I decided to have a little late night meal recently. Then again, I'm pretty sure the Philly Cheese steak was enough by itself.their quality suffers when the crowds come in at 1-2 a.m.\go in the afternoon for their $5.50--a good deal!new location 3 star quality food.
Takamatsu=I typed Japanese and my zip code in to Yelp and came up with Korean.  So off I went.I am pretty sure there are several menu options.  I had a lunch menu which had none of the grill options on it and I think there is yet another menu for the sushi bar.  Directly behind me I could hear a grill being used and saw a couple of carts of food go past me to the table.  Would have been nice to see how all the food was used but I probably would have watched closely enough to intrude on their meal.I ordered a sliced beef lunch box ($8.95) and an iced tea ($1.25).  First up was a cloudy bowl of soup with green onions in it, pretty tasty.  After a while lunch arrived in a compartmented  tray.  Front and center was the beef, several gristly pieces.  Off to the near left were some pickled veggies and in the far left were, I think, 3 slices of California roll, a piece of apple, some sort of deep fried thingy and some ginger?  In the far right was sticky rice and in the very center was some Wasabi.  And in the near right was I think a couple of different kinds of bean sprouts, some sort of green leafy veggie and some sort of cake thing.  Even though I couldn't identify most of it I ate it all.  Obviously it didn't taste bad or I would have ignored some of it.The service was ok but not friendly like it was with the regulars.  I would have liked to ask some questions about what was on my plate but got the Big Box store lack of eye contact with every employee that walked past.  Oddly, when they brought my entree they did not take away my empty soup bowl.  I noticed they did that at all of the tables, only busing once.It looks like the back section of the dining room could be partially closed off for a group.It was an ok experience.  I think I would rather go with somebody who knew the foods better.Yes very good and lots of great little side dishes to mix in with your entree.  Kim Chee tofu stands out. for me.  Might be a little pricy her but don't come here to save your money. Im new to Korean food but this place seems to make people happy, sorry for all those hater reviews when you this famous that seems to attract bad attitudes.Hmm, well i don't think its a sushi house but people keep on rating this place like that is their specialty.  I would focus the attention to the home cooked Korean food it has to offer.  And when I ask my Korean Friends they seem to prefer Takamatsu.  I liked Scotts W's  review, unbiased and funny
Chen & Wok=I ordered Chen and Wok for take out on Saturday. I must say it was pretty darn good! I will give it an a-ok for now even a 3.5, but will return to try more dishes. I'm sure it will creep to 4 stars.What I ordered: Sweet and Sour Chicken- slightly dissapointed because there wasn't a lot of sweet and sour sauce on the chicken chunks. But overall pretty tasty.Vegetable Egg Foo Yung- yummy! The sauce that it came in wasn't just a plain brown gravy, it was an actual sauce with ginger and other seasonings that took it out of the boring realm.House Lo-Mein- That was pretty good. The noodles were a little soggy but still flavorful.House Fried Rice- I would suggest getting any of the other fried rice that they offer. I was hoping for a good mix of all the meats but only ended up with 2 shrimp out of the entire carton. Other than that, the rice was good! I actually really liked it.Egg Rolls- I love a well seasoned egg roll. I only ate one, but wished I had ordered a lot more or didn't have to share my other one. Oh well.. For about 30 dollars, I was able to feed 3 people HUGE plates of food and still had leftovers. I think Chen and Wok will be my new Chinese Takeout from now on!I recently ate here again. The food was delivered prior to the promised LONG wait, and it was HOT and fresh. I have now become a devout fan of this little Chinese takeout place! My dinner guest was equally as impressed with all of the food. I will say that I thought that the sweet and sour was a little dry, but everything else was delicious. We were impressed that they didn't shirk on the shrimp and the shrimp were large and delicious! Is it gourmet and to be served on white linen? No. It's Chinese takeout that you eat in your sweats in front of the TV.  Just wanted to show Chen and Wok some love with another star!Too often my enthusiasm for Chinese food detracts from my ability to say anything meaningful about the establishment. I order, get food, eat food, rant and rave about food, find out that nobody shares my opinion of said food, rinse, repeat.With nearly identical menus and service, I was having a hard time finding something interesting, meaningful, and most importantly funny to say about any of these places. It was starting to cramp my style, and I feared that Chinese food would prove to be the knight that slayed the mighty Jetta Dragon. I bet you all pegged me as the unicorn type, huh.Chen and Wok broke what could have been an otherwise endlessly repeating cycle of pointless reviews by being popular with people I knew and giving me something to criticize them for; their service.First let me start off this review by laying down the obligatory (though not undeserved) lip service.The food is pretty fucking fantastic. Ever since my coworkers and I discovered their menu at the bottom of our "take out menu" drawer, we've been eating that shit like it's going out of style.Normally just the sight of steamed rice makes me flail my arms and scream in tongue, but after that spicy kung pao or house chicken hits me and my stomach balloons with burn and gas, I'm grateful that I'm not being tempted with a side of lo mein. I usually keep a shamrock mmmmmmilk nearby whenever I order anything denoted on the menu as "spicy". Once I experimented with chocolate milk. Turns out chocolate milk and kung pao sauce get along like leather daddies and mountainbike enthusiasts; amicable yet jarringly indifferent. Look up any takeout menu from any other Chinese place, pick five random items. C&W has it, and its fucking DELICIOUS. The food is so good that it warrants the often mindfuckingly tedious task of dealing with the staff. For now, at least.I admit off the bat that I have a skewed perspective. In my group of co-workers I am the official "C&W ambassador."I can tell the difference between chow mein and lo mein so apparently that qualifies me to be a fucking interpreter of the culture.One day not too long ago the IT department managed to pull ourselves away from Japanese Bug Fights and Star Wars done entirely in Terminal long enough to decide that we were hungry, we wanted Chinese, and that although Jetta was in no mood to be yelled at over the phone, she was a bitch and deserved it anyway.I called in the order and was greeted by my friend Asian Lady With The Inappropriately Loud Voice, who after rushing me through my order and snapping at me when I tried to explain (for the fifth time now) where our office was located, would interrupt my giving of the credit card number by reciting numbers that in no shape, way, or form resembled the ones I gave her. You know, to keep me on my toes.One of the people on my order really wanted chow mein with his orange chicken. Chinese restaurants' legendary personal grudge with special orders and substitutions aside, I thought that if we just asked for some on the side and not substituted for their flavorless white rice, maybe they would take advantage of the opportunity to provide something resembling customer service and make a few extra bucks.We all know how this ends, right?The lady argues with me for a while, and then she argues with Clarice for a while, and eventually we compromise; we have to buy A WHOLE ENTREE of chicken chow mein so our friend can eat the noodles. Needles to say my credit card company LOVES C&W.Perhaps to punish me for my insolence, C Dubs sends an obnoxious and easily confused driver in a bad "I'm going to community college to learn how to be a game show host" suit in lieu of our modest and very smiley normal delivery guy. The driver refuses to park in the parking lot and instead drives in circles around the parking lot waiting for me to meet him. After I spend 6 minutes on the phone just begging him to park and wait for me, I spend another 10 waiting for him to finish his victory laps.After botching my name once or twice (how do you get "Liberty" out of "Jetta"? They're not even made by the same manufacturer!), he hands me two plastic bags which he has TIED together (am I supposed to slump it over my shoulder hobo style?) and drives off. Once inside, I find my entree to be so spicy it makes my nose run and my rice to be even colder and more flavorless than usual. Hell hath no fury like a Chinese place inconvenienced.All in all, Chen and Wok is still the Peoria-area Chinese takeout for me. But believe me when I say I've never been so happy and excited to see the Goodcents girl walking towards our office.
Harley's Italian Bistro=I'd really like to like this place more than I do.  Central Phoenix noticeably lacks Italian restaurants (if you're not counting Oregano's and pizza places), and Harley's Italian Bistro is in a great gentrifying stretch of 7th Ave (Melrose on 7th) to really impress as a neighborhood Italian joint, but it falls a bit short.I made my second venture here the other night for dinner.  It was a last minute sort of thing, so we lucked out that we were able to get a table anywhere on a Friday night.  I had a hunch that Harley's might be somewhat busy, but not terribly busy to the point of long waits.  We strolled up to find about 13 of 20 or so tables occupied.  But even if it was too busy, it wouldn't have been awkward since we could have passed the time at the homey and spacious bar in the back.  Lot of different types of diners reflective of the area.  Mostly older married couples and tables of gay singles, and a young family or two with kids. The food was OK.  We ordered the fried calamari with marinara to start and it was uneventful and uneven -- some of it too chewy.  I ordered the salcicce al penne and my friend ordered the spaghetti with meatballs - oh yes.  He only got two meatballs, btw.  My dish was alright.  I felt the sauce could have been a bit more flavorful and spicy.  My first visit was with a large party of 10, and I ordered the crusted chicken romano sandwich - very good, but a tad on the greasy side. The server was OK.  Very friendly, but he felt new and seemed awkward at times.  He forgot the parmesan cheese when he brought out our entrees and was diffcult to flag down to ask for the cheese.  So we sat there and stared at our food before we were able to dig in. I'll go back.  But if another Italian restaurant opens nearby, Harley's will have a run for their money.FYI, It's been open for about two years now , and was known as The Roman Table for many years before that.I've been here 2 times, once alone, and once on a boyfriend-totally-messed-up-so-ordering-the-most-expensive-dish-on-the-menu-is-a-must, and I didn't like anything either time. The food was mostly bland and average, and I commented on the tomato sauce having come straight out of the Sysco can and onto my pasta. The service was sluggish, and dare I say I felt the server was hating on us for being straight? This is probably the most off-putting part of our whole experience (this also has happened countless times at Fez, but I digress). Seriously. I think the decor's trying a little too hard to be something it most obviously is not (they should actually stick to being a neighborhood Italian joint, instead of the cheeseball fake plants and Italian "stuff" everywhere), but the oil and herbs combo at the beginning is a welcome touch and probably the only reason I'm going with 2 stars instead of 1.Doubtful I'll be back here alone or with boyfriend.Thank you Amy D. for reccomending Harley's so highly. The girl and I stepped out last night to get out of the house and have a bite and accidently drove by and decided to give it a try.We got Amy's favorite server Justin, who was awesome! (mind you I think knowing Amy D. gor us the VIP treatment) Friendly and attentive and great with advice on what to order. We started with some appetizer that I wish I could remember the name of. It was mozzeralla between white bread, which was then breaded and fired...essentially a breaded grilled cheese sandwhich with marinara over top. Oh my god it was amazing! We each ordered the Pollo Marsala, though I was worried as I am picky about my marsalla and am almost always disapointed when I order it. It was sweeter than I expected, which was incredibly OK. It was so wonderful I wish I had leftovers for lunch today but my willpower was weak and I ate it all including the fetuccini alfredo on the side which was equally flavorful and delish!All of the sauces were far from bland and far from generic. Justin informed us that they don't make the sauces in huge batches but fresh and to order. The prices are incredibly fair and left money in the account to give the generous tip that Justin deserved. We will be back much more often than we should I am sure. Justin also reccomended the desserts but there was simply no room in the tummy last night.I love, love love Harley's.  It was one of the first places I discovered when I moved here, and it remains a favorite.Things that I have had and loved:Fried calamariFried zucchini blossoms (they don't always have these)The calamari pasta dishGnochi with pestoFettucini alfredoChicken marsalaChicken picatta.That's everything I've had there, and every single one was delicious.  The picatta is my new favorite (I've been craving it since I was there last week).  I've taken numerous out of town people there, and they've all loved it too.The only reason I take the star away, is that the service seems to have gone downhill in the past 2 years since the ownership change.  The first time I went, the owner was a little old italian man, and he and his wife ran the place.  The walls were covered with his artwork, and he came around and spoke to everyone as they were eating.  He told us though that he had recently sold, and this night was his last there.The new owners kept the menu, and I believe they kept the same kitchen staff, as well as the waitstaff.  Over the past 2 years though, while the food stayed delicious, the service has become increasingly perfunctory.  Not bad, just not friendly.However, they're still polite and the food is still amazing, so you couldn't keep me away from this place for anything.  Prices are very good, and you can even get takeout (I confess to having binged on friend calamari, a bottle of wine and a girly movie on more than one Saturday night).Go!So this review is a little late in coming - The domestic atmosphere in my life has been a bit suffocating in these last couple days - Wednesday was a particularly stifling night, and for a mid-week change my boyfriend Nathan and I decided to go out to diner instead of just lounging around the house. After a long debate on where to go and the realization that it was almost 9:00 and bar food would soon become our only option, we stopped in the Melrose District outside a little Italian place called Harley's. Even on a Wednesday they were open until 10:00 - The bar, until 11:00 ... Huge sigh of relief.We were greeted warmly and seated in front of these huge windows that look over Copper Star Coffee and Revolver Records (reviews to follow). Warm fresh baked bread with cracked spices in olive oil for dipping started us off. We were talked in to the Mozzarella in Carrozza as an appetizer - This may very well be my boyfriends new food favorite ... It's a thick slice of mozzarella sandwiched between two pieces of bread and lightly fried ... that's right, a kick butt fried grilled cheese ... with home made marinara on top, not that ghetto crap in a can style of sauce. As an entre I had the Pollo Marsala and Fettuccine Alfredo, by far the best I have ever had. The marsala was slightly sweet, served over chicken that was cooked to perfection, and the alfredo was super light in taste and texture ... Not to mention the fact that our service was impeccable, drinks never ran dry and the bread basket was always refilled.I'd like to send a special thanks to our waiter Justin - He was a riot. He knew about everything on the menu, made perfect diner recommendations and was able to convince me and my boyfriend of at least three different lunches, diners and deserts that we plan on returning to try. He's a local artist with a fantastic sense of humor and a true talent for turning a not so hot evening into a night spent in laughter over little plates of heaven.If you stop by I recommend joining the email list so you can get the weekend update on dinner and drink specials - If you manage it, any leftovers will be boxed up for you, labeled clearly and double wrapped in cellophane for easy, spill proof transport to the fridge. Prices are super reasonable too - bigger portions and better food for the same price if not less than the chain style restaurants like, dare I say it, Olive Garden ... Also a portion of the proceeds this Thursday, the 24th, will be spent helping to raise money for the Food for Life charity. What could be better, fill your belly without empting your wallet and giving back to a good cause at the same time ... Dig it!A group of us went last night for Amanda B's sister's bday celebration. The bread was seriously Yumgasm inducing. The waiter was great he had no issues with the large party and making different checks for everyone he was very pleasant thats hard to find these days! Most people hate their jobs and it shows. I had the baked Ravioli it was delicous and my sister had the spaghetti w meat sauce it was a giant mountain of spaghetti plenty big enough for 2 I'd say! She enjoyed it as well. We will return!!What is better than Harley's in the flesh?Harleys day two!I normally hate leftovers, but let me tell you, the spaghetti marinara on day two was absolutely amazing!I have had the Emperor Salad, the marinara and the cheese ravioli. I also had a bite of the gnocchi once. All of the food is extremely flavorful with huge portions. I also think it is reasonably priced. They have a good wine selection; I especially enjoy the Chard. My favorite item is the tiramisu, though. Oh god is it good. Like a little slice of heaven right on the plate in front of you!My only complaint about the restaurant is that it is always really hot in there!  Service was good all times, but I did once have a server who was a tad sarcastic.Overall I really like Harley's and now I am craving some tiramisu!!!I hate to do this to you Harley's, especially considering how fond so many of my friends are of you, but give me a freakin' break!!Can you say overpriced? Can you say completely un-inventive menu? Yes I know that's a made up word, but it fits so deal with it. Can you say laughable wine list?? I can, HARLEY'S.I hate to be so harsh, but my Spaghetti Bolognese tasted like it came from Sbarro at the mall. The pasta was soggy, the sauce was flavorless, I was just completely unimpressed from start to finish. Listen, if you're going to make and serve low-grade knockoff Italian food, be my guest, but don't you dare charge higher-end prices! Don't even get my started on the $10 salad with dressing that so obviously came out of the bottle.In the business of full disclosure, my pasta dish was 800 times better the next day, but more likely as a result of me adding my own sauce to it before re-heating rather than it magically improving on its own.The only saving grace Harley's had for me was our server Justin. He was a doll. Attentive, courteous, and really f*cking hot. So, maybe I'm a little biased, whatever, sue me.I really wanted to like Harley's, I really really did, but sadly, I could not. Especially not with The Parlor opening just a couple of miles up the road.Harley's is my staple for a chill meal.  I enjoy coming here by myself, especially after a hectic day.  Well, I had had a hellacious week and after going to the SuTRA party tonight, with no dinner in my gut, I headed to Harley's around 8:30 for a bite to eat.I get their weekly email, which includes specials.  This week, they debuted new appetizers:  three different kinds of bruschetta.  I rarely get bruschetta because I am just not a huge bread person.  But, I saw "roasted garlic" and had to try it.  I've had just about everything on the menu here.I also ordered the calamari diavolo appetizer.  It's sauteed with HUGE hunks of garlic, served with their spicy red sauce - my favorite red sauce ever!  The bruschetta was ooey-gooey cheesy with a good portion of freshly chopped tomatoes on top.  Made me feel a little less guilty about the cheesy goodness.As always, Ed, the bartender, and my Justin made the evening!  It's such a comfortable place with friendly staff that I never stop raving about it.  Example: http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/what_are_you_eating/Recently I was talking to a friend about how much I enjoyed eating at Harley's Italian Bistro when the restaurant participated in Dining Out For Life. He looked at me blankly and then it finally clicked. "I totally forgot about that place!" he said.It seems that many people may have the same reaction because during several recent visits many tables sat empty, even on a Friday night. Let me just say, you're missing out.It's understandable that Harley's has been voted some of the Valley's best Italian food for several years in a row the food is delicious, comforting and affordable. The sauces are made in house, carrying on a tradition of from scratch recipes dating back from the Roman Table days, if you can remember that far back.Owners Lynn and Mike McGarry have recently updated the space with new artwork and fresh paint, but the friendliness of the staff is unchanged.The food is simple and uncomplicated. Roasted Garlic & Cream Cheese Bruschetta ($8) is bread, cheese, garlic, tomatoes and basil, then finished with a bit of olive oil. Nothing masked or hidden, the flavors of the creamed cheeses and garlic are tasty. I only wish that the tomatoes had been ripened a bit longer, as they weren't as tender as they could have been.Salsiccie Alla Vodka ($13) starts with farfalle pasta combined with sweet Italian sausage, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, onions that are tossed in a vodka gorgonzola cream sauce. This bowl left me reaching for more of the house made bread to pick up the remains of the sauce.When you visit Harley's Bistro's Web site you can sign up for e-mails about nightly specials. For instance, Thursday nights are getting to be known for Lasagna ($10), a thick slab of layered pasta sheets, sausage, cheese and ricotta all baked up hot and bubbly. If I had an Italian grandmother, I'd hope she'd cook just like this, comfort and joy.Available for dinner only Thursday through Sunday, Harley's also serves a mean Hand-Tossed Pizza (small $10/large $13). The crust comes out pale, but the chewy texture makes up for the lack of color. The many toppings include tender meatballs and juicy sausage, paired up with a choice of sauces, including one of my favorites, creamy alfredo. You can't go wrong here.Desserts include the usual suspects, such as Cannoli ($5), Tiramisu ($6.50) and Cheesecake ($5.50). After eating so much, we just shared a few selections of Berto's Ice Cream ($6.50) Pistachio Tartufo and Lemon Strawberry Sorbet. I wish that these had been served in a bowl rather than on a plate with chocolate syrup and whipped cream; some things are just better plain.Food this tasty should never be forgotten.I started my Saturday adventures early, as I knew I had a lot of ground to cover. On the agenda was my regular Saturday trip to the Phoenix Public Market, plus I knew I had to go BOTH the Indian Market at the Heard Museum AND the Melrose District/7th Ave Street Fair. Skipping my brunch meal at the PHX Market, I hoped to get something as I wandered the Indian Market. But oh my the lines were long. Tired and hungry I continued my journey via light rail and foot to 7th Ave and Indian School. After checking out the old cars a few shops and all the booths, I decided to do a sit down late lunch at Harley's. I had worked up quite the apatite. It was 3pm and I hadn't eaten all day. The bar was packed so I opted to be seated at a table near the entrance. My server was very kind and checked in on me frequently. Starting off with some sliced warm fresh bread and seasoned olive oil, I knew I was in for a treat. They were serving off of both the Lunch and Dinner menus. I couldn't decide, but I was given ample opportunity to and finally ordered the Fettuccine della Casa from the lunch menu. The dish also included the house garden salad. Now this took a while after ordering to show. Maybe it was because I was expecting the salad first followed by the pasta. But in this case they came out at the same time. The salad was nothin special but it was fresh and I was hungry. As I finished my salad it allowed my steamy pasta dish to cool to a civil temperature for consuming. This was a generous portion of sliced chicken breast in a tomato cream sauce with roasted red peppers and mushrooms served over fettuccine. After a generous sprinkling of crushed red pepper, it was much better than I expected. For a Lunch portion it was a generous serving. For $8 and change not including tip I had bread, salad and a wonderful pasta dish that I completely enjoyed. I will surely be back to enjoy soon.
Sirrico's Pizza=Pizza by the slice open until 3:00 a.m. is the lure of Sirrico's Pizza in New York New York Hotel & Casino. Is the pizza good? Nope. Is it worth $5? Maybe. Will you be full? Probably.The line at 12:30 a.m. was about 15 minutes long. Basically, you pick  a slice or two from the pre-made pizzas and then it is reheated as you head to the register. The happiest customers seemed to be those getting whole pies to go.The pizza line also was the scene of one of the saddest things I saw in Vegas. A possibly homeless person right in front of me got a slice of pizza, discreetly folded it, stuffed it in his pocket, and headed for the door. It broke my heart and made me want to give him my slice, too.I got a slice of Jalapeno and Pepperoni. It put some quick carbs in my belly and let me get back out on the casino floor. Let Sirrico's Pizza do the same for you if you are just hungry.New York-New York and pizza go together like a horse and carriage. Sirrico's Pizza is the New York  pizzeria in New York - New York's Greenwich Village. A couple of Saturday's previous, this transplanted New Yorker would put Sirrico's to the test.   It was a busy Saturday night on the Las Vegas Strip. Walking from Fashion Show Mall towards Mandalay Bay, I was up to a light dinner. Secret Pizza was packed. So, I'd drop into New York -New York to finally try Sirrico's Pizza. I'd seen there sign advertising a slice of pizza with a beer for $7.77. However, I never saw the pizza up close. It did not look too appealing. Something about it sitting under the lights. The presentation of the food from the pizza to the pasta, reminded me more of Sbarraros than a legendary pizza parlor from New York. I opted out of pizza and ordered the meatball sub. When I ordered the meatball sub, the cook informed me that it would take five minutes. No sweat! I'd take in the detailed replica of Greenwich Village. I have always admired New York - New York's attention to the New York -New York motif from the steam coming out of a manhole cover to the balconies up above. Way above me, I'd overhear the careening Manhattan Express roller coaster. Down the cobblestone street, Billy Kraus belted out the classics in the Times Square Dueling Piano Bar. In a New York -New York moment time goes fast.  The meatball sub failed to put me in a New York state of mind. It just wasn't very good. Honestly, the meatball marinara at Subway is better. I appreciated that they spent five minutes making the meatball sub. The upshot is that the cheese was hot and delectable. However, I had a below average opinion of the meatballs, which they did give a generous amount of. As I stated earlier in this review, the majority of the food is sitting in trays under lights. This includes the meatballs. When he made my meatball sub, it appeared that he took the meatballs from the tray and reheated it. The outcome was a sub made up of warm and tasty cheese with uninspiring meatballs on ordinary tasting bread. By the time I finished the meatball sub, it was obvious that I will ride the Manhattan Express before ordering it again.  In conclusion, I understand  that New York-New York  and pizza go together like a horse and carriage. However, I believe that a world renown resort of New York -New York's stature needs a New York renown pizzaria.
Studio Café=One of those cheap live show ticket places was doing a great deal by combining dinner and a show.  They offered us a significant discount on a packaged night that included tickets for Ka and a 2-for-1 meal at Nob Hill (both at the MGM Grand).  Unfortunately, Nob Hill was booked up (as well as almost every other MGM Grand restaurant due to an Eagles concert) so we had to settle for their Studio Cafe.For dinner, they had a wide variety of choices, which is usually a bad sign.  Like most other casino cafes, the food was overpriced while the portions were big and filling.  We did not get anything to start except for the complimentary bread.  We also skipped dessert--mainly because they did not have much to offer.  I think they only had cupcakes for desserts.  I rarely see cupcakes on any restaurant menu (and definitely very rarely see it as the star attraction).I went with the grilled Wagyu Prime Rib.  I have had grilled prime rib before (I used to work at a restaurant that made it) and it seemed like a good option because it was both reasonably priced (compared to the other stuff) and would probably be at least okay.The prime rib was probably part-roasted and then thrown on a grill to heat up.  The prime rib was somewhat tender, but it was cooked closer to medium than medium rare.  I would imagine it would be difficult to get prime rib medium rare when you have to grill it.  Despite the Wagyu label, the quality of the meat was not that great.  The flavor wasn't great either.The sides included some mixed veggies as well as a loaded baked potato (cheese, sour cream, bacon, etc.).  The sides were pretty average.The place was pretty busy.  Service was okay.  The food came out quick.  There were definitely spots when the service was inattentive.  Getting and paying for the bill also took longer than it should have.I've visited the cafes at Bally's, Aria, Caesars, and now MGM Grand.  None of them were great experiences.  I've often had to dine at these cafes because the decision revolved around what was close and what was convenient.These cafes may be suitable for breakfast (though some of the breakfast reviews for Studio Cafe are pretty bad).  While I may give a Vegas cafe another shot for breakfast, I think I am going to avoid Vegas cafes for lunch and dinner moving forward.  They are just too overpriced for the below average food quality and typically lackluster service.
Capital Seafood Restaurant=Upstairs in Chinatown Plaza is this seafood-centric spot, which shares it's space with Pho Vietnam. Considering seafood is their forte (allegedly), I expected a bit better. Menu options include fish, shellfish, crab, squid, shrimp, and even sea cucumber- basically everything that comes from the sea, plus options that don't (beef, chicken, pork).I had a killer craving for salt and pepper shrimp (labeled here as House Special Shrimp) and found them perfectly crispy, with tons of fried green onion and jalapeno, but the actual shrimp itself was less salty and less peppery than other, more flavorful versions I've had in town.We also got the sautéed spinach, add garlic, and found it to be tasty- comparable to the baby bok choy dish at Ichiza, except with spinach and a slightly less robust sauce. Dish was tasty but a bit gritty, as if it hadn't been adequately rinsed.Service was typical for Chinatown plaza- you order, you receive your food, and you have to hunt them down for anything else.
Origin India Restaurant & Bar=This was my first experience eating at an Indian restaurant.  It was a group dinner that was served family style and I had no idea what I was eating.  We didn't order off of menus, someone picked the dishes and we all sampled everything.  I wish I asked what the heck I was eating because it was awesome.....however, I was too caught up in the great conversation I was having with friends and my Wife took care of putting stuff on my plate to sample, so I didn't get the names of the dishes.The service was very good.  They made sure our plates were always full.  The only downside is that their credit card machine is old school and takes forever to close out a check.I know this is a useless review for 90% of the people out there, but for those who haven't tried Indian food, I recommend giving it a try.....I was pleasantly surprised and can't wait to go back and try more dishes....this time I'm taking notes.Return Factor - 90%Came here for some take out the other day and had the ol wtf?! moment when I got home. Here's why...The Cabana Salad with added chicken tikka ($10.50) was disturbingly poor. First off, for it to be even a $8 salad (w/o the chicken added) is insulting. It's similar to a side salad you get at McDonalds (yes, this exists). It even had shredded cheddar cheese on top. I'll repeat this. CHEDDAR CHEESE and chicken tikka. Together. WHY? To boot, the tomatoes were wilted, the chicken tikka was dryer than a popcorn fart and I would comment on the dressing but they forgot to give it to me. So, know this going in, they can't even make a salad right... and it costs over ten dollars.  The rest of the meal was a step up (how could it not be?) from the salad. The Chana Masala was average (a bit greasy) and the naan was baamb. My advice? Grab an order or two of naan and dip it in your fave sauces at home. Better yet, find a place that makes great naan and something else to dip it in. NEXT!Eh-ish. I will say this - most of their food was good, but in my opinion, it was very overpriced for a reason unknown to me. I think sometimes it's because it's closer to the strip?? We paid almost $200. That's a lot of money in my opinion. I have a hard time with it because I can get just as good Indian food in a 100% comparable location nearby.We came here on Friday night with some friends. We had 4 dishes, 2 appetizers and 5 drinks total. We had  -3 beers1 wine1 MartiniStuffed mushroom - Very weird for me. It was a very blunt taste of curry, yogurt and a uncooked mushroom that was breaded.Saag Paneer - Very goodShrimp Tikka Masala - Sauce was very tasty and rich. Lamb Rogan Josh - The sauce was okay. I felt they used a little too much curry and it over powered the dish with that and nutmeg.Chicken Mukhani - We actually don't think this was the right dish. It came out and the sauce didn't taste like it normally would for chicken mukhani. It was a bit thinner and not thick like butter chicken typically is. Lamb Vindaloo - good flavor, nice and tender meat. Overall - the service was not good. It took us over an hour to get all of our food. Mainly because the waiter was not coming around to ask if we were ready to order. It was not busy, maybe 5-6 tables total. On Friday nights at 7, it's packed at a lot of places. So, that could be a sign if they're not busy. Again, the food was good - not amazing for a pricier menu. The location and the building itself does not call for higher prices. Neither does the service.OFFSITE DELISHTypically food at the LVCC is just terrible and it's always the same boring food every day like pizza and burgers. So I was excited when I saw that Orgin India had a location inside the South Hall Las Vegas Convention Center. I discovered it during setup and could hardly wait for them to open up on Monday, during the first day of the show. What I really loved was the different menu for all 4 days. No food kiosk here does that kind of variety or even changes their menu like that. There were two options to order. For $13 you could get one meat choice & one veggie choice with rice, bread & sauces and for $16 you could add on two more items of meat & vegetable. On day one, I ordered the Chicken Makhani, Lamb Rogan Josh, Tadka Dal and mixed vegetables. I must say that everything was delicious. My favorite was the lamb because it was so tender. It melted in my mouth. I really loved the sauce from the Chicken and I mixed it in with all of my white rice. The lentils in the Tadka Dal were really good too. After finishing my delicious lunch I only knew one thing, that I could not wait to eat lunch here again tomorrow. On Day two, I ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Karahi, Dal Makhani and Gajjar Aloo. The spices were all amazing again. But I thought I wasn't going to get lunch here because the line went down the convention show floor. Obviously word had spread about the amazing food here. The secret was now out. I thought about getting out of line but decided to stay. I must admit the staff served everyone fast and I had my food in no time at all. I was so happy that it all worked out. Then on Day three, I ordered the Chicken Curry, Lamb Tikka Masala, Sag Aloo and Chana Masala. Everything was amazing and such deep flavors. The potatoes and spinach in the Sag Aloo wouldn't win any awards for looking beautiful but for taste that dish was a perfect 10. Again the lamb was very tender like it had been all of the previous days I had eaten here. I was sad on Day Four because I could not make it over here to eat. I just hope that Orgin India continues making food at the LVCC for future trade shows. I also was lucky enough to get to meet the owner Raja. He was a very nice man and I also told him thanks for delivering delicious convention food. He told me that he had another food cart in the central hall. Wow he is a busy man. I also praised his choice of making different food every day. Raja suggested I try his mango yogurt drink called Mango Lassi. It was both refreshing and yummy, in fact I could have had this drink for a full meal. On my walk back to my booth a few people asked me where I got the bright orange color drink. It was a real attention grabber. I must also talk about the yogurt on the side. It is so good with fresh cucumber, carrot and spices. It is probably the best yogurt I've ever had. I was also amazed at the fresh herbs and spices they used to make the food. On two different days I found real cinnamon sticks inside the chicken dishes. There is nothing like fresh ingredients and it really shows in the taste. So if you are lucky enough to be attending a show at the LVCC I would highly recommend that you find either one of their locations. It's not likely you find Indian food on the show floor of a convention center. I am happy to have found this place and to have met Raja. I wish him much success but I know he doesn't need it because he cares about his food and his customers. He is a very rich man in my book. I look forward to my next trade show in Vegas because I know where I'm eating my next lunch.Situated in an old but accessible part of Las Vegas east of The Strip, this restaurant is a short cab ride away from anywhere. Buffet was about twelve dollars plus drink, tax, and tip. Full bar available. Awkward entering the restaurant... the signage is good outside but when you enter it's like they have construction occurring in the foyer. Anyway, the interior is nicely appointed. They spent some money on chairs and tables for sure. The buffet was decently built up with my favorites: lamb curry, sag paneer, tandoori chicken, fresh-cut red onion, and mixed pickle (achaar). In fact, the food (especially the remarkable quality of the achaar) is worthy of recognition. The people running the restaurant seemed to have a skill at doing so: the waitress kept my water glass full and sat me within a decent amount of time, the six other personnel I  witnessed in various capacities seemed motivated, etc.Why is this review 2 stars? A) This restaurant has a documented history failing health inspections, resulting in immediate closure, andB) When I  went to the restroom... -My-Shoes-Stuck-To-The-Floor-. Let that ruminate for just a second while I  explain the baseboards in the restroom looked like they hadn't been wiped down in decades... And my shoes stuck to the floor. Shoes. Stuck. To the floor. Of the restroom.It's a pity I  won't be back, I think most people who don't care about American-style cleanliness will enjoy this frustrating experience of a restaurant. Not me. I removed my bookmark. I  have one check in, never to be two.The floor. Shoes. Stuck!  -Six- people working in this restaurant and !not one of them! Can figure out how to mop the #;;!!!##:#$ bathroom floor?!
Ed's Tavern=I know this is a popular neighborhood stomping ground for some. And honestly I like the low key vibe, just chilling' kinda joints. Drinks here are affordable.  All in all not bad of a hangout.  It can get super loud when a band is playing (they should reconsider having just acoustic live music, or at least not a full drum set as an alternative to going deaf).So why 1 star?  Well, after witnessing a beat down delivered by an employee against a patron, I honestly don't have anything good to say about this place. (This said event took place before the new year FYI)After several bad press events last year (including a death), you would think someone would care about the reputation and image of the business.  All I know is while I was standing around near the bar, a loud commotion took place at the middle table (where the checker boards table top are). The door/bar back guy punched the guy who was sitting there in the face so hard, there were blood splattered across almost the length of that long table.  The wife was screaming. The rest of the bar male employees jumped on in and dragged this one guy out to the back. Gosh knows what happened to that man.  Wife was hysterical, and she kept being yelled at by the male employees while she repeatedly said stop beating him he didnt do anything.  WTH just happened?! Then it gets better.  The guy who did the face punching now storming back in and yelling at everyone on his way, including me and the people I was standing with, for standing around.  He yelled "this is not your f-king living room, get the f out of the way". Hmm... This is a bar, people stand around in a bar.  Am I the delusional one?  So I could only guessed that he punched someone because that someone was in his way, didn't move and might have mouthed back. My thing is, if you don't like dealing with people, especially intoxicated people, don't work at a bar.  There is ZERO reason why any employee should or need to punch anyone. Management, if you are reading, please don't hire people who have anger management issue. IT IS NOT OKAY, and ganging up on one person isn't okay either.  I go to bars to have fun and enjoy myself.  And I was quite scared and pissed off by that night event.   Maybe they can put up a sign "Come here at your own risk..."
Dae Jang Keum Korean BBQ & Tofu Restaurant=Craving Korean, and not wanting to go near the Tofu Hut per my last visit http://www.yelp.com/biz/0w3BdEOxvwKTpypwbN5kiQ, it was a toss up between D.J.K. Korean BBQ or Mr. Tofu.  After checking out their small and simple menu at Mr. Tofu, we decided we liked the 'full' Korean experience that D.J.K. was offering.With no wait on the past Memorial Holiday for dinner, we were seated at  a booth right smack in the middle.  After perusing their extensive menu, we opted for their Dwaeji Galbi (Grilled Pork Ribs) at $22.95, the BF's favorite of Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap (Steamed rice with vegetables and beef to mix in the hot stone pot) at $14.95, and the Mul Naengmyeon (Buckwheat noodles with vegetables and meat in chilled broth) at $8.95 based on their picture.About nine different banchan was brought to us after our order went in.  It included cabbage kim chee, bean sprouts, salad, marinated octopus with pickled cucumbers, daikon, omelet, raw garlic, sliced jalapenos, broccoli and some kind of dipping paste.  The salad had a nice dressing to it, and was pretty good.  The octopus was pretty yummy as well.We soon discover they are out of Dwaeji Galbi, and ordered the Sanggalbi (Premium beef short ribs) at $26.95 instead.  The beef was good. It wasn't fabulous for the price we paid.  The Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap was average.  At first, the rice seemed a bit mushy.  But the stone pot that it came it really crisped up the rice very well.  (Apparently, this was the best the BF has ever had in terms of crispiness.)  The Mul Naengmyeon didn't quite look like the picture it was presented in.  It came with two slices of beef, one hard boiled egg, some veggies, and few pine nuts.  We asked the waitress about it before ordering and she was honest in her opinion, noting that although she enjoys it, it's a bit different for other people.  It's a cold noodle soup dish and I found it refreshing on a hot day.  They also give you vinegar and horseradishy mustard to mix it up with and this gives the broth the much needed quick.  Back in the city, I'm used to getting tea automatically.  But I guess here, you have to ask for it.  At least they don't charge for it though.I like how the tables are set up here.  At other Korean restaurants, they have to bring this container of hot coals to your table and it's pretty dangerous.  But here, they just turn it on with their gas stove.  And if you aren't going to cook the meat yourself, they simply put the cover on and it's flat like the rest of your table.  The BF was still eating when the cashier girl brought our check to the table.  She didn't even bother asking if we wanted dessert.  (They offer creme brulee, ice cream, etc.)  Asking if they had any shikhye and learning they did not, we were a bit disappointed.  (Had to visit the Asian supermarket next door to get some!)Service - we had the long-haired waitress.  There's this one short-haired waitress that was not so friendly.  When she initially asked us if we were ready to order, and we asked for another minute, she made a "Huff!" sound.  The BF and I looked at each other like, "WTF?!"  Thank goodness the smiley long-haired waitress ended up serving us the rest of the evening and she made up for the bad customer service of the other one.Side note: The restrooms have these gigantic square sinks.  Watch out for the first stall in the ladies' room 'cuz there's a huge puddle right in front and I think they might have a leakage problem per the previous yelper who mentioned the mess too.  Reverse happy hour is 11 pm to 7 am with local ID only and that means 20% off.(You can find pics of our dinner in the business profile above!)I think they are related to Ginseng BBQ on Las Vegas Boulevard.  Total bill with tax and tip: $65.50Total stars: 3.5If you are craving KBBQ in Las Vegas, this places is open 24/7!It is large and each table has the BBQ built in the table with a full hood over it. Most of the tables are actually booths large enough to fit 6 people. The service is friendly and attentive. I was checked on several times.I went with Bulgogi ($21.95) , which came on a heated platter after I was served a large plate of salad leaf greens with a vinegar chili dressing, and 6 side dishes including potato salad, seaweed salad, spicy daikon, kimchee, and Age tofu slices,  The bulgogi was well marinated and served with grilled green and yellow onions, with sesame seeds and a little oil. Bowl of white rice and an OB beer completed the picture.Dae Jang Keum is the name of a woman of 400 years ago who served the royal queen in Korea as a famous and inventive cook. It is also the name of the lead character in a Korean Soap Drama about the same woman. The restaurant decided to name itself after her.I may be Indian, but since coming to Vegas and befriending Koreans in my class, I have quickly become an avid fan of Korean bbq. I've been to a bunch of places in Chinatown, none of which I can remember their names...except for this one...and that's because it's my favorite!Unless you are a Korean foodie or Korean yourself, I would suggest going with Korean friends, so they can order for you and cook the meat for you at the table. Each table comes with it's own "stove" of sorts, and you cook the meat and veggies on it. I usually get chicken, which they will cook in the kitchen for me, because they will spice and sauce it up just the way I like it!You also get a bunch of appetizer dishes before your main course, this includes fish cakes (my personal fave), kimchi (spicy pickled veggies), seaweed, bean sprouts, etc etc. This place is also 24 hours, though I would never venture into Chinatown alone past 10 pm. :pIf it's your first time trying Korean bbq...go to this place!Mr. Tofu was closed for electrical issues and my family had already parked....so plan B we walked over here.  Everything was mediocre and disappointing with this restaurant.  This restaurant only has tables with the bbq grill in the center and parties of 7 are shoved into a little booth with a chair at the end.  They seriously need more table space if they are going to put out banchan and food items.  Due to the fact that the table was so crowded, a glass of water was knocked over.  The waiter...stood there and didn't offer assistance, no towel or additional napkins.  The box with the chopsticks was emtpy, we asked for chopsticks.  We had to ask a few times before chopsticks were brought over.  At one point we asked for additional napkins, and the waiter told us they were available on top of the counter and we could help ourselves!!!  Excuse me?! What did they hire you for? This last encounter with the waiter pretty much sums up the customer service at this place.  Onto the food, the banchan consists of kim chee, pickled cucumbers and radishes, bean sprounts, mashed potato, and broccoli.  Probably the lamest combo of banchan and the least tasty version I've ever seen.  I've had food court Korean with better banchan selection.  I was craving cold buckwheat noodles, since I was introduced to it at Soyo the week before.  However, this place obliterated my craving probably forever.  The noodles are thinner than the first version I had and clumpy.  The beef broth tasted like MSG water....it was altogether a horrible dish.  The galbi was overly sweet and didn't have a nice char on the outside.  The bimbimbap was just average.  The seafood pancake also was mushy and didn't have the crispy exterior that some places can achieve.  The sundubu is definitely not as good as Mr. Tofu....there's a reason why people pick this place as plan B.  Although Mr. Tofu has a much more limited menu, the prices for basic items like tofu soup, noodles, bimbimbap are probably $5 less over at Mr. Tofu.   For me this place will be plan Z...i.e I probably will never eat here again.First and last visit here! High prices, tiny portions, skimpy on banchan... I can't even. We were most of the way through our meal when I asked my mom if she'd try the kimchi and she said no cause it looked sour, and I agreed saying it looked soggy and wouldn't try it... well,  she tried it and made the most awesome NOPE face. Oh and, apparently I'm not to be acknowledged being half Korean and not being fluent in the language. Thank goodness mom is here to help me out and represent the table. We just got the check and my green tea was $5.. what? The most I've seen is $2 and that's if it's not included. Usually some kind of barley or green or black tea is available by default. But the rice was $2, just random. The menu, dude the menu was $38 for kalbi and japchae was at $21. Mind blown.  The nangmyun was "okay," the la kalbi was bland and I kept finding bone spurs, very poorly cut meat. Dae Jang Keum is the name of a very famous female doctor and chef in the Joseon Dynasty (some Korean history for you!). I think this place is trying to bank on its name and location (Chinatown near the strip) but the food portions and quality are low and the menu made me laugh.. out loud. The server was in the corner either picking her teeth or biting her nails and we didn't see her much bit after what I saw I'm okay with that. There are more people working in here than there are customers. Maybe it's a tourist trap, I'd rather drive further to better, and there's a lot better all around here. And yes,  I am writing this on my phone in a booth in the restaurant.
StripSteak=From the marketing literature.....Acclaimed Chef Michael Mina breaks new ground with the debut of STRIPSTEAK at Mandalay Bay, his first steakhouse. With its classic menu, inviting bar scene and sophisticated atmosphere, STRIPSTEAK plays host to guests looking for the perfect filet in a modern alternative to the traditional steakhouse setting. As with Mina's other restaurants, STRIPSTEAK uses only the highest quality ingredients - corn-fed, all-natural meat; line-caught seafood and fresh, seasonal produce. While first-rate components are essential, it is Mina's creative approach to cooking that has made his name.STRIPSTEAK features a menu rife with imaginative interpretations of classic steakhouse favorites using state-of-the-art kitchen equipment. STRIPSTEAK offers three kinds of beef, Certified Angus Beef, American Kobe and 'A5' Japanese Kobe, and is home to two wood-burning grills and six circulating, slow-poaching chambers. The signature slow-poaching method enhances flavor and tenderness by heating the meat for several hours at a low temperature, while the mesquite-stoked grills infuse every cut with a subtle smokiness.***With that said, this place is devilishly good.  The modern decor coupled with a menu that will send your taste buds dancing earns this place the coveted 5th star.  While enjoying my meal, my friends, and the talent on display in walks....da da dum Andre Agassi.  Wow!He was very lively, his presence filled the room.  He was engaging with the many guests requesting pics.  I was too befuddled to reach for my camera.  Don't ask me why something about being so close to a multiple Grand Slam Champion.  Turns out he is a part owner in this latest iteration of Michael Minna's restaurants.  Go, enjoy and keep your eyes peeled you never know who you might catch a glimpse of.One more notch to add to my quest of trying every single Michael Mina restaurant!  Yessss!! (Fist pump)Great, great food.  Does not disappoint.  The duck fat fries are a must, people.  Also, the burratta salad was fresh and delicious, and my boyfriend's rib cap steak was incredible.  He said that it was one of the BEST steaks he's ever had in his entire life.  Coming from a 32 year old extreme carnivore, that's pretty substantial.  Also, my lamb chops were scrumptious as well.In addition, the bill ended up not being ridiculously high as we anticipated.  I'd say Strip Steak rivals N9NE in terms of the type of ambiance and crowd they are attempting to attract.  Go to Strip Steak for a quieter, romantic and more upscale meal.  This delicious, satisfying meal was exactly what I needed after almost killing myself with alcohol poisoning a couple nights before.  I'll be back.Great steaks.  This is one of the top steakhouses in Vegas and one of only a handful that serves true Kobe beef from Japan.Been here five times in the past two years.  The restaurant has been consistently good although expensive.  Be prepared to spend $250/person for this culinary adventure.The ambiance is a little strange.  It is trendy (like all other Mandalay Bay restaurants), they miss the mark with their LOUD music aimed at the 30 something crowd.  I'm that age so I did not mind YELLING to my fellow diners but common, the place was filled with 50 something year old business people.Service was excellent.  This restaurant has an excellent sommelier and a wine list to match his expertise.  Be sure to let your price range be known ahead of making selections.  On a recent visit, we spent over $1,300 for two bottles of wine.WARNING - Do not fill up on the excellent appetizers or you will not enjoy your steak.You are given some duck fat fries and a variety of dipping sauces.  The truffle is to die for.  On to the appetizers, do not pass up the foir gras sliders.   They are incredible.Steaks are what this place is about.  Just skip the common steaks and go right for the Japanese Kobe.  You can get prime steaks back at home.  These steaks seem small (6 - 8 oz) but they are so rich that the small portion size will fill you up.  Do not be put off by the high prices ($180+) for the steak.  Splurge and enjoy.   Be sure not to have the steak beyond medium rare or it becomes a regular piece of meat.Sides are good but again, who can eat that much.  Just enjoy your steak.There is no reason you should have a bad steak in Las Vegas. Michael Mina is making that statement with bold creativity and solid food. I'm a big of fan of anywhere that puts decent thought into the overall layout of the place, decor, sitting, and most importantly the menu. I can't help myself but feel cool walking around in stripsteak. It's like technology, and fashion meets comfort food I wish my mom could compete with stripsteak food around the holidays. I've been here 3 times so far and def see stripsteak becoming a regular place I go with big groups of people before we head out for a crazy night at the club.Start with an extra order of duck fat fries if you are with more than 2 people because they are ammmmmmmmazingly delic. will disappear in a matter of minutes. Along side TRUFFLE SAUCE AND HERB KETCHUP. That alone is my dreams coming true.The flat iron, the flat iron, the flat iron! And A5 filet!For sides I enjoyed the lobster mash and sour cream and onion mash. The jalapeno creamed corn. Wasn't too into the truffled mac-n-cheese even though I love truffles, this wasn't seasoned right and not enough going on in my mouth. It needed a crunch or something,My 700th review goes toward a night of decadent eating!Parties of four are really one of the best ways to experience a menu.  With drinks in hand, we took our seats at a table by the floor-to-ceiling glass walls separating us from the outside world.* Trio of Duck Fat fries with dipping sauces of barbecue, truffle aioli, and ketchup - This complimentary dish was the first to arrive, and yes, they are very delicious and decadent, and oh so good and fatty.  A great way to start any meal!* Potato Focaccia - More complimentary stuff to get your palate going, although I found to be just okay, the Husband enjoyed it more. * Maine Lobster "bacon-wrapped fritters" ($17) - Skewered lobster with bacon wrapped around, and then deep-fried.  A refreshing dipping sauce to cut the fat!* Roasted Beets "burrata, walnut oil" ($15) - The fresh Italian cheese, greens, and beets had the three men at my table fighting over the last bits.* Filet Tartare "american kobe filet, classic garnish, grilled pocket bread" ($21) - Beautifully presented with the rare beef and a raw quail egg resting on top.  Garnishments of mustard, cracked pepper, red onions and the like surrounded it before the waiter artfully mixed it all together and presented it in chilled glass.  So tastefully good, you don't need or want the bread.  * Shabu Shabu "american kobe beef, mushroom consomme" ($24) - A pot of hot broth took center stage as enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef arrived.  A quick swish and a dip of sauce and into your mouth it goes.* Angus Beef Cap ($46) - We all ordered this off-menu cut of beef.  I initially wanted it rare, but was dissuaded to have it medium rare instead.  Cutting into my beef, it was more medium and I was saddened.  A quick glance around the table, and I realized my piece was definitely more cooked than most.  Lucky for me, the Husband was willing to switch his piece with mine.  (That act alone makes him a keeper!)  Once I cut into my newly acquired beef, I was enjoying my medium rare slice with everyone else.  * Mac & Cheese "truffled" ($12) - Yes, it's all that and a bag of chips.  So creamy and good, and not just a hint of the truffle, but it's all over! So yum!  Worth ordering on its own.* Scalloped Potatoes "caramelized onion & goat cheese" ($12) - The onions give this dish a sweetness that complements the goat cheese and potatoes.  * Potato Puree Trio "lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish" ($14) - My personal fave over the other potato dish.  With so many variations of mashed potatoes, how can one not like them.  Very smooth, creamy, and just something you want to eat all to yourself.* Creamed Corn "jalapeno" - I guess we needed some kind of vegetable to offset our meal.  A slight bit of heat from the pepper and it's more creamy goodness.* Beignets "Chocolate Pot de Creme, Macallan 18 Year Butterscotch Pudding, Madagascar Vanilla Creme Brulee" - Take a spoon to the crème brulee and forget the beignets, just hog the pot to yourself.  Dipping wise, I liked the chocolate over the butterscotch in this case.* Coconut Candy Bar "Caramel Ice Cream, Toasted Almonds" ($12) - A very fancy candy bar that's super sweet, and perfect for sharing.* Cucumber Martini - Surprisingly better than other cucumber martinis out there, good enough that everyone at my table was having one because they are that good.* Cherry Caiprihana - The Husband enjoyed this signature drink of theirs as well, and the cherry adds a unique taste to the caiprihana.The service at Strip Steak was probably among the best.  There's a team waiting on you, and they work as a team - with not just clearing dishes, but bringing your orders in and chatting it up with you.  One of the more personal and better customer service experiences I've had in awhile.  Michael Mina obviously knows what he's doing with his food and his staff.  It's no wonder there's a cult following of his restaurants.  They also have restrooms within the restaurant, which is a nice touch. (Most restaurants in the casinos don't have their own restrooms, so you're forced to walk through the casino to use it.)  But there can be a line, which is the downfall of it.My suggestion is to gather a few friends, and only a few, and share a wonderful meal with them all.  With a party of five or more, it's harder to share the appetizers and sides.  You'll share an intimate culinary adventure with them!4.5 starsO-M-G!!  It was just like how it was in the scene from "I Love You Man" where Peter just proposed to his fiance and she is sooo excited that she calls all of her friends to spread the good news of their engagement.  Only, my similar experience occurred when I took my first bite of their complimentary seasoned fries with their special sauces did I realize that it was the beginning of a good thing.  I was impressed that they have manged to perfect french fries with garlic seasoning, bbq seasoning, and regular fries with a crispy outside and a soft center. But, it wasn't the fries that had me calling and texting all of my friends and family.  It was when I took the first bite of their special Bone-in 14 oz Filet Mignon that was the taste of perfection.  It was this moment that I realized every filet mignon that I've ever had was a lie because they never gave me the sensation of knowing that I might have just taken a bite out of the best tasting steak.... EVER!!  Our waitress, Rachel, informed us that it was rare for them to have bone-in filet mignon as their specials.  She recommended it over their American Wagyu and 30oz Porterhouse!!!  Granted that I have never paid $57 for a piece of meat a la carte, but I daresay that it was worth every penny of it!! mMmMm, it was soooo good!!  I can't even describe into words how amazing this steak was, and I am a steak-lover!!  Every new bite of this steak was a surprise because I couldn't believe how amazing it was, and it was a constant reminder of the flavorful amazing taste with each and every bite until the last piece.  I was a bit disheartened when my steak was near completion, since that meant that I didn't have anymore left... despite how full I was.  Its like reading a really good book and not wanting to reach the last pages because one knew that it would over after those pages.  You didn't want to reach the end of the book since it was soo good, one just wants to keep reading it.... just like how I wanted to keep eating.  It was THAT good!!!  Five stars all the way!!!  The BF had their prix-fix $45 clam chowder, prime ribs with three sides, and their amazing chocolate beignets!!  The chocolate beignets  (French Donuts) were amazing, but still did not compare to my steak!!   I will definitely need to start saving money just so that I can eat here every time that I am in Vegas!!  I gotta start a Steak Fund!!  Hence the reason that I was calling and texting everyone about the amazingness of this steak, I hope they can submit their donations to me soon. =wink=I was very excited to have dinner here.  The Better Half & I have been wanting to give it a try for a while.  We had several friends visiting this weekend and decided to have a group dinner here.There were 11 of us in the group.  Before dinner, we gathered at the bar to have a pre-dinner drink.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  He took several pictures of the group at our request and was patient as we gave him 5 different cameras to take pictures with.  The whole time he cracked jokes and told us he would take as many pictures as we wanted....+1 in my book for the service.Originally, we had a reservation for 15 people but 4 didn't make it, so the hostess had to rearrange the table.  The hostess came to get us 10 minutes after our original reservation time....not bad for a last minute change like that.We were seated and our server immediately asked me if we wanted the wine list and who were the wine drinkers in the group.  I gave her the headcount and instructed her to keep our wine glasses full until I said stop.  She obliged and went to get the wine.  I ordered a Malbec from Argentina, it was nice and earthy with hints of blackberry & pepper....perfect! +1 for the wine.The server made several recommendations for the group and we placed our order.  As a complimentary appetizer, they brought out a tray of 3 different flavors of French Fries.  From what I could tell the flavors were BBQ, Plain, and Garlic & Herbs....served with 3 dipping sauces....BBQ, Horseradish, Ketchup.  They were good, the Garlic & Herbs was the best of the 3.When the food came out, it was presented beautifully on the plates and cooked exactly how we all ordered it.....that's rare for a group this large.  Normally there is one or two that has to send it back because it wasn't cooked right, but not tonight!  I had the 10 oz Filet and ordered it Medium Well.....it was tender and the knife sliced through it like butter.  It had a nice juicy flavor with a smokey & peppery finish.....a great pairing for the Malbec...nom nom nom!  +1 on the Steaks.  I took a few pics of the Steaks for foodie viewing pleasure.For a side dish, I ordered the Truffled Mac 'n Cheese....again, great pairing for the entree....I highly recommend it.  The Asparagus was good too.Nobody had any room for dessert, so I can't comment on that.  Overall, the dinner was a big hit with everyone.Will I return?  You bet your Steaks I will!!There's a few ways you can look at a restaurant but a review should include all the different perspectives.  Quality of food:  The food here is good.  Not great (4star) not amazing (5 star) just good.  The steaks were cooked perfectly how you ask and they have a pretty decent rub on them.  They are aged and tender as one would expect from any big name steak house.  They gave us a complimentary selection of pommes frittes which were delectable and the truffled mac and cheese was tasty.  However, not a single one of these items mentioned above was better than a 3.5 star rating.  You could argue that my palate cannot discern the difference between the beefs, but I would like to at least think I can tell the difference between a grain fed cow and one that is massaged by the japanese from kobe.  It also could just be that I've had so many steakhouse steaks that an aged piece of prime beef with a generic rub of salt/pepper just is old hat to me.  Service: The service is very good.  As expected from any high end vegas restaurant, they were very attentive and always served you with a smile.  I was amused with the sommelier we saw opening a bottle of wine.  You see, our table was right next to the small station where they open all the bottles of wine.  One table ordered one with a synthetic wine cork.  I know from experience those things are a B*^%@ to open.  It was comforting to know that a man who drinks and dispenses wine for a living also has problems with said cork.Ambiance: Dimly lit, contemporary decor, open kitchen with the meat locker right next to it.  The restaurant is a great place for a date.  Price: This is where I felt they fall WAY short.  We walked out of there for about 70 to 80 per person.  This included a steak and a side.  The lady got a sirloin steak and i got the ribeye.  If you've been out, you know that the sirloin is the cheaper of the few cuts.  That's why I was surprised that the total bill was pushing over 150.  Dont' get me wrong, the strip steak was great.  The ribeye was good.  But in all honesty, I'd rather go to Ruth's Chris or Flemmings where they have something unique.  The broiled steak with butter.  Quality of the meat MIGHT not be as good but it doesn't fall too far away from that at Stripsteak.After going to Michael Mina's in Bellagio and coming here. I was excited at first but disappointed after leaving.It was good.. but not GREAT. They offered two complimentary appetizers to begin with:1. 3 small selections of pommes frites: paprika, truffle, and duck fat each accompanied with their own dipping sauce.my favorite has got to be the truffle pommes frites. 2. garlic / cheese / rosemary flatbread.As expected the price was high. But for what I've ordered: a 12oz skirt steak, medium-rare. I expected to have better presentation. Not just a slab of beef on a white plate with a half sliced baby carrot and small roasted onion as the side. I guess i was expecting a little more show for the price i'm paying.My steak was cooked perfectly and it was juicy (well it BETTER be for the price i'm paying). But it was nothing special. I don't know - it's hard to explain.. I mean i enjoyed my steak, but it was not memorable.I ordered a side of truffle mac & cheese. I enjoyed it a lot. It definitely has the truffle and cheese - i dont mind eating the whole thing by myself.My friend ordered a seared ahi tuna steak.. which was not good at all. the tuna did not have any fresh tuna taste (not saying it was not fresh.. but a good tuna has a fresh taste).. this one here was kinda bland. like a fake watered down tuna taste (dunno if that even make sense, but that's how i'd describe it). I know i know, why would u even order fish at a steakhouse, right? but hey, i still think that if you're going to charge people that price, at least make it LOOK good, even if it doesn't taste good. The presentation for each dish was kinda boring.The Skinny: a step up on the regular steakhouse, this place delivers some good eats with finesse and occasional missteps - don't order the duck fat fries because it comes as a sizable amuse bouche (4) Service: our waiter/servers were great but there are major issues with the hostess stand (3) Value: considering the plethora of deals on Restaurant.com, this place can be a good value if you order right (4).My hubby was hankering to take me here for a while and we finally got a chance to try the menu at Stripsteak.After passing by multiple restaurants with hostesses soliciting our business, we were taken aback by the inefficient hostess. By our seating time, there was least 3-4  group of guests gathered around the hostess desk. She basically ignored the diners and the wait staff  who lined to find out how to seat us. She also didn't tell us about ongoing promotions at the restaurant: ie, the 3-course prix fixe menu for $55, or that they are currently having a half-priced happy hour lounge menu from 4-7pm. Plus, they don't offer  you their prix fixe menu unless you specifically ask for it... even when you're seated at the table. For this reason, despite the stellar service at our table, the service gets 3 stars.Michael Mina is known for preparing a dish in three different ways. So obviously our amuse bouche consisted of Bay-seasoned, garlic herb, truffled duck fat fries served with accompanying truffle aioli, ketchup and mustard/bay-seasoned sauce. The fries had a lovely crispness that retained its texture even when it cooled off. The sauces were lovely especially the truffle aioli. I considered drinking the remaining dregs of it on the bottom but decided I still needed to save my appetite for food we'd ordered. The soups were solid but nothing special. The vidalia onion soup accentuated the sweetness of onion but the croutons really lack that nice crunch. The seafood chowder was  good - the broth was a little on the milder side which allowed for the diner to get the full flavour of the crab when eaten.The foie gras sliders had the right flavour however the bun was definitely overly large considering the serving of foie on the inside. The plating would have been infinitely improved with having the bun on the side.By far the standout was our bone-in rib-eye. It's rare to see me shovel down an entire steak the size of a catcher's mitt all on my own but there was not a scrap of meat left on that plate. Yes, it is that good. The carmelized crust on the meat was so wonderful, the inside so tender and well-seasoned ... it's hard to find steak that well-prepared. It was lovely that they provided a small tasting of three sides along with the rib-eye. The peas were okay - a little on the mealier side of things. The truffled mac 'n cheese is always great - perfect consistency, texture and flavour. Unfortunately, the creamed spinach had a rather bitter unpleasant undertone.The hubby's grilled chicken (they don't fry a serving of chicken unless two people order) was a very large portion. Half a grilled chicken - a lovely crispy skin, tender and moist on the inside - on top of their wonderful mac 'n cheese. Who wouldn't like this?We topped off our very filling meal with a root beer float and warm chocolate chip cookies. We loved the fact that the ice cream was so cold, it turned our creamy root beer into a nice slush. The chocolate chip cookies were a delight - not too sweet,cool enough to have a mild crust on the outside with melting chocolate on the inside.Overall, we had a wonderful meal for a very reasonable price due to the Restaurant.com certificate. We ordered one prix fixe meals ($55 + $10 supplement for the steak) plus two starters (foie gras $22; onion soup: $17) and one entree (chicken $30). Subtract the $50 Restaurant.com certificate (we got at bargain basement prices), the meal ended up being $118.97 (including tax and 18% tip) which is reasonable considering the quantity and quality of the cuisine. Definitely a solid four star review.My husband and I were staying at Mandalay Bay when my sister in law offered to babysit. (For those of you who know me, or have kids, you know this was a magical moment). I got on my Open Table app and made a reservation for 2. Luckily, I also had a $50 restaurant.com certificate. We were sat in a lounge type area, very low couches which were slightly uncomfortable, that is until the wine arrived. A server brought us the duck fat fries trio with three different sauces, "compliments of the Chef". They were very good, but I wasn't about to waste stomach space on fries. We both had a couple and then focused on wine and our romantic night out. Mr. R ordered the 8 oz American Kobe Rib Cap, I ordered the King Salmon, we also shared the truffled Mac & Cheese. All three dishes were prepared perfectly. I highly recommend the Mac & Cheese. The staff was both helpful and kind, they never rushed us or were over bearing. Our restaurant.com certificate ended up taking care of tip and tax, which is better than nothing, but I think I will be on the look out for $100 certificate next time. On our way out, the server brought us a small bag of caramel popcorn drizzled in dark chocolate. If we ever are blessed with a babysitter again, we will happily return.There are three things that are a must for any Vegas trip... 1) Hot sweaty dance floor action 2) Titties at the Rhino 3) A big fat juicy piece of meat from StripsteakAs far as the steaks go, my personal recommendation would be to get the 18 ounce dry aged bone-in ribeye ($52).  Its fatty, flavorful, and absolutely satisfying, but If that's not enough for you, Stripsteak also offers a much larger 30oz Porterhouse ($69). And for those who want a little slice of heaven you can opt for the 12 oz gold label kobe steak for a whopping $85.  Might as well right...And we all know that no steak dinner is complete without a few sides.  My faves include teh the scalloped potatoes and the truffled mac and cheese.  I would say that one side per person is about right, but keep in mind that they do send over complimentary duck fat fries to get the juices flowing while you wait for you steak.If you're in a rush and want your steak pronto let them know you have to catch a show and they'll throw that sucker on the grill and have it ready for you in no time. Oh and before you head over to Mandalay make sure to hit up restaurant.com for a $50 gift certificate.  Below I have also included some eating instructions for you.As soon as your steak arrives please take the following steps to ensure maximum satisfaction.  1. cut your steak one bite at a time 2. do not stop eating until you have finished you entire steak (fat included)3. once you finish your steak begin to eat the steak off of your dining companions plates.4. If they resist stab them in the neck with your knife then proceed to eat their steak as they bleed out.Two and a half years and another dozen visits since my initial review, StripSteak remains one of the top new American steakhouses in Vegas.For starters, do not pass up the foie sliders.  This signature dish is topped with a tangy pineapple chutney and sweet onion jus that perfectly balance the richness of the foie.  Incredible.  The Kobe beef carpaccio, finished with south east Asian flavors is delicious.  Different from most, the coconut and Thai chili focuses the flavor of the raw beef and brings out its natural sweetness.  The duck confit spring rolls and Maine lobster fritters are also worth a try.Sadly, A5 grades of beef are no longer offered.  The most flavorful of their current steaks is the American Kobe rib cap.  Sublime beef flavor.  Heady umame from the wood burning grill.  Great texture.  Add a side of roasted marrow bones and you're in beef heaven.   (I promise I don't eat liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti). Non-beef mains?  Who knows.  You don't go to a steakhouse to eat chicken or fish.Desert?  No room.The wine list is outstanding, with a lot of gems from around the world.  Vegas resort pricing except for more expensive bottles where the markup is low.  Very Important:  The typical guest at this hip steakhouse has a lot of, how to put it,  disposable income.  The sommeliers try not to insult guest by asking how much they want to spend but rather make recommendations based on the caliber of the first bottle selected.  Save yourself the grief, Speak clearly and tell them what you want to spend.  Its not fun to be presented with an unexpected four figure wine tab.Service remains excellent.Highly RecommendedI recently realized that I've had excellent experiences at every Michael Mina restaurant I've been to.  Seablue, Nobhill, American Fish etc.  They're all at least 4 stars and sometimes more.  This past trip to Stripsteak was 4.5 stars.  I have been here at least 5 times and I always bring a $50 restaurant.com coupon.  This isn't a top 3 steakhouse in Vegas but $50 off from $100 makes it a terrific value for a really solid steak.  We've recently been ordering the $72 porterhouse which is a monster cut that can easily be split 2 ways and even 3 if you get an appetizer or an extra side.  They'll bring it out to you in a pan already carved up if you want a la Peter Luger style and that's what we do.  I also love all the meaty goodness on the bone itself.  To me, kobe beef is basically that really tender, juicy part by the bone all blown up into a regular sized piece of steak.  My wife loves the filet so I eat the majority of the sirloin side which is just fine with me.  We like it rare.The sides are $14 each so 2 of those gets me to a $100 exact.  The spinach souffle is the absolute must freakin have side dish.  I don't think there's any other restaurant doing the souffle quite like this.  The server brings it to the table piping hot, punctures the top of it and pours cream into it.  One of my favorite sides ever.  I am over creamed spinach!  We're through!We went with the mushrooms cooked in bacon for our second side since we already loaded up on starch from those awesome complimentary fries they bring to the table.  Forget bread, forget appetizers, you've got french fries!  I never make it to dessert anyways.        But the kicker this evening was when it came to box the steak.  We had asked the server to box up the 2 leftover pieces along with the bone itself.  The general manager was assisting the servers and busing tables.  She accidentally threw out the leftovers not hearing the server ask her to box it up.  I didn't make that big of a beef (ha) about it but she proposed the chef to cook us another WHOLE porterhouse and box it up for us!  I was stunned.  Talk about going above and beyond!  Who are we to say no to another $72 steak?  Wow.  This was an all around great experience and I look forward to the next time.Another wonderful meal in Vegas! We came here to celebrate my stepmom's birthday and everything was fantastic! Our waiter was awesome, the drinks were superb, the food was top notch, and the ambiance was great! No complaints about Stripsteak at all.For cocktails I highly recommend the Cucumber Martini and the Moscow Mule. Both of those drinks were phenomenal. Their drink menu is an iPad with a really cool interface that allows you to easily browse all their drinks.We were served complimentary fries upon our arrival, since there were five of us, they brought two servings of them. All the fries are cooked in duck fat and seasoned differently, I know for sure one was truffle, but I don't recall the others. The dipping sauces were great, one was truffle, one was mustard, and the other I don't remember, but everything was delish.I split the lobster bisque with my stepmom, so they gave each of us a small bowl. My favorite lobster bisque was at Craftsteak, but they can move over, because my new favorite is at Stripsteak. Love, love, loved this bisque! I ordered the grilled diver scallops, which were delicious and reasonable. Four large scallops for under $40 is a pretty good deal, especially in Vegas. They are mesquite grilled and they were wonderful. I sampled everybody else's food, all of it was amazing!Halibut - Also mesquite grilled, light touch of lemon. Perfect.King Crab Legs - Served with drawn butter and lemon, and they removed the shells for my sister in law, very nice of them!Dry Aged Bone-In Ribeye - Only one person ordered steak at the steakhouse, lol, but it was one of the best ribeye's I have ever tasted. I would get that if I come again.American Wagyu Burger - Awesome burger with a really good mustard flavor to it.For sides we shared the Truffled Mac & Cheese with Peas, Potato Gratin with Gouda Sauce, and the Creamed Corn with Jalapeno. All amazing. The portions appeared to be pretty small, but they were actually perfect considering all the other food we had, we ended up leaving some of the sides behind.For dessert with ordered the Beignets with the trio of sauces. We were given six light, airy, hot beignets with a very scotchy butterscotch sauce, a creme brulee sauce, and a chocolate pudding sauce. Mmmmm, I would come back to this restaurant just to get dessert again!Dinner was $600 after tip, for five people, lots of cocktails, entrees, sides and dessert. Pricey, but about what to expect when you come to a nice steakhouse in Vegas. I hope to dine here again someday!I have been to as many Michael Mina steak restaurants as possible after falling in love with Bourbon Steak in DC. I mean they give you French fries instead of bread- what's not to like? That being said I would say my experience at the Vegas restaurant was slightly worse than in DC or SF but I am a Niles Crane-esque nitpicker so don't let that deter you. Also, Stripsteak is in the Mandalay Bay which makes it a bit easier to get a table/reservation on the weekends as its not nearly as popular a hotel as it once was (something that also lends to the Border Grill brunch). There are like 3 negative reviews where the people say " I can make food better than this"- I'm not sure if they all climbed out of the same clown car together but if they can actually make better food they are in the wrong industry. The SteakI always get a bone in ribeye when I first go to a steak place as a basis of comparison with other restaurants. The ribeye here is a bit smaller than usual (18 oz vs usual 22 or more) and I actually think the meat was a little tastier. The steak had been trimmed a little more than I would like (fat= flavor) but it didn't seem to have negatively affected the steak. The curst was nice and salty- good. Medium rare was a deep red-good. The price (59$) is pretty average for Vegas steak joints on the strip. My dining companion got the Waygu  vs Waygu entree and that was fantastic- probably what I will get the next time I go (although bacon rapped veal is pretty enticing as well) The SidesSome people, after eating 2 lbs of French fries, might think "You know what; I probably don't need another potato side". We call those people losers. The reason these underhumans won't be dining with me is because Stripsteak has a little something called the Potato Puree Trio- much like the fires it delivers 3 different kinds of potato including one that is pureed with lobster. Perhaps I am a philistine but the lobster potatoes were actually freaking awesome. I know it probably shouldn't be done, I know it's probably not the choicest lobster bits but jesus... it is good. The mac and cheese- I also always get this when available my first time at a steak place and this one did not disappoint. It was quite "crusty" with lots of bits on top which I like. The mac itself was perhaps a little dry but I would rather that than have it swimming. Broccolini- had a very nice amount of garlic flavor which made this usually inedible weed actually taste pretty good.***StripSteak is a typical Michael Mina restaurant that provides safe and consistently good cuisine, which is a plus in Las Vegas given the mediocre and overpriced food that you will often find here (even at acclaimed restaurants)***There is definitely a comforting consistency with Michael Mina restaurants regardless of the location. You are likely to have at least a satisfying dinner at a Michael Mina restaurant because his cuisine focuses on quality ingredients and tried and true flavor combinations. Michael Mina restaurants though do not veer much from his style so I am rarely surprised by his food. Michael Mina in San Francisco is his best restaurant; that restaurant definitely has a few real high points though its food would not compete with San Francisco's best high-end cuisine. I remember finding Michael Mina in Las Vegas being good but nothing memorable. Their menu has changed quite a bit over the years and seasonality seems to be playing a larger role so maybe I need to give them another shot. StripSteak in Mandalay Bay is a Michael Mina steakhouse. It has all the trademarks of a Michael Mina restaurant with Asian influences throughout the menu and a variety of high quality beef available to order. Like Michael Mina's Arcadia in San Jose, StripSteak starts you off with a complimentary trio of fries and sauces. Fries with different seasonings like truffle oil as well as different sauces like curry ketchup and mustard aioli. The fries were hot, crispy and definitely addictive. I tried two of their beef cuts. The best was the Wagyu rib cap. This beef was very rich, juicy and tender. It did not match the best rib cap I've had, which was at Splendido in Toronto. That Canadian restaurant not only delivered an exceptionally rich and juicy meat but also an incredible bark that was crispy and smoky. Still, this was the kind of beef course many would love because it was as flavorful as it was juicy and tender. The other steak was disappointing. It was a Prime bone-in ribeye. The steak was too thin so there was not that great contrast between a nice sear and a thick and juicy center. While it was by no means a bad steak, it would definitely not be in the same category of excellent thick ribeyes you can get at a high-end steakhouse like Mastro's. The steak was garnished with complimentary bone marrow. I also added grilled foie gras, which was fine but too pricey.For sides, I had the pork belly fried rice that was mixed with carrots and peas. The fried rice was quite spicy, which definitely differentiated it from a lot of fried rice dishes I've had. I enjoyed the heat though I am not sure if this is the best pairing for simply prepared and seasoned steaks. I also tried the asparagus with yuzu butter. The asparagus was thin and tender and not too bitter. The butter sauce was not too heavy and provided a good citrus element to the asparagus. For dessert, I had the beignets with three sauces. The beignets were fairly good. They were light and pillowy though not as airy as the best beignets I've had at restaurants like Village Pub and Spruce in the Bay Area as well as what I used to enjoy at the now closed Hatfield's in Los Angeles. The sauces were not sauces as much as they were mini desserts. There was a very good creme brûlée with rich and thick vanilla custard and a crispy caramelized sugar top. There was also a salted caramel pot de creme that was sweet and salty as well as very thick. The last sauce was a butterscotch pudding. The pudding was creamy and the bitter burn was definitely noticeable. Service was good--friendly and polite. It is a loud and frenetic restaurant so it is no surprise that the service might have been a little less attentive and personable as some other high-end restaurants I've tried. Prices are high, but it is Las Vegas. I think StripSteak is within the same price range as other high-end and celebrity chef backed restaurants in Las Vegas. As mentioned, StripSteak is a loud restaurant. It is dark, contemporary and definitely energetic. I did like how while the restaurant was very close to the casino, a lot of the seating was very deep into the restaurant so guests are not bothered by the cigarette smoke that engulfs a lot of Las Vegas. I did find the chairs, which had low backs, to be slightly too uncomfortable for a long dinner. StripSteak is a perfectly fine Las Vegas steakhouse. I think StripSteak really separates itself from other steakhouses I've been to across the country with its sides. The sides here are more interesting and taste fresher than typical steakhouse fare.  The rib cap was very good while the ribeye was disappointing. If you are a big steak fan, I would recommend Carnevino, which delivers thicker and more memorable beef, but StripSteak seems to offer excellent choices from starter to entree to dessert, which is a rarity in Las Vegas.Like most casinos on The Strip, parking at Mandalay Bay is free.Ooooooooh LORD! This place is going straight to the top of my PorkBelly Paradise list. Seriously though, I would come back JUST for that succulent, perfectly flavored, slightly crunchy yet still juicy and amazingly divine  P O R K   B E L L Y.  Honestly I can't talk about much else right now, because I'm drooling all over my keyboard while I dream about it. How am I going to tell all the other Yelpers about the entire experience? I can't. TOO BAD! You'll just have to hear me go on and on and on... and on and on and on... about the pork belly. Okaaaaay fiiiiiine, I suppose I should help people figure out if they should dine here blah and try some steak or maybe blah eat some other dishes or wine dessert blah. I'll try to move on, I swear. Here goes nothing!FOOD:---------To be honest, not much else stood out during this meal other than my soulmate (aka PB). Everything else was slightly underwhelming. Surprisingly, the complimentary **Duck Fat Fries** were pretty bomb, and the second best thing we ate here. Very light and crispy and goes well with any of the trio of sauces.Second up was our appetizer, none other than the incredible! super edible! pork belly--its proper name being **Instant Bacon** ($22). See opening paragraph for my full assessment of this dish.Since this is a STEAK place, we figured we'd better order one. The **10 oz Prime Flat Iron** ($48) did not live up to expectations and was definitely not worth the cost. Even thought it was done medium, the meat was dry and lacked flavor. Super disappointing.For side dishes--often the best part of any meal--we got the **Potato Gratin** ($17) which came with gouda and the **Creamed Spinach** ($14) topped with bacon streusel. Both were decent but neither really met my side dish hopes and dreams. However, they did make the steak easier to eat!The **Vanilla Cheesecake** with strawberries and shantilly cream was the chef's special for the night. It was simply perfection. Thank you to executive pastry chef Monica Delgadillo for helping us end the night on the right note.AMBIANCE/SERVICE:---------------------------The storefront is super impressive with full glass panels and brightly lit signs indicating your dinner destination. Even the reception desk outside is lit up, so there's no question where you start your journey. The attire here is mixed, some in cocktail dresses and others in casual/business casual attire.From the hosts to the servers to the bussers, everyone was extremely pleasant. Our server was particularly helpful, especially since he's the one who alerted me to.... PORK BELLY!!!! aka Instant Bacon. I will be forever grateful. TIP: I would return here for (at least) three  --3-- Instant Bacons and the pastry's special dessert for the night.DATE TIP: You can test out someone new when you LOSE IT over the Instant Bacon.Cow done right.Yet another 2.5 years from my previous review.  Yet another dozen visits in that time.  StripSteak continues to evolve and prove its dominance as one of Vegas' top steakhouses.This is a steakhouse so starting with the steaks.  Japanese A5 is back.  Although the brand is not specified, one slice into the heavily marbled beef (if ordered simply seared and raw on the inside) showcases its classic, deeply marbled, gentle beefy flavor, and melting sweet fat.  As good as it gets and at $35/oz, well worth it.  Tip:  Do not order more than 6oz.  The richness will fill you up very fast.Up next, the American Mishima wagyu.  Running A3 - A4 quality, these steaks are tender with a more pronounced beef flavor.  The fat is nowhere near as sweet as the A5 but still plenty good.  Opt for the rib cap if available.  It has the deepest beef flavor and is by far the most delicious.An Australian wagyu offered as a tomahawk is very good.  To be shared (even if the bartender tries to tell you you can eat it by yourself - eyes bigger than stomach - epic fail).  A step down in tenderness but if beefy flavor is what you want, good balance.Finally the angus beef.  If you love American style beefy flavors, it's ahrd to pass on the UDSA prime flat iron.  A true butchers cut.  Packs mineral, beefy flavors.  Good chew and nicely integrated fat.All steaks (except the A5) have a very good sear, cooked to temp, with a very even core.Sauces and toppings if you must; foie gras butter is liquid crack.  Talk about richness with the distinct livery flavor of the foie.  Pairs beautifully with the bitterness from the wood burning grill.  Note:  do not add this to the Japanese A5 unless you want a heart attack.Sides are meant to be shared.  Do not pass on the truffle mac and cheese, baked potato with bacon marmalade, or bone marrow topped with a matsutake chimichurri (the tiny bits of matsutake add an unmistakable umame finish).Bouncing back to starters, three true standouts, the Mina classic foie with roasted pineapple, brioche, coconut milk and macadamia nuts, the braised oxtail French Onion soup, and the steakhouse staple, classic wagyu filet tartare.  All taste as good as they read.Service is practiced and polished.  Very knowledgable.  Steakhouse friendly.The wine program remains strong though somewhat lacking in vintage depth.  Many great choices.  Vegas resort pricing.Raising the bar once again for the top tier steakhouses in Vegas.
Yupha's Thai Kitchen=So a co-worker took us to this place.  I barely know this co-worker, which is to say that I have no idea if she's a culinary idiot or if she's worth listening to.  I have issues leaving my comfort zone.Well we ordered the Kew Something appetizer, which is basically pork wontons.  As in, seven pork molecules in a wonton with some sweet and sour on the side.  Tasty, but not the sort of thing that I'd pay $6 for.  One star deduction.But I had Kao Pad (which is a little disturbing sounding) but it is essentially fried rice.  With onions and tomatoes and egg and scallions.  She asked if I wanted it spicy.  I did.  She looked at me like I was a fool, as if I couldn't hang.  I can.I don't generally love fried rice with spice, but I do like rhyming.  So I tried it, and it was amazing.  Really probably the best fried rice I've had in years.  Next time I'd try beef instead of pork but no complaints--for $8 you get a ton of it and it is sensational.The spice is pretty hot.  I got hot, which is not as hot as Thai Spicy, but still spicy for sure.  I was fine with it, because that's just how I roll, but Dallas G's head was sweating profusely, creating quite a look.  Kind of like a shabby chic, with sweat.Anyway.  I have yet to try anything else but what I had was delish.  And unlike my suspect co-worker, you can trust me.I just had to update my review to five stars because this place is THAT good. Seriously.We now have a new weekly meet up called #ThaiTuesday (or the occasional #ThaiThursday) and I cannot imagine living a week without this delicious treat. In fact, this week I had it Tuesday and Friday. Plus I will be back Monday and then again next Thursday. I guess you could say I am addicted.This is the first restaurant I have been a "regular" at.. and I love that they know my exact order. Although I am having a splendid love affair with the yellow curry (medium-hot) today I also got the Kao Pad with Tofu... its my new obsession!The Buddhas delight appetizer is amazing too. Deep fried tofu wedges with a spicy sweet peanut sauce. MMM MmmMMM.Do yourself a favor and compliment your meal with a pot of jasmine hot tea too!When my office moved from its other location, I thought that was the end of my Thai food for lunch, since the place I used to go to is now on the other side of town, but a friend told me about Yupha's right up the street from, so I thought it was time to go investigate! Grabbed a couple of coworker/friends and off we went!We arrived little after 12; we were a party of 3 and were seated right away. After I sat down, I looked around and thought this is a really cute place, I like how its set up and how the lights hang and the art on the walls, and how tables are divided by bamboo, I liked the place just by site now.Now I was looking at the lunch menu, soo many choices to pick from, I had been craving Pad Thai forever, so for this trip that's what I ordered, the Pad Thai lunch special, and some Thai Tea. With the lunch special it came with soup and salad, and the soup and salad are all you can eat, wow that's cool, because the lunch special price was like $7.99, that's a bangin good deal!The salad was good, but what made it great was the spicy peanut sauce they have for the dressing, OHHHH MMMYYY GAWD!! That stuff is amazing, I think next time I'll have less salad and more sauce , I know, that's bad, but it's that good, and the soup, that's great tasting soup, it's a vegetable soup, but extremely clear broth, so tasty! Glad I gave it a try, because I'm not really a soup person.Ok when I ordered my lunch, the waitress asked what spicy level would I want it, I was thinking of playing it safe since this was my 1st time there and I was unsure, and she told they have different levels, no spice, mild, medium, hot, Thai Hot, Double Hot and Triple Hot, and I thought to myself, if they have a double hot & Triple hot, then Im going to start at Thai Hot and that's what I did baby!  It was packing heat, but I think next time I will give the Double or Triple hot a try! The dish was perfect!! The entire lunch was very delish!I look forward to making this a regular lunch time spot for me and to trying their entire lunch menu to find me a favorite! I think next I'll try there Red Curry!Bad service leaves a bad after taste, and I won't be coming back for more. First time I ate here I loved it. The Pad Thai was yummy, the ambiance was nice, and it was perfectly placed next to Tempe Cinemas making a great go to for a date night...or so I thought. Second visit was about 30 minutes prior to closing. In most restaurants that's not a huge deal, but here it means they will ask you for your order before even getting to look at the menu, remind you every ten minutes that they're closing soon, and pretty much stare you down until you're uncomfortable enough that you can no longer enjoy your meal, ensuring that you don't leave a single minute past closing. Fine, they don't like to work late. Noted. Fast forward a few months for a stop in at lunch. Doors locked. Seems we're 15 min. early this time. No big deal, we'll wait. As we wait we see the same woman who was so rude before. The same woman who is always there. She clearly sees us but doesn't open the door...not until exactly 11:01 that is. You would think she would open the door we were standing at, but nope. First she opened the door on the opposite end, then stopped to answer the phone, then merely unlocked the door we're standing in front of and walked away as if nobody was standing there. Not a smile, not a hello, not a thanks for waiting. Nothing. I thought maybe she recognized us from before and this was an isolated incident but I've now read other reviews stating the same. Perhaps all the positive feedback has gone to her head to the point that good service has become irrelevant? Maybe it's just as simple as her not wanting to work a minute extra? I dunno. What I do know is that part of what makes a dining experience worthwhile (at least for me) is the service. Food with attitude doesn't taste nearly as good, and I'll gladly go to one of the other ten Thai restaurants in the area the next time I get a craving.Came here for lunch the other day and have to say I was a bit dissapointed to what I expected to find.It was just 1:00 and they were not all that busy at all. Service was very slow, but, there did not seem to be a reason for that. I ordered and a salad bar or soup comes with the lunch. I chose the soup that you get yourself, it was not that good.But, before I did that ,I had gone in to the bathroom to wash my hands. It was not very clean.Soup was plain, and the lunch was good. But, the staff all sat down to have their lunch  as well. Which meant they were not attentive to the customers. There was about 5 tables in there. But, why not wait until your luch service is over. THey close for lunch at 2:30.I just found that to be in poor taste to sit down to eat,in the middle of your lunch service while you are still waiting on people.Not too impressed with this place any more.Every time we go see a movie at the Pollack Theaters, we always leave plenty of time beforehand for a dinner at Yupha's. We love our Thai food and Yupha's is one of my two favorite Thai places in the valley (the other being Thai Spices in Mekong). I always get Pad Thai every time I go to Thai restaurants...I really wish I could try more things but I can never stray from Pad Thai! Arrrgh. Anyways, I love the Pad Thai here but one unfortunate thing is the heat fluctuates each time we come.The first time, I got hot and oooo-weeee my bowel movements hurt the next day! I ordered a step lower on the heat scale the next time, and I barely even felt a singe of heat. So it's kind of hit or miss if the level of heat is there that I want, but regardless the rest of the taste of the dish is the same and it's great. My husband thankfully changes up his order each time we go so I can try more of their dishes. Everything he's ordered has been good. The ambience and timeliness of the food is also a plus -- we don't have to panic about not making our movie on time because we're usually in and out in 40minutes tops. Yupha's will always be a staple of our movie date nights.Man, do I regret not trying Yupha's sooner! Dude and I have lived almost walking distance from here for nearly two years and we finally stopped in last weekend. Yupha's is super deceptive if you judge it from the outside only. I was expecting a Chinese take out (think Hot Wok Mr Cook) type of place, but WOW! Very beautiful, aesthetically pleasing decor. Given how many people were in on a Saturday night, it wasn't overly loud like I was anticipating. Just the right ambiance for a date night. We were seated immediately, and once we had a chance to check out the menu, our server came by to take our order. We ordered the almost obligatory Thai Iced Tea, Drunken Noodles with Beef and Red Curry with Chicken - Both Thai Hot. The Thai Iced Tea wasn't anything spectacular. Red Curry was the perfect balance of meat and vegetables. They did not skimp on the chicken and it was cooked just right. I really enjoyed the Drunken Noodles. Also very generous with the steak and vegetables. The noodles weren't dried up like the last Thai place we went to. I will say though with the spice levels, we'll go double or triple Thai Hot as single Thai Hot was more on the higher side of medium for our spice tastes. Both dishes were more than enough for two people and we had leftovers to take home.Overall, friendly service, fresh, delicious food, in the neighborhood ... Will definitely be back when a craving for Thai strikes!I was craving Tom Kha Gai today and Mr. Dubs had been scoping this place out for months.  What better time than to do a little take-out to go with my Ghost Adventures marathon?  So I went to call in my order and the nicest lady picked up.  After a few questions, I placed my order of: The Sampler, Massaman in Pineapple Boat with Scallops, Pad King Sod with Calamari, a bowl of Tom Kha Gai, and a bowl of Seafood Soup.  Here's the breakdown:- Sampler ($12):  You get two Thai rolls, two golden curry pastries, six buddha's delight, and six kew krob.  The Thai rolls are your standard little spring rolls with nothing too remarkable, the buddha's delight is your typical fried tofu, the kew krob had an interesting medley of ground chicken and spices, but my favorite were the curry pastries.  Puff pastry with curry chicken, onion, and carrots?  Yes please!  I think I would skip on the sampler if I come back and just order the curry pastries.  - Massaman in Pineapple Boat ($16 + $3 for scallops):  Advertised on their site as a Mother's Day weekend special, I decided to order this because I love massaman curry and the added pineapples intrigued me.  While I think the $3 up-charge for like four scallops (cut in half) was a bit much, I enjoyed this dish!  The pineapple really adds a brightness to the otherwise heavy dish.  They even threw in the pineapple boat... which ended up getting tossed after I kept spilling curry all over the place.  - Pad King Sod with Calamari ($13):  Squid stir-fry with ginger, onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers in its simplest form.  I was hoping for a balanced dish but all I got was an overwhelming garlic flavor.  I love garlic but whoa!  It was a bit much.- Tom Kha Gai & Seafood Soup ($4 & $6):  The Tom Kha Gai here is delicious!  It might've been the blinding craving for coconut milk soup but this stuff hit the spot.  It was silky and coats the mouth!  The chicken was a bit dry but what can you do about white meat chicken really?  The Seafood Soup was mainly eaten by Mr. Dubs.  It tasted of your standard hot & sour soup with lots of lime.  The seafood soup was definitely not my favorite.The decor was lovely and I almost wished I dined-in instead of carried out.  The service was friendly but for $61, I was hoping for a little more.  The portions are a bit small and they're pretty stingy on the seafood but the flavors for most of the dishes were great.On a whim went here for dinner. Sits in the Pollack Tempe plaza close to the cinemas, comic store, etc. the restaurant is decorated with large Thai art like the huge floating market painting and huge faces of the Buddha and notes of bamboo dividers between some tables and the entrance walk-in. Smells of the food resonated from the nose to my tummy. So much to choose from: March specials and regular menu items. I had to try the Drunken Noodles and the Panang Curry which are my Go-to dishes. Drunken noodles: Mild. Chicken. Onions. Bell peppers. Tomato. Napa cabbage. Thai basil. Flat noodles. Sweet. Savory. $10.50Panang Curry. Medium. Chicken. String beans. Red bell peppers. Lime leaves. Coconut milk. One small bowl of rice. Sweet n savory.  $12Fried Banana with ice cream. $7.50Small bowl of rice: $1.50. Disappointingly a little overpriced especially since the Panang curry came with only one small bowl to begin with. I personally think the Panang curry should have at least come with 2 small bowl worth of rice. The rest of the curry liquid needs the rice to complement the dish. I originally wanted the March special dessert: mango and blueberry stuffed crepe for $5.99 but unfortunately they were out!! Waitress and staff were smiley, polite and helpful!
Sardine=Effortlessly melding French class with a healthy dose of rustic charm, this trendy French-American bistro manages to delight the palates and unfailing expectations of culinary enthusiasts plate by plate. Whether in search of decadent brunch offerings or more savory dinner entrees, Sardine is sure to impress any quality food seeking individual with its menu of locally sourced and Parisian-influenced dishes. Inconspicuously situated along Madison's Lake Monona in the city's Machinery Row district, Sardine undoubtedly heightens the bar and earns its place among the best of Madison's food scene. The inner portion of the restaurant is inherently unassuming in character and in most part relies on natural wood elements that carry throughout the space, while of course taking advantage of the views offered by Sardine's lakeside locale. A defining feature of the restaurant's ambience is the large wooden beams that traverse the length of the ceiling and contribute a sense of continuity in spite of the assorted half-walls and brick facades that serve to apportion the dining area into various subdivisions. The amalgam of earthiness and a refined touch of class invariably deems the interior space a rustic warehouse of sorts, making Sardine the perfect backdrop for an innately distinct dining experience. A sheer glance at the ingenious menu will enthuse the senses and riddle the mind to such an extent that skimming each listed entrée will most likely result in an unprecedented level of indecision and self-doubt. To illustrate, a main source of Sardine's rising popularity lies with the glorious execution of its weekend brunch. Now, the institution of "brunch" in itself presents quite the conundrum in that it forces diners to face the weighty decision of sweet or savory, and, more explicitly, breakfast or lunch. Then add to this the fact that Sardine's brunch menu consists of nothing but exceptionally delicious offerings and the former indecision subsequently escalates. And yet, this initial "struggle", so to speak, with regards to the menu, is singular in nature, for straight upon that first bite of whatsoever dish is chosen, the earlier hesitation and reservations in settling on a meal are conclusively unfounded and without warrant. Rather, each selection is sure to defy preconceived notions as to the flavors of the various meals due to the level of mastery with which each item is prepared. Omelettes are artfully crafted with flavor variations ranging from the more simplistic to the increasingly indulgent. Fines herbes and gruyere cheese...spinach, roasted cherry tomatoes, goat cheese and bacon...arugula, brie cheese, crimini mushrooms and scallions...all of which effectively define decadence. Also flaunted on Sardine's brunch menu include such dishes as a warm duck confit salad, as well as steamed mussels, Norwegian salmon, and the ever-popular croque monsieur sandwich of bayonne ham and gruyere cheese. These savory selections are brilliantly supplemented with a few sugary concoctions that manage to find their way onto the same menu in a welcome fashion. One such dish is the buckwheat Belgian waffle that is served with a whipped cinnamon orange butter, sliced banana, and pure maple syrup, absolutely shining as a collective with its refreshing citrus notes and satisfying sweetness. As a whole, Sardine executes on all levels. Enticing its patrons with a delicious array of French-inspired classics that satisfy both palate-wise and visually, compelling all who frequent Sardine to feel graced with the pleasure of having dined at one of Madison's top bistros.Sardine is just splendid.  My husband's mother and boyfriend came from across the pond and we decided to celebrate here tonight.  We shared a bottle of wine, had great conversation and slowly filled our bellies with some wonderful French food.  I ordered the salmon with lentils, sautéed spinach, portobello mushrooms, tomatoes, and beurre blanc.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  My husband ordered the evening special of duck confit with cabbage and glazed carrots.  The glazed carrots with this dish will go down as one of the best things I've ever eaten... I felt bad but I stole most of them from him.  Dessert was gorgeous...I had a hazelnut ganache with caramel and it was sinfully delicious.  My mother in law ordered a plum cake with the best roasted almond ice cream.  Our server was fun and made our meal even better....I cannot wait to go back for brunch...and happy hour...and dinner.Full disclosure: I cannot write an objective review of Sardine. My wife and I loved Sardine when it opened. Loved the food, loved the "philosophy," loved the service. Loved everything.We loved it so much we had our wedding reception there four years past.Sardine is still tops on my list. No where else quite feels like home so much as this wonderful Bistro on Lake Monona.I'm not sure what is better--the service, the food or the atmosphere. Whether you are at Sardine for brunch, dinner or a special event, you cannot go wrong. Quintessentially Madison, the French bistro food is neither overpriced nor overly chi-chi.Tonight I attended my six or seventh Sardine Family dinner. Always multiple courses paired with wonderful wine and/or beer, these are terrific opportunities to see just what the kitchen is capable of. $40 tonight provided more snacks (cheese, chicken liver pate, kale flatbread, salumi, etc.) that necessary, a lovely duck confit and bread salad, "steamship of pork," an absurd cakey cut of grits (amazingly rich), and a delicious meringue dessert with maple ice cream all paired with Wisconsin craft beers. I love you Sardine and I will miss you immeasurably.
P.F. Chang's=Talk about the ultimate chinese torture: arriving with the crowds at 6pm with a party of 10 on one of the busiest weekends of the year: automatic 90 minute wait.   Freezing outside (unnaturally so) for Phoenix, and the door opening every 3 seconds with people sqeezing in/out.  Family wants to stay because of course every other place on any sort of main strip is going to be the same wait.  Finally sit: waiter looks 13 and wet behind the ears, seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown (running frantically, cursing under his breath), stops by after 10 minutes to let us know "I will help you later, Im busy," meanwhile the kids have already eaten at Krispy Creame across the street or else they would be pissing all over the table, no room to even get out of your table except to go all the way to the back of the place since its packed so tight with people.  3 hours later, finishing up, no time or room for desert with mega-sized fried portions, escaping back out in the cold to go home and feel ill.  Is this worth the 300$ bill?  Is this what we call entertainment and family time?  At least the orange peel chicken was excellent, but after starving that long anything would taste like fried manna.Two words:  Painfully MediocreImagine your favorite and/or average Chinese food delivery place.Now divide the flavor in half.Now multiply the price by 3.Perfect, now find a place that isn't PF Chang's to eat tonight.Seriously though, you are paying for mediocre food in a "trendy" environment.  Trendy is another way of saying "long wait" and "stupid employees".  The Olive Garden : Italian food :: PF Chang's : Chinese food analogy doesn't even work here.  And I make fun of Olive Garden ALL the time.If you are really determined to get mediocre Chinese food, find a Pei Wei.  It's owned by the same family and is the same food but for less.  And if you're looking for a Pei Wei in Tempe, AZ, just go to Tott's Asian Diner.  It's in the same strip mall and it's way way better.Literally...the worst dining experience of my life. So much went wrong (I will TRY to keep it short).I made a reservation for 8pm, 8 people on a Saturday. I called at 5pm, giving ample notice. Walk in at 7:58 (2 minutes early) and the table isn't ready. No bother, we wait outside, chit chat but happen to notice a very sparsely occupied patio, which we could have sat at. 20 minutes later. No table. Finally at 8:40 we sit down. What use are reservations? But this isn't the worst part...We sit and wait for another 10 minutes and are approached by a frantic server: Can I get you drinks? Sure. We order an excess. (You're about to get tipped well if you can make this happen tonight).  Waiting on the drinks...my throat is getting parched...where are the drinks? We get them another 20 minutes later (It's already 9pm folks...an hour after I was supposed to have my table). Here comes Mr. Frantic again - Brings 2 drinks...we're missing some.  He apologizes and confesses he forgot to ring in the other.. Ya kidding me? Finally drops it off. Cool... But the fun doesn't stop there. My friend orders an appetizer. Expresses she wants THIS to be her entree...to be brought out with everyone else's. It does not happen. He just stares at the table, his mouth agape. Say something. Fix this. Send the Manager over. Do something.Next up? I don't eat meat...I am served meat. Cool. Frantic Server Dude is now blaming someone else for this transgression and has the Manager come over to drop off my meager  portion of food. The MANAGER says nothing. Not "Sorry, not how are you this evening? Apologies n such." Just drops it off, and forces a smile. What are we doing wrong here as patrons? Am I on freaking Candid Camera?! (what happened to that show anyway...)Ugh...At this point we all just want to shovel food down our throats and get the hell out. We do the 2 for $40 deal. Where's the dessert we ordered? Blame the Cooks Magoo has his back turned to our table, and is chatting away with his friends. This is not a joke. We sit...and sit...and sit...Ya think he would have turned around at some point to, I don't know: Check on his customers who are going to be tipping him.  Finally my friend taps him on the shoulder and asks if he can box up the dessert so we can just take it with us.I open my leftovers today and not everything's in there. I hate this place. Hate. Slow...yet the servers run around like chickens with their heads cut off. The food isn't great, that's IF they can get your order right in the first place. It's pointless getting a reservation. OH and IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY.  They knew this! Their home office should really make a secret shop and see what's happening at the Mill Ave location.Ya suck.  Don't eat here. I know it's Mill...but save yourself the 2 hour shit show I experienced.OK I will start with the good parts of this place. The Hostess was sweet. She even helped us with the Validation of the parking.The Lettuce wraps were good. That is where it ends.I can honestly say, we will never come here again for any reason. Nor would I ever encourage anyone to eat here.What has happened to P.F. Chang's???  I mean honestly!We were greeted by the hostess who put us at a nice table by the window.After sitting down I could see the table was dirty. There was grease all over it and I had a dirty plate in my area.When Kinnesy came to tell us she would be helping us out tonight. I asked if we could get the table wiped down and I showed her the grease all over it.She did come back and wipe it down,then disappeared, in her place came over a male server, who then told us he would be taking care of us instead.He seemed good at first. He told us about a few things on the menu. I got hot Tea and my friend got Ice Tea, they had Mango and regular. He ordered regular.About an hour later he had to ask for another Ice Tea, he got it but, it was Mango.We got the 2 for $40.00, which does not include your drinks.It came with soup. Somewhere after we received the lettuce wraps things went downhill.We never got any appetizer plates. We had to ask for them.That is OK because, things like that can happen.Then another server brought us out our main dishes. 2 meals one bowl of white rice. We had both ordered Brown rice. Again no Dinner plates.We had to ask for those as well.We never even got any water to drink.I have to say in all the time we sat there waiting for everything, I really noticed how dirty the floor was.  They would just wipe the floors down and paper ,rice, food, everything right on to the floor.They were not even busy here, there were 11 tables occupied ours being one of them. There were 5 servers.We waited and Waited, and waited for the dessert to come out. I really wanted it to go at this point we had been there for 1 and half hours. I was so ready to go.It was a simple meal that took forever.The hostess had to go to find the waiter to tell him we wanted our check. I could see him in the doorway of the Kitchen eating.Just give us our dessert and check and we will be out of here like 25 min ago.The dessert were Wontons that had been micro waved. They were hard and the mixture inside was bubbling. Gross!We waited so long that we finally just left the $$$ on the Table and left.I have to say it was my very worst dining experience.PF Changs is an A-OK Americanized chain Chinese restaurant...Maybe I should just refer to it as PF Chain?  No matter how I refer to it, I have no problem going to PF Changs - especially when I'm with a group of people that cannot decide where to go.  PF Changs to the rescue - there is something on the menu for everyone... vegetarians, meat eaters, boring bland food fans, seafood lovers, spicy enthusiasts, etc... they offer white rice, brown rice, noodles, and I suppose no-carb dishes if you eliminate all of the above.  I actually ordered PF Changs to-go recently and despite the fact that they did not include utensils of any sort in their packaging, the eggplant dish I ordered and the steamed shrimp and veggies with brown rice really hit the spot.  If you're going to eat at a chain, PF Changs is not a bad option... while it's never my first choice of restaurants to dine at, you can't go wrong at PF Changs either... just don't expect anything too authentic and you'll be fine.
Alan Albert's=Anyone who's ever read my reviews will be able to tell you that I love a good steak, live for cheese, adore a good wine and enjoy a nice, stiff cocktail from time to time. That being the case, Alan Albert's falls into Stephy play quite nicely.It's got the feel of an old school steakhouse and I don't know about you, but when I go to Vegas, I like to explore the history and at least dabble in the feelings of the days of old there. Sure all of the modern hoorahrah is great, but that place has history and at Alan Albert's you still feel a bit of it.The waiters are dressed as steakhouse waiters should be, in nice white jackets and know their meats. They also have great sense of humors, since I imagine living in Vegas you'd have to. On one of my trips here last year. we got an old Irish man who rapped us the specials since clearly we exuded the 50-cent vibe, what? Yeah, it was random, but this is what I love about the place.The food is awesome. Steaks are of course their signature dish, but the seafood fare is fantastic as well. Lobstas baby! And if you go, ask if they have the lobster bisque. Sometime they do, sometimes they don't, but G-D Damn is that some good stuff! Use the bread to clean the plate, mmmm mmmmm! Also, like any old school steakhouse, the sides are a la carte, so make sure to try the creamed spinach(if this spinach thing ever let's up) and definitely get the asparagus as their hollandaise sauce kicks the ass!Wine list is also pretty good, but the martoonis are fantastic and they know how to do a dirrty one without tasting like you are stuck in an over-saturated "olive" garden.So go check it out. Not cheap, but definitely a nice meal in a cool place with great service and no one will say "You're money" here. Also, it is kind of hidden. If you are taking a cab, the cab driver should know, but just know that it is on Las Vegas Blvd but kind of towards the back between two buildings. You'll see :) Enjoy!
Sassi=In the spirit of Josh D.'s post, I will argue that Sassi does NOT have the best gourmet Italian food west of the Atlantic.  In fact, I wasn't impressed with the food here at all.  We had the chef's tasting menu for $59 per person and the wine pairings for $39.Cocktails - I had the apple/ginger fizz which was not at all fizzy, too sweet and had mint leaves that had browned in it.  The bar snacks course was decent.  A selection of bruschettas and some olives.  Not bad, but not stellar.Appetizers - We were brought a large plate of assorted appetizers.  Grilled beets, caramelized fennel, spicy calamari, broccoli rabe, and some other things that were quite forgettable apparently.  This plate, though impressive in appearance, was an all around failure.  My group consisted of some very adventurous eaters, and this didn't cut it even for them.  The tastes just didn't meld, and it just felt "off."Salad - The salad seemed like it was nothing more than bagged lettuce with some sliced carrots and radishes in dressing.  VERY disappointing.Pasta - Probably the highlight of the night.  The pasta was so perfectly cooked, it was heavenly.  It was served with Lima beans, greens, bread crumbs & Parmesan in some light olive oil.  I have to mention, however, that my plate had a million Lima beans and no greens.  My mom's plate, however, had all greens, barely any Lima beans.  What's up with that?Main course - I was given the seared Ahi, my husband the lamb sausage and my mom the halibut in bag.  The ahi was barely seared and cold, the lamb sausage was completely dry and over cooked and when my mom opened her bag, it stunk up the entire, albeit beautiful, dining room with fish smell.  I'm sorry, that's just not acceptable.We got a special assortment of deserts, which was nice, and they were probably our favorite part of the night.Oh and from the room we were seated in, you could hear the chef screaming bloody murder at his staff now and again.  That's all well and fine if you're Gordon Ramsay and your patron's know what they're in for, but we came for an intimate, elegant dinner... please shut up.Anyway, I only give this restaurant 3 stars because of how amazingly beautiful it is.  So while I won't say to never come here, in my opinion, you'd be much better served to stop in for some "bar snacks" and wine than having a full meal.5 stars for the ambiance and setting, 3.5 stars for the food.  So 4 stars.The setting is unbelievable and incredibly romantic.  Picture nooks and crannies, warm fire places and fire pits, a great patio, waterfalls....its fantastic.  They have heaters outside and will also provide blankets for you if you would like one.  (I declined, its not that cold yet but others were partaking in them!)  We were seated at a table that was under a bright light and while they weren't able to turn the light down they did move us to another table that was much more romantic and intimate. Our server suggested a great pinot grigio which was a great way to start the meal.  The breads in the bread basket were quite good, including a blueberry nut bread and focaccia with cheese.  We started with the calamari, which was stuffed with salmon, and was quite good.  A new twist on an old favorite.  For our primi we ordered the gnocchi in mushroom ragu which was good, but not the best gnocchi I've ever had.  I do wish they were a little larger but the portion size for a primi course was good.  For our secondi I chose the lamb three ways (chop, shredded, sausage) which was good but not anything that blew me away.  The shredded lamb was the best of the three.  The chop could have been more flavorful and the sausage tasted like generic sausage.  My husband chose the veal which was a little tough.  We did order a side of butternut squash with honey and walnuts which I absolutely loved, but my husband did not.   We finished the meal with tea and coffee (unremarkable) and a pear tart that was large and tasty.  I wish it was drizzled with caramel sauce, that would have really set it off.  All in all the food was good, I wouldn't say incredible and I certainly wouldn't say the best.  It was solid.After dinner we stopped into the bar on our way out for another drink and the bar area was lovely.  Very cozy and homey.  I would definitely return to the bar for some drinks on a cool evening.Waaaaaaaah! And Grrrrrrrrrrr!I'd leave it at that, but I think you need to hear just why I am so pained. Honey and I decided to go all out for a biggie New Year's dinner extravaganza. It had been a while since we got all gussied and spent the big bucks. We were due for some eye-rolling, table-thomping deliciousness. Perusing the short list of our local faves, we both spied the prix-fixe at Sassi and did a little dance. Limited menus at a swank venue usually equate to exceptional dishes, well worth the limitedness of it all. We wanted them to BRING IT. We deserved it!We arrived just a few minutes late (even got a car/driver so as to be sated AND safe), and were immediately seated. The restaurant was not crowded, we liked our table and saddled up. As is always the case, a pre-dinner cocktail was ordered while perusing the menu. A few minutes later our martinis arrived, poured at the table and we were left to make our New Year's toast. Enter click glasses, raising to lips........screeeeech! "Excuse me, miss? Sorry, you were given the wrong drink." No big deal. It happens.We ordered our courses with delight and within minutes the appetizer course appeared. This was a trio of selected appetizers, all tasty and complementary. Our empty plates were quickly whisked away, along with our silverware, and whallah, a second plate of the same appetizers appeared. Er, um, we just had this course. No big deal. It happens. Minutes go by and here comes the appropriate second course. The plates were delivered and we all-to-late realized our silverware was not replaced. A few minutes of trying to discreetly flag someone down and then on to the eating. Salmon - yum, Sausage, pretty yum. Neither as noteworthy as expected, but so far so good. Next was the highly anticipated lobster gnocchi course. We didn't bother to order two different entrees, we both wanted this to ourselves. Oooooh here it comes! "Be careful these plates are hot." Oh. Wait. This is wrong. These are the selections for the next course. WHERE IS MY LOBSTER GNOCCHI? Hot plates removed. Hmmmm. Starting to waver between angry and sad. Lobster Gnocchi arrives. Nothing a little lobster can't fix, right?  Well, wrong. Overcooked, tough shards of lobster...but worse, the gnocchi (black) was so overpowered with anise that we could barely get it down. It was one of the most terrible dishes I have had in ages. We were destroyed. And we eat everything. Oh goodie. Here come the hot plates we were served 10 minutes ago. Now it's been a good 20+ minutes under the warmer. Another warning for "extremely hot plates". I'm not sure there is ever a time for appreciating this, save for a cast-iron skillet, or ooey gooey Mexican fare that actually tastes better when all fired up. Well, it cooled a bit considering we had to wait yet again for someone to return with silverware. My sea bass was fine. It wasn't great. The plate didn't offer much for texture. Rice with sauteed spinach and fish. Mush and mush. Honey's veal was terrible. Tasteless, overcooked discs of mystery meat positioned next to the most horrific attempt at truffled potato gratin (the main reason he ordered the dish) we have ever been served. By this time we just wanted out. The service, the food, the whole night was throwing us into a funk that was so undeserved for the price and the holiday. Dessert was *shockingly* unspectacular. Two unfinished plates (and I have a mouth full of sweet teeth) were proof that the meal didn't even end well. So over $400 later, the joke was on us. We were so distraught we decided to call the car early and just go home. In bed by 11:45 instead of ringing in the New Year at the bar at Sassi. Enough said. A year ago Sassi's butternut squash ravioli haunted me. Now I wake up in cold sweats dreaming I have to endure New Year's Eve all over again.5/22/13Placed my reservation through OpenTable a few days beforehand.  I arrived around 45 minutes earlier than my other table mates, so I used some of the time to check with the kitchen to see if the selections I'd wanted to try off of the RW menu would be allergen-free (for me).  It seemed like I would have some trouble with the dessert menu (I'd wanted the cannoli, but that was ruled out), but after conferring with the kitchen, the hostess said that the gelati and sorbetti were safe.  This initially anticlimactic for me, but boy, was I in for a surprise!  As I was making my way through the courtyard (boy, this property was HUGE) looking for the source of people conversing and laughing, I decided I'd let my friends know I was waiting for them, but they snuck up on me and was at my side before I finished clicking "send."  Turns out the large group of people ahead of us was part of a wedding reception, so we quickly tried to find our way to the host's stand somewhere inside the cavernous restaurant.  My friends asked me if this was a resort, and I told them that I only knew it to be a restaurant.  (On our way to our table, I posed the question to the host, to which he replied that Sassi was only a restaurant, albeit one that also held many banquets.)  We were the first ones seated at one of the rooms that had patio dining overlooking gorgeous views, including Pinnacle Peak.  We each were handed wine and dinner menus, but only one RW menu, so I asked for another.  Since I knew I was going to order the panna cotta app and the tagliatelle as my main, I decided to go with a glass of Arneis ($13).  My two friends ordered glasses of Barbaresco ($17 each).  I enjoyed my glass of white-- vanilla-scented, not too dry, and I loved the apricot and pear notes.  (I need to locate a bottle, or two, to have some at home.)  This glass held well through the app and main, as well as dessert, but I'm getting ahead of myself...  My table mates decided they'd try the other apps and entrees featured on the RW menu, so that we may all get to sample everyone's plates.The Parmigiano and roasted garlic panna cotta app was lovely! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=5gIYqKU2DqAaD7cihhacxQ#5gIYqKU2DqAaD7cihhacxQ  I've had panna cotta before, so I'd expected something much lighter, more gelatinous; This was akin to a cheese spread- dense, creamy, yet slightly crumbly.  While I loved the garlicky crostino, I found it heavily dressed.  A lighter hand with the parmigiano would've sufficed.  Still, I enjoyed the app immensely!  The house made tagliatelle, with artichoke pesto and fava beans, dusted with pecorino cheese, was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever tasted! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=rim0X5ASqEnkKycpVFFLyQ#rim0X5ASqEnkKycpVFFLyQ  Exquisite in its presentation, temperature wasn't too hot, buttery, and yes, rich, but not too much so that I couldn't finish it.  In fact, I exercised restraint, only so that I could also enjoy the chocolate and vanilla gelati and apricot sorbetto for dessert (choice of three scoops). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=ndq8cYqhNck6u0vPP3I10Q#ndq8cYqhNck6u0vPP3I10Q  My fave was the apricot-- tasted so fresh and crisp; AMAZING apricot flavor!  The gelati felt too heavy in comparison, and quite frankly, a tad boring.  My three scoops of dessert at my next visit to Sassi will definitely be all sorbetti!These are what my friends ordered:Sicilian Eggplant Cakes- currants, pine nuts, tomato sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=aGQ1AwONWhUfk_jYf2EMPA#aGQ1AwONWhUfk_jYf2EMPA Wood grilled gamberoni- shrimp, cannellini bean, salsa verde http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=677LodS4kNmQGhKKzfS6zQ#677LodS4kNmQGhKKzfS6zQ Cannoli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=M-JKlnyXUcE07PUbMw3BNg#M-JKlnyXUcE07PUbMw3BNgFarro salad- goat cheese, mint, red onion, cucumber, pistachio, and red wine vinaigrette http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=5SnOMLIBQhSq1oWkAKxZVQ#5SnOMLIBQhSq1oWkAKxZVQ  (Tried this, in spite of pistachio allergy and liked it a lot!

The chill factor was also not very pronounced.  I really preferred my dessert!)If you decide to go, you MUST get the Wood grilled octopus!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=xbSzBL18HlU4r6nwDrKx4Q#xbSzBL18HlU4r6nwDrKx4Q  It's the best octopus preparation I've ever experienced!I'll be back!
Angry Ale's=Maybe it was the fact that my team (Wisconsin Badgers) was killing San Diego State...maybe it was the fact that Angry Ale's was pretty open & not filled with drunkies mid-Saturday afternoon....maybe it was the tasty sweet potato fries....or maybe it was my husband's low key company but I really liked Angry Ale's. I went in with modest expectations - I wanted some good bar food, a table and a chance to watch the game. Overall - Angry Ale's delivered. Now, don't get me wrong - it's a sports bar with a menu. It's not a place to bring children or expect gourmet cuisine. It's not the nicest sports bar I've ever been to, but it's certainly not the diviest. The bathrooms were clean, the waitress (Lindsay) was nice and attentive and the food was pretty good!I ordered the Baby Burger w/cheese - A 4 ounce patty with cheddar, lettuce, tomato on a toasted bun. I choose sweet potato fries as my side. The juicy burger was just enough to satisfy me and I adored the toasted bun. The fries were a total winner - nicely cut sweet potato fries with cinnamon sugar dusted over the top. NOM.Prices were affordable for food and drinks and TVs were plentiful. I'll definitely come back to Angry Ale's to watch another game - as long as it's not super crowded!
Table 34=Met a couple of colleagues for lunch the other day and saw @Matt S review that mentioned a Pastrami Melt....so I went for it with Fries.  I wasn't paying, so I didn't get the price....I think it was around $7.95.The Sandwich came out pretty fast.  It tasted pretty good, but the Bread was greasy!  I understand it's a melt, so it should be kind of like a Grilled Cheese Sandwich.....but it was much more oily than that.  The Fries were excellent and the service was very good as usual.This place gets packed for lunch, especially during the weekdays, so get there before Noon if you don't want to wait.Return Factor - 75%Have you ever been set up on a bad blind date? One where your friend swears that the other person is attractive and that you'll have a ton in common, only to find out that said date is slightly overweight, balding and into LARPing? That's how I feel about Table 34. Very few dining experiences have elicited such a negative response in my book.Probably the most offensive thing about this restaurant is the uninspired menu and ridiculous prices for the food on it. I was told that this would be strip-quality meals, only half the price. Granted, many of the food on the strip is expensive, but the Table 34 prices aren't much different. $25 for meatloaf? $30 for trout? I don't pay that much for dinner in the Bay Area, that's for sure.To top it off, the food isn't very good. Not sure why I ordered it, but the shrimp pasta I ordered tasted like something you'd get in a cafeteria, just some limp angel hair pasta with shrimp and heavy red sauce. Seriously, a home economics class could have made something just like it. My Mom's sole was slightly better and my brother really enjoyed his ribs, so not all was lost.The two stars are for the service. Our waiter was extremely nice, especially when our entrees didn't come out at the same time. There was a small snafu in the kitchen and he didn't want the food that was ready to go cold. Very thoughtful and honest.Bottom line: there are better, more affordable places to eat in Vegas. Table 34 is an overpriced Applebee's with less flair.Since I work in the area, I have had this place on my radar for ages, but never got around to going for lunch until recently for a team lunch. The place is really, roomier than I expected and very airy and light. The service was extremely attentive and friendly. I started with a green iced tea and some of their complimentary bread with butter. They have a pretty extensive lunch menu but I decided on the linguini with chicken, spinach and tomatoes in garlic sauce. The pasta was very fresh, I was loving that and the portion was incredibly generous. I ended up having plenty to take home with me for a second lunch the next day. We rounded out our meal with several desserts to share around the table. We had creme brulee, chocolate peanut butter torte, lime tart and lemon cheesecake. They were all delightful, but my favorites were the lemon cheesecake and lime tart which were really light and delicate with just the right amount of tartness. Since I work in the area, I see myself coming here again really soon. It's a little on the expensive side but it's nice for a splurge every once in a while.I've been wanting to try this place for a while since all of the pictures looked pretty good and the ratings seemed pretty high so I finally got to try them about a week and a half ago and they were just eh for food and for service.Everyone eating inside at the time were all in business attire, probably from all the offices in the same complex and I feel that since we were in more casual attire, our server didn't treat us the same. He was very inattentive and spacey. I ordered the Scottish Salmon for $18.50 and my boyfriend got the Wild Mushroom Pizza for I believe $12.95. The foodrunner brought out the salmon and pizza together however the pizza they brought out was something with a bunch of pepperoni on it and when we told him we didn't order that, he kind of just held it there and said "Well would you like this one instead?" Lmao! I've never had that happen before. Pretty funny and we were like no...my boyfriend isn't eating meat today...and so he took it back and asked me if I still wanted my salmon. Well ya, the salmon was what I ordered lol. The server then stopped by and quickly said "Sorry, put it in wrong" and quickly walked away. Uhhh okay no problem I guess?? lol I was almost done with my salmon when they finally brought out the pizza. Now onto flavor. The salmon was a nice portion but very under-seasoned and wasn't memorable at all. Very bland. I had to put quite a bit of salt on it. The pizza had a good flavor but the crust was pretty soggy.Our server then walked by and dropped off the check without saying anything. What a weird experience. Overall we probably won't be coming back since there's a lot more options down the street on Eastern and on Las Vegas Blvd.Where did this place come from? Snuggled up to the 215 and Warm Springs, Table 34 has a slightly elevated menu that offers everything from Buffalo Fried Shrimp with Creamy Cole Slaw to a massive Grilled Rack of Pork with Chipotle Potato Puree, Asparagus & Hard Cider Glaze. Literally you're sloppy unemployed best friend and your uptight foodie buddy would both love this place. I came here to drop off some toys for the "Toys for Tater Tots" promo and I was immensely surprised at the happy hour menu offerings. I felt like I literally ordered everything; Duck Carnitas Tacos, Buffalo Fried Shrimp, Kobe Beef Sliders with Caramelized Onions and Swiss Cheese, Macaroni & Cheese with Peas & Pancetta, and of course the Sweet Potato Tater Tots with Honey Mustard. Everything was very good, honestly I didn't have a bad dish, the shrimp was on point; spicy and the pieces were huge. The sliders were delicious, super juicy and the onions weren't overpowering, and the mac and cheese was, "food bonerirffic". My only complaint was that there wasn't enough, give me more!The Duck Carnitas were delicious, tender and the perfect bite sized morsels for the non-sharing person. Sweet potato tots, I these fried, sweet carby treasures are paired perfect with a honey mustard for that nice bite at the end. The service was attentive and kept the table clear as each order came and went. I will say this place does have an older crowd. I mean, I'm no spring chicken, but I was the probably the youngest person here by at least 12 years. Is this a bad thing? Nope, now I have a solid spot to take my mom for those weekly dinner outings.
Grand Café=Read my last review on this place before you read this, then compare. Once again like in years past, the workers were having some kind of altercation with each other when I got there after midnight. Like usual the host lady had her back turned and pretended she couldn't see us waiting. She and the other host lady have been doing this for over 2 years. This time I asked the server why that lady always ignores us. He actually explained that she does in fact ignore guests intentionally and that she is just a very jaded and angry worker. I'm one of those guys who write detailed assessments of food, for example I might say: "The quality and attention the chef put into perfecting the filet to a juicy medium-rare was impressive and well represented the integrity of this restaurant". But really, the only thing I can say about Grand Cafe is that the "FOOD TASTED LIKE SHIT"If it's not bad enough that the clientele here are usually extremely drunk and shouting disgusting and stupid things, the food takes about 30-40 minutes to come out so you have to sit there the whole time and endure that shit. And most the time, the customers leave after about 20 minutes. I recommend not coming here anymore, even if you are at Santa Fe Station. Read my review of the Fatburger here at Santa Fe....I would still rather endure the service over there than eat at Grand Cafe. There are so many local 24 hour gaming bars around town that serve exceptional food and have great service and low prices. Just go there instead.Items Selected:Blueberry MuffinStrawberry DonutButtermilk Pancakes with Strawberries and Whipped CreamChicken and WafflesDouble Chocolate CookieChocolate BrownieIntrigued by not only the concept of 'locals' casinos, but more so by the early morning activity at such places, and twice impressed by the quality of the pancakes and pastries at Station Casinos Grand Café it was amidst Las Vegans and visitors that breakfast was enjoyed within the confines of Santa Fe Station and similar to its Strip adjacent brother and Red Rock location in Summerlin the breakfast fare was once again far superior to several more pricey competitors while the baked also proved by-and-large impressive shortly after emerging from the oven just after 6:30am.Lengthy but narrow, with a sort of 'patio' overlooking the gaming floor adjacent to the well stocked pastry case, it was on the right side of the restaurant with a view of the television showing Sportscenter that I asked to be sat and greeted by a friendly Hispanic man just about to go off-shift water was quickly filled and a pair of pastries delivered, my order of entrees transferred to a middle-aged Caucasian fellow who seemed to take a minute to get his bearings at the beginning of his day.Beginning with a simple donut, the $1.25 ring resembling those at Dunkin but not quite as soft in crumb, it seemed to me that while the baked goods were indeed fresh that this fried one might have been a bit old and moving on to the Blueberry Muffin a far better bite was found, the base quite buttery even before adding a little bit more while the top was speckled with pearls of sugar giving the whole thing a light crackle as several fresh berries burst in each bite.Eventually flagging down my original server for a water refill, even though I'm rather sure he was off the clock, it was not long before entrees arrived from the fellow who seemed to have finally woken up and setting aside "faple," as in fake maple, syrup in favor of the good stuff the pancakes again proved light and fluffy with light topping of whipped cream and fresh strawberries while the waffle, too, was quite admirable with a good crunch and soft center, the crisply fried breast of chicken perhaps a little more greasy than some would prefer, but at the same time a whole lot better in its hand-battered herbal flavor than the previously-frozen fingers served at 24/7 spots elsewhere.Sated and happy, but also intrigued by a few novelties within the case of cupcakes and croissants, it was with two items boxed and bagged that I settled the tab and taking my leave to less smoky environs than the casino itself it was with coffee in hand that I partook in two chocolate concoctions that again proved quite pleasant, the rich double chocolate chip cookie with slivers of almonds rich and almost 'brownie-like' while the actual brownie was more like a slab of sheet cake with slick chocolate ganache and patriotic sprinkles that may not exactly justified the $4.50 tab, but would have been absolutely excellent warmed up beneath some ice cream as offered amongst the menu's desserts.
Wildfish Seafood Grille=I really give it 2.5 stars. We went here my sisters b-day. I was extremely under impressed. We got alot of stuff and it was either so so or real bad. Calamari= the grossest shit Ive ever had. It was like the consistency of a cold stiff mozzarella cheese stick and it had that shape too. it wasn't cut into ring it was big thick sticks. The batter was like microwaved seeming because it had 100% no crisp, or flavor. I would be shocked if it wasn't prebattered and frozen. GrossTuna tar tar= it was just minced raw tuna but they didn't add any like flavored oil or citrus on it. It was just completely unseasoned. The fish had no flavor which is good but it was very plain. Seared tuna= the sauce was good the noodles I likes, tuna was ok. This dish alone I would give 3.5I would never come back here, the food was bad and just really blah. Especially for a place that specializes in fish.Wildfish delivered on an extremely happy 'happy hour' tonight to this girl...The Wildfish chopped salad may be a new favorite - it has huge chilled fresh shrimp, heart of palm, tomato, avocado, bleu cheese, and walnuts - a light meal in itself!  Add a few of the .75 cent oysters, a glass of wine, a side of veggies or a bite of crabcake + some attentive service, and you're in for a real treat!I'm not sure why I'm not more of a frequent Wildfish visitor... I look forward to another visit soon.  Happy hour is the way to go!I attended a Yelp Elite event here and I was completely wowed by the seafood.  Having lived and spent time in various places on the water I have diminished expectations for seafood now that I live in the desert.  Fear not!I will be back here on the oysters alone!  Much less the jumbo shrimp, fresh tuna and crab cakes.  The last time I was this impressed with crab cakes I could smell the Atlantic.The last time I had such good oysters I could smell the Pacific."I will remember these shrimp for the rest of my life."  This is what my mom said after tasting the bacon-wrapped shrimp at Wildfish.I knew I had to come back for a full meal after swooning over the amazing appetizers at the Yelp Elite event.  So, when my mom came out to visit I had the perfect opportunity to prove that great seafood can be found in the desert.  Wildfish did not disappoint.After consulting with our (super awesome) waiter Christian, we started off with two appetizers - the crabcake and the bacon-wrapped shrimp with goat cheese.  Both were just as fantastic as I remembered.  The crabcake is large and perfect for sharing and is served with a light remoulade sauce.  The shrimp come three to a plate, complimented with a small stack of light onion rings.  My mom really knows that I love her, as I declined her (feeble and halfhearted) offers to split the third shrimp with me!The parade of deliciousness continued with the entrees - Roasted Sea Bass and Snapper Filet with Johah Crab.  Both were served with delicate sauces that enhanced, not overpowered, the flavor of the fish.  We shared a side of steamed asparagus with hollandaise.  All sides are served family-style and the portions are large but can be ordered in half sizes that are perfect for two.5 star staff, 5 star food.  Overall it was a great experience in every way.Review # 100 and I saved it for Wildfish, how cool is that?So Friday night, after taking my friend, who was here from DC,  to Scottsdale Fashion Square so she could see what this mall was all about, we decided to head over to Wildfish. I mean I was just their a few weeks ago and I remembered just how yummy the food was at the event so I just had to go back.The place was packed! I mean it was Friday night so I didn't expect anything less but wow. We had two choices, to either wait 45 mins for a table or grab a table near the bar. We choose the latter as the you still received the full menu at the bar as well.We were greeted pretty quickly and our waitress, Deanna took great care of us. Hats off to you Deanna! You rocked girl.My friend started off with a raspberry mojito I believe (I am not sure but I think that is what it was), Lobster Bisque and Snapper with Crab, the crab fried rice to share and some steamed asparagus. All I wanted was the calamari  so I ordered that as my main course. I know lame but that is all I had a taste for as I was saving room for dessert too.So her drink, some warm fresh bread, and the lobster bisque came pretty quickly.  After that we are not sure what happened. One of the waiters (who by the way remembered me from the yelp event) came over to see how our meal was and we told him that we hadn't eaten yet. No sooner did we say that did our meal finally arrive. We were not upset by the delay at all as we were catching up on old times but it was a pretty long wait. However the manager Mario came over to apologize about the delay and offered to by us dessert. How cool was that. Deanna also came over to apologize as well for not checking on us sooner. The meal was so good. My friend enjoyed hers and I chowed down on all that yummy calamari. It was a huge plate that was sitting on top vegetables, red chiles and some yummy but spicy cashews. I also had some of that crab fried rice which was also very good. Lots of crab and lots of mushrooms. Yummy.  To save room for dessert we ate as much as we could but then requested to pack up the rest so that we could enjoy the grand finale.OMG! The desserts are sinful. My friend ordered the upside pineapple cake made with fresh whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream, and I had the chocolate godiva cake that was served warm with vanilla bean ice cream. Good lawd those desserts were good. If you don't want anything else from this restaurant. which shame on you for not trying the delicious food, at least go for dessert. Yum, yum, yum.All in all it was a great time. Thank you again to Deanna and huge extra special thank you to Mario for generously buying us dessert. I will definitely be back again soon.On behalf of all those practicing Catholics in search of cuisine options for meatless Fridays during lent, I thank you Wildfish for making it pretty darn easy! It's long overdue but I finally paid a visit to Wildfish last night. In the height of spring training madness and the thousands of additional desert guests presiding over our restaurants, I was happily pleased when I found out that Wildfish takes reservations! It was about 4:00 PM when I called and they had one time available; 8:00 PM. Sold! So at 8:00 PM sharp, we made our way to Wildfish. It was jam packed and lively with locals and tourists all enjoying some of the freshest seafood around. This place is called Wildfish, so you'd expect wild fish to be served....right? Well, you're in luck because they stay true to their name! The server informed us that they pick out the fish fresh off the docks and fly it in fresh on a daily basis. Nothing is frozen and everything is wild (not farm raised). The menu has pretty much every item in seafood format you can imagine: everything from Lobster tacos to crab stuffed shrimp. The menu is so detailed and everything sounds so good, it was actually really hard to make a decision! But, I went with the Lobster bisque to start and had Lobster tacos for my entree. We then ordered asparagus and seafood rice for the table to share. The second we sat down, they brought out thick and fresh bread and the type of bread you expect when you go to a seafood restaurant. They kept the drinks freshly refilled. The Lobster bisque came out in a hot metal kettle and when they placed the bowl in front of us, it was at that moment that they poured it in. This is an impressive way to serve bisque because it keeps it from getting cold from the time it goes from the kitchen to the table. The Lobster tacos were delicious and there was a good amount of Lobster in there. The tacos came with corn pico de gallo and fresh avocados with a tasty sauce included. The asparagus was a fresh veggie addition and the rice added the perfect twist to the meal. As I sat there enjoying my fresh fish, I almost felt like an ocean was just outside our doors (wishful thinking; I know). Before I go, I must mention dessert! Each dessert takes 20 minutes to prepare and we couldn't say no so we opted for the chocolate souffle. Delicious. Delectable. Devilish. That's all. So now that I have had the chance to finally try the seafood restaurant in my backyard, I come to the conclusion that you can in fact get quality and delicious seafood in the desert -- and in a great atmosphere too!
Kabob Palace=03/06/10I rarely find myself in this part of Phoenix, so when I knew I was going to be in the area, I had two places in mind for a late lunch.  I was hoping to dine at Bobby Q, but I found the prices a bit too steep to dine alone, so I headed here.Found the menu uninteresting that day, perhaps bec. I was looking forward to good bbq fare, but I finally settled on the basics- hummus and falafel.  For those who care, the falafel were fried in soybean oil.  (Most places I've inquired at use corn, and sometimes peanut, oil.)  The platter looked very appetizing, but don't be fooled!  The hummus was very bland, and the falafel pieces weren't that great, either.  I had to ask for lemon to get some flavor out of the falafel, and the hummus' saving grace was that it lent the falafel some lubrication.  The pita bread was probably the best thing out of the whole meal, and that's not saying much.Afterwards, I checked out the bakery next door for some expensive baklava.  I chose three varieties, and I found them all too heavy on soggy phyllo and lacking in honey.  $13 for terrible baklava and $7 (or more) on less than mediocre hummus and falafel made for such a disappointing adventure that day.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Not even to anyone that didn't like me.  (But then again, I'd never do that, anyway.)
Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana=Since I've been to Napoli and have had Pizza from the city, I couldn't wait to give this place a try.  I've heard so much about it, it was time for me to visit.My son and I came here after a couple of hours at the Pinball Hall of Fame.  We browsed the menu and decided on getting a Diavola Pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.) and a Settebello Pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Roasted Fennel Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.)  We planned to split each Pizza in half and share it so we can taste both.When the Pizza arrived, I was pleased to see that it was very similar to the Pizza I had in Napoli.  The first Pizza out was the Settebello.  When I bit into the first slice, I could immediately taste the Fennel Sausage and Mushrooms.....it was sooo good!  The crust is thin and slightly burnt on the bottom, just how I like it.  The ratio of Cheese to Sauce was perfect.  This was a good Pizza Pie.The second Pizza to arrive was the Diavola.  When I took the first bite, the Finnochiona & Red Bell Peppers were the first flavors I could taste....yum!  It too was slightly burnt on the crust.  Another great Pizza Pie.The service was good as we were only 1 of 3 tables in the entire restaurant.  We were there around 4 pm on a Sunday....I hope it was just the time of day that was the cause of the slow business.  I don't want to see this place close down.Will I return?  If I'm ever on this side of Egypt, I will.When I crave for pizza, I Crave for Pizza!! At first, I was thinking delivery from one of the chain pizzas or a mom & pop spot in my  area. I wanted to try somewhere new and I didn't want Chicago or NY style pizza (not that I don't like these types).. I thought Sammy's woodfired, CPK.. but they served the usual americanized pies and I've been there and done that as well. So, after doing some research here on Yelp, I found this place and it was Exactly what I was looking for!I ordered 2 PIzzas1. Settebello: crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven roasted fennel sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, extra virgin olive oil- I had to order this since they named it after the restaurant! Besides, the toppings sounded more than satisfying. It was Absolutely Divine! Everything from the dough, sauce and toppings were of high quality and was created with such harmony! Pine nuts.. Yeah, they were a nice touch. The only thing is that most of the toppings were placed towards the center and one of the slices didn't have much cheese on it.2. Carbonara: crushed tomatoes, pancetta, egg, fresh mozzarella, basil, parmegiano-reggiano, extra virgin olive oil- I loved the simplicity of the toppings and the addition of an egg. Now, it may not sound like much was put into this pie but they didn't have to put much at all. Due to their superb ingredients/toppings, a little went a long way! I engulfed this 'individual' sized dish in record time! Dessert:Tiramisu: Silky smooth! One of the creamiest and masterly balanced flavors that was subtle yet soooo luscious!! * Not only are Most of their ingredients imported from Italy, Even their Freakin' Oven is Italian!! You won't find a conveyor belt or deck oven here! * Just a note, they do not have Pepperoni!Authentic, Gourmet Pizza with High Standard ingredients and True Italian baking! This place was a Real Treat!! But the sametime not a place I would often go to fulfill my pizza cravings.. I won't be filled with 1 pizza alone as their toppings were lacking but not because they were cheap but because that's their style and thats the proper way of serving their type of pizza. Not to take anything away from this fabulous place but I may just be accustomed more towards the mainstream pies!First and foremost, this place is so adorable. Super New York vibe. If you call 24 hours ahead they will make you a gluten free crust. This I found very interesting. Because the dough is made from scratch and it has to rise over night, can we say FRESH! so awesome. Since we didnt call ahead we decided to just stick with a salad. I had the Insalata Grande. Only 8 dollars it consisted of Mixed Greens, Fresh Tomatoes, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Pine Nuts, Cracked Pepper, Shaved Parmigiano, and tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette. I also had an espresso martini. WOW i could drink 10 of them. and made with illy coffee? yes please! Ill def be returning here, and next time ill call ahead for a gluten free pizza :)This place has some of the best brick oven pizza I've ever eaten in my life. Whatever they're doing, it's done right. Ordered the focaccia and it was delicious. Nice and warm and salty with a dip of olive oil, sea salt and oregano - perfection! It's a nice opener for the rest of the carbs you'll be consuming here.I've also had the insalata grande and it was nice and filling for a salad. Love the pine nuts and shaved Parmesan, so delicious and fresh.The topper here, though, is the pizza. Using a precise method this pizza is cooked right. Nice burnt edges, crispy and gooey. I had to eat my quattro formaggi with a fork! So delicious. I dislike Gorgonzola immensely, but it was a really subtle flavor here, luckily (as I didn't notice it was one of the four cheeses). I've also had the gelato and it was divine, the taste was comparable to the gallons I ate in Rome!This place is close to my house so I have to cover my eyes when I see it or I'll eat here all the time!  The only, only thing I dislike about this place is that, while the employees are super nice and give great service, they have this REALLY annoying habit of correcting pronunciation. I, for one, think that's horrible customer service when it's so obvious what someone is trying to order. Correcting someone is just condescending to me. Change that one little, tiny thing and this place would be absolutely divine perfection!Grab your fork and knife.  No slices here.  True Napolitano pizza in Vegas (or as close as you're gonna get without a trip to Italy).So it's a small chain of restaurants, all good.  Quality ingredients atop a perfectly blistered, chewy, well seasoned crust served by a proud and friendly staff.  Win!  This is the real deal.  They even follow the the standards laid down by the Italian government that define such trivial things as the basic ingredients of the crust, its thickness, and the cooking temperature.The Margherita DOC is excellent.  The standard to judge all Napolitano pizza by, a simple base of crushed, ripe, acidic tomatoes, fresh milky Mozzarella, fresh basil, and a splash of EVOO.  Near perfect.  The diavola with its fennel flavored, gently aged finnochiona, sweet roasted peppers, garlic and mozzarella equally good.  Too simple?  The pizza Capricciosa with its aged, porky porsciutto, oil poached artichoke hearts mushrooms olives basil all atop the same sweet, acidic tomato pure topped with fresh mozzarella, outstanding without being overloaded with toppings.The only weakness, the namesake Settebello.  The sausage lacked the aged, umame flavor so characteristic in Italian cured meats.  A minor point considering.Very inexpensive for the quality.Now if they would just move the tables much closer, encourage chatting it up with your neighbors, get some disposable paper table coverings and serve an abundance of wine....Well, the hype is true!  And, Rod U. most recently, and many others before him, speak the truth.  Settebello serves great pizza.  Not just great Neapolitan pizza--great pizza, period!  Diane and I attended LJ's UYE here the end of last month, and I--a New York style Dom DeMarco's, Secret Pizza, and Biaggio's champion, and not one typically enamored by Neapolitan style pizza--was suitably impressed.  This is not your typical Pepperoni and sliced Mushrooms Pizza establishment.  But no matter!  The other fine Italian meats served here, Roasted Mushrooms, and outstanding Toasted Pine Nuts are just as satisfying.  As remarked by others, the ingredients imported from Italy are top of the line.  I loved the great flavorful slice of Italian ham Kevin P. was kind enough to extend me from his tantalizing order of Antipasto Misto.  And, the Soppressata I added to my Settebello was as spicy as my server said it would be.  My mouth was on fire!  And the spice lingered there, but in a pleasant, reminiscent sort of way.  My only complaint is that a 12-inch pizza is not enough for me--especially when the crust is relatively thin.  Settebello's pizza crust is not of the crisp cracker variety commonly found throughout Italy, but it is surely thinner than typical New York style pizza.  Yet my pizza was still hot and saucy, and I liked everything about it: the dough, Crushed Tomatoes that tasted like mild and wet Tomato Sauce, tangy Pancetta, relatively mild Wood Oven Sausage, in addition to the Roasted Mushrooms, Soppressata, and Toasted Pine nuts that delivered a nice crunch to a bite.  Only next time I might opt to add a milder Italian meat.  And I will likely order two pizzas for myself, and take half of one home after I have devoured the rest.  I know Diane will not object, because she may very well do the same.  When it comes to pizza, we do not mess around.  For dinner we usually order a large or extra large pizza apiece, eat as much as we can, and take the remainder home for at least lunch and sometimes also dinner the next day.  The only requirement is that the pizza must be superior in flavor, texture, and ingredients.  And, Settebello delivers on all counts!  The dough comes out of the super-hot oven with a little char for Neapolitan authenticity, but no char taste.  Diane, who is fussy about pizza (and most other foodstuffs) very much liked her Emilia Pizza, with ham, Mozzarella, and EVOO, even though she was skeptical going in.  To open, while awaiting the firing and presentation of my pizza, I also ordered an Insalata, and found the Radicchio to be somewhat bitter, but that is the nature of this beast.  Fresh mixed greens and a very good light Balsamic Vinaigrette overpowered the bitterness in any event, and the salad portion was quite generous.  Service was efficient and helpful.  The companionship of fellow Yelpers was enjoyable, and of course the food was great!  It was a fine and memorable UYE.And, I plan to be back often to introduce other pizza aficionados with whom I am well acquainted, to the magical tastes that regularly emerge from the wood burning oven of Settebello.Quite possibly the best pizza my mouth has ever tasted.I ended up coming to Settebello for lunch to celebrate a friend's birthday. The restaurant is located in the District. When you first walk into the restaurant you will be greeted by a friendly hostess and walked to your table. The decor consists of dark wood and granite which makes you instantly feel that you are in a high end pizzeria. Service wise, they seemed to be short on staff when we came in. Our server seemed to also be the bartender for the day shift, but I can see that she was trying to show us as much attention as possible. I also brought a cake from a bakery prior to meeting at Settebello and asked the server to put it in the back until we were done with our meal. I ordered the Vico, which blew my mind. I wouldn't call myself a pizza enthusiast but I know what good pizza tastes like. The pizza isn't loaded down with oil and has no tomato sauce which makes it very light. The pizza consisted of yummy sausage, fennel, mozzarella and mascarpone (no tomatoes). It was frickin delicious. I'm obsessed with the crust, which was  thin but not tastless and chewy in the middle.Highly recommended.Overall it was great experience. If you're anywhere near the Henderson area, you must try this place out."peet-suh" / "peetsa" / "peedtza" / "pittsa"However you say it, this is one of the best of its kind throughout the valley!!  Situated at The District in Green Valley Ranch, this location is quite big with plenty of seating either the inside dining room or the outdoor patio that can accommodate even a fairly large group.  There's also a nice bar setup with flat screen TVs, making the restaurant a great place to watch any sporting event.Being Napoletana, the pizza is cooked for about a minute in a wood-burning oven.  This isn't your typical NY style pizza where it can be picked up and folded in half.  Instead, the use of cutleries is advised while eating this pizza since the crust is thin and soft which doesn't hold up especially if you stock up on toppings.Out of multiple visits, everything I've had from this place so far has been really good.  I usually like to start with Panzanella or Involtini di Prosciutto.  As far as their pizzas, I prefer the ones with crushed tomatoes: classic Margherita (mozzarella, basil, Parmigiano Regiano), the Carbonara (pancetta, egg, mozzarella) and the Settebello (pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil).  Fresh ingredients, bold flavors and great topping combinations.  I normally have the 12 inch pizza to myself which doesn't leave any room for dessert.  If you can, however, go for their dessert pizza (sliced bananas, drizzle of Nutella and dusted with powdered sugar).Overall, Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana is definitely one of the best pizza joints in Las Vegas.  Delicious food, pleasant ambiance and excellent service.  I will definitely be coming back.Wow 665 Reviews? I'll make this quick. I've driven past this past numerous times and finally decided to pop in for a few drinks and a slice of Bolognese pizza, which my friend highly recommended. First off the service here is off the charts, right when you walk-in you're greeted and shown a seat. Water is dropped on the table and within a few minutes a server is greeting you and asking for drink orders while giving menu recommendations.We ordered the Bolognese pizza, baked Gnocchi, and the Insalata. The salad was perfect for two and had mixed greens, balsamic vinaigrette, cracked pepper, shaved parmigiano. A very refreshing salad and a great green break with all the carbs I was about ingest. The baked Gnocchi was ridiculous. Piping hot straight out the oven, covered in melted cheese and house marinara. I don't think I've ever had Gnocchi with marinara before, always just covered in pesto or white sauce. A must pre-meal snack while you're scanning the menu.Bolognese Pizza. Just think pizza with a slow simmered meat sauce marinara and light addition of cheese all on some incredibly flavorful soft crust. Marone! This pizza here alone is worth the trip to come back and check out the rest of the menu!
In-N-Out Burger=It's true : Having grown up in California, I love me some In-N-Out!It's definitely over hyped, but the food is consistently delicious. They do the best job of lettuce wrapping burgers around, make that animal style with my fries done extra crispy. They pay and treat their employees much better than their industry counterparts, which explains the fabulous customer service. Haha, give me a break, it's almost non existent ... At least at this location recently. Seeing as this In-N-Out is by my office, it's convenient and I used to come here often when I was a young, dumb fool that thought it was OK to go out for lunch daily. I never remember having problems with my food or the employees. Dropped in here last Sunday to grab a #2 to go: Animal Style, Protein Style, Extra Crispy Fries.Kayla the cashier was beyond rude and made it visibly known that taking my or anyone else's order was a complete inconvenience to her. I asked twice to make sure she noted Protein Style. Dirty looks and a yes. Practically threw my card and receipt back at me. When I looked at my receipt, I saw it wasn't listed. Kevin calls me up to grab my order, and I asked if this was done Protein Style. He said no but would happily remedy this. Usually Four stars for the food. Four stars for Kevin, ZERO stars for Kayla. I don't come here very much, but I will likely stick to the In-N-Out on Chandler and Price from here on out when I decide to indulge.Sorry for the two star rating, In-N-Out, but maybe you should consider removing this superbrat from a customer facing position or not hiring these types all together.I've been an In-N-Out Burger fan for over 20 yrs.  Since my first bite into an In-N-Out Burger at their Camarillo location when I was in High School, I've been hooked.Now that I'm well into my 30's, my visits to In-N-Out have dwindled to only a few times a year.....I can't seem to burn the calories like I use to, so visiting one is a huge treat for me.  Last night was one of those nights.I ordered a Double Double & a Cheeseburger & Fries.  Of course, they came out prepared just like I remember them.....Sloppy, Drippy, and Nom-ilicous!  I am talking about the Burgers....ok?  The Fries are my fav's too.....you can always tell that they were just cut moments before I walked into the door.  I love it!This location is the closest to my house, but for some reason I've never eaten here.  The drive thru was a madhouse of course, but there was no line inside....bonus!  I love watching them prepare the food as I wait....It amazes me that they can crank out so many burgers and fries so efficiently and consistently.....one of the major reasons why I come back.Will I return?  That's a stupid question.....of course!After shopping nearby... this In-N-Out Burger really hits the spot. Parking lot can be a hassle however once you get in you are golden. Just gotta brave the wait for me 3x3 because the drive thru is usually very long. I'm never bothered by the line at In-N-Out Burger because it's expected. I change up my burger each time depending on my mood. Sometimes I get animal style or sliced raw onions they have many options for such a limited menu. You just can't go wrong with In-N-Out Burger. They actually remember to give you place mats at this location too.Before the plane even touches down on the West Coast I begin to feel that old familiar craving and visions of animal style cheeseburgers and neopolitan milkshakes begin dancing in my head.Arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday was no exception; I demanded to be chauffeured to In-N-Out immediately after fetching my luggage. As I sunk my teeth into this perfect cheeseburger I couldn't help thinking that all was right with the world.Ah In-N-Out Burger, my own little burger heaven that I miss so dearly from the cold East coast.I had to go to In-N-Out Burger as my final meal in Vegas. I got into my cab and told him "The closest In-N-Out Burger to the airport please." His reaction was less than enthusiastic but I am the customer and I get what I want (within reason of course). I walked in with suitcase and carry-on in arm, went straight up to the cashier and ordered my college favorite:Cheeseburger Animal Style WITH whole grilled onions, fries and a chocolate milkshake.(Which is about... what, probably one million calories? To quote almost every rapper out there, "I don't give a ____!")I don't care how long I've lived in NYC for, I still love my In-N-Out so much. The fries are just so fresh. Onions grilled and caramelized. Animal sauce dripping everywhere. Shake so thick that it's really hard to suck out through my straw.... uh hem. All of this quality I can taste and it only came out to $6.38... TAKE THAT SHAKE SHACK.Fifteen minutes of foodgasms later and I was ready to leave for the airport. Till next time In-N-Out, I love you and miss you already.----------------------------------------------------------------------My personal side story:If you are a visiting out of towner, do not do what I did. I honestly thought I was going to miss my flight because I had a cab drop me off here so I could enjoy my burger in peace. Unbeknownst to me that unlike NYC, Vegas cabs are not allowed to be hailed on the side of the road... So here I  am waiting at an In-N-Out for a cab that I called in because I could not for the life of me get any of the cabs driving by to pull over on this random road.15 minutes passes... nothing.I call the cab company and they said they have NO record of my request so I resubmit it.Then another 15 minutes...Then another 30 minutes...At this point I have been waiting for a cab for an hour, my flight is in an hour and I am freaking the f*** out!!!Luckily one man dropping off someone else earlier saw me and actually came back to get me. Thank you taxi man!!! Ironically enough my flight ended up being delayed TWO HOURS because of the one thunderstorm that happens once a summer in Vegas... so everything was fine.So there, that was my full In-N-Out Burger story from Vegas. Enjoy.
The Wildflower Bread Company=Wildflower is better than Panera but still not my first choice for lunch.  It's on the same level as Paradise Bakery - maybe a tad nicer since they bring your food to you at your table.  Bread is fresh and homemade soups are decent as are the sandwiches.I've had the turkey and brie sandwich, the sweet potato sandwich, the grilled veggie salad, and perhaps a hummus plate awhile back.  Today I went with the "Wildflower Two" - my choice of two of the following: 1/2 sandwich, 1/2 salad, and/or soup.  I went with a 1/2 Turkey Brie sandwich and the split pea soup.  I kind of wished that I changed the bread on the sandwich as the herb bread just didn't quite do it for me, and I should have probably asked if the split pea soup had ham in it when I ordered (it did).I'll go to Wildflower on someone else's suggestion, but I will not be suggesting it anytime - that's how I ended up there today (my friend Laura's suggestion).  It's fine for what it is - a fast casual chain concept with decent food and fair prices (around $8 for lunch on average).  Again, not my first choice, but I'm ok eating at Wildflower every now and again.  There you have it!PS - I hope that the construction next door to this location is over soon - it's not fun listening to pounding noises over lunch with a friend.Bumping up Wildflower to 4 stars from three...Since my last review, I've been back twice - both times I experienced wonderful customer service and new menu items that I thoroughly enjoyed.  I highly recommend both the berry yogurt parfait and the chopped salad.  I believe that it's all about ordering the right thing off the menu, and I found my 'right thing' in the chopped salad... It reminds me of the Cowboy Ciao salad - only it's $8... That's right - I said $8 for a salad with grilled Atlantic salmon, arugula, Israeli couscous, feta, red peppers, dried sweet corn, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds.  It looks like a piece of art when It's served; and then they come toss it up with a Pesto Vinaigrette tableside for you if you'd like.  What a treat!  I hope this becomes a standard menu item in the future.I've also been back to Paradise Bakery and can no longer compare the two... Wildflower blows Paradise away in my eyes.  I will for sure return to this or one of the other seven Valley WBC locations again for an affordable, fresh, delicious meal real soon.  I may even recommend it!****Free WiFi and delicious Iced Tea are additional perks as well as the mighty fine looking selection of breads and baked goods!This is the place for me.  As someone who struggles with the demons of greasy and heavy fast food this menu has several light, flavorful, vibrant, and healthy options.  The flavor, execution, prices, and customer service easily exceed those offered by its predecessor, Paradise Bakery.Wildflower has earned my regular patronage and allegiance and here are the primary reasons why.- Reasonably priced and incredibly tasty menu.  Great dishes such as butternut squash ravoili, salmon alfredo, veggie sandwich.  - Perfect place to help mitigate my guilt when I feel like I've eaten too many burritos or burgers.- Free Wifi.- Great breakfast menu. (Yogurt Berry Parfait is in a parfait class all its own)- Very accommodating staff.  They aim to please and it shows in their appearance, demeanor, and efforts to accommodate any special requests you might have.4/7/10Have I mentioned how I love the cranberry scones at Wildflower Bread Co.??  They're very moist and studded with gorgeous dried cranberries... My favorite part to eat, being a crunchy food-lover, is the super-flaky, caramelized crust!  The only reason I don't rate w/ 5 stars is because the last time I bought a few from this location, the crust flavor tasted "off," as if another lipid was used to cook them with, or that the butter used was slightly rancid.  They definitely did not taste as fresh as the others I've purchased here before.Wildflower continues to please my palate and I have recently become an even bigger fan of their breakfast. From fresh baked bagels to eggs sandwiches on their fresh baked bread, if I need a big breakfast I know exactly where to go to get one that's delicious, potentially nutritious and most importantly, speedy!
Kona Grill=Getting off early means one thing - HAPPY HOUR!!  And that doesn't happen very often, so I love to take advantage of the cheap eats and atmosphere that happens during these brief few hours.We arrived around 5 pm and waited a good while to score a table on the patio.  We thought we were in luck when a group of ladies said they were leaving once their friend returned from the restroom.  Well, she must have fell in because it was a good 15 minutes before they did finally leave.  At this point, our total wait time was 45 minutes long.We were hungry and got our hands on a menu quick!  All food was $5 and under!  With our party of three, we got started on a few items:* Atlantic Roll "Baked salmon with motoyaki sauce and cucumbers, topped with tempura flakes and eel sauce" ($3) - Our waiter said it was his favorite and I'm not usually one for cooked fish in my rolls, but I still said okay.  It was good, not exceptional though.  Came in eight pieces, which is great for sharing!* Spicy Tuna Roll "Chopped tuna mixed with spicy motoyaki and cucumbers" ($3) - Again, pretty basic and decent and 8 pieces too.* Kona Calamari "Served with a spicy aioli dipping sauce" ($4.50) - A pretty generous order, great for sharing.* Sweet & Spicy Shrimp "Lightly battered shrimp tossed in a sweet and spicy chili sauce, served on a bed of a daikon" ($4.50) - Pretty tasty and surprisingly generous in this order.* Chicken Satay "With cabbage slaw and sweet hoisin dipping sauce" ($4.50) - Came with four skewers, and a nice slaw to get your veggies from.  A bit dry on the chicken, but enjoyed by others.* Avocado Egg Roll "Sun-dried tomatoes and red onions, with a honey-cilantro dipping sauce" ($4.50) - Two egg rolls cut in half, and tasty too.* Kahuna Sliders "A trio of beef sliders seasoned with onions and thyme, topped with Swiss and cheddar cheese" ($4.50) - The Husband enjoyed these so much that he requested another order.  They were pretty good, cooked at medium rare as requested and yummy little things.  The meat was pretty moist and the melted cheese on top made them perfect as a few bites.  They also came with thinly sliced fried onions strings.* Edamame ($3) - Soybeans that were lightly salted throughout the beans, not just on top.We didn't even get a chance to try any of their pizzas at $5 each since we ordered so much.Service was surprisingly good during happy hour.  Christian was attentive, even when the other staff brought our food out, he was quick to come over to make sure it was all okay and everything was in order.  He checked on us often for more drinks and food and we never had to look for him during our entire time there.  Once we got our order in, food came out in timely manner and we were quite pleased.  (Sometimes it seems service gets a bit slack during happy hour, when the pace should be more upbeat.  And it was definitely moving around here.)Happy hours are Mondays through Fridays: 3 to 7 pmReverse happy hours are Mondays through Thursdays: 9 pm to 11 pmFridays and Saturdays: 10 pm to 12 amHH is only available in the lounge and patio areas and seats are self-service.  So it can definitely feel like there are hounds on you when you're hanging out there because people are definitely waiting for tables here.They have discounted drink specials during happy hour too, just be sure to ask.  We took advantage of their $6.50 Sake Bombs and $3 Ladies Margaritas.  (They weren't skimping on the alcohol in my margarita, I could taste and feel that stuff right away!)You can easily understand why this happy hour is busy.  And there are some guests who stay there all evening long, it makes for interesting people watching!Side note: Restrooms are in the back left hand corner.  Don't go to the right side corner because you'll end up in the kitchen.It has been over 1 year since I've been to Kona Grill.  A lot has changed on their menu, which is a good thing.  The Better Half and I were regulars here for many years but got tired of the same old menu and stopped coming last year.  I met a friend here for lunch this past Friday and was glad to see new menu items.Since it was Friday, we decided to sit at a table at the bar.  Friday afternoons are happening at Kona Grill, so it was great for people watching.They have a special "Pairing Menu" where you can order any 2 items for $8.50.....what a deal!  The Sandwiches on the menu are 1/2 Sandwiches, so keep that in mind.  I went for the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich and the Avocado Chicken Wrap.  To wash it down I ordered a Stella Artois.The food came out fast and our waitress was very attentive.  My Wrap & Sandwich didn't come with Fries, which was a good thing....I'm trying to cut back on Fries.  The flavor of the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich was amazing!  Full of flavor....and the Bread was delicious.  The proportion of veggies in the sandwich was good too....no single flavor overwhelmed the Sandwich.  The Wrap was just as good.  The Avocado and Chicken were distributed evenly in the Wrap......I hate it when stuff in a Wrap is bunched together so you only taste a single flavor.  That wasn't the case here.....very good.  As a big eater, I was left wanting more though.....but it was probably good for my diet, ha!My friend and I put away several beers before we called it a day.  Overall, I was pleased with the food, service, and menu selection.Will I return?  You bet, I want to try more of the new menu items.Kona Kona Kona! A Summerlin hotspot located in Boca Park, but im not sure why im telling you this since everyone and their mom has been here! They have the best happy hour. I usually partake in the 4$ Margarita or 7$ sake bombs. Food wise its just as good! from sushi, avacado egg rolls, to flat breads they have something pretty much for anyone. Only one downfall.. their usually so busy its hard to get a table or spot at the bar so get there early!Happy Hour all day Sunday?! Well, don't mind if I do!!HH is only valid at the bar and also at the patio. It is pretty spacious. The place was pretty busy and we were still able to find a seat outside. It was a nice, cool day so being outside wasn't torturous. Started off with White Sake Sangria ($6.50) which was the best sake infused sangria I have ever had. I've had a few sake sangrias before where the sake overpowered the drink but this one was the perfect blend. Also got a Margarita on the rocks ($4.75).For foods:Cheeseburger Sliders ($6)- I thought were pretty tasteful. Got it as medium which was cooked perfect. One thing that was different was they put cucumbers instead of pickles which I loved because I loath pickles! Good amount for the price.Avocado Egg Rolls-(half off about $5)- I am a avocado lover so this was heaven in my mouth. It came with a honey cilantro dipping sauce. yum!Shrimp & Chicken Wraps- ($6)- Lots of flavors in your mouth. i really liked it. The portion was just right. The right amount of lettuce and comes with a cucumber salad which was pretty delish.Philly Roll (half off about $3)- Sushi wasn't too good. The ratio of rice was pretty off. Not enough fish in it. If you want to eat sushi, I suggest to go somewhere else for it.Service was good. Natalie came by and checked on us at the right times. Food came out in a reasonable time. Our table was a little sticky but other than that I will probably be back again.
Cafe Moda=My half-Filipino-ness loves deep-fried pork goodness from this place such as crispy pata and sisig.  Last Friday, my big sis was craving for some sisig.  I've been to Cafe Moda before and have experienced how loud this place gets at night so I suggested we call in a to-go order.  After trying to talk my sister out of eating here, we ended up eating at the bar since the tables were blocked off for a kid's birthay party (yeah, a kid's birthday party on a Friday night).  As predicted, the place was obnoxiously loud.  The dj had a thick Filipino accent and was saying stuff like "happy bird day (happy birthday with a Filipino accent)...you guys wanna dance IN the dance PLOR?"    *CRINGE!!!*The food couldn't come soon enough!  Then the dj started urging people to do karaoke!  OH HELL NO!  The server/bar tender was too busy trying to flirt with every guy there and flipping her hair.  This place is stright up tacky! If I didn't love my sister, I wouldn't have eaten here.  But I'm sure she learned her lesson: call for a to-go order!But then again, their sisig is the best!  The crispy pata is excellent here too.Came here to verify that the sisig was as good as everybody claimed it to be. I gotta say that they were spot on. Me and the wifey came on a Thursday night at about 9:15. First thing I noticed as we walked in was the blaring music they were playing and people that were dancing ballroom style. For a second I thought we went in through the wrong door because outside it wasn't marked clearly. Once we were greeted by the hostess and was led to our table, we weren't too sure if we should eat there or take our food to go. Since we really didn't want to wait til we got home to eat, we decided to tolerate the club style ambiance and ordered it for there. Im kind of glad we stayed because what happened next was really something you cant forget.We ordered Pork Sisig and Tokwat Baboy. As we were waiting for our order, we were watching all the peeps that were on the dance floor do their thing. Now I wasn't sure if this was a typical Thursday night because upon looking further, we noticed the crowd was a mix of young and old folks. The DJ was playing a mix of fast moving songs from the 60's to today. Didn't matter what he played, everybody on the dance floor did their thing. What really caught my eye was when they played "Gangnam Style". I kid you not I swear I saw at least 2 old ladies that could have been my grandma doing the dance like they were Psy themselves! Wow. Dinner and a show!So we finally get our food. If you refer to my pics, these two dishes alone could have fed at least 4 people so we knew we were gonna have leftovers for the next day which wasn't a bad thing. Of course we had steamed rice to go along with it so if you think we were gonna eat it just by itself than you are so wrong.Service was mediocre. Our server came by every so often to check up on us but it seemed like forever in between those times.The food itself was definitely worth it just going there. Only thing is, I think its a bit pricey. The Sisig was 13 bucks and the Tokwat Baboy was 11 bucks. At some other Filipino places, it was definitely cheaper.So in my opinion, if you don't mind the loud, blaring music and the out of tune karaoke singers, then eating here should be ok for you. Otherwise, call ahead and get your food to go.
Lil' Mama's Soul Food Cafe=There's just something funny about a white guy and his latin boyfriend noshing on soul food in the desert. But what's not funny is how dee lish the food is here at Lil Mama's. And how fun just to say lil. Perhaps the two t's and the e at the end put them over on their sign budget. But I like it. Lil Thomas likes it. The enormous serving of fried chicken was crisp and succulent. Yes, I said succulent. How many of you have used that word today? Side of red beans and rice were faboo. Five stars to the mac and cheese and collard greens. The smothered chops were not my fave and I would try another main dish. Perhaps the catfish? Huge tumblers of sweet tea to chase down this caloric feast hit the spot. The space is sparce with vintage looking African American art. I noticed a performace space near the front window. The ham in me wanted to jump up there and do the Steve Martin front porch dance from The Jerk.
Triple George Grill=I wanted this restaurant experience to be better than it was. The idea of a hip, New York-style, off-strip steakhouse in downtown Las Vegas is very appealing, but sadly 3xGeorge falls short.Service was good. The steaks were good (although one of them was overcooked and sent back)...but I don't want "good", I want "great", dammit!The biggest problem is that "Hogs and Heifers" is right next door, and there are a bunch of fat, tattooed yahoos revving their bikes loudly throughout the night with no consideration for, or awareness of, anyone else in the vicinity. Not that I blame 3xGeorge for that, but it doesn't help the overall dining experience.Seriously, I am stunned at why there are so many good reviews about this place. I'll start by saying that I would normally give a place a second try if it wasn't the best experience.. as there re many factors as to what can go wrong on any night of service.. but this was so far less than mediocre that I don't have any desire to go back. From the start when my group of 4 walked in at 8pm, the bar was packed, but the booths were nearly empty as we took a stroll to look around. We did not get seated right away, but we were early. The server didn't approach our table for nearly 10 minutes after we sat, and was in the vicinity at least 4 times... Finally,  she arrived and after ordering 3 martinis, that all came in completely different fashion than ordered.. and taking 15 minutes to get that sorted out.. it was at least 25 minutes before the server returned again. She was a mess.. and it didn't get better. I had the wedge salad which was just fine, and my friends all had the Soup of the day - Jambalaya... which isn't soup.. and actually was 'gumbo' by my account.. and was actually very good. A friend had a caesar that he said tasted stale. It tasted overly fishy to me and unbalanced. (We had it taken away which is how he ended up with the gumbo, jambalaya, soup thing)For the main course we ordered 3 steaks and a seafood pasta dish. The  steaks were very poor quality. I mean the ribeye was $32 .. and while that isn't the most expensive price for a steak of that sort, its a pretty hefty price tag for a garbage piece of meat.  It was ALL fat.. not marbled evenly and not very good grain to the meat at all.. just trash. I literally had 3 bites. Were it not for the martini and the 2 glasses of wine, I may have cared more.. but I was sharing with my friend and she switched with me for the seafood pasta. Every, single scallop.. we counted 6 .. was sandy.. which to my knowledge means unwashed or from a can.. and unwashed. The sauce was meant to be some form of scampi I thought, but it was watery and thin and just not that good. Any of these complaints were not registered because the server never came back to check on us.Ok, longest story short.. the server didn't return to the table until the check was dropped. The bussers basically took care of us until that point. Not only was the caesar salad on the check, but she added an 18% gratuity to the bill.  Is this standard practice for sub par service and food? She was no where to be found, and my companions decided to leave it since we  would not be returning. 'I would not consider going to this place ever again unless something drastic happened, like it changed ownership. Honestly it was bad.This review is based on two visits to Triple George Grill.  Overall, I found this restaurant/bar haunt on the edge of downtown to be an excellent provider of comfort food.  But there were ups and downs.The first occasion followed an enjoyable Las Vegas Yelp Book Club meeting, as I dined with a few fellow Yelpers, including our Community Manager, Misti Y.  We began with very good warm sourdough bread, followed by a nice complimentary relish tray which contained green and black olives, hot red and green peppers, gerkins, and carrot sticks.  On the second occasion I had to ask for a relish tray, but it then quickly arrived. Slightly peppery Calamari was very good dipped in either a mild Marinara Sauce or an excellent Lemon Butter Sauce that was presented on request without extra charge.Excellent baked French Onion Soup was both hot and cheesy.  The Cheese was Swiss, and the crouton bread that broke down quickly in the hot broth.  Only a little patience is required to allow the crouton time to melt.  On the first visit, soup was followed by a very good Caesar Salad with Parmesan splinters and tasty clusters of toasted Romano Cheese.  On the second, an equally fine George's Chopped Salad was served.  This dish featured Iceberg Lettuce, tomatoes, green onion, bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, and ample avocado chunks all tossed in a flavorful Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing.Both entrees I ordered were delicious.  One was Bacon-Wrapped Meatloaf and mashed potatoes, served with excellent Brown Gravy, mushrooms, green beans, carrots, and onions.  To my surprise, I liked this dish even better than I did the Pancetta Wrapped Meatloaf with Mushroom Gravy I had recently enjoyed at Postrio, and later praised.On the second outing, I was presented with a gigantic bowl topped by a thin sheet of crust beneath which lay the other ingredients of an excellent Chicken Pot Pie.  The crust and filling were not connected, but all it took to do so was to break the crust into pieces with a large spoon provided.  Inside the bowl were numerous chunks of white chicken meat, peas, carrots, pearl onions, tender potato chunks, and pieces of Button Mushrooms, all merged with a garlicky Cream Sauce that tasted good but was too peppery to me.  The crust was buttery and no different than a very good doughy top clinging to a traditionally prepared Chicken Pot Pie.  The result was successful, just like the independent-component and memorable Lobster Pot Pie I enjoyed at Michael Mina's Stonehill Tavern inside the St. Regis Hotel in Dana Point, California.  Unfortunately, Diane ordered Chicken Parmesan with specially requested Alfredo Sauce, which was graciously supplied.  But, while the portion of Chicken Parmesan and linguini was immense, the sauce was really thin and insipid.  Hopefully, this was but an infrequent aberration.An excellent homemade and gigantic Chocolate Chip Cookie covered by a scoop of ordered Vanilla Ice Cream was the highlight of the second meal, even better than B.J.'s Pizookie, which I also happen to like.Service on both occasions was friendly and very attentive.  It needed to be, because on the initial encounter, clumsy me overturned my straw-topped glass and spilled the entire contents of an almost fully filled Iced Tea right onto the lap of my Yelp friend Mamie P.  She brushed off this accident very well but I knew that it must have felt like an icy-cold assault, and felt badly about it.  When notified, the restaurant staff immediately charged into action, swiftly cleaning up the mess and providing new napkins, Iced Tea, and a new bread loaf, which also took a light hit from flying brown liquid drops.  The restaurant has a dark woodsy look, and reminded me of San Francisco's Tadich Grill where I liked to dine when I had been able to scrounge up enough money to do so while attending law school in the city.  Papers littered the floor of the men's restroom on one visit to Triple George, but after I alerted my server about this, within one hour the messy restroom had been cleaned up.  I greatly enjoyed both dinners, and intend to return soon to try the Country Fried Steak.4-1/2 stars!The blackened swordfish of the day was cooked perfectly but the chef drowned it in pepper, which was unfortunate because otherwise this fish would have been delicious. The squash soup (also a special of the day) tasted like it came from a can. The service here is very good but the food just doesn't add up.I am so disappointed with my experience this past Saturday night. I made a reservation for a girl's night with my sister and some friends. I had heard amazing things about the food so we thought we'd get dressed up and give it a try.We called on our way to let the staff know we were running a few minutes behind, and were about 5 people less than we anticipated. They were fabulous and made sure we didn't lose our spot in the process. Kudos to the ladies up front. They were great.When we were seated we immediately got to looking over our menu. I have a dairy allergy so I had planned ahead and read the menu online. On the website they offer a vegan menu, so I happily chose the ravioli in advance, as a dish I don't normally get to eat. When our waiter (Cameron) arrived we were all prepared with our choices, and even ordered an appetizer. I ordered the ravioli, even though the vegan menu wasn't presented to us. Someone ordered a steak, and one of our friends ordered the chicken alfredo, with an addition of shrimp as well.  As the waiter took each of our orders, he asked if we wanted a house or ceasar salad. We were excited for our food. About 10 minutes later I received my salad, bread and then a (very unprofessional) tap on the shoulder.  The waiter was there to let me know that the vegan ravioli are not available. But they had a meatless chicken marsala, a meatless chicken bruscetta and a meatless burger. I let him know that I am allergic to dairy, but I do eat meat, so I'd rather see the regular menu, if possible. He kind of just stared at me like I had a few extra heads, and then moved to grab me the menu. When he returned, he hovered while I made my selection. I explained I would like the lemon herb chicken, but I would need it made with oil, and not butter, if that's how it's made. Again the waiter looked at me like I was crazy, so I added, "Please tell the kitchen staff I have a dairy allergy, no worries". And again he stared. And he said "Well you can't have mashed potatoes, no can you." (You see the menu doesn't tell you what the sides are, only that they are pared by a chef). So I told him no, to which he replied "So veggies and pilaf then??". And I said that was fine.Then we waited. More than 45 minutes came and went. No appetizer, no water refills, no checking on us, nothing. Our food arrived and our friend's dish did not have both chicken and shrimp. It had just shrimp. So we explained to the expeditor the issues, and that we never received out appetizer. We explained that we weren't mad, just wanted to make sure that these items were not on our final bill. The expeditor said he'd let our waiter know. A few moments later the waiter showed up with a manager and they apologized for the mix ups, though the waiter did not seem very sincere. We finished our meals and our plates were cleared pretty quickly. The waiter came back and seemed much more sincere. He admitted that he had just plain forgot to input our appetizer. He handed us a desert menu and let us know we could pick one desert on the house. We excitedly started looking over the menu........15 minutes later, we had to flag over the waiter for our check. We let him know, while the offer was nice, we now had to go, so we did not want our free dessert. He insisted that we take it to go. We explained that we could not trust that we would get it quickly, and thus, only wanted our check. A few minutes later the check was dropped on our table. And to my absolutely disappointment, I found our salads for a fee on our check. The waiter never explained that we were paying for salads. We each ordered our entrees and then the waiter asked "House salad or ceasar?" We were led to believe that was part of our meal. So we flagged down a manager. We explained the situation and he stated "The salads have a price on the menu", in a condescending tone. Salads have a price everywhere. That way if that's all you want to eat, you can order that. Such crap. So he stated if we wanted, he'd take the salads off, and walked away. And then, from behind our booth, he handed our check back and said "HERE". And upon inspection, our of the salads remained. We paid it. But only because we'd had enough.We didn't tip. We don't even feel bad about it.Finally stumbled on in and honestly, I enjoyed it!Sat at the bar, which is INCREDIBLY LONG, in order to enjoy the 4-7 p.m. happy hour.Seriously, the bar fills the entire room.  But, I digress...Ordered the $5 calamari happy hour special, $5 "American Mule" and wedge salad.First of all, the calamari is a great deal.  You get it in a big 'ole cone with two dipping sauces.  One is cocktail, the other tasted like something tartar-y, but better.  The breading was perfect, not too heavy, well spiced, and crispy.  The portion was really generous too for a $5 special.  I would totally order this again.The wedge salad, also good, was a good find.  I generally order a wedge wherever and whenever I can find it.  But, I have to agree with other reviewers, no bacon is WEIRD.  I feel like Triple George Grill is intentionally messing with everyone when they present a lovely wedge but NO bacon.  Shenanigans.The "American Mule" was tasty but not strong at all.  I appreciated that it was served in the traditional copper mug but I'd order a regular price drink next time in order to actually get some alcohol.Overall, good service, good food, world's longest bar, all good.Walking in I fell in love with the atmosphere. It was really relaxing, but never again will I order from a prix fixe menu. My husband and I had a reservation for Valentines Day and decided to go with the special menu they were offering for $99 a couple. Items ordered:-Bisque of Love (lobster meat)-Be Mine Cocktail (shrimp cocktail) -Bow N Arrow (twin stuffed lobster tail w/mashed potatoes/asparagus) -Fall in Love Duo (lava cake/ice cream/chocolate covered strawberries)All of the food had good flavor but I was not a fan of the mashed potatoes. They were a bit too runny for my liking, they didn't taste fresh, and kind of tasted like instant mashed potatoes. The lobster was on the tough side. I really had to get in there with my steak knife, at one point I thought it was going to fly across the room because I was being so aggressive trying to cut into it. The dessert was amazing but by the time we received it, the ice cream on top of the lava cake was already melting and had formed a pool of ice cream on the plate. I did not get full off of the dishes we ordered. We went someplace else to eat afterwards. Price vs. amount of food was not justifiable. I should have stuck to the regular menu. We could have had a better, cheaper meal.. Our server Brenda was really nice. My husband ordered the beef tartare without knowing what it was, shame on him. He refused to eat it when it was brought out and Brenda was kind enough to switch it out for the shrimp cocktail, she was very attentive and friendly throughout the entire meal. I will be back again because I really want to try the pot roast, but until then they get 3 stars from me because of our very friendly server and great atmosphere.How have I never seen this place on Yelp?  I've always done searches in the area and it's never come up on my feed.  What a damn tragedy that I've been missing out on this here joint for 6 years. Enjoyed this place last night before heading down to lend an ear to Rise Against. Awesome.  Really awesome food.  Service was okay.  They were busy but the waiter was super nice. We had - Their sourdough bread with their pepper flake olive oil.  I am the biggest sucker for some good bread.  I would eat it by itself for dinner if it was healthy for me.  So damn good. Blue cheese wedge - not as big as the waiter had claimed but the dressing was very tasty. Lamb chops - cooked more rare than medium rare. Which was perfect regardless because it was perfect.  From the flavor to the mashed potatoes; some of the best lamb I've had. Seafood fettuccine - a little spice and the scallops were OH so delightful.  The sauce was super buttery and thick. So beware, but it was full of flavor. Come here if you haven't been to this place.  And hopefully it shows up on people's feed.  Worth every penny.  And they play sports for you crazy sports fanatics.
Garden Buffet=This buffet is located at South Point which is a bit further from the strip but we were here for the rodeo competition and were hungry so to the buffet we headed.For $15 we went in for lunch...which included mimosas. They had normal buffet food...but it wasn't great quality. I still ate 3 plates:Plate 1: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=fsbBhNLTpOun8rUazxefNAPlate 2: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=3sTWwO4oZ9xzTrzigk9ADgPlate 3: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=AlXdm4Rww07ObBjUKh3odQI ate because I was hungry...but when your in Vegas, the city of buffets, there are better buffets to venture!We stopped here on a whim for dinner, not even looking at the Yelp reviews in advance. I would definitely have been scared off, if I had looked so that's probably a good thing. My fella is a sucker for buffets so I decided to be a good girlfriend. There was no line and we noticed that they offer a discount with a rewards club so we made sure to get one before we went. The prices weren't great, but we decided to still give it a shot. We were seated quickly and the server was very friendly and brought our drinks. The line was pretty well stocked. They had a lot of variety, which I was little surprised by. It was a basic buffet, but unlike some of the more expensive buffets in town, they had a lot of things to choose from and it was better than expected. They have themed nights so that's fun. Definitely a better experience than expected. Not the best food or buffet in town, but a solid choice if you're at South Point.As far as buffet goes, it's okay. Price was so so. You get a discount if you have a players club card. (Only the card member, not your whole party gets the discount, which sucks when you're with a bunch of kids)They had a variety of cuisines (Seafood, BBQ, Chinese, Mexican, But nothing stood out. Service was very efficient and friendly. I can't say I would recommend this place. There are other options you might want to explore before coming here.
The White Chocolate Grill=So, my dad took me here today and billed it as an "upscale Houston's."  I think not.This place is a total Houston's rip-off.  Seriously, the decor is the same, the smell when you walk in is the same, the servers' outfits, the menu, the drinks, the silverware - I guess you see the point.So I ask the server, "are you affiliated with Houston's?" He goes off on a story about how the WCG is an original concept and much better than Houston's - yada yada, save it for someone who isn't an aficionado of the Houston's persuasion.If you are going to say all of that, and clearly be a rip-off of my *favorite* restaurant, then you had better live up to the name.  And frankly, they don't.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad with mango and avocado (surprisingly, Houston's has the EXACT SAME SALAD - only better).   It was good, as I was jonesing for some tuna - but I could have done without the heavy sesame crust and the drenching with dressing.  My dad has the rotisserie chicken, and was so disappointed that they ended up taking it off of the bill (it was cold and dry).  We both had fresh-squeezed Arnold Palmer's - and they had ooky sugar-coated rims.  No thanks.The french fries were excellent, yay french fries.  Oh, and surprisingly, you can get them with mustard-honey dressing, just like at Houston's - though again, it wasn't as good.You know, it is probably a 3-star restaurant, but I was so put-off by the whole "we aren't Houston's and that restaurant sucks" attitude - when they are so clearly trying to be Houston's, that I will not ever be back.  If I want Houston's I will get the real thing, and it will taste better.Plus, I think the name is super lame.  The service was fine, the place is fine - but just go get the real thing, it is worth the wait.**UPDATE**I upped my star rating to 3 because the GM contacted me and explained a bunch about the restaurant.  I really appreciate such personalized customer service - he certainly didn't have to be so nice.  So, I will try WCG again and hopefully pull the rating up another star!  I still think the name is funny . . .** ANOTHER UPDATE **I was harassed by a fellow "reviewer" of the WCG who was clearly affiliated with the restaurant.  This "reviewer" has no other reviews and is a bit fishy.  I do not appreciate being contacted to argue about the experience I had and this type of activity destroys the integrity of Yelp.  I will not be returning to WCG and neither will anyone I know in AZ (they will all be hearing this story!).  Plus, we like Houston's better, anyway, so this will not be a loss!Yes, it may be a chain (there are locations in Vegas and Chicago too), but WCG is a special restaurant... with top notch service, awesome food & drinks, fun atmosphere, and moderate prices, I have to give 5 stars.  I almost don't want to give 5 stars, just because they're a chain, but after my experience there tonight, I feel they deserve an all-star rating!I arrived first (as usual) and put our name in (party of 4)... it was prime time (7:30 on a Friday night), so I expected a wait.  (They don't take reservations during dinner; only lunch).  I was given a beeper thing, and no more than 5 minutes later, it vibrated.  The rest of my party was not even there yet!  The hostess sat me anyways - there was a great table available in the bar area.  Alicia was our server and approached me within minutes of sitting down to take my drink order.  I also ordered the artichoke appetizer for the table.  The rest of my party arrived and Alicia was back to take their drink orders. share the specials, answer questions, etc...3 of us ordered the crab cake entree (2 with a side of broccoli and 1 with a side of honey roasted carrots) - and my dad had the halibut with fries... everything was delicious!  The crab cakes are not breaded at all; they melt in your mouth!  The broccoli is steamed just right and sprinkled with parmesan and some special seasoning that makes it taste great.  The carrots are sweet like candy.  I didn't have any, but the fries that came with the fish looked good too!In the past, I've also had the Four Cheese Spinach & Artichoke Dip (served with warm tortilla chips and salsa), the Rotisserie Chicken Tortilla Soup, and several salads... I've always been impressed with the quality, taste, and serving sizes too!I didn't tonight, but if you can - save room for dessert!  The desserts are actually listed at the top of the menu, so they stand-out - for good reason!  They are all phenomenal!  My favorites are the White Chocolate Brownie, the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie with Graham Cracker Crust, and the apple pie a la mode!Yes, the menu is similar to Houston's; yes, the bar is a replica of Ocean Club... but, the service and quality of WCG make this place unique and worth every bit of the 5 star rating I'm giving them!EDIT: Service on a Friday night was not quite as great... I'll keep their 5 star review, but i'm rounding up now from a 4.5.  We'll see what happens next visit!Is it wrong to update a review a lot?! I went in and decided to try a new item other than my usual rotisserie chicken , which did I mention was like the most delicious thing ever?For some reason I just wanted like a sandwich. I wouldn't think of them for a sammy(my girlfriend hates when I call them that) I got the club BUT it isn't like other clubs. They actually rotisserie up the turkey themselves so it isn't shitty processed nitrate grossness. it was moistest, non gamey, turkey ,the most crisp bacon,awesome cheddar and peppered tomatoes so damn good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got it with no mustard or mayo and a side of BBQ.  The mustard I got on the side too. mayo is gross. But the BBQ I think they make, it is kinda fruity like cherries or something perfect to dip every other bite in. The have crappy fries so dont get them as a side the mashed potatoes are very good and they added a speck of nutmeg and have a fresh thin jus from the chicken. They are really good and normally i would never order mashed potato's. The cous cous is pretty good it has a cilantro yogurt sauce and raisins and pistachios. very pleasant ;)I did try to get a burger once and I took it back, never get a burger. If the burger was good they would get 5 starsWe went on Saturday night and this place was packed. Luckily I had made reservations beforehand. The bar area is pretty cool, but it and the dining area were so loud. We sat on the patio, which is covered and has fans and misters so we could actually hear each other talk. We tried the date night special. It included 1 appetizer, 2 salads, 2 entrees and a dessert to share for $58. The AZ rolls were a pretty tasty appetizer, even though I had to pick the corn out of it. I enjoyed my WCG Bacon Blue Cheese salad. It would have been a lot better had they used spinach instead of mixed greens. The Caesar came with some nice big shavings of parm. Yummy. We both decided on the Parmesan Fillet for our main. The parm was a little overwhelming. We both pushed most of it aside, but the meat was very tender. My mashed potatoes started off yummy, but got pretty hard toward the end of the meal. We split the White Chocolate Brownie for dessert and it was pretty good, but we were so full we didn't finish. Service was slow. We were here for almost 2 hours, but our waiter was very friendly. Everyone I know really likes this place so I think we may come back and give it another chance.I have to lawyer up a little early in my review this time...http://tinyurl.com/4julqgDo you miss the simple, twisted genius of Warren Zevon, too?At any rate, to fully disclose,  I know the owner of WCG personally and businessally...You'll just have to trust me when I tell you that this didn't shade my review...in fact quite the opposite...I have been sitting on this for a while...trying to figure out how write this without sounding like a shill!Then I thought, "Well, Donald, everyone is still entitled to my own opinion" so here we go!WCG is one of my favorite places in the Greater Phoenix Area for a number of reasons:* The menu is so varied, creative and well executed...everything from the Mesquite Grilled Artichokes to the Roasted Chicken to the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad and my favorite, the Maytag Burger (more about that in a minute) is well prepared and delicious* The service has always been first rate (and I have to say that I expected that when the server is aware that I am friends with Bobby, but there are ton of people there that don't know me from Tyler Florence and we still get great service!)* Extraordinary care in the preparation of the food, from the grinding of the beef for my burger to the grilling of the artichokes and the construction of the puff pastry crust Apple Pie for desert...they pay incredible attention to detail* The atmosphere and ambience remind me (and not by accident) of one of my Northern California favorites, the Rutherford Grill...all cherry tones, leather and soft lighting...it always puts me in a great mood and compels me to eat more than I shouldToday was no different...The Beautiful Carin and I stopped in for a lunch meeting to discuss our business, our branding, goal setting for the company (is world domination within 48 months too lofty a goal?) and what not (I set foot in this Northern California inspired place and I start to sound like Ah-nold again and so forth).For my lunch, I had one of the best burgers in town...the Maytag Burger...they grind the meat on the premises, daily, fresh...no kidding!For the "Maytag" portion of this earthly delight, they bake and crumble the bacon into the Maytag Bleu Cheese (notice my fancy French spelling there...merci') and form it into a disk of cheese and bacon that they drop onto the burger a few seconds before it's done and voila'...the best bacon/bleu cheese burger around...bacon and cheese in every bite...genius!Carin has her favorites, too...the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad is one, as is the Spit Roasted Chicken and some of the best Crab Cakes you'll find west of Baltimore.I smile every time I walk into WCG...I smile even more (and I usually burp a little, too) when I walk out after another great meal!But don't take my word for it (another disclaimer to end my review on the right note)...go see for yourself...and try the Apple Pie...you'll be happy you did (and quite possibly burping in delight, as well).After my initial visit long ago, I re-discovered WCG with my Partner in Culinary Crime this summer.  Since then, I think we have tried a little bit of everything - lunch, happy hour, dinner, the Date Night Menu and on one occasion just dessert.  Yes, it is that good.I update my review specifically to share three outstanding items on their menu that I would be happy to enjoy again and again:Filet Mignon Cobb Salad - large enough for sharing, it is a very pretty presentation with orderly rows of marinanted filet, mushrooms, blue cheese, crutons, bacon, tomato, avocodo and egg all atop field greens in a red zinfandel vinaigrette.  I prefer it without the egg or avocado, but hey, I'm picky!Silky Chocolate Soufflé Cake - A warm chocolate soufflé cake topped with with créme Anglaise and whipped cream.  Decadent and delicious - I doubt I could ever get tired of this.  Life is short, eat dessert first!and my new favorite:Maytag Burger - WCG grinds all their meat in-house, and this juicy delight is just right!  Each bite is infused with Iowa blue cheese and applewood smoked bacon, and these flavors enhance rather than overpower the beef.  Mmmm... Beef!WCG now accepts reservations (recommended, it can get crowded) -  which are easily accessible from Yelp!  Reserve, go, eat and be merry!!four star average?Why?This place is a chain restaurant with a silly name - the family made me eat here and I will tell you this - the only thing four star here are the sexy tall young fit waiters.... everything else is weak and salty...At least they serve bourbon - but seriously the cocktail menu was silly and the preparation by the untrained bartenders was obvious - silly rolls with honey butter oh that's cute -the food was applebees meets outback  - one of those taste of the world menus - my dad was silly enough to order the prime rib - it looked like a swanson frozen dinner - poor dad - IT IS CALLED WHITE CHOCOLATE GRILL - what does that mean - oh it means we are silly and have duped people into thinking we are a trendy restaurant.So sad - seriously the service is lovely and attentive the food is better prepared and home with more flavor and less salt - i guess the real french fries - the string kind were yummy but I needed to up my BP meds.oh and a funny decor thing - they use rolled up, stacked utensils in napkins as sorta sculptural decor around the restaurant - sorta weird
The Skeptical Chymist=I had a blast at Skeptical Chymist last night... Thanks again to the yelpers that came out for trivia - Although 'Team Yelp Yourself' didn't win any major prizes, we sure had fun!  I love the atmosphere at SC - so laid back and the staff is friendly as can be!  I wasn't sure I'd be able to find a light bite to eat (I was expecting heavy Irish bar food), but I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed my house salad with salmon. I sampled the curry fries from Kelly B and dare I say they were the best I've had?!  I would go back just for those!  Delicious!  Both items went well with the Strongbow apple cider too. Thanks again, Jolene (my waitress) for your recommendations!I look forward to checking out live music at Skeptical Chymist another time soon... or perhaps returning once I brush up on my trivia knowledge.  Either way, I'll be back for sure!Sundays are a good day to do, well, a whole lot of nothing.  After a successful day of avoiding anything useful or constructive, a friend and I decided to stop by for some Irish-style refreshments.  Located in what seems to be the World's Largest Strip Mall With Confusing Parking Lot, this is a very low-key enjoyable place.  It was not at all crowded on this particular afternoon, and as an added bonus, pints were Sunday bargain-priced at $3!  I tried my first ever Dirty Pear (Guinness on top of Ace Pear Cider) - dangerously good.  I wonder if it can be counted as a serving of fruit...You can't have an Irish bar without fish & chips, and theirs is pretty good - a large slab of lightly-battered fish which was more than enough for sharing, served with a stack of crisp french fries.  While I prefer thick-cut steak fries, these skinny ones were consumed with no problem whatsoever!  Thank you, Skeptical Chymist, for assisting me in my quest for non-productivity.I had the distinct pleasure of making the acquaintance of the King of our fair city earlier this week. At his behest, we met up at The Skeptical Chymist.At first glance, I was nervous that the venue would be incredibly small. It's tucked away in the corner of a shopping center, between a sandwich shop and a Rubio's. The storefront is immensely wide, but for some reason, it didn't appear that it would be very spacious inside.To say that I was wrong would be putting it lightly. When I walked up to the "Please Seat Yourself" sign where a hostess might stand during peak hours, I was immediately lost. There was a vast section in the center of the bar that was teeming with people there to enjoy the amazing happy hour specials (from 4:00 pm - 7:00 pm). I had to actually walk around to the right side of this group (through a small seated dining section) to reach the bar.I only had a moment to gaze at the bar while waiting for Scott D. to arrive. In that time, I noticed several different beers with which I am, sadly, not yet familiar. Though, after the night I enjoyed, I'm sure we will not be strangers for very long.When Scott D. arrived, we ordered a nice stout beer (I'm ashamed to say that I was too nervous to pay attention to the name of the ale). Scott said that it's a good idea to "start from the left, and work your way to the right" of the beers on tap. On this night, we never made it past the first tap.We picked up our ales, and headed to the outdoor patio (another pleasant surprise).  The patio was surrounded by misters, which I'm sure, offer great relief during the blistering summer months. There was a television in the corner of the patio that was airing the Thursday night NFL game. There was a walk up bar that connected to the bar in the main room. At first, it appeared that we got lost in the mix, as it took a while before a waiter came around to see how we were doing. But, once they realized their mistake, they were exceptionally quick to rectify the situation. Our server, whose name escapes me, was incredibly courteous and apologetic for the delay. He asked if we were interested in appetizers...which, after the strong ale, we absolutely were!Scott recommended the "Pulled Pork Sliders". Perhaps it was the beer, perhaps it was the situation. But the sliders were great! They come four to a plate (perfect for sharing). And since it was happy hour, we got them at half price ($5.00).As the night progressed, there was another round of the same beer. That, subsequently, led to another appetizer. For this round, Scott suggested the Chicken Tenders. Being happy hour, we only paid $4.50 for this dish. Just like before, this dish comes with four chicken tenders, making for another easy mathematical conclusion as to which way the dish should be split. I know they were chicken, but the manner in which these tenders are fried, they reminded me more of fried fish. Whatever the case may be, they were scrumptious.Cue the third round of beers, again from the same tap. (Now I HAVE to return, just so I can figure out what this beer is called!) We sat, we drank, we ate, and we were merry. We ended up chatting for more than three hours over drinks and bar fare. So, if you were paying attention, you know that we each had three stout ales and two delicious appetizers during our little pow wow. By the time the tab came, I had completely forgotten that we had been drinking and dining on Happy Hour prices. The damage was an astounding $40.00...including a generous tip! As we exited the bar (three plus hours later), it dawned on me that there was a stage upon which live music acts performed! This place is WAY bigger than I had originally though!  And did I mention the "Library"? I fear I may have said too much already...perhaps when I return, I'll venture into the rest of the nooks and crannies of this local gem!That wraps it up for my 50th review. I know, to some, 50 reviews isn't an impressive milestone. But, to me, this one was special. And, after all, everybody has to start somewhere!I hope you enjoy both the review and the venue!I'm going to give Skeptical Chymist 2 stars to average out my recent 4 star visit and my 2 recent 2 star ones.I really want to like Skeptical. They have everything I like:  Their food is very good and well priced. They have excellent specials and a huge and thoughtful craft beer menu. Plus, it's just a cool, local one of a kind place.What's the problem?  Hostility.It's a coin toss as to how you'll be treated.  I've been there probably 10 times.  One time it's great, and next time you're treated like an unwelcome intruder.Last night was the latter.  The waitress clearly did not want to be there.  She conveyed agitation from the first moment she approached our table.  She mumbled, slouched and shuffled.  We expressed an interest in the Red Hook Beers on special.  She gestured toward a poster on the wall, clearly intending that we get up, go read the poster and not trouble her by asking her to verbalize what Red Hook beers they have.  She left, we walked over to read the poster and ordered our selections.  "We're out of all Red Hook beers" she then informs us.  She impatiently demands our "plan B" beer selection.  My wife was reading the beer menu.  The waitress asks me what beer I want.  I said " I'm waiting my turn to see the list" She let out a sigh of contempt and just walked away.Monday is $5 Cheeseburgers, which is a fantastic deal.  My son ordered one.As I ordered mine, she barked over me as I spoke:"I'll have to charge you for the water"What? "I'm going to charge you for water"  Why are you going to charge for a glass of water? "Because you have to order a drink for that deal and he (gesturing toward my son) only has water."What a very charming diplomat you are, miss. He'll have a Coke, thank you so much for asking.The food was good but again the waitress just had this impatient "I hate everyone" attitude the whole time.  Later we asked "Can we order more beer before happy hour ends?  She just says "Yes" and keeps walking.  We looked at the board, read the menu and carefully select which beers we wanted.  She shows up with 2 glasses of what we had ordered at first.  I said "What are these?"  "Your beers"  "We didn't order our second beers yet""These are what you ordered before""We didn't want those again, we wanted something different""Oh" ...and left them anyway, sighed (again) and walked away. End of discussion.No "sorry"No "What did you want?" No anything,  just "Oh" as in "I will put that on my list of things about which I do not care"Interestingly, she disappeared 3/4 of the way though the service and someone else took over.Expect good food, and a theoretically good beer selection but do not expect good service because this is not the first time the level-of-service-coin toss landed tails up..
Mucho Gusto Taqueria Mexican Bistro=Let me exalt your praises, Mucho Gusto. Don't blush darling. Our love will not remain in the shadows! Do you remember the time that you almost tried to set my boyfriend on fire? You put on an amazing little impromptu firework show when your misters got into a fight with that pesky string of lights, but you were kind enough to quell our fear and try to erase that memory with free alcohol, you wily little minx. You needn't delete him from the equation. We're usually game for a three way with you, Mistress Gusto.That was right when the two happiest hours in my otherwise hellacious day were coming to an end. You do know that between the hours of four and six, your warm embrace and sweet nectar are all I need to forget about the dramarama of the office. The memories of your hibiscus, tamarind and mango margaritas, frosty Dos XXs and generous glasses of sauvignon blanc bring a smile to my face, especially with a three dollar price tag.And you're always very gracious when I graze freely on the chips and salsa when I'm feeling frugal. I don't know what combination of chili and spices you sprinkle on your toasty little delights, but they're positively divine. Although they can't even hold a candle to your tasty salsa.To help keep me from acting like a lush, which would greatly embarrass me in your presence, you offer half price appetizers during happy hour. That guacamole of yours with the pomegranate seeds has a zesty twist, while your gigantic Mexican pizza and mountainous machaca nacho plate have lured large groups of my friends to your patio and bar on many an occasion. Sharing is caring, and you're trying to teach the world to be a better place, one shrimp cocktail at a time. When I'm feeling like a nice lunch or dinner instead of our usual rendezvous, your pozole always brings me happiness, with snow white hominy afloat in a sea of green and lots of tortillas to sop up that goodness. Your Colorado Stew is likewise as delectable, as are the Mexican street tacos. I especially dig how you let me mix and match three tacos, so I can add a red chili pork taco and fried fish taco into the mix!Your cute little bistro setting with the beaded lamps and cushy bench seating made a delightful setting for a first date, while your exemplary menu, service and specials has had me coming back ever since. It's a good thing I'm not the jealous type, because I want to share you with all of Tempe.My new favorite Mexican place in Tempe. Love their tacos. Their menu only lists them individually, but feel free to mix and match. I usually go with one camarone and one pescado. The shrimp are small, but there are lots of 'em. And the chunks of fried fish are bigger than the taco itself. Portions are generous - I'd have to skip breakfast to be able to finish more than two. Service is friendly and efficient - easy to get in and out during your lunch hour. Also a great spot for happy hour.
Garcia's Las Avenidas=I am a second generation Garcia's Las Avenidas patron, as my folks frequented the little taco stand down the street that started the whole thing. I swear instead of a pacifier, my mom put a Garcia's shredded beef taco in my mouth, and its been love ever since.This is hands down one of my favorite places to get Mexican food and I love that the family has stuck to their roots even as the neighborhood has changed drastically over the years. The staff is friendly and consistent (in other words - go often - and you get treated like family).I would offer up suggestions for the best menu items, but truthfully I LOVE IT ALL.  Everything is made fresh on-site so quality has never been a question. One thing I would add to Kristin's review is that if you are looking for a deal, the prices at the Take Out center are about 1$ cheaper per item. The only down side is that you can't order Margaritas to go, so if you want one, drink it down while you are waiting for your order to come up.Since I live about 10 minutes from the location, I usually hop in my car, hit my speed dial to order, and depending on whether or not there are a lot of cars in the drive thru line, cruise right on in to grab my food and go.  Portions are pretty large, so if you are ordering a two item combo or one of their dinners, plan on leftovers. But where else can you get two meals with chips & salsa for around 10 to 12 bucks??Oh and did I mention the Fried Ice Cream? Messy as all get out, but OMG is it good!!!When I was a teenager I worked at Garcia's Metrocenter. As a lowly busboy at the chain restaurant I learned about how restaurants work. The job also offered me up some amazing Mexican food and all the chips and salsa I could eat. In the years I worked there, those never got old.Back then, the operations were still watched over by the Garcia family, who had sold the name and concept to a large corporation. Today, the chain serves pretty much some of the most mediocre Mexican food around and many of their stores have closed.However, the Garcia family wasn't dumb; they kept the best for themselves. The Original Garcia's Las Avenidas in Phoenix is still owned and operated by the Garcia family, as it has been for more than 50 years, and is not connected to the chain. Many of the dishes you remember eating as a kid can still be found and enjoyed here.From the outside, the building has lush landscaping and a separate building for takeout orders. The interior is reminiscent of an old Spanish home with low slung ceilings and lots of woodwork. The main dining room is cavernous, like walking into a Mexican courtyard, bright and inviting.Once seated, guests are greeted with a bowl of hot tortilla chips and a cruet of mild chunky tomato salsa. It took me right back to my busboy years. If you prefer more spice, ask for hot sauce, which they will provide upon request. I enjoy mixing the two sauces for a tasty hybrid.To take advantage of the salsas, a Cheese Quesadilla ($5.50) is a must. I always ask for a side of lettuce and chopped tomatoes so I can adorn each crispy slice, then pour on some salsa.The menu hasn't changed much over the years, which is a good thing. It's nice to know that you can always order your favorite dish, like my all-time Garcia's favorite the Pollo Fundido ($9.95). They take stewed chicken meat, then wrap it in a flour tortilla and fry it until it's light and crunchy. It's topped with smooth jalapeño cream cheese and slices of cheddar cheese then placed under a broiler until the cheeses are melted and bubbly. Served with rice and beans, each creamy bite is sure to please.The Combination Appetizer ($9.25) offers hearty miniature-sized versions of Mexican classics. This plate includes miniature beef tacos, beef flautas, beef chimichangas, green corn tamale and refried beans. Give this plate a good dousing of salsa and it'll be hard to stop eating. Aside from the mini chimichangas, the cheesy green corn tamale really hits the spot with hints of sweetness.If you can avoid eating the crunch flour tortilla shell, the Taco Salad ($7) loaded with seasoned ground beef, might be a healthier choice.Desserts stick to the classics, such as Flan ($4.50) and Sopapillas ($4.25). My favorite is Deep Fried Ice Cream ($4.75), a ball of hard frozen vanilla ice cream covered in honey and cornflakes then quickly fried so the outside is slightly caramelized and crackled.While I'll probably never go back to busing tables, the idea of all-you-can eat chips and salsa sure makes it tempting.
Samba=Mlife Black gave us a free room at The Mirage and a free meal here.  So who are we to turn down some free food?  Mr. W. and I just so happened to take my parents to Vegas for them to be tourists like good children one weekend and this offer pretty much just fell into our laps.  So let's eat some meat!!!After having the best Brazilian BBQ in Vegas, I was hoping for a similar experience.  "Disappointment" seemed to be on the menu.  While the hostesses were rude and the waitress was no where to be seen majority of the time, the lovely servers with their sticks of grilled meats were always out and about between tables.  They kindly gave us these red-and-green colored things to let them know when they can bother us with more meat and when to give us a break.  They seemed pretty oblivious to this though and just kept wandering by.  I really don't mind since they're really just showing off all they had to offer and there was a pretty good variety but everything was so ridiculously dry.  Bite after bite of beyond-well-done meats were piled onto our plates and something within the first ten bites made my stomach churn.  "Where's the bathroom?" I had asked politely to a snooty waitress.  "We have none here.  You have to go to the casino floor."  How friggin convenient.  Why WOULD a restaurant need a bathroom after all?  It's either that or that female dog lied.  That... female dog...!None of us were impressed and I'm glad the meal was free because I wouldn't pay to dine here.  It's such a pity because the ambiance is actually quite nice and it's right across from the Revolution Lounge and next to the elevators.  Oh well.
DragonFly=Imagine this: you are very hungry, having a difficult time deciding what to eat, figure it out, turns into a craving, get there, you are turned away = frustrated and put out. My husband and I decided to go to DragonFly since we had not been there in a while. One of the things that we liked about the place was that they closed at 10pm. We got there and walked in by 9:40pm (knowing that we'd arrived in the past later than that and still received good service). We were turned away!Not a good customer service decision. DragonFly staff, I realize you want to go home, but if you advertise that you stay open until 10pm, stay open until 10pm.Honestly a 2.5, but I am going with a two based on the service and smells I endured during my visit.Upon arriving on New Year's Day, around 11:30, there was only one other table dining in the restaurant. Immediately I noticed a strange smell, almost urine smell, which was very discouraging. I was seated and noticed the booth seats were torn, and didn't even up to the table. With that said, I decided to give it a chance and chose to order the shrimp with mixed vegetables lunch combo with a spring roll and fried rice, with a cup of wonton soup. I was brought egg drop soup, which tasted horrible, so after 10 minutes of trying to flag down my waiter, who was on his cell phone in the back of the restaurant, I expressed that I received the wrong soup. He brought the wonton soup, which was just okay, but before I even had a chance to enjoy it my lunch was delivered. The spring roll was not cooked, very doughy and bland. As for the shrimp with vegetables, very good and a nice lunch portion. The fried rice was decent, but was basically brown rice fried, one one sliver of egg and one carrot, a little disappointing. And, the most upsetting part was my waiter was MIA the entire time, and when he did stop by he smelled of smoke. I get employees need breaks, but it is not too attractive when they smell like a smoke stack, especially when handling food.Honestly, not sure I will arrive anytime soon.
Nicantoni's Pizza=1/2 & 1/2 does not equal 2 at Nicantoni's Pizza.We were looking for a local pizza place that had a larger menu with such things as Chicken Parm.  I went on Yelp and found Nicantoni's reasonably close.  I saw that Aileen had reviewed it favorably so that carried some credibility.We went and ate at the restaurant.  They have a funky atmosphere and friendly staff.  Working so far.We shared a pie and my wife ordered the chicken parm.  It looked good and came with a nice side of spaghetti.  The pizza was tasty with a nice thin crust.  It was slightly soggy in the middle but in fairness we had lots of toppings.  I appreciate that they charge appropriately for toppings.  So if you order 1/2 onion and the other 1/2 mushroom it counts as 1 topping not 2 as many pizza places charge.They also carry limited beer and wine which is another plus.
Sushi Wow=This place was horrible. The customer service was below average. We order AYCE and the waitress was telling the table not to order to much at a time cause it would take 20-30 minutes to get our food, but yet she said we only have an hour to eat. How can you offer AYCE and then limit the amount off food. Later in the evening we asked where the rest of our orders are and the sushi chef decide to start lying and yelling, saying that we never ordered anymore only to come back a few minutes later (mind you after they gave us dessert) and said he found the slip with our orders, but this was too late. Worst part of the whole thing is that I come to find out the next day that my friends got sick with what was most likely food poisoning. This was a major waste of money and I regret giving it a try.
Sandbar=I just want to start this review out by saying if you think wearing heels to the Sandbar is a good idea, you are f'ing retarded.. And yet, I see the same hoes wearing the same hoe-y heels and complaining that they cant walk and that the sand in between their toes is disgusting. God people are irritating. I don't love this place. In fact, I don't even really like this place. I feel like everyone who goes there has a giant stick up their ass, stares at you like you have 10 goddamn heads and the dudes.. don't even get me started on the dudes. Lets just say douche to the bag. But pluralized. 500 times.I once cut my foot open on an enormous shard of glass that was peeking out of the sand because I was dumb enough to think it was a good idea to empty my shoe out and step on the ground. Don't do this. Don't even take your shoe off ever. Also, don't get in that water. I swear a layer of syphilis was floating on the top of it last time I was there. I think a decent rake job on their pseudo beach is a must after every shift.. and perhaps some chlorine, or better yet...  bleach. Seriously, think about it.The one cool thing that ever happened at the Sandbar in the handful of times i've been forced to come here was that a dude bought 100 beers. He bought ONE HUNDRED BEERS and passed them out to whoever was close. I think I walked away with 3, and who the hell doesn't love free beer. Other than that, this place is enormous and confusing and dirty and there are random shards of glass and STD's floating around everywhere. Sorry dudes, im just, not a fan.
La Grande Orange Pizzeria=Love their Pizzas, The Avocado pizza and the mushroom party are my fave! Love the Caesar salad , yummy California rolls, love the grocery side too.Downside is no waiter service until after 4pm!  You also can't order pizza during the week until after 4pm!  Parking is a nightmare and they are always very busy. My biggest complaint would be when my family and I had went there to celebrate mothers day (not on actual mothers day) one year and they did not want us to move a couple of tables together, they expected us to all sit at separate tables...WTF.....I mean they really put up a fight over this  BUT, Of course I was not having that, and moved them anyway....I've noticed since then they have welded the tables to the ground and you CANNOT move them, so if you are going with more than 4 people it really sucks!I do Love the food so I will suffer serving myself and having to put up with the mobs on the weekend to enjoy a pizza for lunch.I had to take away a star because it's really inconvenient to go there even if the food is divine.Woah talk about confusing, starting with the entrance - we walked in through the back door, right through the kitchen.. still not sure if that was actually an acceptable thing to do. Nobody said anything if it wasn't. Then what? Looked around for a hostess, didn't see one - were we supposed to seat ourselves or get in line? Which line? The big one going out the door? The coffee station? The pastry station? Did we have to go to each one for something different? Would have asked somebody if there had been anyone to ask. Like I said, confusing. Won't be that way for you, of course, because I'm going to lay it all out for you...Ok, so there ain't really all that much to lay out.. It's pretty simple, actually. Split up, that's my advice - one of yous grab a table - there aren't many when they're busy - and somebody else get in line - doesn't matter which one. We ordered everything we needed from the coffee station. Apparently that's a secret, because the other one was going out the door, like I said.The food - we shared the french pancakes, these super thin little slices of Heaven, and the tofu "chorizo" burrito. Rockin' good breakfast. Very tasty, and a nice change of pace. Beware: the orange juice is freshly squeezed and jam packed with pulp. Cool if that's your thing, not so much if it ain't.And in retrospect, all that confusion - was all kind of part of the charm of the place. Weird, huh?Well finally! Just over a year ago Gabi invited me to lunch at LGO, then we switched and went somewhere else and that is the last time I have been on the verge of going there. Not that EVERYONE didn't recommend it. When people hear where I live they assume I'm making daily trips to LGO, which I now know, I should have been! Dottsy and I hit up LGO on Wednesday night, meeting at 7:30. Of course the place was packed, not to mention the absurd parking lot (thank god I rode my bike!), but the LGO gods smiled on me and I found two seats at the chef's table almost immediately. I took in the menu as I waited for Dottsy (late as always, but I forgive you), though honestly there's not a lot to take in as the options are few and very straightforward. Then I stared at other people's food and got really excited. So excited that it took me forever to figure out what I wanted to eat (Shrimp Ceviche, Pizzeria Chop Salad, Mushroom Party Pizza or Veg-o-rama pizza were the final four). Dottsy bought us some time by telling the server he was both 'GORGEOUS!' and had 'BEAUTIFUL EYES.' Way to take one for the team Dottsy. I went for the Pizzeria Chop Salad and the Butternut Squash Soup to start.  My soup was decent, but really, I need to stop ordering things I make really well at home because I'm never wowed. Anyway, the salad was yummy and I'd asked for no raisins and our server even came by to make sure it was raisin-free (it was, and btw he really was beautiful).  Dottsy's pizza looked great and I got to sample a slice and immediately wanted a whole pie to myself. I guess it's all the more reason to head back to LGO and work through the rest of the menu!Lemon zest?  On a pizza?  Yeah, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it.  I decided to put my faith in LGO to create a wonderful pizza experience.  And that they did!  My final verdict; the Avocado Pizza is heavenly!  The creamy avocado, sweet tomatoes, summery basil, bright lemon zest, and add in the salty prosciutto and you have yourself a pretty tasty pizza.  The best part is that you don't see that kind of pizza on the menu everywhere you go. The even better part is the sourdough crust!!  So delicious!  All of their pizza creations sound amazing.  I can't wait to try them all!  A few more tries and I easily see a fifth star in their future.It did take us a few minutes to figure out the lunch flow of the place.  - Order your food on the grocery side, - find your own table on the pizzeria side, - wait for your sandwich on the grocery side,- listen for your pizza on the pizzeria side,- ask for more ice at the coffee stand,- fill your ice tea at the table at the doorway between the two- go back to the grocery side to pick your dessert from the case (trust me, you do not want to skip this step!)In addition to the wonderful pizza and the lunch with great friends, LGO also provided a bright spot in my day by putting one of my favorite (hard-to-find) red wines right by the cashier for $10 less than I usually get it at AJ's.  Score!!How is it possible that I haven't reviewed my love; LGO? Well, better late than never and that's definitely the case with this. I'm not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said, but LGO is a classic gem in Phoenix. It's nestled among quaint houses full of character and as you walk in, you'll most likely see several beach cruisers parked along the building, waiting for their owners who take a morning bike ride to grab a bite to eat. I visit LGO when I want to pretend that I'm in California or on the ocean, or in Europe or even if I want to forget that it's 100+ degrees outside. I visit LGO when I need to do work but want to get out of my normal routine. I can grab some food and set up shop at one of the several tables or booths, or even outside. Plus, I don't need to worry about my battery dying here, for they have several power outlets so I can keep my computer's juices flowing for hours. The scene here is crazy, cool, relaxing and fun all at the same time. I'll see every type of Phoenician here and they all blend and vibe with each other like it's no big deal. The music is going, the kitchen is hustling with orders, people are chatting with old and new friends and the smell of freshly baked goods and coffee fill the air. The food here is delicious. Where to even start? Well for starters, I'll touch upon the breakfast. If I'm feeling fatty and in a hurry, I'll opt for one of their delicious muffins. If I'm feeling healthy and in a hurry, I'll go for the yogurt, granola and fruit. And...if I'm feeling fatty and lazy, I'll order one of their delicious hot meals and sit there and enjoy it. Lunchtime is my favorite and it most likely has something to do with their food. I adore the tuna melt but I only order it on calorie-counting free days. I also like the tuna salad, and turkey stack sandwich. Anything on their menu is amazing. Now moving on to dinner. Yes friends, they serve the famous Chelsea's hamburger here, so I can fulfill my cravings without having to fight the Chelsea's crowds. Their pizza is for champions and delectable. The pizza kitchen doesn't open until four and goes until late hours in the night. It's a perfect spot for a casual yet tasty meal. I will leave with a couple additional tidbits of fun facts. They sell the reusable plastic glasses that are trending up the city these days. While it's pricey on the front end ($12+), you can then fill it with coffee (even iced) or tea for I want to say just a dollar or two which isn't bad! Craving LGO but can't find a space or better yet, too lazy to get out and walk in like I am half the time? Luckily the lazy fairies are watching over us for LGO offers some excellent curbside pick-up. I will call on my way there, drive in, park, they come right out, I give them my card, they grab the food, I pay, and I'm on my way. It's seamless and I love it... just like I love LGO as a whole. I wish they opened one walking distance to me.The buzz on the street is their pizza will blow your stinky socks off your feet! Well, not exactly in those words, but in that promising context!If you know me like the back of your hand, you would already know what I look for! The crust! For one, I am a carboholic!  Whether that be bread, donuts, or rice, I cherish that food group immensely.I firmly believe the most critical bite in a pizza is going to be your first one! It will make or break your love for it! Why? Because its the closest you will get to freshness since the time it popped out of the oven! Bam! Love at first bite! Just the sight and smell caused some drool-age! It had the right amount of crispness and thinness.  The bottom crust had a slight charcoal, the way one should always like it! And the middle layer still soft enough for some bending and flexibility!Crust Test: Pass. During my most recent visit, the amigos and I decided on the "Gladiator." Yup! I guess it was indeed the most manly pizza you could get here. Glorious meat! The schreiner's sausage and pepperoni were cooked very nicely!  The cheese and sauce were no match for the meat! They played more of a subtle role but still contributed to a wonderful pizza experience.Sauce and Toppings Test: Pass.With all that said, I want to clearly say, this is not what I call a true Italian pizza.  As great as it was its hard for me to put it on the same level as some well-known places like Pizzeria Bianco, which will always be my numero uno.The major difference is in the sourdough crust.  To me, this is what defined their pizza. The one trait that separates them from the Italian style is how it is NOT bubbly with that brick-oven charcoal quality.  Instead, its more simple yet quite tasty.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ?select=Q0kUcPJhdZlueuitX154VQBesides everything said thus far, I want to give credit to their excellent service.  The host did a good job in booking our table and notifying my group when our time was near. Our server maintained a playful, enthusiastic attitude from the moment we sat to the time we finished our last dessert bite! Speaking of dessert, I happily decided that their Red Velvet Cake be my new go-to! The frosting and cake was not too sweet, just to my liking! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ?select=bCRxfhgIbOSC-eRUgD3M_gThe moral of the story, do not come here if you are seeking a true Italian experience.  Do come here, if you desire a wonderfully tasting pizza in a friendly, cool, upbeat atmosphere!***** This place has always been AMAZING and close to my heart!!! Everything from their food, the service and the ambiance!! It is always relaxing to come in to La Grande Orange both the grocery store and or pizzeria. It has a very nice uniqueness to it as well as a very tasteful satisfaction.      As for our meal my boyfriend and I had their amazingly minty Cesar salad to start, then their exquisite ceviche and to end the MUST, The Rocket Man pizza!! lets not forget their fruity sangria!! VERY YUMMY!!! Oh and yes everything was GREAT!!! :)    Honestly, last night was my best visit so far, we got to sample their complimentary wine tasting and this to us was a perfect touch for our night!!!    La Grande Orange is simply as best as AZ gets, so experience it yourself and thank me later!!! :)Everyone loves LGO. Well, almost everyone. I see a few one and two star nuts in the mix.  It's one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix too, but I have to say, the pizza is more like 3 stars. It is good, but not great. Just not a big fan of their crust. Now, the burgers, decor, service and people watching are all awesome. Plus it is attached to the LGO grocery store which is great.Last night I had their green chili burger for the first time and thought it was great. The beef was delicious and cooked to order, the roasted green chili tasted great, and even though it is borderline sacrilege, when at LGO, you gotta go with one of their massive English Muffins instead of a bun. I think it could be even better with melted American cheese, but the shredded cheddar is a nice alternative to the slice. The side of fries were awesome and they give you more than enough.After dinner I suggest you go over to the grocery store area and try one of the delectable desserts. I'm a fan of the Tammie Coe Ooey Gooey cupcakes myself. Parking's a bitch, but you can understand why. It's a great place. Check 'em out. You'll probably like it a lot.On Saturday I want to punch people in the face when here.  Mediocre food, overhyped, overpriced, no parking, bad service, and waaaaaaaaay too many people to enjoy yourself. Once upon a time you may have been worth it but with so many solid offerings in Phoenix these days your entitled attitude is not warranted.No it's cool, I'll clear off the table that you just walked by four times with nothing in your hands.  What's that?  Oh I shouldn't do that?  I should just stand here and look at the table full of dishes until you walk by a 6th time?  Ok.  Hey, one more thing. Kiss my ass.As far a pizza goes I have to say that LGO's pizza is just okay. I love, love, and I mean love pizza. I would eat it every day. Cold for breakfast even. But the pies I have had here definitely left something to be desired. I love the toppings and the interesting flavours but I am sill waiting for that wow factor that makes me want to have this pizza again and again. (** I do love that they will halve the specialty pizzas for you with no qualm. You can try two pies in one visit.)There are a few pies on my "need to try that" list. So I will be back. Plus I really want to try the burgers and the wings. I'd say at the least two more trips in the near future, of my own will. Maybe more if someone else chooses to invite. I love the chandelier in the dining area and the TV over the long bar. This place has a nice rustic feel in with the concrete bar top and the rich dark wood tables. A few larger tables for a bigger party but most of the tables seat four. Or two if you're by the window. If you do not like crowds or tight spots this is not the place for you. You order your pizza on the grocery side and there are always a ton of people in this itty bitty space. The menus are near the register when they should be near the doors. But there is usually a kind staff member to ask if you need one. All in all... It is something I say you should try once. Especially if you love toying new places and love you some pizzas.8/11/11Arrived early to meet a friend for happy hour.  While I waited, I ordered a Dark 'n Stormy, which was made with Gosling's rum and ginger beer and was very satisfying. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=3I1MDsYqvtcSvZ1mEAdm3A#3I1MDsYqvtcSvZ1mEAdm3A  I recall having to nurse it, when what I really wanted to do was order another one.  We eventually ordered a pizza to share, the Fallen Angel, which consisted of local Schreiner's sausage, roasted yellow peppers, shaved fennel, and "premium cheese and red sauce." http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=mnnAJU87MV0Skbk9d5xPVA#mnnAJU87MV0Skbk9d5xPVA  Very, very good!  Great thin crust, although IMO the red sauce made for a soggy pizza.  Guess we also ordered chicken wings, although I don't remember the experience, so I most likely didn't have any.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=pwqkdvk8VnOBNmWaDH-uow#pwqkdvk8VnOBNmWaDH-uowhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=XvbD54Sj8m2i6qSa2MxCuA#XvbD54Sj8m2i6qSa2MxCuAI haven't returned, but that's because there's so many restaurants to try in this valley we live in!  I must go back before the end of the year...So, my only question for La Grande Orange Pizzeria is...can I please live here?  Seriously, this place is GREAT!  There really is no formal division between the pizzeria and grocery parts of the store, so I'm going to talk about both.  Grocery-wise, the place carries a broad mix of classic candies, wines, cookbooks, tchotchkes that rotate seasonally (I've picked up some great holiday items here in years past), and grocery staples; they also have a cafe that serves up oatmeal, eggs (friends rave about the Commuter Sandwich), salads, sandwiches, and sushi rolls.  Word to the wise - bring some extra napkins because their bakery will make you drool!  Order up front at the counter, pick a seat, and then keep your ears perked for when they call your name.  Friendly staff, cool ambience - I always find myself Shazam-ing the music here!  ;)         As far as the pizza is concerned, the crust is insane!  It almost reminds me of really good sourdough bread, toasted and crispy, not too thin and not too thick.  All the ingredients are fresh and the pizza permutations creative.  They serve up your pie on a slab of wood - nice presentation!  Sadly, I am a creature of habit - once I find something that's to my liking, I latch on and order it every time I return for the rest of my life :/ At this particular establishment, these personal faves would be the Rocket Man Pizza (spicy red fresno chilies, broccolini, roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes) and the Classic Chocolate Pudding - wow, just wow!  I make my poor husband drive all the way across town to come here - he always grumbles but in the end, admits that the place IS pretty delicious.  The only negative - and it definitely a BIG negative - is the parking situation.  La Grande Orange has the tinsiest micro parking lot known to man.  On a good day if the parking lot gods are smiling down on you, you just might find an open 20 minute parking spot (I haven't been impressed that they actually enforce the time restrictions).  But, if you go on their website under the 'Secret Parking' link (shhhh!), you will find a diagram depicting other parking options that are slightly farther away.So yeah, come check out La Grande Orange for some great pizza, brunch, baked goods, groceries...the list goes on.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix!
Mastro's Ocean Club=Wow! I have finally been able to visit Ocean Club and it was well worth it. For starters, I got there just in time to snag a parking spot right out front (Thank you parking fairies). The hostess immediately sat us even though our entire party had not arrived yet ( double score as most places won't do that) Our server's name was Darian, and at first I thought he was in a bad mood because he appeared not happy with me when I asked for a black napkin instead of blurting out my drink order first. However I had him laughing and joking with me by the end of the night and realized whatever was gone on earlier in the evening had nothing to do with me :) Score one for Darian :) Drinks - Pomegranate Martini - Good lord it was good and pricey. But you pretty much do get two drinks in one and I was practically trying to break the shaker trying to get every last drop. (Darian even showed me a few tricks to make sure I got every last drop thank you!) Appetizers - we ordered the seafood tower and it had lobster, crab, shrimp and oysters. Plus we had a side of steamed mussels. I was in seafood heaven. Everything was so good. I practically ate all of the steamed mussels myself. Heck it was a meal in itself lol. Main course - Chilean Sea Bass. Could anything be any more flakier and melt in your mouth good? Cooked to perfection and it was HUGE! Sides - we had the gorgonzola mac and cheese, sauteed spinach, and my all time favorite roasted brussel sprouts. Those that know me know I love me some brussel sprouts, so needless to say, that side was all mine. OMG! Roasted to perfection and oh so good. I actually ate more brussel sprouts then the sea bass. (What can you say I love Brussel sprouts) Dessert - There is always room for dessert and I ordered the warm butter cake. It was like sweet cornbread with fresh berries, ice cream and fresh whip cream on the side. Luckily I was sharing that with two other people because it was huge. A great way to top off the night. Oh by the way, another friend ordered the layer cake. Let's just say that was the biggest slice of cake I have ever seen in one serving. It could have easily fed a family of 4-6 lol. WOWZA! Very nice place and I am sure when I will be back again one day. But until then, I will remember how lovely the evening was by eating all the yummy leftovers :)Ocean Club used to be my go-to spot for girls night out and dates with out-of-town visitors... Sure, it's expensive, but I've never had a bad meal (or drink) there.  But, I took an unintentional hiatus from Ocean Club when I got married and had a baby, and what do you know, at least two years have passed... So when it was time to choose a restaurant to celebrate my mom's birthday dinner this past Saturday, Ocean Club it was, and once again, I was reminded how fabulous it is!  While I used to sit in the bar (where there is great people watching including plenty of "hired help," awesome bartenders, and live music), we had the baby with us and a party of five, so we were seated in a back corner... this was totally fine by the way.  They had a highchair for the baby and everything!  Tyler was our waiter and he was great... the rest of the staff was extremely attentive as well.  My husband, mom, and I went with dirty martinis, and my dad and brother went the bloody mary route.  We were all pleased with the drinks - as mentioned in other reviews, they are indeed pricey, but you get two drinks in one!Bread bowl - this is worth mentioning as they always have a nice selection of breads and crackers including my favorite: pretzel bread... yum!Appetizers at our table included two types of oysters, a lobster sushi roll, salads, and calamari.  Hint: ask to split their salads - they are still a decent size when split.  I love their "Ocean Club House salad" - It could possibly be a meal in itself as it has crisp lettuce, fresh shrimp, egg, blue cheese, tomato, and onion.  The other apps were delicious too.For my entree, I split the Chilean Sea Bass with my husband... I'm a huge sea bass fan and this is up with there with some of the best I've had.  Again, splitting it is great as even a half serving is plenty once you add family style sides, etc...  My parents went with lobster tail and brother had a bone-in ribeye.  We chose the roasted brussel sprouts and signature lobster mashed potatoes (both cooked perfectly and oh so delicious as well).  Note that it's very difficult to choose just a few sides as there are so many to choose from and they are all delicious.  The sweet potato fries, onion rings, creamed spinach, and steamed broccoli are other faves that I've had in the past.  As if any of us weren't full enough, Tyler brought out a huge slice of chocolate cake for the birthday girl, served with fresh whipped cream.  Mmmmm.... and once we licked that plate clean, we also ordered their signature butter cake, which came with more fresh whipped cream.  OMG - that butter cake is incredible!We all went home full and happy and will definitely return for more special occasions.  Thanks to my dad for picking up the bill!For my 1600th review, I chose the 3rd and final restaurant in the Scottsdale/Phoenix Mastro's trilogy.  I've dined at the other 2 restaurants and this was the last one....I am now complete! :)What more can I say about this place?  Outstanding service and food!  Wifey and I dined with 2 colleagues from out of town.  They'd never dined at a Mastro's before, so we decided to go all out and give this location a try.  Here's what we ordered during this visit:Beef Carpacciohttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=0A3PEoUl8nKmlvj8EF5-oQ#0A3PEoUl8nKmlvj8EF5-oQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=Ixj6faa-nc0dTkGppacixw#Ixj6faa-nc0dTkGppacixwShrimp Cocktailhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=3AR60YF7zUfUTlMkpHYINw#3AR60YF7zUfUTlMkpHYINw12 oz Bone-in Filethttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=QVxssj3cmGN4HCaFUaGUUg#QVxssj3cmGN4HCaFUaGUUgLobster Tailhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=7Au-elHq0sjklrUCFmc9Rw#7Au-elHq0sjklrUCFmc9RwSwordfishhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=NSB9arDBjuxvveTXfEw9yA#NSB9arDBjuxvveTXfEw9yAGorgonzola Mac 'n Cheesehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=LqVgNLZiYkTlHyI4l27kMg#LqVgNLZiYkTlHyI4l27kMgButtercakehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=fxt_7zzR_OwjQGnVuODPzw#fxt_7zzR_OwjQGnVuODPzwKey Lime Piehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=Rf66dP2sU3DFvFST48WwfA#Rf66dP2sU3DFvFST48WwfAWhipped Creamhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=V4XXNRsCPC481hDNixC9hg#V4XXNRsCPC481hDNixC9hgChocolate Cakehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-scottsdale?select=tNoj-p2RTdwGIyDk-0sDtw#tNoj-p2RTdwGIyDk-0sDtwI had the Bone-in Filet and the Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese....these are my favorite Mastro dishes.  I sampled the Carpaccio, which was phenomenal....it's soo tender and full of flavor.  For Dessert, we all shared 1,000,000 calories worth of dishes (Buttercake, Key Lime Pie, Chocolate Cake, Whipped Cream)....but it's all good when you're dining in a top notch restaurant with great people.I forgot to mention that we put away 2 bottles of Wine during dinner and a nice glass of Port at the end of dinner.  A perfect way to end an evening.Tip - Don't forget that Mastro's is not cheap.  It's a fine dining joint....expect to pay for it.Return Factor - 100%Standing on a rooftop, I shout "I absolutely love Mastro's Ocean Club!"  It's my absolute favorite place to dine when visiting Scottsdale.  I've been 4 times, for business and for pleasure (even though this makes it one of the same, 100% pleasure).The bar is beautiful, reminds me of an Absolute ad of color and things stacked atop of another magnificently, hence that's why I used ABSOLUTE so much.  I can go on and on about Mastro's, the seafood is terrific, and they even have wonderful steaks.  I have heard about the ship to shore to restaurant process, and it's nothing short of phenomenal. But what I really want to focus your attention on two things, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, and incredible, awe inspiring, Seafood Tower.  Focus, FOCUS!First, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes: creamy, lobstery, and the most perfect mashed potatoes you can imagine (I think they are buttery, too).  They will leave in a state of bliss.  They go perfect with anything you order, seafood and meat dish.  I absolutely adore this.Second, and without a doubt, the most outstanding thing on the menu, the Seafood Tower.  I've had it small (3-4 items), and I've it large (7-8 items), but I get it each and every time I go to MOC.  They clear the table, fast before your eyes.  Then, they bring out the monstrosity, a tower, 2/3/4 tiers depending on how much is ordered for how many, and the thing is smoking.  Literally.  Served on dry ice (and regular), it's a feast for king.  You have your choice from snow crab claws, crab legs, blue crab, oysters on the half shell, lobster cocktails, jumbo shrimp, lobster tails, among others.  Each and every selection is the freshest thing you can have.  I love it.  I would make sweet love to it!  It's pricey, but worthy of making credit card payments.It's a chain, I know, but the food and service has always been outstanding.
Havana Grill=Off the freeway and near the theater is Havana Grill, a Cuban-style restaurant that offers free salsa lessons on Sundays and live music on Friday and Saturday nights.The BF and I went there for dinner last night and I think it's fair to say, this was my first Cuban experience.  Of all the Cuban-style milkshakes ($4.95) to try, the guanabana was recommended and it was a fabulous choice!  It was sweet, not overly milky, and a nice finish to my dinner.  The BF tried their version of the  Caipirinha (Cachaca, a Brazilian Rum, simple syrup and limes) $7.95.  Some buttered press-grilled bread was placed before us in a basket as we perused the menu.  For our aperitivo (appetizer), we tried their Mini Sandwich Cubano $6.95.  It's a smaller version of their Cuban sandwich and it's made with tender roasted pulled pork, sliced ham, cheese, dill pickles and mustard on Cuban bread.  It's then press-grilled and served with mariquitas (fried thin green plaintains) or french fries.  It also comes with a garlic lime dipping sauce.  Don't be foolish and get french fries now, go for the plaintains for sure!  Thus far, our experience at Havana Grill was garnishing a 4 star and I was excited about our entrees.  The BF had their Boliche Mechado ($14.95), which is slow-cooked roasted eye of the beef round, stuffed with chorizo (Spanish sausage).  It's served with white rice, black or red beans, or moros.  He had them with moros.  The dish was luke-warm and lacked flavor.  If anything, it had an odd plastic wrap aftertaste that didn't fare well.  Same with the moros.  The BF ended up dousing the whole thing with hot sauce.  (I should mention that the waiter commented that this was his favorite dish, so I can only imagine his horror when we covered the whole thing with hot sauce!)I tried their version of the Lechon Asado ($14.95), which is leg of pork that is slowly oven-roasted and marinated in a mix of lemon, garlic, lime, orange juice and spices.  There are also onions that are mixed into this dish.  I had this with white rice and red beans.  Although my pork was also luke-warm, it was tender and not dry at all.  It had a lot more flavor that the other dish, although my red beans need some kick as well.Overall, we were more impressed with our Cuban sandwich than our entrees.  Service was okay.  The waiter did come by often to ask how our meal was, but we did have to request that our water glasses be refilled.  Although they didn't advertise that there was live music on a Wednesday night, apparently there was a group practicing that evening.  It might be too loud to carry on a regular conversation when music is being played.  But then again, we figure we might come back to try out their free salsa lessons and grab some other apertivos instead of doing dinner.  Salsa anyone?Sidenote: "The Las Vegas Weekly" offers a BOGO free entree coupon (up to $15.00).
Rialto Deli=This is the place you go inside the luxurious Venetian Hotel on the Las Vegas strip when you are:1. Broke after losing all of your money gambling2. Don't want to spend $50/person for lunch in a finer Venetian Restaurant3. Want a sandwich that costs less than $104. In a hurry5. Want a snack before you get into your car in the parking lot6. Is the last money you will lay down in Sin City before you leave7. All of the aboveThe Rialto Deli is inside the Food Court on the main floor of the Venetian Hotel, near the escalators going up to the parking lots.So it makes sense that you stop here for a cheap bite before you leave Sin City.You know, all of those beautiful luxury hotels, like the Venetian, with all of their Glitz, Glam, and Amenities weren't built off the "Winnings" of the visiting gamblers. Nope. To support that type of Luxury found on the Strip, you need a lot of losers willing to give it up, over and over again.
Paradise Cantina=Happy hour here I come! How can you not love 2 for 1 drinks and fattening bar food?!I enjoy the pretzel with spicy cheese sauce as my food du jour. Don't expect haute cuisine, it's just a fun place to meet up with your friends after work to drink and chat. The food isn't amazing, but you're probably just here for the drinks. Stick to pub grub. Wings and queso dip are some good options too.Keep your expectations low and have fun!Dive bar to beat all dive bars!  This place needs to move closer to my house!!!  On our way to drop off some family at the airport we were a little early so we decided to stop in for a drink of 2.  It was happy hour and ALL drinks are buy one get one.  No matter what the drink is!  Considering I drink Grey Goose or Kettle I was a little surprised.  All drinks we ordered tasted great and they did not skimp on the booze.  Not to much and not to little.Great vibe serving up mexican food and great tasting drinks.  Our total bill for a total of 12 drinks in total was $54.  Where in Las Vegas can you get drinks this cheap??  Service was great.  She was pleasant and very friendly.This is a UNLV bar so it's near and dear to my heart!  We will be back, rest assured!
Capo's Italian Cuisine=Ok, for those of you that want a short review, "the story is short":Superior Food. Superior Service. erm....UNIQUE Atmosphere. Make reservations. Give Mikey at the door some playful attitude. Tip appropriately.There, move on to the next review if you aren't into my typical prose.It's 7:15pm on Friday Night. I was motivated to go to Capo's for only one reason: a Yelper (Judith B.) wrote a bad review and the owner Nico S. responded with zeal...on Yelp...within 24 hours of each other.  So, I went to check it out myself! And there I was, 7:15pm, ringing the Speak-Easy doorbell and mixing it up with Mikey The Doorman (his card says Mikey "The Bull"), trying to get in.  Hey, it's an OLD TIME SPEAK EASY. Don't forget about the UNIQUE atmosphere, here!  Ok, all playfulness aside, the truth of the matter is I got the very last seat in the house...at the bar...right in front of the kitchen staff and the bartenders...and I had a wonderful experience! I got to see EVERYTHING being cooked. I even saw some of the back-staff at work. There are SIX cooks all working a feverish, aerobic pace to keep the food moving toward the customer. These people are MIRACULOUS at what they do. I watched the bar-staff work with equal zeal, so much so that they took the time to make friends with me because they noticed I noticed them so much. What does it say that a Bartender (Melissa) with 5 years experience takes the FRAKKING TIME to shake hands with some random customer? Wow. And John the bar-back REMEMBERED my name. AND JUSTIN the other guy behind the bar...between the three of them my water glass was NEVER empty.Ok, anyway, there are probably twenty people working at this restuarant, and each and every one of them are busting their hiney's to make every customer happy. Every Breath of Every Minute that I was there. That counts for 5 and a HALF stars to me. I'm not talking about the "I'm busy I'm busy I'm busy" attitude, I'm talking about the "Every Customer Is My Number One Most Important Customer Every Second" kind of attitude. Wow. Props, Nico.Let's pretend the service wasn't fantastic for a moment.  It was, but let's pretend, just for a moment.  Because I was curious, I ordered the Veal Piccata, pasta fagioli (say foo-ZHOOOL!), and spaghetti with red sauce (Yes, RED Sauce). Yes, I lived in Europe for 8 years. Yes, I know my way around a traditional Italian restaurant a 'la Europa, AND the American version thereof. Yes, I thought the Veal Piccata was great! Cooked TO PERFECTION in my opinion, NOT OVERCOOKED as Judith says. My particular dinner was so tasty I couldn't get over the tenderness of the perfectly-cooked veal...and the wonderful caper sauce it was bathed in. Heck, just that alone is worth five stars to me.  Yet, I digress a little too far.The veal was perfect.  The pasta in the red sauce was FANTASTIC. Yes, FANTASTIC. The pasta was cooked, in my opinion, exactly Al Dente. Jimmy at Chianti Cafe would probably have been jealous had we been dining together tonight, and given half the opportunity, I'd like to bring Jimmy and a lady friend of his with my girlfriend and compare his cooking to Nico's one day!Oh, and then the wine. House Cabernet that tasted like it wasn't the "house" brand. Heck, I could savor the chocolate overtones battling the plum on my tongue all night long it was that good. And the wine list had a large selection of wines I recognize from my own collection at one time or other (I happen to have collected over two hundred bottles of primarily sparkling and red wines from Napa and Sonoma counties once upon a time). Sterling Vineyards featured among them.Oh, and the cappucino after dinner was really, really good.Oh, and the bread throughout the dinner was so scrumptuous!Oh, and the port after-dinner drink was luscious and velvety!Oh, and Kansas led Mich State by two most of the time I was there! LOL!Ok, so by and large, I compare this restaurant to Chianti Cafe in Summerlin and rate them equally, favoring Chianti Cafe because it is a bit more conducive to seducing my girlfriend sans loud groups of tourists. But Nico deserves 5 stars, because he DELIVERS 5 stars.And as Dennis Miller says "That's just my opinion, I could be wrong!"Capo's is a place concerned with the experience. When you walk in the front door, you enter in a little vestibule area with no windows, no doorknobs (that work), and a camera in the corner. A little screen slides open and the guy asks you what you want, kinda like a speakeasy. When you enter the actual restaurant, it's very dark (so dark, in fact, that the menus have little flashlights attached to them) but decorated well. I went there with a group of people. We were supposed to meet at 8:00, but not everyone showed up until about 8:45. To kill time, the few of us who were there decided to wait at the bar. After a few drinks, the bartender let us know that appetizers at the bar were half off. Sounded like a good deal, so I ordered the calamari, which was $14.99. The bill was non-transferable, so when enough of our party showed up to be seated, we asked to close out our tab. This was the first shady part:Bartender: That'll be $10.82Me: I thought the calamari was $14.99?Bartender: It is.Me: Didn't you tell us appetizers were half off?Bartender: Well the calamari is $10.Me: (Puzzled look)Bartender: Ok fine. Umm...just give me $8.We sit down at the table and look over the menu. Everything is typical Italian, but I really got sticker shock when I saw the prices. Entree prices averaged around $24, which wouldn't be that crazy for a fine dining venue, but this really didn't strike me as such a place. Anyhow, the calamari had really taken the edge off, so my girlfriend and I decided to split an entree. We ordered the veal parmigiana, which was $28.99. When we ordered our food, it was just after 9:00. When we got our food, it was just before 10:00. Granted there were 10 people in our group, but we were the only people in the place, literally. I don't know what they were doing, but I can't remember the last time my food took that long, even in crowded restaurants. I don't think I would have normally gotten so irritated, but I had gotten up at 3:30 for work that morning and had to wake up at 6:00 the next morning, so I had been antsy to get home and go to sleep.When finally get our food, I ask for a separate check. I admit, I had forgotten to ask for it up front, but all the other restaurants I've been to in this town dodn't have problems splitting the check up post-meal, so I didn't think they would either.Me: Excuse me, I need to leave soon. Could I pay for my meal now?Waitress: I'm sorry, but we can't split the bill after it's been created.Me: Oh, OK. Well could you please charge the amount of my meal to my card and apply it towards the bill? (I hold my credit card out)Waitress: We can only take two cards per bill, so only one other card can be used.Me: OK, well I know the rest of the people have cash, so I'm alright with this.Waitress: Fine. Let me figure out what your total is.--about 5 minutes pass--Waitress: You're total is $36.xx.Me: $36.xx?? What was the gratuity? I thought the veal was $28.99?Waitress: You two split the meal. There's a $4 split charge.Me: You didn't tell us about that when we ordered.Waitress: It's on the menu. Here, see? (She was right. The $4 split charge was indicated, but it was on the back page underneath the desserts. Since we hadn't gotten to desserts yet, we hadn't looked at the back page.)Me: OK, you're right, but why didn't you tell us about this when we ordered?Waitress: It's on the menu, so we don't tell people about it.Me: So when someone is asking for something and will be unknowingly charged extra, you don't think it's appropriate to let them know?Waitress: Nope. We're not allowed to tell people about it. Me: Not allowed??Waitress: Nope. The owner says we're not allowed to tell people about it.Me: That's really shady.Jen: Could we speak to the manager?Waitress: I am the manager. Jen: Well then can we speak to whoever you report to?Waitress: He's not here.Jen: Well then how does your restaurant handle customer service?Waitress: Fine, I'll take the $4 off.The waitress is gone for about 10 minutes doing who knows what. In the mean time, we're eating our veal, and it was mediocre at best. I would say the meat was maybe a couple millimeters thick with twice as much breading. The pasta sauce was lacking and nothing worth going back for. I gotta say, accounting for the cost and quality, you would get an exponentially better deal at Olive Garden. She finally came back with our check, $31.30, and I paid. It seemed like everything worked out. However, after charging my card, she didn't stick around long enough for us to ask for a to-go container. We waited for about 10 minutes before my girlfriend decided to just go ask for one. She walked over to where the kitchen entrance/waitress station was, poked her head in, and said "Excuse me." When the waitress saw her, she jumped around a corner. Literally. Our waitress ran away. The service was shady and the food was mediocre. I would only recommend this place to someone for drinks.Yuck! This place sucks. The decor is cool and total mob scene but the food is so nasty! Not even close to being authentic Italian food. I got 4 small frozen ravioli for 30 bucks...really? The service sucked as well. Stay away and try Parma or Roma instead.Had dinner here last night for my fathers birthday and to put it lightly...we weren't happy. The back of their menu even says to state any complaint before you leave and asks you not to be a "Jimmy The Weasel". Red flag much?For starters the food was nothing spectacular and extremely overpriced. I had the "Sawed Off" sausage and peppers which was $22! C'mon now. The dish was nearly all pasta and peppers with very little sausage. My dad had the extremely small portioned "Gotti" chicken. My wife had the fettuccine alfredo and actually left the restaurant saying she was still hungry. Don't get me wrong, the food was okay...not spectacular, but okay.Now I'm not one to complain about a restaurant especially when the food is okay. My family and I enjoy trying new places and you're not always going to have a great experience. However, Capo's had me ready to refuse paying the bill. We used a $25 for $50 Groupon last night and Capo's works the system to where the Groupon is useless. We had 4 adults and my 4 year old son (who shared a plate). With the Groupon applied our bill was $77.77 ($127.77 without). However, the waitress took it upon herself to add $25.55 for gratuity putting the bill back up to $103.32. With the price of my Groupon, the bill was actually $0.55 higher than it would have been without a tip and to be honest, the service we received didn't deserve anywhere near a $25 tip. Once they took the credit card, the waitress even went as far as writing the tip amount on the credit card slip herself!!! Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that's illegal...Now I realize many Groupon's have fine print stating there will be an added gratuity or something but not in Capo's Groupon. Be warned, this place has other reviews about the business scamming customers and now I see why. They make the Groupon useless by adding their own tip at their chosen amount. I will never return to this place and will contact Groupon in attempt to have these theives removed from their site. Now I just have to hope they didn't steal my credit card info!Let me praise this place first and foremost for it's customer service. The one thing I'm always impressed by is when you have a large group of people, and they provide excellent customer service. We had a group of 11 people and only 1 waitress. She was awesome and amazingly attentive the entire time. I was very nervous because my boyfriend's grandparents are obsessed with Italian. I never recommend places that I haven't been to, but all of my friends that I trust had recommended it to me. I'm so glad I made the choice! Everyone loved everything they got, and the best in my opinion was the Chicken Marsala. Most of us passed around our dishes to try everything out, and there wasn't one thing I didn't like. I do love Italian, and I have been very picky on the places that I like. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants. I just feel they're all the same and generally the same "OK" type of quality of food. There are a few exceptions, but I usually shy away from these places. I see people on here complaining about the prices. I feel that the prices are very reasonable, and here is why - The dinners come with bread, soup or salad. They give you large portions (even though I typically appreciate smaller portions so I don't over eat.)They have live entertainment, I'm sure it's mostly in the evenings. The ambiance and the experience. It's cute and "mob" style. The service. I always pay attention to the service and the service around me, and everyone seemed very content. The singer and the manager even thanked us for coming in and dining with them. People need to take in account for everything, not just the prices, especially if it's worth the prices and it's good food. I know it may not be consistent across the board for everyone, but I had an awesome experience. Go to their website, look at their menu before you go. It's definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys something different than the norm.Atrocious service. My trip here led to a shouting match with the manager. We purchased a groupon for a party of four. The other couple cancelled, and the restaurant manager refused to honor the groupon, even though it would have resulted in us spending more money than we would have.Apparently they are all good on cash here, so don't bother giving them any of yours. Never had a worse dining, or in this case a "not-dining" experience in my life. Can't wait to see this place turned into more parking lot. Their terrible management is going to make that happen sooner than later.After seeing the show Mystery Diner on the Food Network my wife and I made the decision to eat there on our upcoming trip to Las Vegas.  With three days to go before the vacation I purchased a Groupon that was 30 dollars for 60 dollars worth of food.  We made a reservation for 6:00 on Sunday because we wanted to eat early before we went out.  We showed up about 10 minutes after 6 because the valet was a little behind at our hotel.  After pushing the button and waiting a minute or two the little window was opened and we were asked if we had a reservation.  I told him my name and he let us in.  After we got inside, the restaurant itself was extremely dark and the gentlemen who opened the door said we were late and we would be punished by having to wait longer.  "Whatever" we didn't care, we were just hungry.  It was kind of funny when we sat down and I looked at the menu on the back it said that reservations would be held for 15 minutes.  When we sat down we were given two menus with little lights attached to help us read them.  After a couple of minutes the server came and told us about the specials.  I was very interested in the meatball and shrimp special and my wife was going to get another shrimp dish that was on the menu.After we told the server that we were using a Groupon she said we had to spend the full sixty dollars which we didn't think would be a problem.  We needed another minute to decide so the waitress left and came back a minute later.  I was excited about my shrimp and meatball special especially after reading all the review on Yelp about how good their meatballs were.  When the waitress returned the first thing she said was "sorry we are all out of shrimp," this meant I couldn't get my special and my wife couldn't get her selection.   Now how is it that you have a special and that consists of shrimp and you somehow run out of it by 6:15 at night.  I think that since we were using a Groupon they didn't want to sell us the shrimp , I have no proof but I think it was bullshit.  So we had to take another couple of minutes to look over the menu which had mostly dishes that contained shrimp.  I decided on spaghetti Alfredo with a meatball side, and my wife went with a clam dish in a red sauce.When I the meal came my Spaghetti Alfredo had absolutely no flavor at all.  It was horrible.  The meatball on the other hand was really good.  My wife's clam dish was also very good and there was quite a bit of clams in the dish, which was exactly what she wanted.  After we finished and asked for our check the waitress came back and said we were a few dollars short of sixty and we were going to have to get something else.  My wife decided to get a dessert and she chose a tiramisu which ended up also being pretty good.  It tasted like they used real lady fingers and the whipped cream was also dynamite.Overall our experience was not what we expected and we will not be going back here next time we were in Vegas.  The atmosphere was neat but I just can't fathom a restaurant that runs out of shrimp that is their special for the night by 6:15 in the evening.Coming to Vegas I was told I must try this place, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is fun and it was a must experience. After coming here I won't be coming back. The evening started out on a positive. Liked the idea and the decorations and atmosphere, but the food was sub par for the price. It said steakhouse so I ventured for the $40 steak. My friend had to change her order due to them being out of food and she was also not impressed with the selection. We did make reservations and asked about the special to make sure it was still going on when we called. We were assured it was. However, after we ate the waitress brings the bill and after inspection find out the special was not honored.  She then told us that the special was for locals only and we were clearly not locals. They did finally honor the discount, but not without complaint.  The waitress told me that "next time I just need to be aware". Maybe I should've read more reviews or maybe they should mention that when calling to make reservations.  Either way there will be no next time for this patron.New chef = lots of changes, not for the better. (This review's visit: April 2013)The Italian dressing that was SO good, circa the previous chef is now completely different. Now: inedible (greasy, yellow, tasteless and, just...No). Garden salad ($6) was made with rusty, wilty lettuce, carrots were stale. Nothing in it was fresh. Lasagna - check out my pic. I was expecting a luscious, beautiful, hearty, home-made hunk of well-made lasagna (for $10).  During this lunch service, only two other tables were occupied in the resto, but still my server couldn't get things off the ground. We spent the next 45 minutes trying to deal with one thing after another: funky new dressing, funky salad which he accidentally charged for as it was a swap for the pasta, we ordered a meatball but no meatball arrived, waited another 20 minutes for that lasagna to get boxed up, etc... Too much management required. Oyy.My previous stellar review, which I was delighted to write, belonged to the previous chef. I was expecting a repeat experience, but this was like a different restaurant.The greatest thing about this place is the entrance through the front door. Past that, everything goes downhill. I get that this place is trying to go for the Italian Mafia, pseudo rude, Chicago hard ass mentality... but the people are just not hospitable. When greeted at the host stand, they made me sit like a leper on these gross banquet chairs to wait for my table, rather than invite me to sit at the empty bar and grab a drink. The ambiance is kind of interesting but when you actually look at whats going on, you realize that the lights are just turned completely off. Its almost pitch black. Theres kind of a cool lounge singer that plays piano and does Frank Sinatra songs but hes not very good and it gets really annoying after 3 songs. The food is the worst part about this place. Its just downright bad. Its one thing if the place was super cheap and not TRYING to be a nice restaurant. Its not exactly cheap. I had a dry, crusty meatball appetizer, a boring caesar salad, and a completely tasteless eggplant parm. While I was eating my $22 eggplant park, i was legitimately thinking how i would have rather gone down the street to trader joes and eaten the microwaveable eggplant parm that they have for $4.99.The service is bad to average but i think that part of it simply has to do with how dark this place is. Noone can see anything. Our waitress asked us for our drink order without bringing over a drink menu. And she never came back to ask if we wanted a second drink.I just think this place tried to focus on the gimmick too much and is not understanding that they need to provide an actual dining experience.MUST READ ! MUST READ ! MUST READ! This is my first time to sit down and write a review about anything but after tonight I can't keep quiet. I've been going to Capos for years to starting with there first location on Tropicana. I must say the food is always great. I've celebrated birthdays, anniversary's, New Years eve and just for the hell of it lets go to Capos. But, tonight was the worst experience I had. First we get greeted by the rudest man at the door he has no smile, no warmth, you can tell he was flustered. We're sitting with another couple waiting for a table. He calls both of us up and seats us in this "private room" next to each other. With no menus. And the room had to be hitting 85 degrees and humidity 120. After sitting for about 5 some one dropped off menus. The place is so dark you need a little flash light to read the menu MINE DIDNT work. I had to ask about the Chefs Specials for the night. I get up and ask what i think is a host slash manager slash mater'd to either A. turn the air down in that room or B. Move us to the main dinning room where you can tell it's much cooler by like 10 degrees. He intel responds in his rude italian over worked voice "thats gonna be 20 minutes or so". I go back to my table start fanning my self and just waiting for an open table. He comes up to our table and says "you can eat at the  bar if you want". I told him i didn't make a reservation to sit at the "bar". He responds with "what do you want me to do then"? With his face in my face and body language like he wanted to pounce on me. I just tell him "TO FIX THE PROBLEM" either fix the air or move me. He storms off. By this time one or our appetizers hits our table. So we start eating the waitress comes up to us with our second appetizer and says your other table is ready. Im like great picked up my glass and bottled water and followed her leaving our first appetizer at the original table. We get sat in a booth in the main dinning room. First relief because its much cooler. Then we realize the table had not been wiped from the  previous guest ( which by this point that did not bug me at all). The buss boy sees that and wiped the table for us and apologizes. Well wed like to eat our salads that were dropped off with our second appetizer but we have no utensils. We tell our server that our calamari is on the table still she respond "i thought you where done with that"? I had about 4 bites. So she goes back im thinking shes retrieving our appetizer or re firing a new one. Finally we get our silver ware by the bus boy and no bread. We ask her wheres our calamari she says " you ate most of it" so by this point now shes being rude and defensive. So i tell her " am i S.O.L on my calamari? She responds with well i can have them make a half batch because you ate half. I looked at her and i almost wanted to just over turn my table in that restaurant. Im like i want my check im OUT OF HERE...... She gets her manager slash host slash mater'd. And hes like why are they leaving ? i did everything they wanted. He tells her to fire a calamari. By this point its to late I let him have it. Im so disgusted by the customer service theres no way to fix the situation. I told him ive been in the hospitality industry for 12 years and thats not the way you handle a situation. His last words to me where "Wheres your restaurant ill go eat there".....I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN SUCH DISGUSTING, VILE, HOSTILE PLACE IN MY LIFE. I dont have a restaurant THANK GOD! But let me tell you this i never made a customer that mad that he stormed out of the restaurant i was managing. Im posting this on YELP, and on my Facebook that has over 500 friends, family, and clients. And let me tell you this i see my clients daily and we do is talk about Las Vegas food, shows, restaurants, As god as my witness i will bad mouth you and tell everyone i ever meet about this experience. When i have friends come to Vegas this is one Restaurant that i will not be taking them to. So keep up the great work and the great customer service. Maybe thats why your first original location closed, and thats why you have 2 for 1 on Tuesdays and you are on groupon every other day. Bigger better restaurants have closed there doors you can too..............With out us THE CUSTOMERS REMEMBER YOU ARE NOTHING !!!!!!!!I HOPE YOU THE WORST I HOPE YOU CLOSE AND I HOPE YOU NEVER GET ANOTHER JOB IN LAS VEGAS.........DISGUSTING ! DISGUSTING ! DISGUSTING !After all the reviews I thought I was going to be in for a good time. Sadly it was just ok, I guess the door guy wasn't in the mood to bad I was looking forward to that.  I understand the darkness is part of the feel and fun of this place but I couldn't even read my menu the little light attached to my menu was broken.  :(  Made it extremely hard to order.  I got the lasagna when it came it was burnt so bad around the edges I couldn't cut it so I had to return it and wait for a new one.  By the time it arrived I was starving, the taste was good no complaints.Our group had a group on, when we went to pay we felt like we received attitude.  Don't sell them if you don't want people to use them.  Our waitress claimed the system was down and we couldn't use it, we refused to not use it and suddenly it was working again.  The whole time the manager who could have smoothed some feathers was sitting at the bar drinking.So the food was ok service sucked, oh well...It is rarity and a luxury for my husband I to get free time to ourselves. Last Saturday our daughter was spending the afternoon with her grandparents so we jumped at the opportunity to have a proper date. Capos was not really on our radar and it wasn't until we drove past it on our way back from doing some decorating at his office that we decided Italian sounded great. We turned around and got into the parking lot of Capos.I have to say that I really like the feel and the ambiance of this place. Although it is very dark when you first walk in so make sure to allow time for your eyes to adjust. My husband made a comment that this was the type of place one would bring their mistress. It was dark with high red booths offering privacy and comfort. Our server was excellent. She was knowledgable, friendly and energetic. She took our drink orders promptly after we were seated. They do have a happy hour menu mon-sat but it is only at the bar.We opted for one cocktail each... They ranged between $12-14 per.We started off with their fresh calamari which was lightly battered and complemented by sliced Peperoncinis for that added zest. $14,95For my entree  I opted for "Angels a With Dirty Faces" which was angel hair pasta in pink sauce with peas and mushrooms. I added grilled chicken for an extra fee. $18.95 + $6 for the chicken to be addedMy husband had "Racketeers Ravioli" which were homemade pasta pillows stuffed with ricotta cheese and he opted for Alfredo sauce as the topping sauce of choice. The ravioli tasted homemade and exactly the way my mom used to make them.  $18.95We overheard the server explain to a booth behind us that nothing in house is frozen or pre made. She stated that they have a small freezer which houses some of the desserts. That is what I like to hear. You pay the premium for it, but that's what I like to hear.All entrees come with a choice of soup or salad. I loved their garlic sauce that was on my salad. So delicious!!The only con were the prices. Even with 2 for 1 entree for locals, we ended up shelling over $70 for the two of us. Although the food and service were great, I am not thrilled with the price point enough to rush back. I can see the prices being justified because everything is made fresh and portions are fair, but Italian food ingridients generally don't warrant that kind of price unless we are adding seafood, etc.Cool spot to take visiting friends or family for a unique off-Strip dinner: Italian food in a speakeasy-theme joint with a dark interior and a one-of-a-kind entrance. I'd say this is more for adults than kids, though. Dinner prices are a bit on the high side, but they occasionally come up on Groupon.CAPO'S HOUSE  SALAD or NICO'S CAESAR SALAD ($7): Overpriced and overdressed, they use tons of dressing, but do taste good. Opt for the garlic version on the House, splurge the extra $3 to add chicken to the Caesar.AUNTIE G'S ANTIPASTO SANDWICH ($12): Chicken breast and various antipasto meats and cheeses layered on a tasty focaccia with roasted red peppers, spinach, and a delightful lemon-pesto aioli. Side choice of pasta salad or fries, topped with additional aioli. Large portion, very fresh.SANTUCCI'S PASTA ($10): classic spaghetti with "Capone family secret sauce", add a giant meatball for $5 to make it a real meal. Pasta was a bit mushy but the 'ball was pretty good, BF said he'd get this again.Food quality for lunch was probably a 3/5 but attentive service and atmosphere kicks the overall rating up to a 4 for me. Would come back in the evening for the Frank Sinatra singer, or to catch HH at the bar (3-6PM, M-Sat). They have a private dining room for larger parties. Look for the chalk body outline on your way out the door.This was my first visit at Capo's and it was an excellent one! They have a dramatic entrance where you ring the doorbell and the guy opens up a small window to see who you are, then opens the door to let you in.The place was very dim with lots of awesome decor from the mafia world. While casual dress is ok, I felt under-dressed wearing jeans as many were dressed a little bit more formal.Then the tables that were empty were already reserved. So, my friends and I ended up dining at the bar. Oh boy! I was happy that we ended up at the bar! You can see all the live actions while they cook and prepare your meals. They have TVs at the bar and a live singer by the piano at the center of the restaurant (I came in at the right night). It's really awesome! I ordered Tony Duck's soup and Spaghetti with Meatballs. The soup does not contain any duck. It has spinach and eggs with such a flavorful broth! I came here to try out their spaghetti with meatballs and it was delicious! The homemade meatball was bigger than my fist. It was moist and did not fall apart when slicing. The marinara was well flavored and good consistency. I prefer my pasta a little thicker though. This is one of the great dining experience I would not hesitate to take my family and friends when visiting town. Capo's is definitely an added gem for Vegas! And the cute and friendly female bartenders added a nice touch!Gimme a name...and a kick in the head. From the moment I called to make reservations, to the minute I left the joint - I was smiling. I called to make sure we wouldn't be turned away and the mobster that answered replied with a heavily Italian, "Gimme a name..."We arrived on a Thursday for lunch. We found the secret entrance, gave the eyes in the doorway the code and were granted admission. The entire place is dimly lit and mob like. Red lights flash to alert them of new visitors and creaky wood floors keep people honest. We were seated right away, in a comfy booth adorned with a portrait of Al Capone. All the waiters wear white pressed long sleeve shirts and black trousers with suspenders. I selected the meatball sandwich, which came with a side salad. The sandwich was amazing. The best Italian I have ever had in my life. The creamy garlic dressing is so good, you will wish you could take a bottle home with you. From the drink list, I chose "Kick in the Head". We visited a nearby tiki bar a bit later and let me tell you -Capo's crafts a much better cocktail. It was delicious and carried just the right punch. My man selected the chipped Italian beef sandwich and again, we were blown away. It's as if they have taken good home cooking and elevated it to off the charts good. Their Chianti selection is also excellent. Service was great. We were there too early in the day for the piano player. I am already planning a return dinner trip, so that we can experience that. I have heard nothing but great things about him.
Blue Wasabi Sushi and Martini Bar=In a town filled with sushi restaurants, restaurateurs must come up with exciting and innovative concepts to lure new patrons.  I believe Blue Wasabi does just that in merging contemporary American ingredients with their sushi rolls, as well as providing a generous list of signature small plates for the discerning palate - whether that be seared pork tenderloin or the spicy yellowtail mushrooms.  And to wash it all down, a fun and diverse martini menu dazzles its guests with selections such as the "Milky Way" (Skyy Vanilla vodka, cream liqueur, Vermeer chocolate liqueur, vanilla cream with a caramel rim) and the "Strawberry Blonde" (Skyy Citrus vodka, Stoli Strawberry vodka, homemade lemonade and strawberry puree)Blue Wasabi gained recognition and many awards when it opened a few years ago.  Categories including "Best Sushi" by 944 magazine,  "Best New Restaurant" by New Times, and "25 Top New Restaurants" by Phoenix Magazine.This is not the place for sushi purists.  Here, the goal was to Americanize the sushi experience and experiment with many diverse flavor combinations.  The sushi itself may not be top grade, but the signature rolls definitely get an A+ from me!Some of my favorite Signature Rolls:Dirty Sanchez: eel, avocado, krab, jalapeno and cream cheese, tempura'd with soy glazeEating Nemo: Krab, cucumbers, topped with salmon, thinly sliced lemon and ponzu sauceShrimp Bizkit: shrimp tempura, cucumber, asparagus, chipotle mayo, topped with shrimp and avocadoSurf and Turf Roll: shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, topped with seared beef tenderloin and a sesame onion dressingThe average cost of a roll is about $11, but many of these signatures can be sampled for 50% off during Wasabi's happy hour.Happy Hour is daily, Tuesday-Saturday, from 4:30p-6:30p.  Selected signature rolls, selected signature small plates, salads, and sushi are 50% off, as well as the entire menu of martinis.  An incredible value!For those not as adventurous, the signature small plates offer something for every palate.  Starting at $5 and going up to $14, there is much to be sampled here.Starting with fried pizza rolls, the list is eclectic.  Ranging from Americana's best, the hot wing, to buddha burgers and grilled miso salmon, your mouth will water, and your tastebuds tingle.Aside from the traditional sushi offerings, Wasabi also features New style sushi, such as "Cajun Spiced Seared Tuna" (my favorite here) and Striped Bass with a citrus green peppercorn sauce.The salads also diverge from the traditional seaweed and squid salads here.  Try the delicious Grilled Miso Salmon Salad.  The fish is flavourful, juicy, and tender - grilled in a sweet miso glaze.  The salad greens are fresh and crispy, and doused in a miso onion dressing.  During happy hour, this delectable salad is only $6.50 - definitely something you would expect to pay three times that amount for.The incentives just keep getting better here.  Tuesdays is ladie's night, so their signature martinis are 50% off the entire day.  16 martinis can be found on the menu, as diverse and colorful as a gal's handbag collection.  And did I mention they are divine?  The recipes go easy on the heavy liqour, so one can easily try 2 or 3 before calling it a night.  If you want to sample their sakes and wines, imports, or premiums, Sundays are ideal.  If you wear blue, you get 50% off all the alcohol - a lush's paradise.Overall, I love the modern decor, the blue granite at the bar, the blue padded seats, the chilled out music that doesn't overwhelm the conversations, the clean and contemporary feel of the restaurant, the fun staff at the bar, the attentive servers, and even the edamame.  Definitely one of my favorite joints for happy hour, and enjoying Japanese/American fare.
TAO Asian Bistro=Friends were in town and they wanted to try the very popular Tao Restaurant.  (It's been reported that the Tao Restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in Vegas!)  Just as we were about to enter the hallway, this VERY large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  Talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!We were seated upstairs on the balcony overlooking the huge Buddha.  As menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  As I perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, I didn't even know where to begin.  My fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. Grilled Kobe Sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.The menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  I could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (I would not consider Tao to be romantic at all.)In the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  And this is what we got:Squab Lettuce Wraps ($14) - This came with five lettuce leaves.  A decent amount to fill all the leaves.  The squab mixture was a bit too moist and the BF found it too sweet.  I had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  There was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.Lobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth ($16) - A clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  Very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  A very light and delicate dish.  Sashimi of Kobe Beef with Fresh Wasabi Sauce ($28) - Beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  We couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  Lovely taste and clean.  However, I didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.Pork Spring Roll with Thai Chili Sauce ($11) - This order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  The spring roll was decent, nothing particular special about it.  The Thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables ($34) - Very good, but I guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece of Chilean sea bass?Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken ($26) - We must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  It did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces of chicken in it, including the drumstick.  It was okay, nothing particularly special about it.Jasmine White Rice ($4) - Of course we had to order some rice!  We got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.Overall, the food was good.  Definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a certain kind of clientele.  You'll be amused to find things like Kung Pao Chicken ($26) and Grilled Prime Porterhouse with Wasabi Dipping Sauce ($88) on the same menu.  We decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended Giant Fortune Cookie ($10) or Fuji Apple Springroll ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (We actually drove over to Luv-It Frozen Custard instead!)Service is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and Tao fails in this department.  I was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the BF to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (Uh, who does that?!)  As they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  I felt like I was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  I'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  The waitstaff should take a few lessons from Rosemary's Restaurant's waitstaff.  That's what I call service!At the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  And it was...just okay.  They asked if we were going to the club afterward and I said yes and asked if they had any passes.  What they do have is a "line pass," which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  However, you will still have to pay cover.  (I think this part is rather ridiculous.  They should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  With the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  Not the best pass I would say.  Tao Restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.    There are better places where service is valued higher.$185 total, including tip and tax, no drinksThis place made my night.I must have gotten lucky because everything I ordered to eat was delicious (see my pics).  I shared the wasabi-encrusted filet mignon, sea-bass, fried rice, and salmon with udon noodles.  The rice wasn't anything special but each of the other dishes was delicious.  The sea-bass was amazingly cooked and the filet mignon hit the spot.We had a group of 15 and the service was ultra-efficient and super smooth.  I'm a huge fan of the decor of Tao nightclub, and can say the same holds true with the design of the restaurant (tho it is a bit dark.)  The servers were super friendly to us and at the end of the night as a perk for eating there, we got VIP stamps to get into the club.  And I'm not talking about "VIP" status where you get into a "VIP" line and wait another f-ing hour.  At 10PM we left the restaurant and were in the club in under 10 minutes even though a line was building up outside.  Considering I spent about $40 on the food, and entry into the club would have been about $20 anyways...well that's what I think anyone would call a good deal.If you're going to come and complain about the "noise level" take a pause and think about it.  What do you expect from a resaurant sitting below the club (with the same name, mind you).The only weird thing to me now is that two of my favorite places in Vegas have the same place ..Tao and Tao.  Nightclub and restaurant.First time diner, long time clubber. Me and eleven other "bachelors" enjoyed an incredible time at Tao for a friends stag party.After three glasses of wine I honestly can't remember what appetizers we had but they were the bomb-ass rap song. If you don't believe me, ask L.A. Lakers Robert Horry - he was at the table next to us saying hells yeah... or maybe, "As usual, I'll take the check." I wonder if he knew that the hot red head sitting next to him just came over to our table and advertised the strip club where she would be working later that night?Our server Sereka was the cats meow. Not only could she handle 12 crazy men, but she helped us haze the groom. She hand picked a table of bachelorettes for us to send a comp bottle of champagne. Imagine the groom-to-be's surprise when 10 boa-clad bachelorettes came over and personally thanked him for the bubbly.Oh, and definitely get the miso sea bass - delicious!4.5 * stars*bias switch on*Unaccustomed as I am to the wayward excess of wesson cooking oil, cryogenically frozen hamburgers -their flesh revived after 5 years of roaming the Mc pastures- and a forced-entry of Harsh Browns-shirts down my esophagus, for the everyday equivalent of a Nazi Spandau prison breakfast, my antibodies capitulated and allowed the stomachal aches to begin their bombing. I decided to tenderly call it "the blitz"This necessary intro will frame for you the picture of my everyday routine in Vegas; as I made my way for the Sands expo center at the Venetian, and with the imperative need to eat some breakfast and lunch. It was not until Friday, after a party at said hotel's poolside, that I finally had the opportunity to sit down at a real restaurant, where I would have at least, real food (the rest of the evenings, btw, dinner was served in a bottle with lime) Enter Tao:Oh yes. Finally some tranquility, some posh, some xanax imbued zest! My muscles relaxed the moment I sat at the couch. My pancreas wept alongside my saliva centers as soon as I blinked through the menu options. I refuse to pejoratively call "drooling" what clearly was the act of tender weeping. The why? Crispy Spicy Tuna and the lusciously fresh Salmon in a sweet (but spicy) sesame sauce and incrusted with crispy onions. Naturally, I enjoyed every bite of these dishes with unabashed contempt to all cuisines under the tyranny of wesson oil, and with unabashed praise towards the butcher's dexterity of the sushi liberating chefs. Kudos.As I made my way towards the bathroom, I noticed that Tao offers an expansive seating area to accommodate many refugees like myself, and when I also saw the stairs that led to the TAO nightclub chamber, I couldn't help but feel how the imposing pictures of the monks and innocent children that loomed in the walls in front of me, where in fact, severely bent on scattering my sinful wishes aroused, or perhaps to manipulate them by whispering in a nomadic tongue: "Its all-ight, we approve!" And so that you know that monks never lie, Tao offers to stamp a comp admission to the TAO nightclub above in your pumping wrist, only and if you have dined in the zen establishment. Watch the horror and astonishment of the serpent-like queue as you breeze by them and re-enter for the club scott-free (yes, they make you exit, and re-enter through the VIP line in order for you to undergo a quick ID inspection. Sorry toddlers!)So I have no problem bowing to the wisdom of the Tao Te King, and acknowledging that "Tao" is indeed "the way". Do come to this amicable speck in the midst of the chaotic Vegas strip Taiji to replenish your Yin, and by all means, your Yang waiting for you upstairs.WHERE: Located inside TAO Nightclub (downstairs)WHAT: My girls and I come here to redeem our complimentary dinners once in a while.  I haven't actually sat down and payed for a meal here so I have no idea what the prices look like, but I know that the food was worth my tip!!The all-girl complimentary dinner includes:-one round of shots for the girls of the party (lemon drop, washington apple, or their tao special)-edimame beans-fried rice-asian seasoned salad-about 3 rolls of sushi-sweet pork-dumplings-eggrolls-lettuce wraps-and you are able to choose a specialty drink from the list of drinks for free!-for dessert, a tao-made fortune cookie with a sexy/funny fortune! =DYuupppp!! Our dinner came with all of that!! It was so much food, I don't think we were able to go up to the club to dance right after! (The most recent time at least).The service was excellent, the food was excellent. So, I leave you with this.EXCELLENCE!! hahaWhile I've been to Tao several times for cocktails  I had never dined there before.  My most recent Vegas excursion rectified that minor detail.From the moment we entered the restaurant, to the time we left, service was attentive and friendly.  I started off the evening by ordering my favorite cocktail, the Tao-tini.  If you've never had a Tao-tini, I highly suggest you do so ASAP.  We ordered multiple items off the menu for our dinner, including the Chilean Sea Bass Satay as an appetizer.  After watching the Vegas edition of "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" on Food Network, we wanted to try this highly touted app.  I am so happy we did!  That was seriously one of the best foods I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Everything else was just as yummy.  Tuna Tar Tar, Pad Thai, Halibut, etc. etc.  We all loved the food. I can't wait until my next trip to Vegas so I can go back to dine at Tao on all of their wonderful food...and to have another Tao-tini.  ;)I came here for a friend's birthday expecting the worst, but was actually pleasantly surprised.I didn't even know Tao had a restaurant until the night I ate here. The restaurant is huge and surprisingly busy for dinner. The service was impeccable, with knowledgable and attentive servers. The food is expensive, but you're in the wrong city if that is a deal breaker. I definitely recommend the Chilean sea bass, order it and everyone at the table will be stealing bites. If you come here for dinner be sure to get your hand stamped so that you can get into Tao nightclub for free.***We had a large party menu (fixed) at Tao's and that could have contributed to the experience; the food was mediocre with some of the courses being decent, but more of them with a quality and flavor similar to a PF Chang's***Tao has never been high on my list to try in Las Vegas, but I've definitely heard a lot about it--especially since it is both a restaurant and, I believe, a nightclub after dinner ends.  Tao was also featured on the Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate where Duff Goldman selected their satay of Chilean sea bass as his favorite thing in Las Vegas.Tao is located in The Venetian and it is a big spot with a dark decor (very loud as well).  Tao's huge menu is very modern Asian or Asian fusion with a wide variety of items including sushi, sashimi, edamame, satay, tuna tartare, hot and sour soup, dumplings, spring rolls, BBQ meats, tempura, wok-fried meat, poultry and seafood dishes, fried rice, and noodles.Everything was kind of okay, but while a few dishes were noticeably better than what you would get at a PF Chang's, a lot of it wasn't (and Tao carries a much higher price tag though part of that is because Tao is in Las Vegas).  We did have a fixed party menu so maybe more freshly prepared dishes would have stood out more though the flavors were not exciting or memorable.Service was fine.  The food came out at a good pace.As mentioned, prices were high for a just okay Asian fusion restaurant.Tao does offer many different dishes and it brings in a lot of customers to make for a lively atmosphere so if either of those two qualities appeal to you, Tao might be worth checking out.  But if you are looking for high quality food or good value, Tao might not be the best choice on The Strip.Like other Las Vegas casinos on The Strip, The Venetian offers both free self and valet parking.I was pleasantly surprised by my dinner at Tao. The atmosphere was lively and fun. The food was fantastic. We started with the lobster wontons in a shiitake ginger broth and the satay of Chilean sea bass that was coated in miso and came with large crisp asparagus. These were both incredible. We ended up ordering a second of the sea bass skewers as they were flaky, moist and sweet. For dinner we shared the udon vegetable noodles, the salmon sashimi with avocado and the New York steak with a peppercorn sauce and veggies. Everything was top notch ingredients, and really flavorful. We ended up ordering some sort of crab roll at the end and that was the worst thing we had, otherwise each dish was really wonderful. I'd definitely come here for a fun dinner in Vegas again.Terrible service and not a good experience at all.It is very clear that this restaurant only welcomes those for whom money is of no consequence as they literally tried to take as much money from us as possible.First of all, we were asked, "Still or sparkling?" Thinking these were our only choices and still must equal tap water, we asked for still. That was a $24 mistake. Although we ended up getting the manager to take it off our bill, it caused a huge hassle.When ordering my $14 vegetarian meal, the waiter stopped me mid-sentence and told me I needed to try their Kung Pau tofu dish. Although mildly annoyed to be told my choice was wrong, I was excited to try this off-menu item.  It ended up being too spicy for my taste and I switched meals with someone else.  Fast -forward to when the check came and I found out the meal he had convinced me to order was almost twice the price of the meal I originally had picked out. Needless to say, I felt a little cheated.The meal I did end up eating was good.... Vegan Pad Thai with Gluten free noodles. (Yes, it was also appreciated that they had GF options!)  we were also able to use their buy-one-get-one promotion for cocktails as it was happy hour. However, everyone at the table was really disappointed and rather indignant at the service that was given. The cuisine was good but the experience was marred by the sub-par service and the costly extras.The only reason to eat here is to avoid the long lines waiting to gain access to Tao Nightclub. Once you've finished dining, your waiter will usher you past all the line-losers to gain your rightful spot amongst the beautiful people.It's there you'll wonder why, after six vodka and Red Bulls, your 'buzz' more resembles a Sunday afternoon on the couch than the dance party you'd hoped for.Well duh, you just ate enough food for a small village in the Sudan.On the bright side, you didn't have to wait in line.Avoid the 'family' meal experience. The bill was a stack before the tip for 8 of us. Stick with the sake bombers instead. Tao has a unique device that cleverly drops six shots into six beers simultaneously. It's so fascinating, you'll want to try this at least a dozen or so times.Don't forget to shout out some Asian babble as you salute the Emperor or else the bombers have very little effect.The sea bass was a triumph. The beef was like butter - I'm guessing it was Kobe, and if it wasn't, it was likely from a bull who'd had his nuts cupped daily by some half wit.Expensive? Yes. Loud? Yes.Was it worth it? YES!To be fair, you go here for the experience. A professional, stylish and hip Vegas dining experience. With staff that knows what they do and with food that will probably drain your wallet a little bit but is also very well presented and, most importantly, delicious.Price range: cocktails $15, main dishes $19-$30, dessert $12. Do the math for your party.Bonus: you get free admission to the night club, ask your waiter for the stamp. You still gotta pass the door though.I truly have not had a bad experience at Tao. The quality of the service is great and the food is excellent. The sushi is always nice and fresh and the Main entrees are delicious. I would recommend to get the crab cakes for appetizer. They are meaty and very tasty. The glazed miso cod is one of the best things on the menu. For side dishes you can never go wrong with the fried rice or the noodles. And for dessert, well you have to get the amazing fortune cookie. This is a giant fortune cookie with half chocolate and half cream! It's just delish! If you are planning on visiting Tao you will be pleased with the food. However, the restaurant is not cheap. Well I guess you get for what you pay!
Carlos O'Briens=We had dinner here with some friends.  It was our first time trying out this place and since I'm on my No Meat diet, I went for the Bean & Cheese Chimichanga.  My friends ordered an appetizer for the table that was a Tortilla with melted Cheese on it.....they insisted that I give it a try.  I did and was instantly a fan....wow, it tasted sooo good.  The Cheese was gooey and had a nice, rich flavor.  We added some Guacamole to it and it was great.By the time my Bean & Cheese Chimichanga came out, I was almost full from the complimentary Chips & Salsa plus the Cheesy Appetizer.  However, once I took one bite from the Chimichanga, my stomach kicked into 2nd gear.....it was good!Overall, it was a nice place to have dinner with friends.  It's very casual.....it was busy when we arrived around 7:30, but was empty by 9:00.....I can never get use to cities outside of Vegas where places empty really fast!Return Factor - 70%
Hash House A Go Go=WOW...The servings here are huge, enormous, vast, gigantic, massive, mammoth, colossal, titanic!!  A bit of advice, look to split everything on the menu.  I had the sausage gravy pot pie and it was more than enough for two people.  When our server brought it out, my first words were "holy shit" that's huge (please refrain from any cheap jokes)!  Rosemarie ordered some eggs and a mango coconut pancake.  The pancake was so big that it came out on a pizza platter. This place is American gluttony in a nutshell.  I almost felt guilty that there was so much food. Bottom line, even though the portions are huge...the food is good.  We will definitely be coming back and definitely be sharing....As I was waiting for friends, I decided to order their award-winning watermelon-kiwi-lemonade drink at the bar.  I can see why it's a reputable drink.  Not too sweet and the fruity flavors go well with each other.  Just wish I had a bigger glass.    I wasn't sure what to expect at this simple restaurant and bar.  "Twisted farm food" is a good way to put it.  As if they have large creatures at this farm because portions here are gigantic.  I've had 12-14 inch pancakes before, but never were they filled and tasted just right.  I had their blueberry pecan famous flapjack as part of my Tractor Driver combo.  This combo included 2 eggs with strips of bacon.  Thick cuts of bacon and scrambled eggs already made me happy.  It was the flapjack draping over the large plate that scared me the most.  I don't even think 2 people can finish it.  This enormous pancake made everyone look at me.  They were probably wondering why I also ordered a side of hash browns.  Looks like to-go containers are popular here.  Even with large appetites, people still leave home with a doggy bag.  The next time I visit I will have to try their one pound stuffed burgers.  A humongous burger that includes 2 patties, with apple-smoked bacon and mashed potatoes in between, and all the fix-ins and steak fries....sound like breakfast lunch and dinner combined.  Who needs a buffet?  Parking is easy and traffic around is not bad at all.  I would definitely take people visiting from out of town to this friendly establishment.  It sure beats the long lines and loud crowds on the strip.  Besides, food here is way better...and bigger, which makes the prices reasonable.  Thanks to Tish and Cynthia for introducing me to this place.  Can't wait to go back!Nothing can be said that hasn't already been said.Very reasonalby priced,,Enormous,gourmet farm fresh with great atmosphere & service.I enjoyed the fried green tomatoes,pork tenderloin,chicken sandwich and my son had a medium pizza sized pancake breakfast for $5.Check out restaurant.com for a $25 Gift Certificate-get additional 50% off CODE: Vegas.A must try!We joined our out-of-town guests for breakfast this morning, and we figure Hash House A Go Go would be the perfect place.  There was absolutely no wait on a Thursday morning at 8:30 am, but two hours later, there is definitely a wait!* Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato & fresh spinach Hash ($11.25) - The hashes "are tossed with crispy potatoes and topped with 2 eggs, served with fresh fruit and biscuit." Two sunny side up eggs sat in the corner of my skillet along with a large biscuit and a generous portion of potatoes and other good stuff.  I ate it all up, sadly enough, minus the biscuit.  And yes, I am still full from my breakfast.  It's a hearty portion alright! I even managed a couple of nibbles of the biscuit with the jam provided on the table.* Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict "w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream & scrambled eggs" ($14.95) - The Husband was looking for the item that was featured on the Travel Channel's Man v. Food, and the waitress said it was this one.  All of their benedicts are "served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes."  It was a huge pile of something with creamy sauce dripping all over it.  I took a bite, and in retrospect, I don't think I tasted anything beyond the fried chicken and cream sauce!  I did see the generous scrambled egg resting on top of the chicken though!  The Husband did box up the other half since it is such a generous order though.  * Andy's famous Bread pudding topped w/ ice cream and served w/ a cup of coffee ($7.95) - The waitress said the only bread pudding they offered was the Snickers one.  I don't recall a Snickers bread pudding on the menu, and this one didn't taste like there was any Snickers in it.  No cup of coffee arrived with it either.  It was good though.Service was okay, water glasses were refilled in a timely manner. We thought she forgot about our dessert since it was taking longer than usual.  But I think that's when it was busy in the kitchen, so that could explain the lag time.  Overall, Hash House A Go Go is the place to be at for big breakfasts.  (Looking back at my other review, I had a much better experience before!)3.5 starsMy friend told me about this place and when I saw the pictures of the food, sold!!The wait for our table was 45 minutes, which is pretty typical for Vegas I've noticed. Then it got extended to a hour because the people at our supposed booth wouldn't leave. The thing that kept us from leaving? The huge platters of food being brought out.Shared the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken with Maple Reduction. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=dbftVwJt5k64QnewOJUXLA) It comes with 2 eggs, bacon, tomatoes, mashed potato, biscuit and fruit. So much food that I couldn't even finish my share! The chicken was soo tender. And the mashed potato...mmm delicious! My friends got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=lBpd6yqIk3pYFrZ7n9z7cw) and Kiwi Lemonade (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=tUJzW857Q9RmIInyPlu12Q). The benedict was massive and looked really really good. The lemonade was very cool looking also, although it tasted more like watermelon juice than lemonade.Overall, great brunch. Definitely worth the ride and wait! =DIt was nice to get away from the bustle of the Vegas strip to come try Hash House a Go Go for brunch. The wait took around an hour for the 5 of us since it was pretty darn busy on a Saturday afternoon. We just sat around and admired all the autographed menus lining the entry way. Their menu had an incredible selection too! I think I would have had trouble deciding if my friend Marti L. hadn't already suggested a dish that sounded delish.Andy's sage fried chicken meal ($13.95 and $2.50 extra to split the dish) - OMG!! The portions were humongous! No wonder HH was featured on Man vs. Food before. haha The prices are totally worth it if you share the dish with one or 2 other people. My faves were the bacon mashed potatoes and fresh baked biscuit. The chicken didn't taste of sage at all to me and a was a little dry...there wasn't enough maple reduction but was fried to perfection! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=rOcMiMAsg_K3yC-aOPggPA)I sampled the kiwi/watermelon lemonade (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=AvvDoT4CdKsnfcCSUuy5vg) which looked pretty and was really tart just the way I like it. I also tried the bacon waffles which were to die for! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=AvvDoT4CdKsnfcCSUuy5vg) The batter was soft/chewy and the bacon complimented it very well. The food took around 20 min to come out but it was well worth the wait! Our waitress was dressed like the Chiquita banana lady too. lolFun meal and great, affordable food!This time I came back during real breakfast hours (as opposed to fake hours).  I knew what to expect with the food, but not with the wait.  It wasn't bad at all...considering how many people were waiting.  Service was better than my last visit, which was excellent back then.  And cleanliness was obvious!    As usual lots of staring at unbelievable portions of food.  This time I had the Tractor Driver combo with a Brown Sugar Banana flapjack.  The "large pizza" looking flapjack tasted great, not too sweet.  Although I did like the Blueberry Pecan flapjack better.  I also ordered a side of crispy potatoes, which was addicting.The griddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream tasted better than it sounds.  And the Sage Fried Chicken with Bacon Waffles didn't only look breathtaking, but was outstanding in taste.  There was actual bacon strips inside the waffle!  I'm working my way up to the one-pound stuffed burgers.  Give me a month...My first visit to Hash House A Go Go was for a CMYE event, so I couldn't officially review it.  My second visit was a simple breakfast with The Better Half (TBH).I ordered the Chorizo Hash (Chorizo, Jalapeno, Cheddar Cheese, Potatoes, Eggs, Biscuit, Peppers & Onions).  TBH ordered the Salmon Benedict.  To wash it down, I had the Mango/Peach Iced Tea.After a short wait, the food came out.  Since we have been here before, we knew what was in store for us....a massive plate of food.  Adam Richman from Man vs Food picked a great spot to host his show.....portions are LARGE!  You have to bring your A-Game to finish your plate.My strategy was simple....I will save the Biscuit for the end.  Biscuits are stomach busters.  I added some Tabasco and dove into the Chorizo Hash & Eggs.  It was very good!  The combination of ingredients had a good flavor to it.  The saltiness of the Chorizo combined with the gooey Cheddar Cheese and hot Potatoes made for a huge plate of Awesome!  I wish there were more Jalapenos on it though....it didn't seem to have enough of them.....kind of light.  The Eggs were prepared Over Easy just the way I like it....with the runny Egg Yolk covering the Hash when I broke the seal.  As I said, the Biscuit was last and I ate most of it with the final third of my dish....it was puffy & buttery....delicious and filling.TBH enjoyed her Salmon Benedict, but could only manage to finish 1/2 the plate.  I packed up the other half for later.Overall, it was a great experience, just like the first time.Will I return?  Soon....very soon!WOW!  Can we say BIG FAT DISAPPOINTMENT??The first time I tried to line up here, they said it would be a 1.5 hour long wait.  Good thing we decided to go elsewhere because if I waited 1.5 hours to eat Hash House, I would have been even more upset.The second time I came back, we were seated within 15 minutes.  Outside, you see pictures of celebrities that have eaten at Hash House.  The main reason I decided to visit Hash House was because of the raving reviews Adam Richman gave on Man vs. Food.  Adam, your credibility is seriously on thin ice with me after my experience here.Hash House is located inside the Imperial Palace hotel along the strip.  Is it just me or does this place feel cold and unclean?  Service here was also iffy.  It took our waitress a while for her to come over and take our drink orders and the restaurant wasn't even full.  She also disappeared at the end of our meal after she dropped off our check.  Then, she charged us an extra $2.50 for a split plate!  Ridiculous.  If I could give a negative star on service, I would.Hash House is all presentation.  Their dishes come out looking massive!  Andrew D. and I ordered the chicken eggs benedict and I was SERIOUSLY disappointed.  Eggs benedict is my FAVORITE breakfast meal, but the dish SERIOUSLY lacked flavor and kick.  I was waiting for my taste buds to be stimulated, but alas, it was bland.  I ended up having to season the thing to the best of my ability with the tabasco sauce, ketchup and black peppers we had at the table.Our whole group left feeling unsatisfied and a little bitter for having to waste our money on this place.  IIII felt bad also for making the group come back not ONCE, but TWICE to give it a try.Do yourself a favor and find another place to have breakfast at.  Hash House is all talk and no flavor.I have been told for years that amazing food is found off of the strip, but I never did the research prior to my Vegas trips to put this wise advice into practice. Thanks to my handy Yelp app. I easily found Hash House a GoGo and is forever in my app's debt. First of all, this place has moxie. The staff are fun and have character. The menu ranges from run of the mill (eggs, bacon and toast) to original masterpieces (snickers pancakes), of course there is room for plenty of crazy as well (O'Hare of the Dog, which consists of a 24oz Budweiser and a side of bacon). I loved the drink choices, lots of creative mimosas! Hash House will become a new tradition for Saturday morning, I can't wait to return. Word to the wise, show up before you go into starvation mode, you will be waiting for at least 20 minutes.WHY: I have been here a couple times, taking my touristing friends and family to see what everyone is and has been raving about.WHAT:  The food certainly comes in huge portions, so I've always shared.  The dish that I suggest everyone should try at least once, is Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict! It is named after the dude on Man vs. Food. I love condiments, so I usually ask for a side of gravy just in case there isn't a part of the benedict that hasn't been slightly drizzled with gravy, haha.The hot drinks are really good too, BUT my all-time favorite drink is the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade! This drink alone is what keeps me coming back! They puree watermelon, add kiwi syrup, all into lemonade which makes it HEAVEN! TRY IT!Let me preface this review by saying, I've been to both this hash house and the one at Imperial Palace and this by far is a shitton better in terms of wait time, service, and dare I say even the food. I had a large group of famished, sunday-after-vegas-weekend-exhausted friends. All of them more than ready to show hash's infamously large plates what was up. Okay well maybe that could've just been my thoughts, really.I was fortunate enough to have an eating partner willing to partake in my fatty adventure. The original request of a not so detrimental eggs benedict had been replaced by the andy's sage fried chicken benedict and a chorizo hash. Mind you, two very gargantuan orders. What a good sport, I almost kind of felt bad. Almost. Everyone got a variety of things which was of course, more food than anyone should ever force to digest in one sitting. We really enjoyed the sage fried chicken and chorizo orders --and were also the only two who finished all of our food. Side note, the fried chicken in and of itself was a bit dry. Luckily there was enough fat off the bacon, and the fried cheese to keep it moist. LOL. My friend got the kiwi watermelon drink thing which she seemed to have liked. No one else bothered with drinks. Bellies full, albeit painfully. Back on the road for a very long comatose drive home.Hash House a Go Go is one of those places you have to enjoy at least once out of the many trips you'll take to Vegas. You won't regret it. Hash House features American Farmhouse Food with a twist! Portions are huge and the combinations are creative. This place will get you eating outside of your comfort zone, and you'll be okay with it!SAGE FRIED CHICKEN and BACON WAFFLESWe had heard so much about the chicken and waffles, so the bf HAD to get it: Sage Fried Chicken stacked up high atop Hash House's famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction, and fried leeks. Remember that thing I mentioned about the portion sizes being huge?! Yeah, this is the perfect example. One look, and the bf knew he wouldn't be able to finish it by himself. Hah. Good thing I'm always available to pick up the slack. ;) BTW, it was phenomenal. I loved the bacon waffles!BENEDICTOf course once I saw the word "Benedict," I was already drawn in. But um... be warned, they don't serve "traditional" anything at Hash House a Go Go, so don't go in expecting "traditional" American Fare. I love to try new things, so I was real excited about their gourmet-sounding Benedict. I chose the HH original w/ smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted red pepper cream, and two basted eggs. Like all Benedicts at HH, it was served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mash. It was excellent. I'm a huge fan of spinach and roasted red peppers, so this was totally right up my alley. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and all the flavors melded together very nicely. And even though I am the biggest fan of Hollandaise, this red pepper cream sauce was a nice complement. BIG O'CRISPY HAND HAMMERED PORK TENDERLOIN SANDWICHThis sandwich is almost as big as it's name! It's like a HUGE pork cutlet served in a whole wheat bun, with onion, pickles, and ketchup. It comes with a choice of side.Hungry people, search no further! This thing is HUGE. This is taking "huge portion sizes" to another level. You'll have to see it to believe it. As for the taste, it was good. Almost like any other good, tasty, crispy pork cutlet I've ever had. Just 10x bigger..VERDICTOverall, if you order the "right" things, you won't be disappointed. And of the things I've eaten at Hash House a Go Go, I have yet to be dissatisfied. Try, try, try this place! Especially if you are a big eater, like me. ;)Yelp 365 - #280/365I have been to Hash House several times over the years, usually when friends are in town.  I only go when my group of friends want to go.  It really isn't one of my go to places.  I like the food, but I don't think it is super special.  Yes, you get huge servings and will almost always have leftovers to bring home, which is a plus, but not enough to make me a diehard HH fan.  My complaint would be that the food doesn't have a ton of flavor.  I have had a lot of different items that always sound good, look beautiful, and have great presentation, but almost always the food is lacking flavor.  Everything is bland to me.  I always have to add a ton of salt, pepper, hot sauce, syrup, or something to add some flavor.  I love chicken and waffles in general, but the chicken here is always lacking seasoning. I do think the Kokomo sandwich is quite tasty though!I will probably keep ending up at HH occasionally because so many friends are in love with this place.  I will keep giving it a chance when I am there because I like the concept and the idea of the place.  And like I said, I think it is ok, just nothing amazing.3-1/2 stars.In this episode of me vs. food, food has triumphed. I got my ass kicked by a chocolate chip pancake. The pancake sitting on the plate looked deceivingly flat. It was at least a half an inch thick by 12 inches. I thought it would be no problem for me to kill this thing, since the last time, I was here, I completely finished an Original Farm Benedict, and still had room for dessert. Must be getting old - I took half of it home and had it for breakfast the next morning. Spiked Watermelon Kiwi Juice was refreshing - ordered it with an extra shot of vodka. This meal was definitely carb overload. My desire for pancakes has been satiated for the year - hopefully.Portion size is unbelievable..........Be hungry but then again it was great the next day too....Love itAfter reading so many positive reviews, we decided stop here after the mall. I had read some reviews at the mall of so the hype was definitely set. When looking at the picture this place for me seem like "comfort food" with a twist. When we pulled up to a near empty parking lot we knew we did not have to to wait for a table. The hostess quickly seated us. The menu was massive and t took me a good 2 or 3 minutes to figure out where to start. Our server according to our receipt was Jay. He quickly took our drinking order and was prompt on service this evening this is a bonus. Our waiter brought out the drinks and offered us complementary biscuits big portions. For Hash House A Go Go "big portions" is a complete and total understatement. WARNING this place has monster size plates of food leaving the kitchen! This is not the restaurant to be eating with your eyes. Now, let's move onto the food quality. We had a total of four dishes the first  is the Hash House Meat Loaf Pasta. It had charred tomato, basil pesto and crispy parmesan cheese. This pasta was an a decent dish but my taste for pasta has changed since I went to Italy. Pasta in the United States is unable to compete with it. The Slow Grilled BBQ Pork Ribs was amazing. I highly recommend this dish. The ribs are braised with a house soy BBQ sauce and served with mashed potatoes. The ribs was tender and the meat just fell off the bone.The potatoes was the only disappoint on this dish since is was dry. The Kokokmo, is meatloaf with tomato and griddled smooth mozzarella cheese on milk bread. Reminded me a lot of a mozzarella grilled cheese sandwich with meatloft. It took an extra couple of minutes for the last dish to arrival comared to the other dishes for some reason. The last dish was the Famous One Pound Stuffed Burger. We had the hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar it comes with two patties with lettuce tomato and red onion. The prices were a little higher than I usually like to pay, but once we saw the plates of food coming out it didn't matter anymore. The presentation of all the dishes was well done (picture will be posted soon).Highly Recommend the Kokokmo and Slow Grilled BBQ Pork Ribs. So if you are planning to eat here Get hungry and make sure to wear some sweatpants!Living in Vegas for all these years, it was time to finally come here. They used to have a location at the M, but they closed down so we made the shlep across town in the hopes of experiencing a Vegas icon.Sunday lunch time and line was out the door with the promise of seating after a 45 minute wait. We waited in the car since there wasn't much wait seating. Ok, busy place is always a good sign of good food, right? Well, maybe it's more about the GINORMOUS portions.As you can already tell from the 2 stars, I was not at all impressed. However, I must give props to the friendly and cordial service we received from our server.Clientele that day was mostly tatted up hipster crowd with piercings and stretched out lobes. To each their own.We ordered a spicy Bloody Mary that was very good and perfect for a Sunday afternoon.We've been on a fried chicken & waffles kick as of late and eager to try the sage chicken & waffles. The pictures of it show a tower of chicken stacked high on a huge plate. We thought sharing this enormous entrée would be the best option.We were amused at the nearby table of 3 petite diners, each having their own tower of chicken & waffles. How ambitious.We finally got ours and though the presentation looked impressive...it was a huge disappointment.The chicken was soggy and skin was wet and fatty. The overall flavor of the sage and rosemary mixed into the batter was awful. We both choked down a couple bites but hated it. The waffle was ok with the bacon cooked into it, but not enough the redeem this nasty dish. This was the only thing on the menu that made Hash House a remote possibility for us, but after this experience we will definitely not return.The success of Hash House may be directly related to the frequency of hangovers in Vegas. Just the sight of their leaning towers of fried chicken and waffles could cure your hangover faster than IV hydration (which, freakishly enough, is a service you can find easily in Vegas). Opting for a fork & knife remedy over surgical needles, our experience at Hash House was thoroughly therapeutic, and still very Vegas-y. The ambiance is not much different than your local Denny's: big booths, neon colored cocktails in tumbler sized glasses, and smiley waitresses. They do have some outdoor seating and a fun 90s playlist in the background, but the real selling point is the MENU. It'll be hard to order anything but those famous sage-fried chicken & bacon-stuffed waffles everyone is Yelping about. But in case you're anti-poultry or gluten-free, you'll still find something to drool over on their gigantic menu. Homemade biscuits, big salads, scrambles, benedicts, crab cakes, griddled cheese, and meatloaf are all part of the uber-American offerings. Prices are also huge: $18 chicken & waffles, $15 cocktails, for example. But, be wise and share everything. These are party portions, and you've had enough of that. Shout out to our waitress who was SO cool, and happily split our check 4 ways without an inkling of annoyance. And hooray for fresh grapefruit & pineapple mimosas for $7... because quitting cold turkey isn't good for anyone.Items Selected:Bottomless CoffeeButterscotch Pecan FlapjackAndy's sage fried chicken benedict with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggsButtermilk Biscuit with Peach PreservesHot oatmeal w/ milk & mixed fresh fruitHaving visited the Linq location during its Imperial Palace days and also partaking in early morning breakfast at The Rio during last year's Winter Olympics a visit to West Sahara's Hash House A Go-Go was mostly for the amusement of a well traveled guest from out of town, and with absurd portions the rule and smiling service entirely amused by my old friend's antics one would be hard pressed to name a more appropriate experience to show what the San Diego import is all about.Undoubtedly more "Vegasy" than its Midwestern roots or So. Cal. origins would suggest, it was just after 8:15 that we entered the sizable spot and opting to switch to a four-top after originally being seated at a two-seater it would not be long before coffee was filled for the first of several times, an enormous menu next navigated with the resultant order entailing four items - one a daily special, and the rest restaurant signatures all arriving at once to quickly flood the table.Ever bubbly in service, with subtle pop tunes and country floating overhead, it was with great amusement that my pal bantered the server about her Energizer Bunny personality as I began to tuck in and although the oatmeal was nothing particularly special the fresh fruit and berry-streaked plate details did not go unnoticed, a little extra effort elevating an old standard while the buttermilk biscuit with housemade peach preserves remains one of the best in the city - a soft and savory center beneath a top baked golden brown.Moving on to things more interesting, it was next in the Man vs. Food favorite of Sage Fried Chicken beneath smoky pepper cream that the meal progressed and although the heap of griddled mashed potatoes was far too much to be enjoyed in its entirety every bit of the juicy chicken, fluffy scrambled eggs, and crisp bacon was devoured by the time the meal came to an end.Finishing the morning with a hubcap-sized pancake, equally soaked in buttermilk as the biscuit but receiving a substantial upgrade from toasted pecans and butterscotch chips, it was beneath a lacquer of butter, light whip, and brought-from-home maple syrup that a first bite was taken, and although the edges proved a bit dull when lacking all the accoutrements, the center of the flapjack was as good as any griddled novelty in Sin City, particularly at a mere $10.Chastised by some for portions felt to be irresponsible, and reportedly varying in quality depending on kitchen staff and time of day, all three of my visits to HHaGG as well as San Diego's Tractor Room spin-off have been memorable for not only the food but the service - a Midwestern vibe for a Midwesterner at heart, no matter what state the drivers license says.I really dig this place.Why? because they give you so much food it's enough to fill a fat ass like me up.I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich, which is gigantic and tastes great. My partner-in-eating-crime ordered the Chicken N Waffles, which is what this place is probably famous for and I can see why, as it's a monstrosity of waffles piled high with crispy chicken that will make any fatso-mcgee say "Wow".Despite being busy, which I'm sure this place usually is, the service was fast and our waiter was really nice and attentive, and even made light conversation with us. Just another day in paradise for him, as the family of 20 million people behind us with their 800 children threw chicken everywhere. No, he was definitely in zen mode and no brat was going to irritate him. You go dude.The drinks here are pretty good too. Maybe I ordered wrong or they're just weird here, but they gave me my shot of vodka on the side with the watermelon fancy thingy drink. Either way I took the shot and had a party the rest of my visit there.Straight up. The most American place that I have eaten at in Vegas. Bacon. Beer. Alcohol. HUGE portions. Chicken. Waffles. BACON in WAFFLES. Pancakes. Burgers. And so much more. Oh and did I mention, these portions a freakin' HUGE.My friends and I came here for breakfast after a long drive from the Bay Area. We knew we needed a big breakfast to give us some energy for the day and for EDC.We arrived around 9:45am or so and was promptly seated. The place was already super packed. As we walked by the tables, I took a peek at what other people were eating and wow. I don't know how people can finish an entire portion. (Maybe this is why America is so fat...although...the food was bomb).My girlfriend and I shared the signature sage chicken and waffles ($18). If you look at the pictures, you can see that the plate comes with two large pieces of fried chicken, 4-6 pieces of bacon infused waffles and a lot of onions and sage. I was pleasantly surprised. Everything tasted really good. The chicken was soft and tender on the inside and the Bacon/Waffle combination was amazing. Forreal though, it was more than enough food for 2 people. One of my friends, did however, finished his entire meal...Our server was amazing. He kept coming back to check up on us and made sure we were good. He encouraged me to eat my greens as well!! Overall, great food, huge portions, great to split! Come if you're on a date or hungry enough to eat for 2!
Fusion Restaurant and Lounge=The beautiful Carin and I decided to go dinner last night and wanted something burger, within walking distance.I had seen a review of Fusion and the burger looked pretty good so we decided to try it.WOW!!! I have had most of the burgers in the greater Phoenix area and around the USA, and this is in the top 5 of any burger, anywhere ( I am including Taylor's Refresher in St. Helena, CA and the BigAss at Roaring Fork, among others).This thing was more than I could eat (admittedly after the more than delicious Panko breaded Calamari appetizer and a really good vodka martini). The caramelized onions and jalapenos are the perfect sweet counterpoint to the meat, bacon and cheese and chili/cheese sauce on the burger.I brought about 1/4 of the burger home and I think it will be lunch today. Carin had the same thing (we both just wanted a good burger and wanted to try something different...we have been to Stax, etc., and they are good, but this was decadent).The prices were good ($48 for 2 burgers, an appetizer and the marti), and I understand they have 1/2 price happy hour during the week, so we will be going back soon!!!The service was also terrific, our waiter was attentive without being intrusive, the elements of the meal showed up exactly on time, and we had chance to have really nice chat with one of the owners, Jen Lynn ( I hope I spelled that somewhat correctly).I recoomend that you give this place try, esp. if you are burger fan.
Oregano's Pizza Bistro=I'm an fan of Oregano's but don't like the wait so I don't usually go to Oregano's. I will only go if I can get there before 5:30. So tonight was the night. I had my son run in there to get us a table. No waiting line. Ya ya. We started out with their Big Julius Caesar Salad. This is their small salad. This was huge. We had four people and could barely finish this. So good and fresh. My wife could have just eaten the salad. We also ordered the large order of wings with BBQ sauce. Huge wings with lots of meat. Really love the wings with the ranch dipping sauce. Yum yum good. Of course we always order their Chicago thin crust pizza with sausage, meatballs, and mushrooms. Fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked. Loved the meatballs and sausage so good. I'm a fan of Oregano's pizza and wings. Of course we're stuffed but you can never and I mean NEVER leave Oregano's without their pizza cookie. A must. We had the half chocolate chip and peanut butter cookie topped with vanilla ice cream with chocolate chips sprinkles. To die for. So good. This always tops off a good meal. They are always known for their huge portions and tonight was not a disappointment. Service was great. Drinks were at our table in no time and surprisingly our food came out pretty quickly. Our server and the manager kept on coming by our table to make sure everything we good. Loved the service. Like I said before. Love Oregano's. Good food. Good atmosphere. Loud and fun place to eat. Just make sure you get there by 5:30 at the latest or else you could be waiting in line for a really really long time. We'll be back for sure. Enjoy.Let me preface this by saying the Pizza and service are spectacular, five stars for those!  Why am I writing this and only giving one star? For stupidity!If the manager gave us a reasonable explanation then you wouldn't see this.My mother ordered two shots of vodka on the rocks.  She requested two olives in it... Not an unreasonable request.  The bartender came over to the table and said "we don't have whole olives, will sliced be ok?"  Huh? A bar without whole olives? Perhaps they ran out?  Ok sure my mother said she would try sliced.Presentation of the drink sucked...it came in a pint glass with the ice way above the vodka, no stir stick, and the olives? Were in a rocks glass, they weren't even queen olives, they were small sliced olives like you get on a pizza.  But I am not writing about the presentation of the drink.We got the bill for our drinks, 2-16 inch pizzas, a 12 inch pizza a Pazookie and...here it comes 2 olives!  No shit! They charged us for condiments!  We had to ask why, as we have never been charged for having a lime in a beer, or 5 cherries in my daughters Shirley Temples, or olives anywhere in the world! The bartender never mentioned and extra charge for sliced olives. $0.39 each!Now $6 a shot for vodka not unreasonable, even for rail! I am not upset about the $12 drink. The slap in the face is the charge for olives, that were not even whole!  So the manager (Carrie?) comes over and gives us some BS story that other places have figured the cost of the olives into their drink prices so that is why we have never ever seen this before anywhere in the world.  Hmmmm, how do those places know how many olives we are going to ask for? Or limes, or oranges or cherries.  You know I used three squirts of soap and three squares of hand towels when I used their restroom did I go over my limit on those? Think I should go back and have them add it to the bill? I am only writing this because I was not satisfied with the reason given to me by the manager.  My mother ordered a $12 rail drink (not call) and had to pay for condiments. STUPID!Dear Mark Russell,You have awesome people, great food, and service, however you need not charge for olives in drinks... Kind of stupid. Right?Well well well, what can I say about this little bastion of Italian food down in Gilbert.  One thing comes to mind - if you plan on making a trip to a food joint an all day affair, show up here at the open...and be prepared to leave at the close.  I've had better service in countries where they don't understand what I'm saying...but considering the dairy farm across the parking lot, it's possible I was in another country.  Got there about 11, seated by 1...I had to walk outside and check the sign again to make sure I wasn't back at French Laundry!The food was not half bad - the lasagna was the size of my sister (take it easy, she's 100 LB's), the bruschetta is served on a Toyota Corolla and the garlic bread is soaked in butter flavored oil spill.  So...2 stars for them.  For the tall cool Bud Lights.  Any more stars and I'd have one more heart attack...and just FYI it took me less time to write this than it did for one more napkin to be delivered...thank goodness I wore overalls to wipe my hands on!  Dairy Farm it is!This place is hit and miss! I have gone here twice in the last few months and im still up in the air about it. The first time the deep dish pizza was delicious! Tasted great, came out before they said it would (was worth the 45 min wait time told to us) waiter was on point and it was a good time. This last time I went with my sister it was a mad house (was a Tuesday night). People were coming and going, really loud, everyone standing inside because it was too hot to wait outside for a table, waiters running around running into each other dropping food. A lot of tension and pressure in the air for some reason. After we sat down we had 2 waitresses that were trying to be attentive but were not very good at it. They apologized a lot and we were there over 2 hours for 1 deep dish pizza and a cookie pizza to go. When the pizza came out, it was tasteless, bland and just blah. The stuffed mushrooms..... I dont even know how to describe those. They looked great and I feel had a lot of potential especially with the sausage and cheese...... but nope very bland and boring. Close to being done we ordered the pizza cookie to go, 3 apologizes later from both waitresses we finally got our bill and the cookie and left. It could have been an off night for everyone im not sure. But really not sure if I would go back. Sometimes the food is worth the wait and hassle, but after this visit im thinking Barros will take care of my pizza cravings. :/
Baiz Market Place=My ethnic experience isn't rooted in the middle eastern culture, but my fiancee's is, and she goes nuts in here buying some awesome, interesting, and delicious gear like tahini, chick peas, za'atar, feta, etc for making things like hummus, za'atar bread, and the like.  I picked up a half-rack of lamb chops and a side of couscous for prepping ($12) together.  Their butcher is awesome and far different from retail grocery chains in Phoenix.  They have a mountain of hooves, FYI.  Typically, the prices are inexpensive-to-reasonable, but sometimes the rarer items are a bit elevated in price.  That is totally understandable considering the unavailability of this type of product nearly anywhere else in the valley.  They make you put at least $10 on your debit, so be aware, though they have so much good stuff that this fee is easy to surpass.Today's lunchtime quest was to check out Baiz Market. The place is like a mirage. It sits on a barren residential stretch of 20th St. near the intersection of the I-10 and the 51. Don't worry about the car; there's abundant parking and little potential for destruction and mayhem.This is actually a business-within-a-business. The restaurant inside Baiz Market is called Al-Hana, and it's a clean, well-oiled machine. Al-Hana takes up about an eighth of the market's floor space. A young woman was taking orders at the counter and two white-uniformed cooks were models of efficiency. You can see everything being prepared as the aromas of garlic, sumac, and roasting meat fill the air.I had a small order of hummus and a chicken shawarma sandwich. The hummus was enough for four small people or two large people, and it came with a mountain of freshly house-baked pita triangles. It was delicious, but next time I think I'll ask for a slice of lemon on the side. The chicken shawarma sandwich was a miracle of industrial design. It was a perfectly shaped torpedo: juicy chicken, pickles, onion, and garlic sauce wrapped in a perfectly heated piece of flatbread. Make no mistake -- this thing is easy to eat but it's also impervious to collapse. It's the perfect thing to eat in the car (not that I eat in the car), and at $3.99 it's a bargain. For non-carnivores, the menu has grape leaves, taboulleh, falafel, baba, the famous thyme pie, etc. Did I mention the garlic sauce?After lunch, I strolled the aisles of the market. Picture the market side of places like Haji Baba or Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli, but about 10 times the floor space. Spices, bagged pitas and chapatis, green and roasted coffee beans, a full produce section... it's like being in a supermarket from a more interesting place .Definitely check out the glass cases in the back, where the meat guys reign. There are halal meats available and the staff is friendly. Personally, I locked in on the case to the left of the meat counter. Olives. An armada of olives, floating in fragrant oil. Next to the olives, red pepper paste (the ultimate condiment) beckoned. I wanted it all.Head to Baiz Market / Al-Hana for some fertile crescent-y goodness. One tip: as other Yelpers have mentioned, there's a $10.00 minimum for debit and credit cards.Kalamata, Feta, Baklava oh my!  Pita, Hummus, Baba oh my!Just a few of the items that made their way into our cart as we enjoyed our first shopping trip to Baiz Market.  This place is a great resource for hard to find middle eastern ingredients.  We got a nice block of Feta much cheaper than the grocery, for example.There were many items I saw that we didn't get this trip - we'll save them for our next excursion.  Like European Style Ovaltine.  What?  European style?  I was a big Ovaltine fan as a kid - just imagine how much more worldly I will be if a drink European Style Ovaltine purchased at a Middle Eastern Market!  Sprechen sie Global Citizen drink mix?We ate at the little restaurant in the front.  Fabulous!  Four of us shared a plate of baba ganoush, a chicken shawarma wrap, a falafel wrap and of course an order of fries.  The kids insisted they needed the fries because they probably wouldn't like the middle eastern food.  So everything was delicious including the  fries and some serious haggling took place over who got how many bites of the chicken shawarma.  We washed everything down with a pomegranate juice drink, 2 waters and an orange crush.  Perfection!So glad we stopped here!Once upon a time... when Cher was still Cheryl... I sat in my auntie's old El Camino happily eating my strawberry shortcake when my auntie stopped at a red light on the corner of 20th street & Van Buren when out of no WHERE a crack head with a gun tried to car jack us. My auntie yelled and threw an half empty bottle of tequila out the window as she sped threw the intersection. This was more than 10 years ago and things haven't improved much since that day in this neighborhood.When I read about Baiz Market it was from my fellow yelper Jim W. who ranted and raved and even encouraged me to check it out. The other night not having much to do, my friend Ree & I decided to go to Baiz Market which is just north of the intersection where my auntie & I almost got car jacked and check it out. We both have love for middle eastern food and know how to take on scary neighborhoods. When we walked up to the counter of the deli inside the quaint grocery store we were excited and a little scared of what to order. The cashier was SO patient and VERY nice about explaining everything to us! I really must give her props on that. There was a cab driver who was very helpful in explaining the different dishes and even recommended a few items. I listened to Tarek S. and chose the beef Shawerma it was delishous! My friend chose the chicken toolawoosh (is that spelled right?) sandwich which was very good with it's bell pepper, pickles and tomato fixins. We also chose to sample the small spinach pies which weren't that good btw and cheese pie which I could make at home with pizza crust & some cheese and the yummy yummy hummus that came with some pita bread. We also got a bottle of water and a can of imported orange soda. ALL this for only $27! Can you believe that?! The dining area was nice and quiet with mellow middle eastern music on in the background. Everyone kept to themselves and was nice to us even though we backed up the line. After our meal we wandered around the candy aisle in the grocery store and found lil heart shaped boxes of chocolates which - ummm wasn't that great! lol. We wanted to spend a heck of a lot more time going threw every aisle but unfortunatly they were closing so we had to leave. We will DEFINATLY be back! And prolly with a few more in tow. And no, no one tried to car jack us on our way out... but we did see a tranny hooker get questioned by the cops. Maybe if she went to Baiz Market for some baklava instead of walking the streets she wouldn't be in that situation! I'm just saying. To my yelpers, I say go! and when you go, order the beef shawerma and avoid the spinach pies! Oh and get there before 4pm so you can have time to really enjoy your meal without the rush!I ventured to Baiz Market with a few of my my friends and boy was it worth the trip!  Al-Hana, the restaurant inside, is the ultimate hole in the wall!  The hummus is so good I could seriously bathe in it.  I had the Chicken Taook which was amazing especially the garlic dip that accompanies it!  I also tried a meat pie for only $.69!  How could I resist?Because we went on a Tuesday night things were pretty quiet.   We wondered the grocery store after dinner and picked out sweets by the pound when we were done with dinner, this only added to the charm!I would definitely recommend checking this place out!  Make sure you have time to peruse the store and order the hummus whether you think you like hummus or not!If you need goat or lamb meat, you can get it here. This wasn't the reason for our trip to Baiz Market this weekend--we went for Al-Hana dining, which was delicious. However, the walk through the grocery portion of this place was great. We picked up some produce and feta cheese [I think they make their own: Confirmed, they make their own!] and overall had a great experience.I can't wait to go back and take more time to discover some wonderful products and new foods.I'm moving in. The end. This is the most authentic shop (of any variety) that I've seen since I moved to Arizona. It reminds me of the mercados I used to hit up in VA in that it has everything, hookahs to religious art, and of course food. The bakery was a mystery to me. I pointed at a few things, have since tried two of them, and I have no idea what they are. But I like them. There is a huge section devoted to turkish delights, as I sadly found out after making my purchases. Great cheeses! Massive quantities of dried fruits, nuts, olives and canned meats. If you see me brushing my teeth in aisle 4, please don't mess up my cot in aisle 2. Thanks.We no longer buy our meat from this place because the quality of service and product has been going down and down over the last year or so. After having to throw away the ground beef for the second time, we finally made the switch to I-Mart for all our meat related purchases. When we would ask for extra lean ground beef, we would have to pay an astronomically high price AND it was still not extra lean. It was full of fat and seems like they were mixing in lamb with it too because it stank like hell. I was getting tired of being badly treated by the butchers who conveniently went deaf when we would ask for something (not in Arabic) but would be completely on their toes helping whoever spoke in Arabic exclusively with them. One time when I asked for a woman to repeat herself behind the counter, she literally stared and me for a few seconds and moved over and started helping someone else. I guess we are not good enough for them to help over there. We still like the Al-Hana restaurant and they do offer some good spices that we will go in and purchase but we will no longer be using their meat counter.Great place to shop at when you're needing ingredients to make some homemade Middle Eastern food. They have several choices and brands of everything you could desire. Just pick out some tasty recipes at home and bring in your shopping list.Normally get the ingredients to make fresh Tzatziki, Hummus, and some Beef and Lamb Gyros or Kabobs. Last time picked up some Jordanian Green Zaatar. Saw them make it on a DDD show. Just mix it with some olive oil and add a little chopped onion and tomato. Really good on freshly toasted pitas or even English muffins.My favorite here is the amazing butcher section with all the different cuts of the lamb. Hearts, livers, kidneys, tongue, rocky mountain parts, and even the head. The Chicken case also looked nice and got my attention.Nice Pita Bread selection and then some. Had to pick up a few extras to put in my freezer. You can even use these to make personal size pizzas by adding a little sauce and some cheese. Cool project for the kids when they are needing a treat.Looking forward to trying their restaurant on my next visit. It always smells good and is packed with hungry people. Had several Yelp friends recommend it. Hi Guys!Kinda tucked away in a small neighborhood off the freeway. Place gets really busy and parking can be tricky. This place is like a top secret OASIS in the Desert. TOUCHDOWN!4 STARSAl Hana, their restaurant inside of the grocery store is a total 5 stars!  This review is for the Baiz Market, the grocery store.  For us, this is a great "go to" place for some key items we need from time to time that our local grocer doesn't carry and/or they offer a better quality.  Some of the items we shop for while at the Baiz Market; ~the BEST place in town to get your pita bread!  Both white and wheat and in different sizes.  ~they have a fantastic selection of middle eastern spices especially curries.  ~they have some great butchers that will chop, slice and dice every part of a lamb, cow or goat.  ~they butcher fresh ground to 30/70, 20/80 and 10/90 ~a great selection of nuts, sesame seed and olive oils, curries~some great pastries Sometimes they have seasonal produce you may not find at your local grocer but you have to search for it.  Their produce is not one of their qualities.  It's a great place to pick up some groceries and have a bite to eat!  Maybe I'll see you there.If this place wasn't 10miles from my house I would frequent it all the time!! I went on the road trip here seeking Pomegranate Molasses...yes it is a thing.  They had 4 kinds to choose from!  Mind you I had been to Fry's Marketplace, Whole Foods and Trader Joes trying to find the stuff!  As a side note the Trader Joes 'guy' told me to come here after doing a bit of googling!  FYI Pomegranate Molasses is $27 on Walmart's website!!! At Baiz they have four kinds ranging from $2.49-3.99!  So they are extremely reasonable.  The vegetables section is very fresh with a great variety of vegetation.  If you are making anything from scratch Baiz has amazing ingredients and obscure items to make exotic dishes!  The customer service was very friendly; there were only two cashiers open and decent lines.  But really no big deal, I was tantalized by the yummy looking foreign chocolate bars surrounding the register, but somehow managed to resist!  Just being in Baiz Market inspires me to want to cook more!!  I will be back.
Hole-in-the-Wall=This is a great place to go for lunch or dinner if your in the area.  It is also becoming one of our regular "stay vacation" destinations for dinning when we stay at the Pointe Hilton Resort.  Restaurant ~ decorated with plenty of "cow poke" decor everywhere with a rustic saloon kind of feel to it.  It's very clean and they have a huge patio that over looks part of the swimming area. They have a nice but somewhat small bar area with a TV if your not into the western thing.Service ~ everyone is very friendly and attentive to their customers.  Not sure why some Yelpers have been treated differently but we've been to Hole-in-the-Wall several times without any issues and find their service to be very good! Food ~ They have changed their menu over the past couple of years and we miss a few of the exotic things they used to offer.  Their current menu has a very good variety choices to choose from.  If you like ribs, they have some very good tasting ribs with a good smoke ring.  If you and your guest are hungry I would suggest getting their Backyard Feast for two.  It is a bottomless plate of BBQ goodness starting with salads, ribs, smoked brisket, smoked chicken and some side dishes.  This is one of those dinners to where you skipped lunch earlier and your ready to belly up to some good eats!  We like their smoked and gilled salmon with a three chili peach chutney and fried green tomatoes.  Yum!   Don not forget desert here!!  They may talk you into their creme brulee, which is delish or their house made warm donuts served with a chocolate creme sauce which is also very tasty, but just say no and go for the make your own s~mores!  We have a blast cooking (charing) our marsh mellows over the little open fire they bring to your table and then smashing the melty-marsh-mellowy goodness between two gram crackers and a piece to chocolate bar!  It's loads of fun!  Pointers ~ Ask them about their dinning package.  When you stay at the Pointe Hilton Resort you receive two $25 vouchers upon check in to be used towards your dining experiences.  They have a really fun swimming pool, great resort and a really neat restaurant ~ Hole-in-the-Wall!  Plan a "stay vacation" and enjoy one of the fun "gems" Phoenix has to offer.  May be we will see you there.07/07/13The food and cocktail flyer my sister found (or was handed, I'm not sure which, for I wasn't there when she acquired it) mentioned specials from all the restaurants and bars there, and on Fridays through Sundays, Hole in the River and Rico's American Grill offer 20% military discount on both food and cocktails purchased there.  (Yes, even spouses of military personnel.)  I wish all restaurants delivered food to the pool area, but I suppose that could be taxing when it's too hot and a madhouse of people (moving from one pool to the next) outdoors.  We purchased a couple of cocktails from Slim Pickens, the grill and bar situated at the pool area, and I really enjoyed my "Black & Ginger," which was made with Capt. Morgan spiced rum, Cock 'N Bull ginger beer, and fresh lime, $8.  I wanted to order seconds!  We ordered food from Hole in the Wall (look for my review there soon), but ordered a Pound 'O Fries ($6) a couple hours later (swimming burns around 11 calories a minute!), and it was delicious!  I enjoyed the fries plain, which were simply seasoned with salt and pepper, but also came with ketchup and ranch dressing.  The Pound 'O Fries app was a big hit with everyone!While I saw many servers (dressed in turquoise shirts) darting in and out of the crowds, I never saw any nearby when we needed a drink, or wanted to order food.  There were water dispensers, with small plastic cups, all around, but if you want ice-cold water, you can get some from the bar.I always have a great time at Hole In The Wall! It reminds me of visiting Arizona as a child, even though we never stayed here when I was a child. However, it has the same vibe. Hole In The Wall is a great family-fun atmosphere. They have a patio that overlooks the beautiful pool and it truly makes it feel like paradise. The patio is perfect for a party or simply enjoying a night out with family or friends. Inside, the atmosphere feels true to the cowboy feel. The checkered tablecloths and Most Wanted photos add to the atmosphere and they serve drinks out of cowboy mugs. The food here is classic BBQ. I've enjoyed the BBQ Nachos with chicken, cornbread and ribs...all of which are amazing. The BBQ chicken is definitely my favorite. Hole In The Wall does a great job of making this a fun environment for all and it's a perfect place to visit regardless if you're staying at the resort or not. In fact, it's a great restaurant to visit if you aren't staying at the resort because then you can feel like your on vacation!
Archi's Thai Kitchen=What a delicious last meal in Vegas, all thanks to Archi's Thai Kitchen, I'll will be back! Dishes: Fresh Springs Rolls, Chicken Pad Thai, Beef Pad Thai and Shaved Ice (Pictures will be posted)Archis has a VERY friendly waiting staff! As for the atmosphere, it has this vintage and inviting feeling like a house! It was nice enough so you didn't feel cramped. I would highly recommended trying the pad thai! Coming from NYC, and having a love for Asian cuisine this is probably one of my top two places. The shaved ice desserts is deceiving because it was not shaved ice. When I think of shaved ice, I think of Malaysian Ais kacang (ABC). This seems more like a type of ice cream but the texture is different from store bought brands. The shaved ice here is some type of ice cream topped with condensed milk and boba! I would still recommended this dish as well. The only reason this restaurant did not get five stars was because of the Fresh Springs Rolls. Fresh Springs Rolls reminds me a lot like sushi.The steamed rice paper that wrapped the other sides is unable to hold all the other ingredients. When you pick it up everything falls apart making it very hard to eat.Archi's had a charming, rustic feel to the place. On the inside, the decor relies much on objects placed in the room, and not fancy decorations adorning the walls. The paint looked old, and there were some patches on the wall. Overall, the restaurant looked clean and it was a little busy when we were seated.Their food didn't really blow me out of the water. I have had better Thai food in Vegas -- the food here is just average. I had the yellow curry, which comes with jasmine rice and your choice of meat (I chose beef). They asked me for the spiciness on a scale of 1-10 and their 4 was just right; not too hot, but just enough spiciness to be flavorful. It was a filling meal, but there are probably better places out there with the same price range as Archi's. When it came to desert, they had mochi ice cream on the menu. Unfortunately, the waiter told us that they didn't even serve it anymore (menu update?). I'd probably come back because it's in close proximity to where I live, but I wouldn't say it's as amazing as all the hype it seems to have.
Chili's Too=I've been here many times over the past few months and have tried their Appetizer Sampler (Sliders, Artichoke/Spinach Dip, Boneless Wings) and Classic Breakfast (2 Eggs, Toast, Breakfast Potatoes, Bacon) dishes.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fDe1ZAfFfeV70ngBdG9gog?select=DPRfi8hFYN_ep6YxCd7oRwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fDe1ZAfFfeV70ngBdG9gog?select=H0rl4_E86CYMV98m2bVbDAThe food is decent, but not great.  Since Phoenix has very limited food choices at the airport, I like Chili's Too out of all the other options.The service here is borderline terrible though, the employees are not very friendly and their really slow!.....overall, I'd give it 2.5 Stars, but rounding up because I'm in a good mood today.Return Factor - 75%
Cucina Tagliani=This is a very nice Italian restaurant that's perfect for lunch or dinner with your family. It's nice inside and the service is top notch.  I've only eaten here a few times but was always greeted by a friendly person who chatted a bit on the way to the table.  The servers are also friendly and attentive. We got a sampler platter for a starter the last time we came and it was a lot of food!  It comes with artichoke dip, chicken wings, onion rings, mozzarella, zucchini and mushroom fritti. No problem serving three adults and two kids.They have a nice menu with a number of choices. But, I figure that any place that has the tag line, "your neighborhood pasta place" is giving me a hint about what to order. I've had the Baked Ziti and the Sausage Lasagna. Both dishes are very good.  Their sauce is delicious and they're a contender for the best meatballs in the valley.Nice place for a good meal with your family - note, they have a very good children's menu.
Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop=We finally made it over to check out the dessert selection at Jerry's Famous Coffee shop! I was in the mood for banana cream pie, they were out so we settled on a chocolate cream pie. A slice of pie is $4.50 so we decided on a whole pie for $15.00 which is 7 large slices. I like that they pre-slice the pie, very convenient and will avoid the mess of cutting it on your own, also the slices are equal size!Mmmm this pie is yummy for sure, love the chocolate whipped mousse like cream filling and the white whipped cream they use is also tasty. The crust is flaky and tasty as well as the generous garnishment of shaved chocolate! This is a generous and rich pie, well worth the $15 bucks!They had the old school style refrigerated glass cake and pie display case and a spinning display. That was a blast from the past for sure.We selected from what they had already made. They had a strawberry shortcake cake with strawberries so large on top. I just could not bring myself to paying $36.00 for a cake when it is not even a special occasion. It sure looks delicious and I think next time I will get a slice to test it out first, I am sure is worth the money as it looked Divine!You can call ahead for a special pie or cake request.All cakes and pies are homemade on premise out of their bakery.The options are mind blowing and all look Amazing!I can not wait for the next opportunity to try other pies and cakes!Cakes...cheesecakes...pies galore all from scratch!CAKES...angel coconut cake, banana cake, black forest cake, black out cake, boston cream cake, carrot cake, chocolate fudge cake, chocolate mousse cake, chocolate peanut butter cake, frost cake, Hawaiian cake, German chocolate cake, Kahlua cake, lemon white cake, m&m cake, marble cake, mango cake, orange cream cake, milk cake, Oreo cake, peanut butter cake, pineapple upside down cake, strawberry torte cake, strawberry shortcake cake, tres leches cake.CHEESECAKES...blueberry, cherry, chocolate, fruit delight, lemon, macadamia, peanut butter, Oreo, plain, raspberry, sour cream, Reese's, strawberryPIES...apple, banana, blueberry, cherry, chocolate cream, banana cream, peach, lemon cream, pumpkinMmmmm yum for sure a great place to get a birthday cake and you can view the menu online and see the options from chocolate gonache to butter cream frosted cakes etc!Delicious baby!I have been missing out all of this time, I wish I had known sooner about this wonderful bakery!Items Selected:Strawberry Ring - Choux, Bavarian Cream, Whipped Cream, Glazed Strawberries, Chocolate ShellJerry's 50th Anniversary Almond Nugget Cake7-Layer Carrot CakeBread Pudding CakeMonte Cristo with Hash BrownsButtermilk BiscuitCoffeeLargely incapable of sleeping in on weekends and having thus taken it upon myself to explore the Vegas 24/7 dining scene after my morning run a somewhat atypical Sunday would mark my first visit to North Las Vegas, home of Jerry's Nugget - a casino having celebrated its 50th anniversary just three days prior - and Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop, the 24/7 retro-modern eatery within.  Decidedly different from the Luxe resort-casinos of the southern strip but featuring a gritty sort charm it was just after 5:00am when I arrived at Jerry's and with a skeleton crew catering to just six other patrons in the large space service was expectedly accommodating with coffee kept brimming throughout as a somewhat slow (likely understaffed) kitchen prepared hot dishes allowing me to focus first on pastry - a collection of over fifty options baked in-house featuring cakes, pies, danishes, donuts, and more.  Beginning with the famous "Strawberry Ring" it should first be stated that for a choux-based pastry baked at least 8 hours prior to remain crisp and buttery beneath two types of rich cream speaks volumes to the quality of kitchen and with both textures and flavors aplenty the dish proved wonderful, a lightly sweet take on the Paris-Brest with a portion big enough for two or three more than justifying the $6 tab.  Working slowly through the ring with frequent coffee refills as I awaited my sandwich it was with some disappointment that when the Monte Cristo arrived the flavors would only prove average, the fried bread shining while proteins and cheese proved meager in both taste and portion, but propping the dish up with a touch of real maple syrup it should be said that at $1 each, the biscuits at Jerry's are worth seeking out - an excellent rise and good layer separation beneath a crisp, buttered top.  Taking the rest of my order to go, a veritable bargain at $5/slice, suffice it to say that while Jerry's may not be the best choice in town for a sandwich I'd be hard pressed to name a better choice for cake as each of my three selections shined; the anniversary cake a sort of dulce de leche with buttercream and frangipane vying for top billing over a delicate crumb, the bread pudding featuring two layers of rich pound cake topped with lightly sweetened egg custard and a bruleed top, and the carrot cake dense with cinnamon, nutmeg, carrots, raisins, and walnuts beneath thin ribbons of cream cheese frosting - the best I've found in the city to date and a contender for the best I've tasted anywhere in years.I stopped in at Jerry's for breakfast this morning.  I haven't been here since the 1980s.  In walking through the casino, I was surprised at how much nicer it seemed to me than it did years ago.  Since it was morning, ti wasn't very crowded with people at slots and there wasn;t a lot of smoke to bother me.I looked at the menu carefully, checked the Yelp reviews, and then ordered huevos rancheros.  I got the eggs over easy and I opted for corn tortillas.  Jerry's was very quiet.  In a short time, my breakfast was brought.  When I ordered, my server asked if I wanted mild or hot salsa.  I chose the hot.  Jerry's doesn't know hot salsa unless someone put the wrong salsa in the small dish she brought.  There was a large serving of refried beans with some taco chips in the beans.  The eggs were done correctly and the entire dish was covered in chopped fresh tomatoes and lettuce shreds.My server, Mamie, was very pleasant and competent.  She was back quickly with the coffee pot to refill my cup.  The breakfast was large, very filling, and good but there was nothing that would make this stand out above other huevos rancheros I've had.I would like to go back sometime in the afternoon and get their strawberry ring for dinner.  It looked so good in the front case as did many of the other pastries including GIANT eclairs.Jerry's is A-OK!
Chino Bandido=---Good--- Friendly service and I enjoyed the food.  I'd like to go back and try a few other items, but right now I'm kinda perturbed about this place.---Bad---  1) This is just dumb, how could you ever think of putting push/push doors on your bathrooms? Walk anywhere near the doors and you'll be smacked.  Buy two $.89 door handles and fix the problem.2) No ice tea or was it hidden and I had to press a magic button and the tea fairy would appear?3)The ordering system is not unique or funny, it sucks, it blows, it makes me want to kick a puppy.    Why must I use my secret decoder ring to find the code for what I want to order for lunch?     Example: First write the number of the entree down, if you want a burrito put a "B" next to it -BUT THEY DON"T TELL YOU THAT!!!!     WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF   Why make me figure all this out when all I want is lunch.4)Huge pictures of, what you would think to be, menu items above the register so you can order/figure out your selections. The first this she says was something like " These are not our menu items". Awesome, thanks for the mind fuck.But the food was good.I have to say I'm rather disappointed after my half hour + trek to Chandler only to be served cold Chinese food in a cavernous (and empty) retail location.  I'd read all the rave reviews about Jade Red Chicken and was amped for some kick ass grub.  Three different people I know personally  all told me I needed to check out CB as well and one of my buds, whose culinary curiosity is on par with mine, says he literally craves this stuff.I was pretty stoked to try something new tonite for dinner as we tend to get bogged down in central phoenix and eat at the same places over & over again.  It's Friday nite, I'd had a few beers after work and had  a pretty light lunch, so I was beyond peckish and downright ready for the taste sensation I expected Chino Bandido to be.  My better half and I drove from CenPho down to the culturally devoid center of the Universe (aka Chandler), hungry and excited.  We'd read the reviews, used the interactive menu tool on the CB website and we were pumped for an excellent, if not quirky dinging experience.  Not.  ;(The restaurant itself is in a bizarre, gravelly strip mall, oddly wedged between a nail salon and a store called simply "Wide Shoes".  We walked in to what felt like a vacant student union during spring break - -when everyone else is in Ft. Lauderdale, Rocky Point or the Caribbean and you're the only kid broke enough to stay on campus and work at your library job.  There were maybe 25-30 other diners in the place but it is so huge inside that it felt empty and barren.We were greeted by a nice-enough counter lady who took our orders and punched them into the register.  I felt somewhat robbed of the paper-menu ordering experience I'd heard so much about -- no challenge, nothing unique.   We grabbed our drinks, utensils and straws and settled in at the end of a LOOOONG vacant  Rubbermaid folding table. Jason asked why they had church buffet tables set up.  I thought maybe there was something cool about them....but nope...just cheap tables.  We looked around a bit while we waited for our food to come over and raised our eyebrows questioningly at one another. I kept waiting to "get it" -- which I figured we would when the food arrived.There were some screaming kids running around while their parents ignored them, chatted with one another and texted.  (BRATS! BRATS!! BRATS!!!  Get outta my yard!!  ...I yelled inside my head like that mean old lady from down the block when I was a kid). My annoyance with bad parenting aside --I couldn't figure out why everyone loved this place. It has all the ambiance of a med-clinic. I felt like at any minute a middle-aged woman in chili-pepper-embellished scrubs would shuffle over, hand me a clipboard with a flower-shaped pen, ask me to sign a release form and pay my co-pay.  There wasn't even MUZAK playing -- there was NO music playing which made the place seem even more devoid of life.The food soon arrived and we dug in eagerly. Everything was a smidge above room temp -- if that, and pretty boring to be frank. The Jade Red Chicken is pretty comparable to Panda Express' orange chicken.  The BBQ'd pork didn't seem to have any asian BBQ flavor -- more like roasted pork soaked in sugar and the cold, thick refried beans could have come from Taco Bell or a can. Nothing unordinary or even interesting here. The only thing that was in the least bit interesting was the pork fried rice which tasted oddly like it'd been cooked with cheap white sherry and shallots -- which I've not experienced before with fried rice. That was "atypical" but certainly not interesting or enchanting.  The only redeeming thing about the meal was the Snickerdoodle which seemed oddly out of place for either Mexican or Asian food.  It was pretty good though.Even though I was physically full after the meal I felt very emotionally empty, oddly depressed about Chandler, its environs and its residents.  Everyone else in the joint seemed oddly devoid of emotion as -- certainloy not like people who go out to dinner on a Friday evening.  I'm thinking we should have aimed the car towards the original Chino Bandido in the Aves.  I am  a fan of asian and latin foods and admittedly have an odd penchant for cheap asian buffets -- so I'm usually pretty tolerant of cheap bad fried foods.  I'm thinking that the original divey joint didn't translate well to Chandler, so I'm willing to give CB another try -- just never again in the east valley. Please someone explain to me what I'm missing here.It looks like everyone's experince here differs greatly.  It is a novelty to say the least.  Where else would you find asian/mexican/carribean food?  When we first arrived there was no one there.  The guys behind the counter were super helpful in giving out samples and showing me how the ordering process worked.  I placed my order, got drinks, and sat down to wait.  My daughter waited patiently while looking at pictures posted on the wall.  When the food was ready they brought it out to our table.  My daughter had a cheese quesadilla and white rice.  Ya, I know, but what can you do?  I was a picky eater as a kid too.  I had a jerk chicken quesadilla, carnitas, black beans and pork fried rice.  Was it the most amazing food I've ever had?  No, but it was good and it was cheap and better than Micky D's any day.  My daughter gobbled down her rice and quesadilla.  It was tasty, the jerk chicken had just enough heat for me, the carnitas were tender, and the rice had nice flavor.  The decor is a bit different.  It's a huge area with lots of seating.  It feld kind of echo-y when we got there because it was empty.  The kitchen looked clean but I noticed some of the table needed to be wiped down better and the soda station could have been cleaned up a bit more.  This is a great place for families.  Mid way through our meal more and more came in.  There is a little children's play area in front of the asian/mexican panda bear in the corner.  My daughter took the opportunity to make some new friends.  Am I going to go back.  Yes, I will.  Cheap eats other than fast food are hard to find. And you get a cookie with your meal.....Snickerdoodle please!
Hank's Fine Steaks=Kristine, my "lil sis" from college and I were treating ourselves to a nice dinner (during our weekend away in Vegas)... and Hank's looked like the perfect spot for our night out. Upon walking in the dimly lit dining room, I was impressed by the decor, and the plethora of servers busily running around the dining room.  As we were escorted to the very back of the dining room, we joked that we were being sat at the kids table....still the ambiance was relaxing, and the drink menu was abundant. I ordered a Brassy Blonde martini, a spin on my favorite pineapple martini which didn't live up to it's predecessor, but still - it was tasty and tart.The basket of bread they sat in front of us was warm and had a great variety to settle our appetites while we waited for one 1 of the 3 servers that were assigned to take care of our table.  Now THAT's service!  We ordered:The Chopped Salad (and split it between us)2 petite filets (mine with a Gorgonzola crust)A side of creamed corn (and split it between us)A side of jumbo baked yam (and split it between us)The salad arrived - small portions split on two plates between us.  It was delicious UNTIL I bit down on something SUPER hard and sharp. OUCH!  Seriously, I thought I broke my tooth. When I removed the item, it looked and felt like part of my tooth... Kristine called the server over, and he called the manager over to see what it was that I had bitten.  It was a sharp piece of crab shell!  In my salad!  Thank God I'm not allergic to shell fish because it could have been a much bigger issue.  Anyway, I digress.  The manager asked if I needed medical attention... but after feeling my tooth - I told him that while it hurt, it didn't feel like it was broken... so he comped our salad, and we moved on.I decided to order a glass of red wine to complement my steak and requested it prior to our steaks being delivered....The steaks came out - and while mine was perfect, Kristine's was super over done.  The server noticed, and insisted on bringing her a new steak - and that it was only take "1 minute, 1 minute, 1 minute" so I kept eating mine... as she still had the sides to munch on.  10+ minutes later, my steak is gone, and hers was just re-arriving. This time it was perfect, but so much for dining together...and my glass of wine was just arriving by this point. (Side note, the cream corn and the yams were both excellent)So now we're both stuffed and ready to go into food coma mode... even with my sore jaw/tooth but the server insisted once again, that he bring us dessert.   We chose the molten lava cake... which was rich, gooey inside and a little dry on the outside... EH.  Not the best I've had... but it was a nice gesture. So...almost $200.00 later, the two of us bid farewell to the steakhouse at Green Valley Ranch Resort....and I didn't think I'd think much of it again... it was good food, great service but not necessarily a place I'd go back to.....Now fast forward a week later.... I am snacking on a piece of bread (SOFT BREAD) and I hear a crunch.  My tooth broke in half!!! The same tooth that I injured during my dinner at Hank's - eating a chopped salad!  Seriously?  Looks like I'm heading to the dentist... UGH!12/29/11 DINNER.The food was great, BUT EXPENSIVE. (But we knew that, going in.)The service was great. (In fact, the waitress was very sweet and attentive. I feel sorry for her, having to work there. The tips must be good.)BUT the "corporate" leaders AND their policies are ... well ... SCREWED.We went to GVR to attend an event coordinated by an outside entity ("Rock N Roll Wine", http://rocknrollwine.com/thursdays.html), which had advertised in their flyer online "...in addition to the great wine and live music, GVR is offering 15% off dinner to anyone with a Rock 'n Roll Wine wristband in any of their restaurants."So after the event (6p-8p) we decided to take advantage of said offer at Hank's, in the lounge. To make sure they would honor the 15%, we spoke with the "suit" at Hank's.He told us that the event coordinator did NOT have the approval of Stations Casinos (the parent company) to offer that discount.So we were screwed.Wouldn't they just honor it, since we were eating a small ticket after all? It wasn't gonna KILL their receipts of the evening. (Keep reading for details.)Answer: NO.But the icing on the cake?I got home to find that my bill at Hank's was taxed 18.1%, not 8.1%.Don't tell me I was charged a 10% RESORT FEE to dine at what is, basically, a LOCALS hotel/casino?What is WRONG with these corporate hacks? Do they WANT to drive business away? In THIS economy?We've been to Hank's a number of times in 2011, during happy hours as well as regular business hours, spending lots in the restaurant and bar.And we're done. I'll never return to ANY Stations Casino ANYTHING, after tonight. Who needs this?12/30/11 ADDENDUM.We went back to the restaurant this evening to get an explanation as to why I was taxed 18.1%, not 8.1%. They stated it was not a RESORT FEE, it was the ENTERTAINMENT FEE. HUH? I had been to this restaurant MANY TIMES over the past year I've lived here. I've sat in that same bar, I've eaten while their guitarist (it's been the SAME GUY, the entire year) played, and we were NEVER charged a 10% ENTERTAINMENT FEE.Well, obviously "We Luv Locals" no longer.I'll reiterate. The ENTIRE Stations Casino chain, with which we've done lots of business over the past year of living here, has lost ALL of our future business. We will no longer visit GVR, Sunset Station, Fiesta Henderson, Boulder Station, ANY of them. No more dinners at the Broiler, Cabo, Pasta Cucina, Terra Verde, Grand Cafe, buffets, especially HANK'S, EVER AGAIN.And ALL THIS over the princely sum of 15% off $115 = $17.25 + rebating the 10% ENTERTAINMENT FEE of $11.50.We sure hope Stations got their $28.75 worth from this idiotic move, to not have any more business from us, ever again.I was waiting for the moment Hank's was going to disappoint, after all its in any establishment's nature to have a bad day. But it never happened. Coming here 5 times - every steak was phenomenal, martinis were never anything less than tasty, the service was always impeccable, the live entertainment was consistently classy, and every experience was top notch. It should come as no surprise to anyone but it is without a doubt, Green Valley Ranch's best restaurant.It started with their 5-7 happy hour. Sitting by the bar and enjoying the piano ballads / live jazz, while sipping away with colleagues / clients on some of their killer martinis. From the dry glass to the exotic flair, I have always enjoyed their lychee and koi martinis. Every sip was smooth and the potency of the after taste made for a great finish. As one goes further into Henderson, these places just don't seem to exist.When it was evident the drinks would be taking a toll, it was on occasion, some complimentary bar food from the generous bartenders. If it wasn't drinks on the house, it was sides from the kitchen. A creamy and no frills mac and cheese, some cream spinach, an incredibly tasty lobster chowder, and a fresh, yet plump variety of shrimp with some cocktail sauce. After too many chowders / bisques, along with some of the best crab cakes in Sin City, did I finally decide to shoot for what they're known for best: Steak.I started small with a petite filet mignon, which for $40 was a bit more paltry than I had hoped. But any meat with the words "petite" or "small cut" is going to be a pricier, albeit unsatisfying portion for any serious carnivore. Instead of focusing on its size, I switched it to its taste, which was nothing less than foodgasmic. Charred bits, smooth textures, and juicy meat at its finest. I eventually moved onto to the full sized 9oz filet($46) and the prime rib New York ($45), both of which had me going gaga for more.Then there's the grand daddy. It's name is the Tomahawk Ribeye ($95) and while its a portion for two, I think I can gladly take it on by myself. It reminds me of something Tarzan or Fred Flintstone would eat - a hilarious hunk of meat on a bone, with a smell that ignites hunger for even the most casual meat eater. Paired with a gorgonzola crust ($8) and seared foie gras ($19) to add to the meal and sides of creamed spinach and potatoes, and its both a vegans worst nightmare and a glutton's finest moment.I admittedly don't visit Henderson as much as I used to, but after writing this review and an impending trip to Vegas, I think I'm due for another visit.Dreamy scenery, with the warmth of the huge glassed-in fireplace contrasting nicely with the crystal chandeliers. Excellent service, with our server explaining the menu to us in depth. Good food. Not excellent, but good. My one problem that I couldnt overlook and which really spoiled the whole experience for me was this:Our waiter duped us into buying an entree. Allow me to explain. We told the waiter we wanted to split a meal. We werent that hungry and why pay for an extra plate if not necessary? We TOLD him this, and we were willing to pay a sharing fee or whatever. So after he told us the specials, the last of which was a surf and turf that added on scallops for $15 or so, we gave him our steak order. The waiter says "would you like to add on an order of scallops? Theyll complement the steak very well." I say "ok" assuming it would be an add-on. Nope. I got five (albiet very large) scallops. On a separate plate. We shared everything. And when tge bill came, those scallops werent $16, or $20, but THIRTY-EIGHT DOLLARS. So what probably would have been four and a half stars turned into two. Left a VERY bad taste in my mouth. I doubt we'll be back.This is an update for the bar area.  Went on a friday to listen to live music.  The singer was very good and played both acoustic guitar and piano.  However, the service was horrible and the crowd worse.  I tried a couple of their special martinis which were ok butt there really aren't many daring mixes.  The guy next to me at the bar spent 10 minutes complaining that his 24 dollar burger came on a regular bun.  So i went and sat down at the piano bar.  There was one other couple at the piano bar at the same time.  I literally witnessed them order, get served, be asked several times if they needed anything and be served again during the 30 minutes I sat there with an empty water in front of me and an open tab just begging to have something charged to it.  When the singer took a break, I went back to the bar, closed out my tab.  The bar manager asked if everything was ok and I told him no one had asked if I wanted anything.  All he could do was stammer an apology but I was already on my way out.   Shame because I really like this place and remember when you couldn't even find a seat on a friday.  I will go back though because I like live music and maybe the rest will be better next time.Happy Hour at Hanks!The girls and I stopped in for their happy hour since we've all heard great things about it.   You walk into their bar and lounge area.  It's decorated beautifully with many comfy seating all around.   During our visit here there was a guitarist playing ever so lightly which made for great cocktail music.  We decided to split their Mushroom and goat cheese tart.  Oh Yum.  So rich and creamy.  This isn't served with any bread for dipping but we received some without any issues.  We also split the chef's choice sliders.  On that particular day it was reuben sliders with sauerkraut.  Well, we respectfully requested them without the sauerkraut.  They were good but not great.  I'm hoping to try them again on a different slider option night.  Service here was good.  We didn't have any issues with drinks and refills.  There were a few different girls always checking on our table.  It was nice!Yes, I will be back again!  Maybe for dinner next time.  :-)

Must haves:Super HashMonte Cristo Meatloaf Stuffed french toast (4 pieces) with cream cheese and topped with fresh made berry compote.When Friend #1 said he usually goes to Denny's for breakfast when he's in Vegas, I knew I had to lead us all into the light!Parking was easy and free in the strip mall lot, and we seated ourselves when we walked in.  We were greeted with menus by our friendly server and coffee (regular or bold!), decaf and waters came out fast. Our food landed in front of us within 10 minutes of ordering - yay!Me: Angus Top Sirloin & Eggs ($10.95) - served with cottage cheese and an english muffin (my choice of 2 sides), my steak was perfectly rare next to the scrambled eggs.  This is what I needed!Friend #1: Corned Beef Hash ($7.95) - served w/hash browns and an english muffin, this potatoey, oniony hash had crispy bits of meat in it.  It was not as meaty as we expected - they could stand to bump up the ratio of meat to potatoes & onions.Biscuits & Gravy ($7.25) - served w/2 eggs and nicely crisped bacon, these b&gs were yummy!  Still crispy edged yet fluffy under the gravy.To share: Blueberry Pancakes, short stack ($3.50) - super blueberry-y, not overly sweet, really good!After the food came out, our efficient server brought a tray of house made jams and jellies for us.  They sparkled like multi-colored gems!We tried:Apple Butter - super cinnamony, we all wanted to eat this with a spoonPineapple Jam - sticky and chunky, like pie filling, this was tasty but overly sweet.We loved the casual diner atmosphere, and the food and service made us happy. So yes I'm a fan!Not "a go go" I repeat, not "a go go." That would just be disrespectful to this little gem in the rough.No, it's not fancy. No, their dishes don't match. And no, you won't have to take out a second mortgage to eat breakfast or lunch here. Good food is what I'm all about and this place hits the nail on the head. When in doubt, just go to Hash House (how many times do I have to tell you it's not a go go?). Sometimes you just need a little hash in your life. This place hashes like a professional hasher. Awesome flavor, great texture, and more importantly it feels like your getting a home cooked meal. Hash House is everything a chain restaurant isn't, which is why I like it so much. If you're looking for a basic breakfast they do that exceptionally well. Want something a little fancier like a Monty Cristo? Yep. They do that well. Personally, I'm more of a pancake and egg kind of fella. Mary, the owner, was featured for her pancakes on The Cooking Channel, so she has street cred. I can vouch for those tasty hot cakes, they're off the hook. Their homemade jams are superb. Generally 10+ choices and usually a few unique flavors. Hash House is definitely a "regulars" joint. Become one, you won't regret it.I'm not a morning person or a breakfast person, but I can be persuaded to do a lot if my first stop is at Hash House. Not to be confused with HAGG, up the road, this place actually has good food and service.Besides the hashes (just get the party hash that combines everything, watch out for the jalapenos, and you're good to go), there are omelets and my favorite dish, Mary's Eggs- which is Mary's take on eggs benedict. Two poached eggs on biscuits, topped with gravy and the best crispy bacon  you've ever had.Everything is sided with homemade grits (simply perfect with butter) and a bowl of fresh fruit.Their lunch options include soups, salads, and sandwiches. Monday's cream of mushroom is my personal favorite, but they're actually all pretty solid. Only open til 2PM, so run in and grab your order to go if you need to.I really don't write reviews here, but I have to let my voice be heard on how rude I was treated by "Mary".  Myself and 2 other co-workers ordered some food here.  He ordered a sandwich with fries, the other the San Diego omelette with hash, and myself tuna melt with fries.  When he got back we were all surprised to see that we all didn't get sides!!!! Not one of us.  Now I understand that if it said sides are extra on the menu but no it says "comes with your choice or sides!!! And to make it even more "wtf" my sandwich and my buddies omelette are in one box!!!!! Really "Mary"?!?!So I called and "Mary" answered it ( the reason I put quotations on this is because she said she was Mary the owner but you never know). So I told her that we didn't get any sides.  She replied that's how we ordered it......yes Mary all 3 of us decided we all don't want sides so that we can keep our figures.....OH NO!!! We are hungry boys working morning till night!!! I told her no we ordered 2 fries and one hash.  Her response was, "no you didn't". I also told her that even both my main order and my buddies main order were in the same box. Her response, "that's how you wanted it". Yes of course Mary we wanted our food together so that we can recreate the scene from Lady and the Tramp!!! So then she just cut me short and ask, "so what do you want"......Excuse me?!?! I told her well cutting your attitude to a customer would be nice.  To which she replied again, "that's how you wanted it, so what do you want?"  After that I asked her for her name and she said, "Mary, the owner.  Well Mary the owner.  Thank you for no sides even though you gave us a bottle of ketchup!!!! And thank your for your gracious attitude Mary! You remind me of the character "Mom" from Futurama.  Look it up Mary.....I will definitely not come here anymore. And will let everyone know about your attitude.  Like I said I don't do reviews unless it's super awesome service, or someone treated me bad.  You fell on that Mary.  Best of luck to you and your business....(also check out my pics on here on how our food was presented along with their menu)I really wish I could give a lower star for this place. Let me just start off by saying I really tried to give it a shot because the owner was on Chopped, so I assumed it would be a hidden gem. Nope. Our server was rude, pushy and tried to rush us to order because she "had a 45 top that was coming in". Once we were ready to order she rushed through everything, spoke over us, so we kept having to repeat our order, and never have us her full attention.I got the asparagus and Swiss omelette, mediocre at best. It was luke warm and she brought the wrong side dishes. ( White and Sourdough are two completely different styles of bread)The biggest complaint I have however...the hash on my friends plate was the Salmon Hash, which would be fine but she ordered the Super Hash, and in fact hates Salmon.So either they aren't cleaning their flat top or they served the wrong hash. Good thing she isn't allergic right? The staff is older, which I sometimes prefer, they have a way of making you feel at home. The entire time I was there I felt uneasy, in everyone's way and inconveniencing my waitress. The 'As seen on Chopped' sign on the window should be taken down if this is the general expectation here.We waited 37 minutes to get our food and our waitress was a miserable excuse of a server. Towards the end of our meal, my husband and I were in agreement - we hate our waitress. HATED her. Okay, so we came here on a Saturday morning around 11AM. We tried Eggs & I first, but they had a wait time of 25 minutes. I think if we just would've waited there instead, we'd have been much happier.WAFFLE SPECIAL ($7.55): A Belgian waffle served with 2 eggs and 2 slices of bacon. Gave the husband my bacon, who thought they were pretty delish. The waffle wasn't anything special, nor were the eggs. Very underwhelming. 2/5CHICKEN HASH ($8.45): Ordered with a side of fruit and 2 eggs. My husband said the dish was bland. According to the menu, the chicken is 'garlic-poached', but my husband didn't detect any garlic undertones. 2/5 SERVICE: A white-haired woman with glasses greeted us as we walked in and seated us immediately. She was awesome. An older lady with short brown hair and no personality is what doomed our visit. When taking our food orders she walked up to the table and just stood there, silent. Finally, she mumbled "Need a moment?". We gave her our orders and she scurried away. She didn't interact with us until she brought some food to the table, which wasn't ours. She took the plates away and said "Oh I thought these were yours". Eons later, our food comes. Not once did she return to check up on us or offer refills. I would've liked more butter and syrup but seeing as how she avoided us, that never happened. Lady had a perpetual frown on her face. If you're not service oriented, you shouldn't be a waitress! Also, it irked me that the check wasn't itemized and that there weren't fountain drinks, only bottled cokes. 0/5VIBE: Old-school breakfast diner complete with ceiling fans and box TVs.   Worth a Return Visit?Other waitresses seemed to be competent and friendly. We got the bad apple. The food was unimpressive and took waaay too long to arrive at our tables. There's a problem in the kitchen and a problem with service here.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #218
Sonoma Grille=Even though this place had three stars (and three $ signs, which made my cheap side a little worried) I still had heard a lot of good word of mouth, so I wanted to try it out.  I went about this dining process by rating it as the action started.  Our server walks up to us and asks if we had ever been there.  His response was great, telling us all about the farm to table experience they try to create there.  He was extremely helpful in picking out our drinks, Lyeth Meritage for me...at $14 a glass...YIKES.  But it was really light and refreshing for a red wine.  My friend got a gin and tonic, the gin being infused with cucumber deliciousness (I assure you, I tried it a couple times).  We're 5 stars at this point folks.We both decided on the tasting menu since everything looked good.  $35 for three courses is pricey for me, but I was splurgin' here (dah, $14 wine).  To start I choose the Wild Mushroom Flatbread.  Now bear in mind, I thought the tasting menu portions would be, well, tasting size.  It was regular appetizer size, you know, for like two people.  I ate almost all of it....other than the piece I shared with my friend.  It was THAT good.  Porto mushrooms, pesto and feta cheese.  YUM!  Still 5 stars people.I was torn between a the healthy Sonoma Salad and the Pecan Crusted Haluomi.  Since my friend is generous, she said she'd get the cheese and give me a piece.  Win win!  The salad was good but the Haluomi...holy crap!  It was amazing!  I cannot believe it's served as a whole meal.  It comes with potatoes and broccoli, but I would need something else.  Even though cheese does fill lots of voids in my life.  At this point we've downgraded the score to 3 stars because our second course came out AN HOUR after our first course was served.  The server came by only once to say our courses would be close together (because we were going to a show and in a rush at this point).  He never came by to ask if I wanted another glass of wine (a no, but still).  Or just to tell us the kitchen was running slow tonight, etc.  I would have taken any excuse.  But there was nothing.     Final course was the Crispy Indonesian Glazed Duck.  Don't get me wrong, it was VERY good and crispy, but I thought the glaze overpowered it enough where I felt like I was eating at a Chinese restaurant....where my meal would have been $8.  Regardless of the wait times I still thought the meal was solid, if not a tad overpriced.  Would I go back?  Yes.  Would I soon or frequently?  Probably not.  The mystery of the 3 star rating has been solved.  Sonoma Grill, get on your game, you could be a 5 star!I meet up with one of my friends from college about once per month, and we go out to eat somewhere on his work lunch break.  One of our recent lunches took us to Sonoma Grille.  It's probably one of my favorite places we have ever gone.The wait staff here is exceptionally friendly, and they want to help you find the perfect meal.  If you don't like chatty servers, this isn't your place.  However, our waiter was super helpful, and it was just his first day!  They must have some pretty fierce training.I ordered the crabcake BLT.  Crabcake, sunny side up egg, tomato, coleslaw, and bacon on a sandwich.  YES, please!  It was delicious, though a bit messy.  So if you're trying to look graceful.... Who cares?  This sandwich is worth it!I really loved the ambiance here as well.  Table cloths and cloth napkins for the win.  They also had a huge wine list if you don't have to go to work after your meal.  When I've gone past at night, this place gets crowded, especially after shows at the Benedum.  You might want to consider a reservation if possible.I can't wait to return and test out more of this menu!When you mess with my momma, you mess with me.  Okay, it's not THAT serious, but...  I was out with mumsie for a pre-theater dinner this past Saturday night at one of my favorite lunch spots, Sonoma Grille.  Having never enjoyed dinner here I thought it a safe bet since the majority of my experiences lunching and brunching had been fabulous to date.  The goods news - I [mostly] enjoyed my Mixed Grill (loved the Branzino/didn't love the pork shank/salty stir-fry) and she thought her pork tenderloin was delicious.  Unfortunately, our overall experience was sullied by slow service and less-than-welcoming management.  We arrived shortly after 6pm and were promptly seated by an exceptionally courteous hostess then greeted by our server Dominic, a true delight with a 100-megawatt smile.  At 6:35pm we received our drinks.  It was a beautiful day and we weren't in a huge rush so the wait didn't both me too much.  The issue came when the manager (I'm assuming) interrupted Dominic while he was taking our order to instruct him to give the [freshly-seated] table next to us extra care.  I could've let that go, but as I waited patiently I watched the aforementioned table receive their entrees before we even had a bread basket.  The moral of the story is, we enjoyed our meals and made it to the show on time, but left feeling like VUPs (Very Unimportant People).  With so many incredible options downtown I'll likely look elsewhere for our next dinner.
Touch Of Thai=Decor has been or is in transition. New floor/carpet. Looks good. I had Pat Peking. ? It was beef, green beans, carrot s in a brown spicy sauce. It might have been the best tasting and hottest spicy food I have ever actually loved. Served with rice, wonton and soup...perfect,!The staff its awesome too...they hustle.My lips are returning to normal now.
Mi Casa Grill Cantina=Having dinner out on a Thursday evening, it was slow over at Mi Casa Grill Cantina.  The hostess almost  took us all around before seating us in the corner of  this huge dining area that was nicely decorated and had a lot of promise.  We were seated in front of a giant screen TV showing Thursday night football.After our beverage orders were taken, chips and three salsas arrived at our table.  There was one limed based tamarind sauce that the BF was practically drinking, while I had an affinity to the spicy red pepper color one.  We were very impressed already and couldn't wait for our orders!After deciding on the manaza $7 (apple rum, lime juice, and mint) for myself and the caprinha $8 for the BF, we realized our waiter was very new - at his job and at this restaurant.  It humored us nonetheless as he had trouble understanding and pronouncing our drink orders.  (The BF's caprinha was a bit too strong for his liking and my manzana was pretty much an apple mojito.  It was a lot tastier than his drink, that's for sure!)  We decided to ask for his recommendation on food items since they had an extensive list.  He gave us some ideas on whether to order tapas or go straight for the main courses or do the mix and match.  We decided to try out a bunch of different things by going for the Appetizer Sampler ($17) and the Mix and Match entrees of three items ($17).  We had the waiter bring out all the food together so we can enjoy it all at the same time.The food was rather quick to come and just as well since we had already finished off a basket of chips.The appetizer sampler came with two corn cakes that were sauced up and topped with guacamole.  The BF thought the cakes were pretty decent.   Two chicken(?) flauntas also came with the sampler.  I found it to be dried out and tasteless.  The adobo seasoned deep fried calamari was left in the oil too long, and the BF couldn't taste any of the seasonings.  These items were laid out on a bed of coleslaw and came with three dipping sauces - a dill based cream sauce, a chipotle sauce, and the lime-based tamarind sauce from earlier.  There was also a cup of queso fundido, which is melted cheese that you're supposed to dip your tortilla chips in.  However, once the cheese starts hardening up, it becomes one big goopey mess that's pretty challenging to eat with chips.Of the Mix and Match entree, we got one shrimp, lobster, and crab enchilada that wasn't to my liking.  The BF was appalled when he saw and tasted what appeared to be imitation crab meat.  Blah on that!  There was one soft flour tortilla (or you can choose the hard corn tortilla instead) holding what would be our carne asada taco.   It was alright.  Hiding behind that taco was one tiny ass what they call a burrito filled with dried carnitas.  The burrito was small enough to fit into the palm of my hand.  (Was this a kid size?)  Half of the plate was covered with rice and beans.When it came down to it, I found myself eating more chips and salsa than the actual food we ordered.  That's a bad sign.  The only leftovers we took were the cheese (so we could remelt it), the tortilla chips, and that lime tamarind sauce. Service was fine.  It took awhile to get our orders in, but the food came out rather quickly.  Our waiter was nice and friendly, so no problems there.  I'm glad that we had a gift certificate too like Allison J. because it's definitely not worth the price they are charging!   Sidenote: They offer a weekday happy hour from 4 pm to 7 pm with $2 chips and guacamole, $3 nachos, $2 flauntas, $3 calamari, $1 margaritas, and $1 tequila shots.AWFUL. I had to give myself a few days of cool down to write this review otherwise I think I may have dropped a lot of "f" bombs. so unclassy. just like this place! If i could give this place zero stars I would.My friend and I wondered here this past weekend in the hopes of getting some decent margaritas. we were so wrong. we were seated by a girl who didn't seem to like her job. pretty bland. it was whatever. we looked over our menus and the margaritas looked pretty good so we ordered one each at $7 dollars a glass. I asked for a not so sweet and sour one, but a stronger one with more flavor so the waitress recommended one to me. While she put that order in my friend and I decided to share some basic beef taquitos for 8 dollars. She dropped off some free chips and salsa which were nothing too impressive. the 3 choices of salsa all tasted the same pretty much and were bland. so sad. Our drinks came over and I took one sip and already felt sick from all the sweet and sour. It tasted like a virgin drink. I'm sorry...I'm 27...don't you remember checking my ID while I asked for something of the opposite? I did not say bring me a virgin margarita. open your ears. My friend was not impressed either with his frozen margarita which tasted like frozen lemon water. UGH what is this place?! our taquitos came over and they looked like they were from the freezer isle at target. believe me when I say there was no beef whatsoever in this little things. there were 3 of them and they were the size of my boney little pinky finger. $8 dollars for what?! OMG. unimpressed. When the waitress came over to ask how our drinks were I told her mine was too sweet and I didn't like it as I moved it to the side for her to take away after one sip. obviously she didn't get the hint as she watched me and walked away. umm alright. she brought our check over and I noticed our drinks were $8 dollars while on the menu they were $7 dollars so I decided to ask her about this. She said they charge an extra dollar for the alcohol. nowhere on that menu did it say they were going to charge more money for a drink that already has alcohol in it. WTF! yes...I understand it is only an extra dollar per drink but it is the point of telling your customers about this before they order. I didn't even drink my margarita because it was disgusting and wanted you to take it away but instead you decide you want to charge me more for it?! not to mention your food sucked and was such a disappointment. I left this place so angry and upset over this. The waitress offered no help and it was obvious she wanted us out of there.I'm apparently still very angry over this about half a week later. I will make sure none of my friends and family ever go to this place. I really hope they do not stay around too long and are replaced by something better. I am so let down with mi casa's food and service.
Cornish Pasty Company=I find this place absolutely delicious, but rarely end up going there when the inevitable conversation arises: "Where do you want to go? I dunno. Where do you want to go?" It is a bit tucked away in a little strip mall, so I'm going to chalk it up to location and not the fact that I typically have the memory of a gnat.If you've never had a pasty (pronounced pah-stee, unlike the pay-stee nipple adhesives strippers wear), you're missing out on a hearty English Hot Pocket. However, likening it to a Hot Pocket does it a disservice. Hot Pockets consist of cardboard crust filled with nuclear hot goo that causes blisters and cursing, rather than sighs of content and delight. While both are great drunk/hangover food, the Cornish Pasty Co. far surpasses the measly freezer dried Hot Pocket. While they have flavors that are also available as Hot Pocket varieties (taste test!), my dining partner routinely reminds me that he will shun me for indulge in one of those. Not that it's hard to find at least five different flavors that you could imagine chowing down. I always end up just blurting out my decision at the last minute to end my indecisiveness. They updated the menu recently and it now includes a bunch of flavors that weren't previously available, like carne adovada. Mmm. So if you haven't been here in a while, give it another go and try something new.For about seven bucks you get a huge, stick-to-your-ribs pastry filled with a wide variety of meats and vegetables. I've never tried the vegetarian choices, but there are quite a few on the menu (about half as many as the non-vegetarian options). Among the traditional pasties, you can't go wrong with the oggie, shepards pie or lamb and mint. I've tried the chicken tikka masala, greek chicken, and lamb vindaloo from the fancy schmancy options and they were just as stellar. The greek salad is also pretty respectable, with a hefty amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese. Watching the cooks at work is part of the fun at this place, so have a seat at the bar. Just make sure to do so far enough away from the oven that you won't end up dried out like beef jerky at the end of your meal. When you get the bill, there's a cashier near the door that you can cash out at if you're in a hurry, since the servers are a little bit on the slow side. Slow, laid back, whatever. Their happy hour is also an awesome option to opt for, and is offered every day from 3 to 5 pm. There's a dollar off beers, three dollar Irish car bombs and two dollar top shelf shots (Ketel One vodka, Jameson whiskey, etc.), so if you're looking to spend an afternoon getting stinko and munching on some awesome food, this is the place to be.UPDATE: I've tried just about every non-veggie pasty on the menu. The salmon trumps them all. Do it.I'm in LOVE with Cornish Pasty Co!  If you've never had a pasty (pass-tee) before, picture a big pocket made from buttery-flaky crust and filled with your heart's desire!They have nearly a dozen delicious, vegetarian pasties to choose from!  I love the Veggie Oggie filled with veggie-steak, potatoes, rutabaga and onions.  Mmmmm!  Pre-order 45 minutes before hand and they'll custom make you a vegan one!My only complaint?  Since the place is so small it can really heat up because of the ovens.  Be prepared, it can get pretty hot in there!If you ever had 3 days of meetings in different cities each day, spending more time at the airports than the hotels, you will discover that you can end up eating non stop because food is available everywhere...at the meetings, at the hotel, in your luggage.... and you  eat sometimes just to pass the time.   At the end of the 3rd day, I had seen enough food to feed the LSU National champion football team.  I could out fast Les or Bear on their survivor showsDinner time was approaching.....My business associate and I couldn't face a full course dinner for at least another 24 hours...but we knew we had to eat something so we wouldnt wake up at 3 am famished.  I remembers reading about this place in Yelp that would be perfect for our situation....so remembering some favorable Yelp reviews in Phoenix  I said to him:"How about pastys for dinner?"He went from a relaxed and carefree disposition to a stunned and shocked demeanor.   He looked me like I was from another planet and his glance indicated doubt about my integrity.   Then with a delayed but dry smile he spoke up and said...."Aren't those things they wear at the.....""NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!    Not pasties......pastys."   I retorted quickly before the people in the lobby heard the next nouns he was just about to utter.   "Pasty's with a short vowel, not long.   Have you ever had one.?"Still thinking of the long vowel version, he hesitated a little and answered with a "No" veiled with a lot of doubt and concern."Good.   That's where we're going."    As I glanced over to him, I could see a sense of curiousity, dispair and expectation of upcoming chaos.We arrived at 7:45 pm.   It's dark everywhere.   In the street, in the parking lot.   We enter the restaurant and it's no brighter.   It is a very narrow and long restaurant with just enough room for seats at the bar nearly the length of the store and small side tables on the side.  The interior decoration theme is obvious here.   Build the biggest bar that would fit in this row house type of store, and accessorize the rest of the restaurant around the bar.  Sitting in a very dark restaurant, with Beatle music blaring away, this English pub type of place had a huge variety of pastys....from traditional steak and potatoes, to bangers and mash, to more contempory selections that include vegetarian, curries, and fish.   They have a huge selection of international beers, many of which are of the UK......duhhh.I wanted to eat "light" so I selected the Lovely Bit a Salmon which isAtlantic Salmon in a white wine cream & dill sauce, sauted asparagus, spinach, roasted red potatoes, spinach and roasted tomatoes. WHAT A GREAT DISH.   Everything was layered carefully inside the pasty which was served cut in half.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  The asparagus was not over cooked but had a crunch.   All the flavors blended well together.   I still wasn't hungry so I took one half of it back to the hotel....and had it for breakfast the following morning......which tasted just great.My buddy had Spicy Asiago Chicken which was spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes with a side of sour cream & salsa.   That too was excellent.If ever in Phoenix, this would be worth any drive to have lunch or dinner and a beer.After dinner I asked him if he would return to eat here and he said he readily would.    Then I detected a slight pause and a curl of a smile in the background.........maybe he was fantasizing buying a long vowel...I have a small history with pasties.  Having close friends that have been eating pasties since before Christ was born + hanging around said friends for 20 years = a small history with pasties.I recently heard about this place on Yelp and every time I saw the name, I managed to over and over mis-read it as pastry.  My only defense is that I keep getting those forwards from folks that say it doesn't matter the order of the letters or even if all of them are there, you're brain will figure it out anyway.  i guess this time my brain figured wrong.  I digress...It never occurred to me that this little known dish would have it's own establishment run in its honor.  Of course, once I finally clued in that it was pasty and not pastry and stopped acting like someone hopped up on pills, I naturally invited my pasty-lovin' friends to share in the experience.  They too were elated at the variety of pasty options and the fact this was the restaurant's purpose and specialty.  An added bonus is how f'n cheap it is.  Talk about a steal!This place was packed!  Someone said to get there before 8 or 830, but it was 7 and overflowin'.  We managed to fit 5 of us in the awkward geometrical booth built for 3.  My two pasty veterans ordered the Oggie with ketchup since that's what they grew up on (minus the rutabaga).  They both liked it, but thought it was a little spicy due to the rutabaga and the fact they are both ridiculously sensitive to spice induced heat.  One of their sig others ordered a chicken pasty of some sort which he thought was just okay.  The other +1 and I had the shepherd's pie and there wasn't a crumb to be found on either plate.  Our waitress seemed completely unfriendly and a little standoff-ish.    She warmed up as the meal progressed, chatted with us, and she ended up being a great waitress.  One of the guys drinks diet coke like he's in some sort of contest.  After he downed the first one in record time and the waitress gave him a curious "you need a refill already" look, he warned her that he drinks a lot of diet coke and will be gettin' a lot of refills.  About two minutes later she came back with a pitcher so he could refill till his thirst is content.  Rock star move on her part.  We all left full, happy, and ready for the next phase of the evening.I'll definitely be back again - maybe even for lunch since I work relatively close.  Just remember pasty, not pastry.  Yum!To review or not to review, that's the question I've been struggling with. With 50 reviews already, what more could little ol' me possibly add? Absolutely nothing, I knew.But then, today turned out to be a special day...I was trapped - back to back meetings from early morning through late afternoon with no time for lunch. Fortunately for me a good friend but obviously not as hardworking co-worker on her way out the door offered to bring me something back. Where was she going? Pasty!!! She just needed to know what I wanted, of course. So I checked the Pasty to go menu hanging from the bars of my cell - oops - I mean the wall of my cube, and to my surprise discovered that this wasn't going to be just another Pasty... Being the quasi-vegetarian I am, I've been slowly working my way through their vegetarian menu (more than 10 delicious options, including my favorite eggplant parmesan), and there was only one left - the Veggie Tikka Masala. My 11th and final vegetarian pasty - quite the momentous occasion, don't you think?It was while I was savoring the perfect mix of fake chicken, bell pepper and basmati rice in tikka masala sauce wrapped in that soft chewy crust, dipped in that rich mint-yogurt dressing that I realized, 50 reviews be damned. Something new to say or not, I've got to say it. So for what's it's worth, this is it.So, in conclusion: If you haven't been to Pasty yet, you need to go - soon. Come on, man - 50 reviews with a 4 1/2 star average rating? This place so obviously rocks! One tip: if you go for lunch, go early (they open at 11). It gets pretty busy and takes longer the later and busier it gets. Going early is also recommended if there are more than 2 in your party - there are only a couple of tables that fit 3 or more (otherwise you'll be sittin' at separate tables, or at the bar - oh, and should you find yourself headed for the bar, try not to sit directly in front of the one of the ovens, as those seats get pretty freakin' warm).I love this place. If your looking for a good English treat, this is the place to go. The food is phenomenal and the atmosphere is fun. My favorite pic is "The Pilgrim", which has Turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, and comes with a side of cranberry sauce. My husband, who is a vegetarian always gets the vegetarian Shepard's Pie, which he loves.The only two things that I think could be improved on is the inside of the restaurant is hot hot hot in the summer (better air conditioning). And, there could be more space (it's pretty cramped) for seating. Especially if there is more than 2 people in your party.Well I've still got my socks in case you were wondering.I ordered the Rosemary Chicken which was Marinated chicken breast, roasted red potatoes, brie, roasted red peppers and fresh rosemary. Served with a side of mustard cream sauce. (see pics)I'll just call this like I see it, so don't Hate, Glorified Hot Pocket Anyone??It wasn't bad at all but it wasn't the Great and Powerful OZ either.I thought it was just OK. I wish it would have been hotter also, Maybe that would have made the difference?  We even decided on the Strawberry Pavlova for dessert which is Homemade meringue shells, strawberries, kiwi & fresh whipped cream, Finished with raspberry coulé. (see pics)UGH! That was just plain awful......over ripened and flavorless kiwi, zero sugar whip cream and stale meringue all at a tad above room temperature. (and we were still charged for it)Despite the fact that upon leaving I said I couldn't care whether or not I ever ate here again........I probably will give it another try because I really wanted it to be better than it was.  Maybe it would be better if I got them to go and baked them at home?I still don't think it was great enough to have a line out the door, You'd think they were baking 100 dollar bills into these things or something.Is it a bar! It's a restaurant! It's Cornish Pasty Company! Dum do de dum.The music is superb. Elvis Costello anyone? Yes please. The beer selection while I didn't partake this trip is A+.The food....yes!I met the lovely Sarah G. here and loudly remarked on her review point of a pasty being "a glorified hot pocket" just as our waitress came by. Oops.English accent? Check.  As stated a brazilian times the chicken tiki masala is tops. They come split in half so Sarah and I traded halves and I also got to try the pilgrim. Definitely amped my excitement for turkey day. both selections were tops.I want to go here and drink and eat like a king one night. Sarah changed her tune and decided it was definitely better than her last trip and even grabbed a few uncooked to feed the family that night. How cool is that?Ate here a few times since 2004.  Haven't been in many, many months.  Love all but one of the pasties I've tried, thus far.  Great to know that you can call ahead to custom-order!  Also, you may call ahead and have your order started so that it's ready by the time you arrive!  (It took one of my pasties 50 minutes' preparation and cook time from phone call to my table!)Best to order a few and share!  Keep in mind, one of these pasties could contain up to 1200 calories or more!  One word: BUTTER.  Vegan pasties are also available, but you must call ahead to have them made.When I saw the name "Cornish Pasty" I immediately felt like I needed a peasant dress and a goose following me around in order to visit this establishment. Boy was I wrong; I fit right in with my ripped jeans, straight bangs and tattoos!! The people at this place rawk. (yes, I actually typed the word "rawk")Anywho, this place is absolutely amazing. They have a whole entire page of veggie creations that make me salivate just thinking about them! I have had the Veggie Mexican (by far the best IMO), the potato and onion and the cottage somethingorother... and oh brother, I loved them all.I think that the small dining space, worn seats at the bar and the fact that you can see your food being prepared adds to the experience.My only complaint is that it takes a bit to get your food, but they fill your drinks while you are waiting, so I can deal with it. They also have Irish Car Bombs. Very cool. Very, very cool.Ok so I don't know whom I should be exactly pissed at here... Yelp....my neighbors....citysearch....HOW HAVE I NOT FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS PLACE?????Okay Yelp, I can't be mad at you because your little mobile application showed me what was close to me for lunch when I was down in Tempe at the Japanese market buying some Echigo beer which I discovered while at Yasu.Amazing, simply amazing, I saw the outside of this place and was like, "well here we go, another smokey pub filled with old timers"But as I passed through the front door I felt as if I had been magically transported to somewhere back east, a hustling bar with employees shouting orders and pressing fine pasterys and a decor that would make even Gordon Ramsay proud.I had the traditional being that I've never had a "patsy" before and it was simply amazing, beef, potatoes and a red wine gravy that made my mouth go, um what the hell just happened? They have a huge variety and it was really cool to see one of the kitchen members sitting next to me trying out one of the new recipes and critiquing on it.....huge brownie points in my book.. Best part, 10 bucks for lunch including a 3 dollar tip. SCREW YOU ECONOMY! I'll be back for sure!!!No - this is not a review of the pasties that women wear to cover up nipples underneath their clothing or instead of bathing suit tops... this is a review for Cornish pasties... and to be honest, I didn't know what they were either, until I read the 133 reviews that came before mine!So, I finally made my way to Cornish Pasty Company today after months and months of seeing the reviews roll in, and now I know why there are so many CP fans.  This place is great!It's kind of a British pub atmosphere inside. Really laid back and comfortable - and mostly men dining... my party balanced it out as the three of us brought some estrogen inside!  The menu consists of a diverse variety of pasties, which are like calzones or English hot pockets.  They are all homemade with fresh ingredients, and many of them sound super yummy; i had a hard time deciding what to order... I went with the chicken greek pasty while my dining companions went with the carne adovada and the spicy asiago chicken.  I think we were all pretty happy with our respective orders.  I noticed they have large salads on the menu also.  I'm thinking perhaps next visit I'll try a salad - maybe even go with someone who has similar tastes to me and split a pasty and a salad?  Any takers?Either way, I'll be back - it may have been my first Cornish Pasty experience but it will not be my last!Wow... i don't think I've ever been in a more narrow place.. ever! but it was just perfect in ever way!!! They have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side... you can watch them make your food.... its like the food network... but live and you can smell it :) my coworker and i sat right in front of the oven... every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier!! :) we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients!! i had the Reuben (Pastrami, corned beef, homemade sauerkraut and Swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing) WOW... it was amazing... for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage... it was more sweet than bitter... and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery... so delicious!! and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef! over all it was very rich... but great to share.... My Coworker had the Italian.. (pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce) it looked great... he loved it... you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes... it smelled divine we didn't speak for a full 20 minutes... just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and o-m-g this is amazing... said quietly to ourselves.... all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time... just really cool guys... i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place... i cannot wait to come back!If you can find it you will enjoy it - It's a tiny place located around the FAR left side of the plaza on the NE corner of Hardy and University in Tempe.The Pasty, I was informed, is a long ago English mining tradition. Which breaks down to it basically being a "Limey's" take on a burrito. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LimeyWe tried this for lunch on Sunday - Her cheese steak pasty was amazing, and my chicken pot pie pasty was delicious too. The crust is so so flaky, and the "oven chips" with jalapeños were the best I've had. This is NOT fast food, so don't be in a rush when you visit.3.5 starsRemember when Hot Pockets were the best invention EVER? Well now there's a restaurant that is totally dedicated to a fancy hot pocket filled with tasty treats! Yup, Cornish Pasty Co!After promising myself that I would try this place for way too long, I decided to go with a co-worker for my first visit. For my first trip to CPC, I chose the Tikka Masala pasty. It was pretty good! I guess I was hoping for a serving of spicy, somewhat creamy, and savory tikka masala served in a hot pocket. What I got was a good hot pocket full of chicken and some sauce. Not nearly has juicy and spicy as I had imagined it would be, but still good. I chose the peanut butter and jelly pasty for a dessert to take home with me. When I got home and baked it, I took a bite and it was peanut butter and apple jelly? I was confused. It was ok.On my second trip to CPC, I had the cheeseburger pasty. That was pretty darn good! The meat was juicy and a little grease was dripping out of the pocket, which meant that it was nice and juicy! Whenever I am tempted by a hot pocket, I make sure that I head to CPC for a well made, tasty, more sophisticated version!Dating back hundreds of years, the Cornish pasty comes from humble beginnings. The half moon shaped baked pastry filled with meat and vegetables was designed as a lunch for soot-covered Cornish tin miners. To eat it, miners would hold the pasty at the crimped edge, and then discard that part after eating the rest of the pasty. This way the miners didn't eat the dirt they were covered in, missing out on ingesting stuff like arsenic that was common in the mines. While most tin mining is gone, we're fortunate to have the Cornish Pasty Co., which specializes in pasties.With restaurants in Tempe and Mesa, each location has its own spirit. While both are laid back, the Tempe location has a more subdued feel with dim lighting and no windows. Mesa has a brighter interior with indie rock blaring over the sound system.If you enjoy watching kitchen action, belly up to the bar at either locale for a first-hand look into the hard work that goes into making their delicious pasties.As soon as I entered the Tempe location, the warm smell of wine gravy and fresh baked crust covered me like a blanket of mouth-watering comfort. The feeling was like going home for the holidays. I know it's a million degrees outside, but the feeling transcends the summer heat.The first pasty I tried, The Pilgrim ($8), exemplified everything that tastes good at Thanksgiving, luscious turkey breast, sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions all wrapped in a tender crust, then served with a side of cranberry sauce. After one bite, I felt like I needed to pay thanks to someone.The Porky ($7) is filled with all that is good: pork, apples, potatoes, onions and sage and served with a side of red wine gravy. The problem with the gravy is that it's so tasty I'm not sure whether to dunk my pasty into it or drink it.Never able to resist a good burger, I decided to take a chance with the Royale with Cheese ($7.50). Ordered medium, this pasty was brimming with a juicy hamburger, French fries and cheese and served with a side of Thousand Island dressing. As the meat juices ran down my face, I couldn't help but think of the scene in Pulp Fiction where John Travolta explains to Samuel Jackson what the name of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese is in Amsterdam.The Peanut Butter and Jelly ($5) was served piping hot. One bite of this was not going to be enough. Filled with creamy peanut butter, raspberry preserves and sliced banana, the sweet goodness oozed out after the first cut was made. The plate was expertly cleaned in mere moments.Cornish Pasty Co. has a small, but great, beer selection, including one of my favorites, Kronenbourg 1664. Plus visit during their daily happy hour from 3-5pm and you'll enjoy a buck off of every pint.Love at first sight. Lust at first bite. And now I'm drunk with a red curry pasty infatuation. I don't know how it could have taken me so long to eat here, I've been eyeing this place since I moved here 3 years ago. This is my jam. This is what I look for in an eatery. This is where I want to hide out, drink beers and chat with my tatoo artist about the next ink-scursion.Small, narrow, dark, perfect level of noise, good music, cool waitstaff, fun kitchen peeps, inexpensive, and friggin delicious. At 9:30 pm there was a line of about 10 people waiting for tables. Yep the food is that good and the joint is that cool.New mission: try every veggie pasty on the menu and all sweet pasties.Ive been here multiple times and love their food. Living in california i come here at least once a month. Any foodie knows there is more to a restaurant experience than a great product. An amazing restaurant has three basics covered:1) customer service 2) great food offerings 3) an overall great experience. This place lacks customer service which kills the experience. I stood there on a packed Tuesday and saw 3-5 different employees walk by with no acknowledgement that I existed. No eye contact, no greeting, no words at all! After 10 mins and a line out the door I left irritated and ticked. I sympathize with the youth movement and the college atmosphere this place has, however customer service needs to be emphasized to the men and women working the floor. They are the face of your store and if this trend continues, eventually customers will get fed up and go elsewhere. If I am an owner I would be pissed if this negative behavior was going on in my business. The business acumen is very important and should be a learning tool to teach the college kids the important lessons which can be applied to all different job titles. The staff I saw working tonight looked lazy and tired. Maybe due to the high temperature of the restaurant however with poor customer service and lack of a face in the entrance greeting me with a smile and a friendly greeting, it leaves me feeling like you don't want my money and you don't care enough about your customers standing around. Eventually the attitude of we have a superior product that ppl pay for and they not have to worry about customer service will come back to bite them in the butt.Areas for improvementThe waiters should be focused on turning tables and getting the checks as soon as the dessert is finished as opposed to walking around with their heads cut off. More tables being turned equates to more tips. I saw 4-6 tables sitting talking on their phone when they could have been served their checks or ordered more food. My avg time from start to finish was between 90-120 mins! You cut my time in the restaurant to 60 mins with efficient service and food running from the kitchen this place could double its profits and increase tips. They need someone to work the front and greet the customers and let them know they are wanted, appreciated and they want to provide me with a great meal! Drinks out in under 5 mins from order (I waited 20 mins and she forgot about my 2nd beer later in the evening and I had to remind her so 30 mins for a pint of beer...total wait time for 2 drinks: 50 minsNotification on food times (depends on who is working) Challenge your servers to turn tables faster Servers need to be smiling and socialIt was my first visit.  All my co workers have been talking  about this place....with that said,  ..........walking up to this establishment is not impressive.  Please do not take a 1st date here.  All I have heard is about the expansion..and thank goodness!! This place is dark, the staff look like they are all on tour of some skating boarding ESPN tour  in town.BUT!!!!The staff  (who look like skateboarders) were great!  Each one of them so friendly, polite and very attentive. Beer selection-par none...excellent selection on tab.  The expansion section is inviting for large groups...which was perfect for our work HH.MENU- as my friend would say......UNBELIEVABLE!I took home a Carne Asada concoction and it was sooooo good.  The calzone idea is great! When you can come up with creative stuffing you can't go wrong.  Ambiance 3 ..too dark for me Staff  5+ -very friendly, attentive & politeFood 5+- the calzone spin -UNBELIEVABLE...so good.  even take home.Beer 5 -great selection on tab......can't get that everywhere.Picture this...3 $1 bills (which may or may not be from a bet I lost (or won) at the strip club)...an affinity...a propensity...nay, a proclivity! for Irish Car Bombs and a menu that says 'CAR BOMBS: ALWAYS $3'.Those 3 words, squiggly symbol and numeral made me squeal and giggle with glee. The music they were playing was also very appeasing.Monday night, Hubzilla and I were looking for ADVENTURE!, completely exhausted with the usual suspects that we pick up for take out, we headed down to the college town affectionately known as "Tempe" and whipped out the handy dandy Yelp App.  Up jumps "Cornish Pasty Company" at the top of the list.  Eventually we found it tucked into the back of a strip mall (weirdly unexpected location...but sooooo glad we didn't turn away).  Down to brass tacks:The menu has a bunch of stuff on it, yummy-sounding stuff, inexpensive stuff...After a brief conference with our server (and a couple of car bombs to lubricate our speaking skills) we decided to split The Oggie and The Peppered Steak.  The Oggie was the favorite because once you added that red wine gravy to it, the flavors just kinda...pop. The Peppered Steak, by default, was the 2nd favorite, but was also very yummy. I just wish that the peppercorn brandy cream sauce that came with it wasn't cold. Some people really like that, I guess, but I'm a warm-to-room-temperature-or-hotter saucy kinda chick. Next time, I look forward to tackling their delicious sounding dessert menu (they have creme anglaise!!!). I REALLY look forward to going back (soon) to try more pasties!Second visit, just as good as the first:Mushroom, Walnut, Spinach Soup with Homemade Bread and ButterCheese Steak - Onions, Green Pepper, Mushroom, Swiss, Red Wine GravyChicken Pot Pie - Carrots, Red Potato, Green Beans, Celery, Thyme and Chicken GravyThe Pilgrim - Turkey, Sweet Potatoes, Grilled Onion, Stuffing, Cranberry SauceBanoffee Pie - Graham Cracker Crust, Caramel, Whipped Cream, BananasApple Caramel Pasty - Apples, Cinnamon, Caramel topped with Ice Cream and Whipped CreamMoving from sweet to savory (and then back to sweet) our arrival at Cornish Pasty Company was met with a raucous crowd enjoying any number of craft brews but seated swiftly as Led Zeppelin, The Who, and The Ramones competed for air time overhead we were greeted equally quickly by an excellent (and funny without being fakey) young server who understood our time constraints in terms of making it to the game and took our whole order at once noting that she'd place the order in a staggered manner to make sure food wouldn't pile up while still leaving us time to make it to ASU by kickoff - a plan that worked flawlessly.Knowing from my last visit that the pasties would all be excellent - and they were - what truly wowed during this visit to Cornish Pasty Co was actually the soup, a recommendation from our server as "her favorite thing on the menu" - a dense, creamless potage with a hefty mushroom nose and a subtle vegetal note on the tongue while the walnut base added a lingering smoothness that went well with the hearty housemade soda bread and cultured butter.  Obviously not leaving without dessert and having already enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding and bread pudding on my prior visit this time we opted for the house-special Banoffee Pie and Caramel Apple Pasty, neither as good as the pair off puddings but both better than the vast majority of in-house pastries at restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale (where even top tier restaurants choose to outsource their desserts to Ms. Dempsey.)Holy shit is this place awesome. Great unique foods, which are essentially hand held pot pies, wonderful beer selection, and desserts that will knock your socks off. This is truly a unique gem. One thing that shines brightest is the warm, friendly service. It'd be easy to look at the staff and assume you'll be getting shat upon by a hipster tattooed crew, but in reality- they really care about service, and have pride in what they do.Pro Tip- have the banana dessert, it is insanely good.Eek!  This was a second time in just a few weeks I've had a "Meh, I've had much better experience!"  What has happened to Cornish Pasty???  So I felt compelled to write a review about my experiences so that others would know this Cornish Pasty is in need of some management/owner love/help or something.... Service~ yikes! It was turrible, to quote Charles Barkley.  Both visits were the same experience but with different servers.  The servers here seem more interested in talking with each other rather than serving their customers.  On both visits we had to remind our server multiple times to refill our drinks and bring us condiments.  Probably the biggest disappointment is when we complained about our food.  They both were very disinterested in turning our poor dining experience into a positive one.  When we asked to speak to someone in charge in our 2nd turrible visit the waitress disappeared!  I kid you not!  She never came back and when we asked the bartender about her she stated that she went on a break....Food~ prior visits we've had a pretty good experience trying the different pasty's however lately their food has not been up to par!  The pasty's are very dry lately for some reason and they lack flavor.  This last visit we had the bangers and mash, chicken and the traditional beef and potatoes.  We also had a couple of side of fries and some salads.  The salads and fries were the best parts of our dining experience again unfortunately.  The banger and mash was ok.  It had a good balance of bangers to mash but had too much onions.  Since when did onions become a major star in this pasty?  The chicken pasty was not filled completely and was very dry.  The waitress suggested the red wine sauce to help?? WTH?  NO THE RED WINE SAUCE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH ALL PASTY'S, ESPECIALLY THEIR CHICKEN PASTY! It was gross!  We asked for a different sauce.   The waitress stated that was their only sauce but she could bring us ketchup and that's what a lot of people use.  Yes she did say that! If a lot of people are requesting ketchup, the cook, heck the owner needs to know their customers are having to douse their pasty's in ketchup because they are too dry.  The beef and potato pasty was more potato than beef and yes it was arid dry as the desert....So for both visits I give this Cornish Pasty 2 stars because of their salad and fries.  For had we not order those this would easily be a 1 star review. I hope they can turn this place around soon!I'm sure I agree with just about everyone else's raves about this place, so here's my own spin on the place:I love love love that I never knew puff pastry could be so versatile and delicious.Lovely bit o salmon is just that! The veggies inside are perfect! And the sauce mmmm!The Royale is named so appropriately!! If you like burgers, you will Love it!! Service is good, always someone spunky and friendly.But my main reason it's awesome???I reheated my Lovely Bit o Salmon in the microwave 2 days later, and it was still astoundingly fresh tasting but perhaps even more flavorful?!  That might just be a culinary miracle. I recommend this place to anyone, visiting, living here, young, old, meat lovers and not.Finally had the chance to stop in here for lunch and was not disappointed. Arrived right when they opened and was the first one to get served. Sweet!This location is definitely set up with the college kids in mind. Inside is very dark with black painted ceiling tiles and walls. Looks like the basement of a really old bar or maybe even a coal mine. Great place to gather up with the crew and down a few pints and then chow down on some tasty grub.Their west side entrance has a long sit down bar with a few small tables and is rather cramped. The east side entrance has more of a full seating area with additional bar seating. Recommend using the east side one unless you are going undercover and need a quick escape.Started with a cup of Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton soup. It came with bread and butter and was very good. Ordered the Peppered Steak Pasty which is filled with Sirloin Steak, sautéed Portobello Mushrooms, Leeks, roasted Zucchini, and Stilton Bleu Cheese. It also came with a side of yummy Peppercorn Brandy Cream sauce.Everything was very satisfying. There are so many different versions of what they can make. Lamb, Chicken, Pork, Beef, and Veggie are just some of the fillings. I suppose you could make a check list and try them all. Hmmm?Don't forget some Dessert if you still have room. Can't wait to explore more of their delicious menu. Would probably go to the new Scottsdale location or the Mesa one on my next visit. Same great food with more lighting and better suited for a blind old fogey like me. PARTY ON TEMPE!3.75 STARSThe food at Cornish Pasty is unique, freshly made, and delicious! For the vegetarians, I highly recommend The Greek ($8.50) and the Balsalmic Portobello ($9) - both are flaky, delicious and oh so flavorful! My mates enjoy the more traditional meat and gravy pasties and rave about The Oggie (steak + potatoes) and The Royale with Cheese so there's something for everyone and you really can't go wrong!ServiceVery attentive and friendly. Relaxed yet polite servers. The waiter kept a close eye on our beverages and offered refills on our water. I'm always concerned going with a large group to dinner about the check because rarely do I carry extra cash and some restaurants make a fuss about splitting checks. Thankfully, splitting checks isn't an issue at Cornish Pasty. Our server happily complied with our request without batting an eye. The service was excellent so we were fine leaving a little extra gratuity since it made splitting the bill easier. Our waiter was jubilant over the slightly more than 20% gratuity, which just underscores that this is not one of those fancy, pretentious restaurants that expects a generous tip. Physical spaceBeware: The restaurant is NOT visible from street when driving down University. When I finally found the restaurant around the corner and walked up, the windows were black and it appeared as if it was closed. Fret not - it IS in fact open! Apparently the restaurant also recently expanded and friends who had visited the restaurant previously were impressed with the remodel. The bathroom was the one place that suggested more of a pub and college feel. On the bathroom walls I found strange graffiti art. Some inscriptions may have been written by Lady Gaga during her carnivorous costume days or a confused co-ed (e.g., "I am meat"). In any event, once you find the hidden restaurant delicious pasties and friendly service are just a few steps away!Quite frankly, my little sister doesn't understand why I write reviews on Yelp and it annoys her when I take pictures of food, but she has demanded that I give this place 5 stars and exclaimed, "Look at the craftsmanship (of the pastry)...this is actually worth a photo!" Sooo, yeah Cornish Pastry Co is a 4.5 in my book, easily rounded up to a 5.While I would probably never find and/or try this restaurant on my own, I was highly intrigued by the excellent ratings and sheer number of reviews, so my sister and I dropped in just after 11:00 for lunch. I think we made the rookie mistake of entering through the dark, candle-lit kitchen side (with tables along the wall) rather than the far door with the actual dining room, but sitting on either is fine. They even have a patio!The staff was great, answering any questions we had about the menu and service was well-paced. Now...the FOOD! As a (mostly) vegetarian, I was pretty blown away by the options - I have to eat a lot of veggie burgers elsewhere - but this place has a whole vegan/vegetarian page of items, some of which include veggie chicken and beef. Forget what anyone else has said...nothing could be better than the Eggplant Parmesan pastie! ;) My sister also loved her Lamb and Mint pastie, saying it was "effing delicious" and that the mint was not overpowering. The pastry is not doughy like pizza crust, but rather flaky and crispy like a biscuit. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, as they were fresh and still a little crunchy. Literally my only complaint about this place is that my meal was so good I kept trying to bite into it while it was still hot, burning my mouth multiple times. I look forward to coming back the next time I'm visiting my sis in Tempe, as I know she's about to jump on the Cornish Pastry Co regular train! She already has the "Pilgrim" pastie picked out as her next one to try and at about $9/meal, I bet she'll have worked through most of the menu by the time I see her again.Definitely put this on your "must see" list of places to eat (for lunch)!Having only been here are few times I can tell you that when I find myself in Tempe this is the first place that pops into mind when someone asks, "Where do you want to go eat?" With as many reviews as this place, it appears to cover various aspects.  What I will further drive in is the fact that this is quality scratch food.  Be patient this is not some Hot Pocket fresh out of the microwave. It is real food.  Pasties are not the only thing on the menu.  They have a great selection of salads and soups.  Vegan, veg whatever...they got you covered....With 1,079 reviews (and counting) and a 4.5 star rating, I'm not sure what else can be said about the Cornish Pasty Company. The food is always delicious, almost any beer you could want is a flowin', service is excellent and the atmosphere is on point. Back in March one of my childhood buddies was visiting from Boston, and we hosted a Homecoming/Reunion party for him here. I have to hand it to the staff for how well they handled our wild, crazy, LOUD group of 15+. Our drinks were never empty and I can't recall any hiccups on anyone's orders. Also, on this visit, I finally shared some Banoffee Pie with Greg G.Ho Lee Fook AMAZING. Why did I wait so long to try it?! Graham cracker, caramel coated crust with pillowy whipped cream and banana slices. If Greg and I hadn't known each other for almost 20 years, I may have fought him to the death for the whole thing!Any place I can get out for well under $30 after a filling entree (Lamb Vindaloo Pasty is my fave!) + two pints of Raj IPA is a winner in my book.Don't ever change, CPC!YUMMY PASTIES, and no i'm not referring to the ones you're used to. Pasties here are thin flaky pastries filled with many savory options from american to indian influenced one pasty is perfect as a meal & the crust is what makes them so good---oggie: the beef wasn't the best but the potatoes were flavorful! i liked the red wine gravy that comes as a dipping sauce!i can't wait to come back & try other optionsNOTE: in terms of atmosphere don't expect to walk into grandmas house because they serve up pasties, think dark dive bar (which was perfect as a low key lunch after our crazy night)I have been hearing great things about this place.  I had to try of course.  L and I had our god-daughters for the day.  So we try to take them to different place to try out.  We found great parking and walked in.  It is seat yourself, but most of the empty tables were dirty.  So we sat at a dirty one waiting for them to clean up.  The staff came pretty quickly to clean off the table and gave us menus.  I ordered the chicken pot pie pasty and a side of roasted potatoes.   The chicken pot pie was very good, but the potatoes were slight under cooked.  The service was pretty good.
Feast Buffet=I noticed after this visit just how much the price has changed when it comes to a brunch buffet. Generally brunch costs more than breakfast, lunch or dinner, but not here at the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station. Brunch on Sunday runs around $9.99 (same price for dinner during the week) with a players card. After being seated I noticed how dirty the highchair was that my nephew was in. I'm talking all sorts of food on either side of it. I cleaned it up with some wipes his mom had with her, but this highchair looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. Our server was great and checked on us often. Even with the big group we had at our table she kept the dishes cleared and brought us refills without us ever having to ask. They brunch buffet has the usual stuff. Different breakfast and lunch option at the same time. I walked by the pizza as it was coming out so I figured that was a good time to get some of that. It tasted OK, but definitely tasted like a frozen pizza that was made. They do have a pizza oven right there and you can watch it cook, but it wasn't anything I'd ever go out of my way for. The bacon was hard and tasted microwaved. Scrambled eggs weren't bad or the mini waffle I had. The hash browns were a soggy mess with some burnt crispy parts. I did enjoy the mac & cheese even if it tasted like Kraft deluxe. The breakfast sausage looked good, but tasted nasty. I brought back an assortment of desserts for our table to try and they were terrible! All of the pastries were hard which was a disappointment. I will say that the salad bar had a lot of options including fresh fruit and it all looked good. I enjoyed what I had from the salad bar area much more than anywhere else at the buffet. This buffet could use many changes and isn't really worth it until then in my opinion. Kids 2 and under are free.Didn't like this buffet. The tables and chairs were filthy and the food all seemed like frozen food that was microwaved. I even had a BOGO coupon and still didn't find the buffet here worth it. What happened the Stations buffets used to be better than this?! I remember a larger selection of desserts in the past compared to the mostly sugar free desserts they had during my visit. The prime rib even lacked flavor. Just not worth it for me.I'm pretty sure all the Station Casinos' buffets are called "Feast Buffet." This Feast Buffet is located inside Sunset Station in Henderson. My son and I came here for dinner last week and it was a better atmosphere, better service, better food selection, better quality of food, and a better looking clientele as compared to Boulder/Texas/Palace Stations; but certainly does not compare in the least to Red Rock Resort nor Green Valley Ranch, which are both upscale resorts operated by Station Casinos.As typical at Feast Buffets, they offer Pepsi products served to your table. From there, each dining patrons is on their own to serve themselves walking back n forth to the food areas. Many ethnic varieties of food to choose from, most of which were fried aka not on the healthy side. (e.g., American, Carving Station, Salad Bar, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, and Dessert Bar.) The selection and quality of the foods offered were very basic and very average, but certainly much better than what i've experienced at Feast Buffets of Boulder Station, Palace Station and at Texas Station.The interior of this restaurant was well lit, very clean, and with modern decor. The staff were all very friendly...from the cashier, the hostess, our food server, and each of the employees working at the food selection areas.For $10 dinner, it was a good deal considering the variety of foods/drinks, and the AYCE-All You Can Eat dining concept. We will be back again when in the area, hungry on a budget.YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #259I still haven't changed my mind much from the last time I was here but they have changed a few things. You can now add a steak for $5 or 1 lb of crab legs for $6 to your $6.99 buffet. It's the standard Vegas buffet, pretty small with so few choices, they do have charbroiled hamburgers and sausages. But they got rid of the hand scooped ice cream & now have the machines which really sucks that was the highlight of this buffet. The prime rib was par roast part rubber. .The  chicken and tacos were good overall its not bad for $7, but still I usually only go when it's comped on my players card.The service is non-existent here-get your own drinks and they hardly come around to clear plates. However they did redeem themselves at the end with some good coffee.If you're looking to be wow'ed by a Las Vegas buffet, look elsewhere, toots.The Feast Buffet located in the Palace Station Hotel & Casino is very affordable for those looking not to spend a lot of money for an AYCE.  Here's my 2 cents on my mealtimes, in chronological order-Lunch - A step-down from your local Hometown Buffet.  There is a grill where diners can ask for slices of roast beef/turkey, burgers, hot dogs & brats.  Located next to it, is a pasta station where pasta is made to order with whatever choice ingredients the diner desires.  The rest of the hot/cold foods were decent, but nothing extraordinary.  The dessert section was nice w/ various cakes, cookies, sweets and the obligatory nonfat froyo machines.  Overall, meh.Dinner - See lunch, but w/ a few extra items scattered hither & thither.  Not worth the extra cost, IMHO.Breakfast -  Now we're talking!  Several egg dishes, mounds of bacon, biscuits & gravy, country fried steak etc.  There is also an omelette station where diners can have an omelette their way.  The dessert section had most of the same items from lunch/dinner, plus various doughnuts and other items.  The Feast Buffet is an affordable, no-frills buffet.  I recommend breakfast over lunch & dinner for those interested in checking this buffet out.  I had free buffet vouchers, but if I had to pay, I would stick to breakfast.Excelsior!We were staying in this hotel and didn't feel like getting into the car and driving around looking for a place to eat so we decided to check out the on-site buffet for dinner. Get a boarding pass- which is the Palace Station players card. You get a discount at the buffet and end up paying the child's price. You cannot beat the price of this buffet. Even McDonald's for my family of 5 is more expensive than what I paid for the buffet for 5 people.I didn't really explore the rest of the buffet too much as it's pretty small and the selection and quality are lacking. They even have a carving station which I usually dive right into but the meat lacked flavor and was incredibly dry. The real star of the buffet, and the only reason why I would return is because of the made  to order pasta station. Now that was delicious and I returned again, and again, and again. There aren't even that many choices and I kept ordering the same thing over and over but the pasta was pretty good, considering one plate of pasta at the Olive Garden costs more than this entire buffet. I was craving pasta so this was definitely worth it and hit the spot. You get your choice of pasta noodles and sauce. Toppings include shrimp, clams, and vegetables/spices such as tomato, oregano, garlic, onions, etc. The small asian man is grumpy and rude and will make you go back to the end of the line if you want to order two dishes. He made my son and I go to the end of the line each time but some old white guy was able to get multiple dishes cooking because he had tipped him. No fair but that's Vegas I guess.I had come to expect good quality from this place but this time around found it very disappointing.The price was right-2 comped buffets. The service was great, quick to take the plates on top of the drink refills and extra napkins.The salad & soup bar was great. Bleu Cheese Chunks for the salad and great chicken noodle soup with tender white meat chicken.They have lots of sushi, fried sushi, wontons,potstickers,dim sum and lots of aian cuisine.Most of it is very weak with little pop to it.The beef brisket was tender & juicy  and had a nice smoky flavor. The Roast Beef was a little uhhh..No seasoning on the meats.The cornish game hens were super juicy and very good.The fried chicken however was tough and dried out.Most of the side dishes like mac n cheese, beans,potato salad, coleslaw, and collard greens were just bland its like its all the same food with no fllavor.The pizza was doughy and the vegtables and meats were not cooked. The whole Italian section of ravioli,rotini and spaghetti is all pretty weak. Dinner they usually do made to order pasta with shrimp etc.The desserts were pretty dry & crusty with a very limited selection.Real diappointing.There's lots of other things available but I did not try tham because they didn't even look appealing. I see there is quite a varied opinion on this place and I would say 6 months ago the food was 4x better now it just seems like all the same quality as other station bufffets, one of which I tried just yesterday at the Palace Station. Same tasting food. Red Rock had better presentation plus a little more selection.For my money I'm sticking to the Palms-filet mignon & crab legsRed Rock Feast buffet is pretty darn good! I am always satisfied with the fresh selection of buffet items. They have the basics, the classics and build your own creation stations such as tacos, omelets, and pasta. Fresh sliced meat options, turkey, roast beef, prime rib and ham. They also have shrimp cocktail, simple sushi, salad bar, soups, breads, pizza, enchiladas, fish & chips just to name a few. Desserts are incredible, cakes, pies, gelato, soft serve, cookies, macaroons, etc. Drinks anything you could imagine from chocolate milk, lemonade, coffee, iced tea, and sodas. The lay out is comfortable, spacious with both booths and table seating. The service is always fantastic, the servers always keeping our drinks filled. Great food, wonderful service and fantastic deals with a players card for comped or two for one deals. I have done this buffet many times and will continue to do it every time I am in the mood to be satisfied.In the sea of buffets at Vegas, Feast Buffet @redrockcasino has go to be on top of the list of great deal buffets. The prices at this buffet are very reasonable and you get your money's worth.Breakfast:Monday - Saturday 8:00am - 10:45am $4.99 w/boarding pass card, $7.99 without boarding pass card Lunch:Monday - Saturday11:00am - 3:00pm $7.99 w/boarding pass card, $10.99 without boarding pass card Dinner:Daily4pm - 9pm $13.99 w/boarding pass card,  $18.99 without boarding pass card Sunday Brunch8am - 2pm $13.99  w/boarding pass card,  $18.99 without boarding pass card I highly suggest getting a boarding pass card because you will save some $$ at the buffet. It's pretty easy to get one. All you have to do is sign up at the front of the casino and you ta da - boarding pass! :)There is a lot of selection at this buffet. It's international with different stations dedicated to foods from around the world. They have Japanese (sushi), Mexican (fajitas, quesadillas), Chinese (orange chicken, bao, fried rice), American (mini hamburgers, mac and cheese) and Italian (pizza, pasta). They also have an awesome dessert area (pies, cupcakes, cookies, cannolis, brownies) and a gelato bar! There is so much food, I just can't list it all!I've been here for Sunday Brunch and lunch and they actually have pretty much the same offerings. Sunday Brunch just has champagne, mimosas, an omelet bar and breakfast goodies like eggs, bacon, sausage, corn beef hash and breakfast sweets like donuts, muffins and croissants.  I tried out the omelet bar when I was here. I got a vegetarian omelet and it was great! It had a good share of different veggies and nicely made. The gelato bar here is my favorite! Some of the flavors they had were: mint, vanilla, raspberry, caramel, strawberry and spumoni! The spumoni and caramel were excellent. Sweet and creamy, it's the perfect dessert at lunch or dinner or even breakfast brunch (hehe). Gelato and Vegas, how can you go wrong?Lots and lots of selection with decent prices! Don't forget to get your boarding pass for even more savings! :)There are certainly a lot of people who think that Red Rock is one of the best local casinos in town and I will admit that it had a lot going for it. That is, it HAD a lot going for it. Over the past two years I have watched as this once great Red Rock has slowly soured into a joke that is not at all funny. There seems to be no aspect of this casino that has not deteriorated in quality, with the rare exception of the Yard House (which is not associated with the casino).But let's keep the focus of this review to the Feast Buffet. I have eaten at the Feast Buffet on a very regular basis for several years, although it had been a few months since I was last there. With some friends in town, it was a good option for a good budget meal, so we went this past Sunday.First of all, I am supposed to be a VIP of the Station Casinos, with a Presidential status that was earned almost completely at the Red Rock. The President status is supposed to get me a 50% discount on the buffet, but it only amounted to about 25%. So the Sunday night buffet is $19 per person ($15 after my VIP discount). One would think at those prices, we were about to be pampered with some great food choices. Boy were we wrong - very wrong.Let's just sum this all up with a reference that I think we can all relate to - the food quality and choice was what one would expect to find at Sizzler (but of course, at twice the price). There were less options to choose from than there used to be and what was there was crap, just pure crap. No prime rib, shrimp or crab legs, something they were calling sushi (ha!) and a plentiful collection of some of the cheapest menu items a buffet can offer. It reminded us of a cattle feed lot, troughs of a food like substance that all tastes the same.Crap - pure crap!$20 lunch for two with drinks and dessert? While the food is standard fare comparable to a good ole Chinese buffet, the dessert is quite good. A lot of "NSA" options. As if you'd be worrying about sugar when you eat at a buffet. They have different ice cream flavors, gelato, AND soft serve with a topping bar of course! You can even make an ice cream cookie sandwich if you so desire. The pastry section offers different kinds of pie and again, with sugar-free options.$3 specialty drinks if you want some adult bevies.Excellent service, it's like they're secretly watching you eat and clear your plate as soon as you eat your last bite and refill your drinks right away. Sign up for a boarding pass card for $3 off :)I've been to this particular buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner over the past year, and feel it's a solid three stars. The selection is pretty good but dinner has been underwhelming- lunch is your best option.Breakfast: Typical breakfast buffet selection. On weekends you may luck out and find shrimp and grits, which is done excellently here. Other than that, it's just fine. Nothing in particular stands out.Lunch: Best time to go, selection is large and you'll have most of the dinner options. Start with massive salad bar, end with a smorgasbord of desserts including a gelato bar. The Mexican food options are surprisingly solid.Dinner: Underwhelming. Little to differentiate it from lunch options. Seafood selection (my favorite) is limited, sushi quality is comparable to a grocery store, shrimp are small and not very clean. Service is consistently good, and you can find locals discounts pretty easily. Always surprised by how busy this place is.3.5 stars-My favorite Feast Buffet:    The Red Rock Feast Buffet is my favorite Station Casinos Buffet. It has consistently been very good without achieving the level of outstanding. Today, when I made it my post - hike supper; it was one more positive experience.    Station Casinos might be genuine when they advertise they love locals. They sent this local a booklet with a half - off cupoun for any Feast buffet. I planned ahead to Saturday nights when Station doubles their price for the gimmicky prime rib & shrimp night. Station Casino's love for locals reduced a $17.99 dinner to less than $10. Lol, I would regain all the calories that I lost from hiking the Red Rock hills bordering Blue Diamond.   From experience, I recommend arriving to the Feast Buffet before 5:00 pm. After, the long lines seem to appear. When I arrived, the line was short. However, it seemed to move like molasses.     This Feast Buffet represents a wide assortment of food in food stations featuring sushi, Mexican, barbecue, International, Asian, American, Italian, pastries, and salad bar. If I am not mistaken, this is the only Feast Buffet to feature sushi (I have to check GVR again ). Each station offers a nice variety of food. Some examples:Asian: Asian ribs, fried rice, Singapore noodles, wonton soup, orega chicken, stir fry, lo mein, spicy tufu, Spring rolls, etc.Sushi: peal & eat shrimp, assorted sushi, ginger, & mussel salad.American: Live cooking station of prime rib, chicken, and turkey. Plus meatloaf, cabbage, mash potatoes, fried chicken, etc.Italian: pizza, meatballs, sausage, chicken pesto, etc.Pastries: full service ice cream. Plus cheesecake, German chocolate cake, cream puffs, raspberry poulade, cookies, sugar free desserts, etc.   In recent times my buffet station of choice is Asian foods. However, when sushi is offered it is my station of choice. I filled up on assorted sushi which appeared to be varieties of California rolls. My complaint is that they don't name many of the items. It was good at the same time that it wasn't close to the excellence of Yummy Sushi. Sushi and Asian foods represented my plates. I filled up on stir fry, wonton soup, and this no name soup that is below in a picture. The wonton soup was good, and I appreciated that they never ran out like they do at Sunset Station; yet it fell short of the great wonton soup that Cravings and Carnival World Buffet have served me. To conclude my meal, I drank coffee with raspberry poulade.   This very Feast Buffet is my favorite of them. The deal is that this meal is usually $20 after tax. They use the prime rib & shrimp gimmick to increase the price on a night that many people go out to eat. From experience nearly every buffet includes prime rib. When I think shrimp night, my mind has visions of broiled shrimp, stuffed shrimp, shrimp cocktails, shrimp scampi, and pealed shrimp. The only shrimp I laid eyes on here was the peal & eat shrimp. This is ordinary buffet food that I recently had during lunch in the Gold Coast Buffet. The upshot is that this gimmick is prevents me from rating it 4 stars. In conclusion, this is my favorite Feast Buffet.Rarely do you find the combination of good value combined with good quality, but this buffet does it with amazingly great prices, (for Vegas that is) and a real decent selection of quality food. The line can be long at times I hear, but was not bad when we went at 7:30 on a Saturday for breakfast. They opened at 8am. We got there early so we got more to the front of the line. Get a players card and be local and the prices really comes down for all the buffet options. We paid only $7.50 each for breakfast. I like the whole scene as it was not as hurry up and get in line like the places on the strip. Food quality was better than expected for the price ... so no, this will not stack up to a $40.00 buffet, but remember you are paying less than $10.00 here, but well worth the price. Better than most of the other Station Casinos in town as well.This was gonna be our last meal in Vegas before we head back to Reno/Carson City area and the only buffet we tried while here in Vegas. I've been to many a buffet, so doing buffets is not a big deal, but I wanted to see what the Red Rock had going. It's nice to be away from the main strip casino area.The food selection is all you normal breakfast stuff. All the bacon you can eat! The quality was actually pretty decent for a buffet, and for the price of $7.50 ..... I'd spend more than that at Denny's! and this is waaaay better! Service was fine, plates were cleared and our coffees and OJs refilled just fine. This place really got packed, and I can see why, the prices and the quality and mostly locals as the Red Rock is away from the main tourist areas. OK, off to the nearby Costco to get gas and we're outta here. I'm glad I came here and got in line early!
Pyramid Cafe=This is what I get for being lazy.  I know there are plenty of good places to eat after hours in Las Vegas, but I decided to dine here after watching Carrot Top's show simply because I was too lazy to go find something better.  The 24 hour Pyramid Café located on the casino floor of the Luxor was quite the popular spot when I was there as there was a constant line of patrons waiting to be seated.I liken the restaurant to a Denny's based on its menu.  They serve items such as all-day breakfasts, salads, burgers and sandwiches and a few main dishes.  The prices are very reasonable.  The staff is all pretty friendly even though I noticed quite a few of the buspersons lagging in their step and just standing around and doing nothing while there were multiple tables to be cleaned off and countless patrons waiting for a spot to sit down.After a ten minute wait I was seated.  I'm not complaining, but they sat me (dining solo) in a table for four while tables for two were available forcing groups of three or four to continue to wait for a table.  The whole seating arrangement just seemed way out of whack.  I got a nice waitress though who constantly smiled and checked up on me multiple times.I ordered the New York Steak dinner and asked that it be cooked medium.  The dinner is served with fresh seasonal vegetables which turned out to be steamed carrots and broccoli and a choice of potato.  I chose mashed potatoes and made the mistake of saying yes to gravy.  The wait for the food was about as prolonged as the seating process.  In the meantime I was brought a basket with two warm garlic rolls and four pats of butter served cold and hard.  The bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=Ji_LeplLxwpK_0wCAN9n6g) was flavorful, but it was not fresh as the center was kind of firm instead of being soft.My steak dinner (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=xVshpLhrKF23IUVFmNqt2g) didn't fare any better.  The meat was unevenly cooked as half of the steak was served medium-well and the other half was well-done.  I hate well-done steaks!  I wouldn't have minded had the entire steak was medium-well since that part remained tender and juicy.  Trying to cut into the well-done meat with only a semi-sharp steak knife proved to be a task as the entire table shook.  The huge serving of mashed potatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=bOshUN8Fs5iGod0KBTGG1Q) might have been okay had it not been drowned in the super salty brown gravy.  The best part of my meal ended up being the steamed broccoli.Pyramid Café, no thanks!  Next time I won't be so lazy!I can only assume that the awfulness and douchebaggery of the Chris Angel show is rubbing off on this place. Like an airborne virus or something. Awfulness: a fifteen dollar burger that just wasn't tasty. I thought that bacon, onions, cheddar, and BBQ sauce would automatically make this thing great. Not so. The fries were mushy. The pickle was good though. The partner in crime liked her panini, but since she's not writing this, her opinion doesn't count. Douchebaggery: Walk in and tell the hostess we want a to go order. She says that's what the servers are for and to grab a seat. Whatevs. 15 mins later, our order gets taken. Another 15 mins later and we have our food. Thank god for those big, stupid plastic drink thingies to keep me company. 30 minutes and $35 later, I am totally underwhelmed. Disclaimer: I did not see the Chris Angel show, however, when it ran on TLC it was full of awfulness and douchebaggery, so I just assumed.
Mardi Gras Bar and Grill=Not a big fan... the bar is fairly large with several rooms, though all are pretty dumpy (not so much in the old school "good-dive" kinda way). The crowd is somewhat interesting. Drinks are pretty strong, but smallish. Prices are fair. No smoking patio here - go outside the front door and wave at cars on McDowell while you puff.I have yet to dine here.I did see a band play here recently, and that was pretty decent. Without a band - no thanks...
Phoenicia=08/13/07 UPDATE:They have the best, most crisp, french fries around.  And you can now watch music videos on their big plasma screen, from the Arabia channel.===========================================Opa!  I'm speaking Greek, right?I write this review as a Caucasian male whose only familiarity with Mediterranean cuisine was when I ingested a leaf while eating grapes.  Turns out the leaf ended up being from a tomato vine.  I'm still wondering how that wilted foliage found its way into my cluster of concords.Back to Phoenicia.  My first time there, I orderd the safest thing I could find... gyro and fries.  Roasted lamb and cucumber yogurt sauce.  It was like my mouth was having a party, and everyone was invited.  But wait, it gets better.I see they have babaganoosh, and momentarily, I flash back to the Wedding Crashers movie.  Great, now I have to order it... and I'm glad I did.  Its just eggplant, people.On subsequent visits, I ordered the chicken shawarma and kabobs, cilantro jalapeo hummus, tatziki.  Fantastic.  There is also a great place in Tempe called Haji-Baba.Phoenicia also has a huge mural on the wall, of a Greek coastal setting, which you can stare at while you fill up.  For some reason, I keep reminding myself to wait an hour before going into the water.This place is a real treat.  And their treats (desserts) and great too.  I'll take the pistachio baklava.-SwoopI like it.  The food was mostly very good, the service was good in a hurried sort of way and the prices are reasonable.We ate on a weekday evening and the place was bustling.In the valley of the sun, Z's Greek at 40th and Indian School continues to be the standard bearer for this sort of cuisine and Phoenicia does not measure up, but they are solid enough that I would return.I would add something clever and Greek or Middle Eastern here but I've got nothing right now so you're out of luck.If you like, send me a compliment with something good and I will add it to the review and credit you...Oh wow...this place is really good!  I've been a couple of times now and I could go on and on (you know I could), but really, it's excellent almost all the way around. I've tried a few different things on the menu by this point, as you can see by my pictures, and everything has been delicious.  Their tabouli has to be some of the freshest I've ever had, and the meats are full of flavor.  The only reasons they don't get 5 stars are because the service is a little shaky at times, and the one time I got the chicken kabob, it was a pretty skimpy portion.  Other than that, I would go back any time.  They also have a Yelp check-in offer of 50% off your second entree, which is a great deal.  Their prices are reasonable anyway, even without a discount.
Trader Vic's=An empty restaurant is never a good sign so perhaps Gabi K, Jared M, and I should have found dinner elsewhere, but we decided to give Trader Vic's a chance. Our meal started off on a good note...Attentive service, although then again we were the only people to really give attention to.  And we did enjoy the bread basket...although I could do without the bread with chunks of pineapple in it.Gabi and I decided to share 2 entrees- both highly recommended by the waiter. In fact, he said they were 2 of the most popular dishes on the menu. What you ask? Hold your horses yelpers...I'm getting there! Macadamia crusted mahi mahi and some lo mein like dish topped with halibut.  Jared was eating his 2nd dinner of the evening so he decided to keep it light and ordered the won ton soup. And it turned out he ordered right because the won ton soup was apparently better than anything else that came to the table.The mahi mahi and halibut (on top of the noodles) was beyond bland...it tasted like one of my flavorless weight watchers meals I make at home.  And it's really a problem when Trader Vic's cooks like the gal who burns pasta (yep, guilty of that last week). The mashed potatoes that came with the mahi mahi were decent, as were the noodles...but that was pretty much it.  Our bill came to $90- $90 too much!!We skipped the drinks after having our fair share of them at the hotel bar beforehand, but if I ever have to come back to Trader Vic's (which I don't plan on) I'll have to mask the bland taste of their food with lots of their specialty drinks.Not sure if we went on a really off night, but I was extremely disappointed with TV's.  As Andrea wrote below (damn her for writing her review before me), our bill came to $90 for dinner and it was $90 too much!The waiter (Tyler I think) said that their version of pad thai with halibut was his favorite dish on the menu... favorite dish?  really?  it was pretty bland - nothing special at all!  We also went with the macadamia crusted mahi mahi - not so much - pretty bland as well.  The steamed asparagus was fine but how can you really screw that up?  I had a spoonful or two of Jared's wonton soup - that was actually decent... but not enough to bring me back.Sorry, TV's - I won't be seeing you again anytime soon but good luck to you!I once went to a perhaps unsurprisingly now defunct Trader Vic's in Washington for happy hour and was impressed by neither the food nor the drinks - this is not that story.An almost empty restaurant (making our reservation comic relief) excluding the bustling bar area (slightly after the end of happy hour) on a holiday despite a well-decorated hall brimming with Tiki kitsch should have given us an indication, but since I was there for a family dinner with a picky family and this was already a compromise location, it was a bit late to change course(s), and among the goods for which we bartered were:- Cosmo Tidbits ($22): Enough fried and meaty flavors for three but nothing of note.- Lamb Curry (~$27): A flavorless cream of lamb soup that would have made Campbell's proud as a special? I have no idea what the chef was thinking with this.- Polynesian Snowball ($7): Coconut-encrusted vanilla with chocolate sauce done well.- Chocolate Macadamia Nut Torte ($8): Adequate, appropriately sweet, but forgettable.If I'd gone to Outback Steakhouse and paid commensurate prices, I would have been pleased with the results, and thus it might fare better for happy hour (despite a previous experience at another location) but for near Ruth's Chris costs I expect near flawless execution, especially on a special, the failure of which overshadowed the experience.I can't decide if Victor Bergeron (the real life Trader Vic) was any or all of the following:- A shrewd capitalist genius who traded pittances of mediocre food for large sums- A C team stock trader who went long on 25% odds based on our dining experiences- A victim of continued posthumous branding that has brought shame to his name- A one-hit wonderquack who never surpassed or fully channeled his Mai Tai "invention"However, I have decided that I am comfortable leaving this islander mystery unsolved.I had some visitors from corporate in town - one for our annual operations inspection, one to have a look at some of the tactical marketing we're developing in my region.  Anyway, they wanted to eat here so...Here we were at Traders Vics.  The atmosphere is nice, island themed opulence and texturally pleasing.  We were greeted very warmly and sat in the bar for cocktails and a snack before dinner.  The drinks were tasty.  The appetizer "tidbits for two" varied from good to uninteresting.We moved on to the dining room.  It was a Thursday night and the place was D ecidedly E mpty A nd D evoid (DEAD) of customers.  I tried one of the specials which was some sort of Thai inspired noodles with curry and some seafood and peanut and some mild pepper spiciness and...and...and...I frankly don't remember what it was supposed to be because it frankly wasn't anything.  Too many things going on, nothing made a big impression.  The other diners apparently chose better because 2/3 of them were happy with their dinner.  Wait, if there were 4 of us and I wasn't thrilled and only 2 of the other 3 diners were happy that means that 2 of the 4 or 50% of the diners were underwhelmed.  Now if Trader Vic's had been traveling north on a train at 75 mph and had 160 miles to travel...wait I think I just had a flashback to sixth grade math.  Ok, my bottom line impression of Trader Vic's - kind of cool atmosphere, interesting history (I think they were owned by Merv Griffin) and the food was average at a premium price.   Oh and the bathrooms were very nice.I went back on this trip for the happy hour. It's twice a night, every night, from 4 to 6 and 9 to 11. Appetizer specials are $1, $2, or $3, and a few drink specials are also available.Our group enjoyed relaxing on the lanai, sipping our drinks underneath the tiki torches, bamboo, and heat lamps. Amongst the six of us, we ordered the Maui burger, Chinese spareribs, popcorn shrimp, calamari, and chicken skewers. I thought my spareribs were excellent and meaty, but Vicky T. really won with her $3 Maui burger. Somehow our group passed on the frou-frou tropical drinks that Trader Vic's is famous for, but we were all content with our cocktails. Even the teetotalers were happy with their fruit concoctions. Sadly, I forgot to try a Drunken Geisha (next time, I promise to remember, Brian S.).We arrived shortly before happy hour ended, but our waitress was great at getting our order in on time. As we relaxed with the good food, good drinks, and good company, we joked about hanging out until happy hour started up again at 9. Next time, we surely will.
Pin Kaow Thai=Solid Thai food.  Quite so, I must say.I enjoyed an order of pad thai, hot and an order of sweet sticky rice with coconut milk.  I really enjoyed the pad thai, great blend of flavors in this Thai food standby.I liked the warm atmosphere and the service was very attentive.They pay attention to the presentation of the food as well as the taste and it was an overall enjoyable experience.I would go back.This was my first visit back to Pin Kaow in several years and I still can't say that they are a favorite of mine. The restaurant is very nice looking. Large, clean and nicely decorated. We came in around noon and there were two other parties seated already. The restaurant was eerily quiet, I wish there was louder music playing to offset the awkward silence. My mom and I almost felt like we needed to whisper, it was that quiet. We ordered a chicken fried rice and basil duck to share. The rice was tasty, but it's hard to screw up fried rice. The basil duck was pretty good as well. The sauce was good, but a little lacking in substance. The flavors are a lot more subtle than I would like. Overall, Pin Kaow is just an ok dining spot in the valley.If you're in the Southwest part of the valley as I seem to be more lately, Pin Kaow is a solid choice for Thai food.   There are three Pin Kaow locations; I've been to Pin Kaow 1 (Rainbow/Lake Mead) on my side of town several times, but it was my first time at Pin Kaow 2 (Rainbow/Robindale).  I'm happy to report that the quality of the food and the customer service are the same at both locations.  We came here for Sunday dinner around 6:30pm and were seated in a booth immediately.  I really like the Thai décor at these restaurants and the food and service were on point.  Girlfriend and I shared the following:Mango Salad ($8.95):  I always order this salad, which I prefer over papaya any day; light and refreshing, with enough of a kick for me to handle.  I'm trying to leave the zero spice level behind and grow up; I ordered it at spice level 3 and survived.Panang Curry with chicken ($9.95):  This has become my new favorite Thai dish, since I was schooled on panang recently.  I'm not a fan of curry in general, but there's coconut milk in panang and I am a fan of that.  I chose brown rice instead of white rice; if there was an upcharge for this, I don't know what it is because I forgot to check.Pad See Ew with shrimp ($9.95):  Another favorite noodle dish and a nice break from Pad Thai, which used to be the only thing I'd ever order.  The shrimp were plentiful and delicious.We were checked on frequently and our water glasses were never empty.  This experience was so good that the Thai food phase that I'm currently in is going to last a while longer.  I even forgot to take pictures because we were so ready to eat.  I'm looking forward to the next visit and hopefully we'll even have the sweet rice with mango dessert--after Lent.Brought a client here for lunch by her request. The restaurant is beautiful inside with traditional wood carvings and Thai art throughout. We were seated asap at a booth and I ordered Thai ice tea.Our waitress who was Thai seemed like she didn't want to be there since she was unfriendly and was just going thru the motions of servicing us. I went with the Thai red chicken curry. The entree came with a spring roll, soup and steam rice. The curry was actually tasty good and contained bamboo shoots and was spicy creamy. Our waitress brought the me the bill and I had to hit her up for offerings of dessert which happen to be only green tea ice cream. I ordered a serving and it was yummy but I only ate about half of it.If not for the mediocore service by our waitress I would definitely return here again but it would problably be on my own to test the waters again. What a shame how a negative attitude can turn what should have been a above average experience into a below average rating.3 1/2 stars. Second time visiting this location during lunch on a weekday. Heart the decor of the interior of this restaurant.  Started off with a refreshing solid glass of Thai ice tea. Instead of ordering a lunch special I went with the ala carte yellow curry which came with steamed rice.The sauce was spot on but the white chick meat  was on the tough side which was disappointing but the sauce and potatoes over the steam rice was yummy. Service was attentive from the entire staff this time around and friendly.I'll probably be back but would avoid the chicken curry and try another entrée.
The Pub at Monte Carlo=(short review alert!)During the Vegas trip the guys wanted to hit up a bar...  Being a Vegas veteran knowing that there really isn't any "stand along bars" available so decided to check it out.  (Most of the bars in Vegas are infused into the casinos as a Bar/Lounge style next to the slots)  The pub's got a cool logo of a whale with fire coming out of it's blowhole so I guess that was the draw of my attention.  (I enjoy these little things)Once we were here, we noticed that it was more of a restaurant than an actual bar.  The place was wide open with decent decor, dim lighting, and dark furniture around the facility.  Since we were looking for a bar and my friends were more disappointed because it wasn't an actual bar (and actually wasn't crowded at all), so we decided just to have quick bite to eat instead.Ordered chicken quesadilla with mango sauce, calamari with 2 sauces, and nachos...Quesadilla was great... I mean, how can you go wrong with tortilla, chicken, cheese, and sweetened sauce?  An easy and safe choice.  Calamari was fried to perfection with decent sauce accompanied with the dish.  Nachos were humongous in portion, but it was overly salty and the cheese looked fake... so the nachos wasn't a hit at all.We didn't get any drinks as we were really looking forward to a bar, so after the meal immediately we left the pub so that we can get some drinks in our system.  The entire meal (appetizers) cost us almost $40 so it's not a cheap meal by any means, but I guess you are paying just like the whale with the fire out of the blowhole....(is that why he is burning inside?)I may or may not come back to this place... some entertainment was happening on stage but it wasn't really grabbing anyone's attention so perhaps Monte Carlo have to rethink their strategy by having this place within their facility.  It's just another another mid-high priced restaurant with mediocre food...Now you see why this is such a short review...Locals get Happy Hour 24-hours a day!  $1 sliders, $1 wings, and 1/2 off Miller & Coors beer I think.  The best deal out of all of those are the $1 sliders, but they're just your basic mini burgers.The Pub has an extensive beer menu, both a mix of draft and bottle selections.  They also carry unique seasonal bottles (all over $15 per bottle from what I remember).  I need to come back here on a Sunday, since they advertise 1/2 off all beers; not sure if that's just for locals or for everybody.  If you area a Las Vegas local, in the Monte Carlo, looking for cheap nourishment, this may be your best bet.The wife and I stumbled in here, (literally), while drinking our, (my), way through the streets and bars of LV...Was feeling a bit parched so we stopped in here for a cool refreshing beverage, (or two, or four), and a bite to eat while simultaneously taking a break from our financial downfall. (Contrary to popular belief, I cannot live on beer and gambling alone).We both decided on the turkey / avocado clubs and sweet, (and I do mean sweet), potato fries. I started off with a 22 oz. Firestone Walker IPA, (draft of course), and while I've tried it before, it was exceptional... (Maybe it was the buzz???).Our club sandwiches came and they were uber tasty, especially when, (dumbass that I am), I put the marshmallow sauce intended for the fries on it by mistake!!! Seriously, I thought that shit was ranch dressing, but boy am I glad I'm "visionally impaired", lol.Which takes me to the sweet potato fries... Doused in a delectable sugar / cinnamon mix, these babies are friggin' good. Once you dip those little shits in the creamy marshmallow dipping sauce that accompanies them, you have effin' died and gone to heaven!!! Probably went thru a months worth of caloric intake at that bar but I really didn't give flyin' f*ck. I had died on gone to pub bar "food heaven". No need for that swanky a$$, gourmet chef, shit, just feed me beer, (or any other type liquor), and decent pub food and I'm a happy camper.Can hardly wait to try it again...just got to Vegas checked into the hotel and hit this place for lunch.I had the CALIENTE CHICKEN  $16.00Brioche Bun, Pepper Jack Cheese, Grilled Onions, Lettuce, Tomato and Chipotle Mayo.....bland-o-ramamy 2 customers had the CUBANO SANDWICH  12.00$Roasted Pork, Black Forest ham, Pickles, Yellow Mustard and Swiss Cheese they said it tasted like a poor boy more than Cuban cuisine.Basic beers nothing special great atmosphere wish the food tasted as good as it looked.
Va Bene Italian Restaurant - Martini & Wine Bar=We came here for happy hour one evening.. 4 stars? Of course we have to check it out..They have happy hour from 4-7. For food we ordered the Bruschetta, and the Melanzane Ripieni. The bruschetta was ok. It was just mainly tomatoes on it. I felt like a slice of cheese with it would've been perfect. It was no meat friday again so these items were perfect. The Melanzane was good. It's baked and filled with eggplant, cheese, zucchini, etc. I felt they could use some more items on their appetizer menu. It's mainly all seafood. Mussels, calamari, scallops etc. For the drinks... I was kind of shocked that they don't have a drink menu. They don't have a regular drink menu, wine menu, or anything. You basically tell them what you want and that's it. The first time, I ordered a Strawberry Martini while my friend got a Cosmo. Then we told our waitress, can you just have the bartender mix up a fruity martini. I'm not sure what was in it, but it was really good! The good news is their martinis are really good and they're a steal! $4! I would really recommend having a drink menu though, maybe throwing some specialty drinks on it along with a wine list and perhaps expanding the happy hour menu with the appetizers. I'd come back for a martini though for a price like that! =)
Corbin Bar & Grill=Had another great lunch at Corbin's today. Couldn't decide between the vegetarian cheese sandwich and the pulled pork... so I compromised: went with the cheese sandwich (sliced tomato, fresh asparagus, red bell pepper, cheddar, Swiss AND queso fresco grilled on sourdough) and fries to dip in a side of BBQ sauce. The asparagus was perfect -- still had a crunch! I sat at the bar, which was just a plain-ole cruel thing to do to myself in the middle of a work day. I swear the Pimm's was staring at me! (Look for me there at 5:03!)After 4 years of dining at Corbin's here are some of my favorites:Their quesadillas are open faced (kinda like a lavosh pizza). Huge, too. At least two people could share one. The Southwestern Pork one is out of this world!Best salad option: Club Salad - Field greens, grilled chicken, tasso ham (a hot-smoked Cajun specialty that's got a cayenne and garlic kick), crumbled blue, hard cooked egg, tomato & avocado. When I'm craving a burger I go for the Carolina Burger: apple-smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, red onion and that awesome house-made BBQ sauce!It's a tie on the chicken sandwiches: Buffalo Chicken Sandwich - GRILLED chicken breast, wing sauce, sautéed celery and blue cheese dressing or the New Orleans Club, a breast of chicken topped with Swiss, tasso ham, tomato, red onion and real mayonnaise. (I can't get enough of that ham!!) Truly, it's tough to go wrong at Corbin's. This place is at the top of my list!Stopped by the other evening with Chrissy P. and Andrew K. after hiking North Mountain, at this point we were ready for a refreshing beverage and something to eat. We chose to sit on the patio since it was such a pleasant evening. Turned out that on Monday's Corbin's special is happy hour menu and pricing is available all night! *Bonus* I sampled the Sesame Crusted Seared Tuna - tasty and delicious with a great combination of flavors and textures. I am looking forward to return visits to sample other menu items.It was a dark and windy Bike Week 09 type of night. After spending most of the evening at West World, surrounded by hot biker boys... I was hungry. I suggested hitting Corbin's for some food and drink. I had never been to Corbin's before and I'm glad we went in for a quick bite. When I opened the door to Corbin's I was hit by a semi-swanky vibe. I was certainly glad I wasn't all "Dirty Harleyed" out. I was more "Harley Hookered" out which, in my mind, is more swanky bar vibe acceptable. We were greeted warmly and seated at a table in full view of a family that was VERY interested in our presence (it could have been my super low cut shirt...hmmm...sorry about that...not really.). I even waved! I love my "adoring" fans who found themselves back to being busy with events at their own table. Anywho... back to the events at my table! After ordering a glass of wine (and being told they were out of my first choice..grr) I finally scored a nice glass of pinot noir. I also went with the grilled cheese sandwich. It wasn't just any ol' grilled cheese, my dear yelpers! This yummy sammie had cheddar, swiss and queso fresco cheese and it was all grilled with thick-cut bacon and a good hunk of tomato. I chose whole wheat for my bread. It was WONDERFUL. The home-cut fries were so good and they have yummy ranch to go along with it! My biker boy chose the Cajun Tasso ham quesadilla. Again... so yummy! The ham was nice and spicy but not HOT, just had some nice seasoning going on. The quesadilla is the size of a small, thin-crust pizza. So it can easily satisfy one person with leftovers to take with them. The whole meal was surprisingly VERY good! I only wish that Corbin's chairs were more comfortable to allow for some serious lounge time. I could imagine myself lounging after a great meal and just soaking in the swanky atmosphere. They have a nice bar area and also have hip music playing in the background. I look forward to another visit to Corbin's. I promise to not come dressed like a Harley Hooker next time... or not.... we'll see! Continue to surprise me, and I might surprise ya back Corbie!My husband and joined a group of Yelpers at Corbin's after the OYE last week.  I had never been there, and was excited to go somewhere new.  Unfortunately, after perhaps one too many at the event, I wasn't at my best for observation of the surroundings.I do know we had excellent service, however.  Although we began arriving after 9 pm (they close at 10), they were happy to push tables together and keep the kitchen open.  They were willing to do separate checks for our large group as well.As for the food, I was honestly so hungry, I didn't spend much time analyzing it.  Everything I tried was tasty though, and I would not hesitate to go back.  Disclaimer:  see first paragraph.
Ian's Pizza=Ian's Pizza for breakfast is now a thing and it's amazing.I love oatmeal and I love Ian's Pizza, but I never thought I'd be eating oatmeal at Ian's Pizza. Indeed, this is what went down this weekend as Ian's opened shop bright and early to introduce to the world their take on breakfast. With a steel-cut oatmeal and yogurt parfait bar, along with nine breakfast pizza options, late night destination Ian's Pizza crosses into new territory as a new destination for the early birds among us.Given Ian's Pizza's affinity for concocting wacky flavor combinations, the intrigue was high for what ingredient pairings would make up their nine breakfast pies. On the day of the breakfast launch, workers were spinning out Denver Omelets, Huevos Rancheros, and Chorizo or Roasted Vegetable Hash, all manifested onto a pizza. With such a loyal adherence to classic breakfast fare, a trip to Ian's in the morning will be just as tasty as or even better than the typical Saturday brunch. And Ian's hasn't forgotten the folks who crave an injection of something sugary for their morning fix. One slice of the sweet Apple Cobbler pizza later and you will forget your usual syrup soaked pancake or French toast needs. The Sweet Potato & Kale pie that I indulged in in my visit to this momentous occasion, left me already declaring Ian's breakfast my new Saturday morning ritual. From the trusty crispness of Ian's crust to the generous layer of cheese, and flavorful additions of sweet potato and seasoned kale, this was a smashing pie. While they're only serving breakfast on Saturdays from 7am-11am, I decided that yes, I will wake up for this.On top of the hearty handful of creative pizza varieties, Ian's is also looking out for those with the more traditional breakfast options on the mind. They've transformed their salad bar into the oatmeal and yogurt station of your dreams. With over 15 topping options, the likes of granola, dried and fresh fruit, and a handful of different nuts, the flavor combos are endless. If you're like me and lacking the creativity this early in the a.m., Ian's will set you up with one of their signature favorites. With a base of Sugar River Dairy yogurt and house-made oats, you really can't go wrong. And however delicious the pizzas are, 'The Mifflin' Oatmeal that I feasted on was what really had me swooning. In this signature flavor, Ian's steel-cut oats are topped off with honey, fresh strawberries, toasted coconut, dried cherries, a splash of almond milk and, wait for it, chocolate chips. The heartiness of the oats acted as the perfect base for this delicious party of ingredients. The almond milk and honey added a delicate sweetness, the strawberries contributed a refreshing taste, and the crunch of the coconut and chewy bite of cherries were both just right. Add a sprinkling of melty, rich chocolate chips to this already beautiful (and ginormous) bowl and you are sitting in oatmeal heaven. Thank goodness Ian's has decided to team up with Just Coffee Cooperative for their breakfast days. This is coffee so great that even sugary latte addicts will prefer to drink it black. Though I am far from a dedicated coffee drinker, I'm able to fall in love with and easily drink a black cup of Just Coffee Cooperative's brews time and time again. There is no bitterness to these roasts and it is amazing. The coffee, the oats, the yogurt, and the pies, Ian's you've done good.
Point Brugge Café=Went in for Sunday Brunch with high expectations.  Without my GPS, I am not sure that we could have found this place!  I wanted to bring my BF here for the mussels and I was in the mood for some spectular waffles!   Sorry to say, it didn't live up to our expectations.  Seating was crapped, service slow and the food was okay.  The moules were nothing special and my waffles were a little cold.  We also shared an omelette which was decent.  I know everyone loves this place.  But I am sure that we will not be making a second trip.Delightful, delectable, de-lovely! Driving up the street I could smell the wonderful aromas before even exiting the car! One of the best dining experiences in Pittsburgh. Walking in I soaked in the busy atmosphere and found the last seat at the bar as we waited to be sat. Pinot Please! We didn't wait long this night.For a starter I ordered the famous moules, they were out of this world! Plump, juicy, tender, and without the often found chewiness. The classic sauce consisted of white wine, shallots, garlic and light cream. I ate all the bread just to sop it up. I don't usually like to get full on filler bread but I couldn't help it. You can also have them prepared with Red curry coconut milk, lime juice, basil and cilantro or tomato saffron, and fennel broth. A-mazing!Intellectual types make the modish community. The whole place hums with wine, brews, food pouring out of the kitchen, and conversation.  It is a minimalistic design but so warm, and cozy as you sit at the candle lit mosaic tables in the huge storefront windows. The twinkling lights in the trees and the starry night seem massive outside, so European. They have more seating such as booths and other tables in the back but I loved where we were placed!My entree came out steaming as I fluffed the perfectly cooked noodles. I decided on the ragu bolognese since I had been craving it from HB's E2 dinner choice awhile back. A rich ragu made of beef, pork, and sweet sausage braised in red wine and herbs had my mouth singing! It's watering so bad right now as I close my eyes and remember it. Oh dang! fasting sucks right now! I had a large to go since I had eaten the bread but I was happy for the lunch a day later. I can't wait to visit again and again.Before traveling to Pittsburgh, I turned -- where else -- to Pittsburgh Yelp.  By a serendipitous stroke of good fortune, another Pitt-bound traveler had started a Talk thread: where do I *have* to eat in the 'Burgh?  The Pittsburgh Yelp community chimed in in droves, and I found myself furiously bookmarking away.  It's how husband and I happened on Salt of the Earth, Prantl's, and Point Brugge among other local musts.  Point Brugge is a tiny little brasserie tucked away in a residential neighborhood between Homewood and Squirrel Hill.  By another serendipitous stroke of good fortune, husband and I timed our arrival so that we were given the best seat in the house, a table for two in the floor-to-ceiling front window with the doors open, overlooking the outdoor tables and the street outside.  The perfect ambiance for what would be a wonderful dinner.  Ordered some Belgian tripels and settled in to enjoy Point Brugge.We started with a bowl of moules frîtes, of course, with red curry, coconut milk, lime, and basil.  The heaping mound of mussels was thoroughly satisfying and meaty, the broth rich and flavorful, the frîtes thin and crisp with a basil mayonnaise dip, and nice, crusty baguette for sopping sauce.  For entrées I had the locally-made, organic tofu bánh mì style sandwich, and husband opted for the charcuterie pork chop.  My sammie had ginger soy marinated tofu, cucumber jalapeño relish, napa cabbage, carrots, basil mayonnaise served on more lovely, crusty baguette with a side of cole slaw.  It was delicious, if a bit one-tone; I was hoping that the relish would pop, but it was hardly noticeable.  And I could have used twice the cabbage and carrot.  The mayo-free slaw was light, crunchy, and a nice complement to the sandwich.  Husband's grilled, bone-in chop came with potato-leek hash, corn and pepper relish, and a homemade pork sausage.  He loved the tender, juicy chop and sausage paired with the cool, vinegary relish.  Everything was priced quite reasonably, too.  We paid no more than $21 for any of the dishes we had the pleasure of noshing.Rounding out an excellent meal was the even better service provided by our server, Flora, as well as the host and the manager.  When I asked Flora what "locally-sourced" tofu actually meant, she went and brought the manager who wrote down the name of the West Virginia-based producer.  Quelle service.Thank you, thank you, Pittsburgh Yelp!  We were steered, again, in a great direction.It's taken me way too long to get here!  Especially with all the rave reviews.  So naturally, you'd have to ask after that statement, did it live up to the hype?  Absolutely!If not for the popularity, you'd never know it was here!  It's amidst a cute little row of houses.  When you walk inside it gives you a homey feel, since it's so tiny inside.  But the food packs a huge punch!It's hard to chose what part of the day you should come here based on how great everything sounded from the reviews.  Since brunch wins me over most of the time, I chose that.  Good thing I was not disappointed in the least!I love me a prix fixe meal because it offers a lot of options.  The prices for these are $19 and $23 depending on what you pick.  I chose the Eggs Benedict, Potato Strudel and Mimosa.  First off, the mimosa was slammin'!  They don't give you a dinky champagne glass, they serve it in a wine glass.  Total win!  Speaking of large and in charge, the loaf of bread my eggs and Canadian bacon sat atop was HUGE!  it was delish and most definitely fresh. The eggs were a fluffy-ness I've never experienced before and the Hollandaise sauce was light and abundant.  I need lots of sauce and it included enough for dipping.The potato strudel was equally as yummy.  It's made with Parmesan sauce that is actually making my mouth water as I type this.  This should for sure be your side dish pic.  Although, I'm sure the other ones are winners as well!  I will note that we didn't have to wait for a table at all, which probably had something to do with particular sports team playing at the same time, our win though!  Our server was incredibly friendly and helped make suggestions on different food items.  The meals came out super fast too.  I was really amazed at how smoothly everything was!  We kept glancing over at other people's dishes ogling what their choices were.  I wouldn't say it was food jealousy, because ours was equally as fab, but everything that came out of the kitchen just looked so darn good!  Of course, I absolutely want to come back and try the mussels.  I will NOT wait too long again...see you there soon!My boyfriend made fun of me for wanting to show up to brunch 20 minutes before Point Brugge opened. Five minutes before opening, like a flash mob, 15 cars pre-parked nearby the establishment opened their doors simultaneously and the line formed for Sunday Brunch behind us. What would follow would be one of the greatest brunch experiences I've ever had.We were seated by Dana - I remember her name because she treated our table of 6 like old friends as soon as she met us. She was quick with the mimosas and the jokes, while also recommending her favorites from the menu.Though a little cramped, it was an intimate experience and can easily sit small groups. The menu is almost entirely European-inspired and incredible. We all ordered something different so that we could try each other's meals - and no one was disappointed. In fact, we all ordered another mimosa and couldn't stop gushing about our awesome meal. I personally got the Baked Brunch Cassoulet and it raises the bar for what I expect from my brunch.This visit also led me to return on a weeknight to explore the dinner menu. I ordered the Mussels, which confirmed that the chef's talents don't just reside in a few dishes but across the menu. Point Brugge is must visit for everyone in Pittsburgh!
Gordon Biersch=GB always a good choice. Gordon Biersch is always a good choice, especially after a day of shopping at Tanger Outlet Mall. GB has a relaxing atmosphere and I admire  the decor on the inside of the restaurant,  with all the subtle references to beer.The server's at GB are always very helpful and take the time to review the menu and explain the various selection of beers offered. The menu at GB is large with a great selection of appetizers.  If you like fries, then you should sample the garlic fries. These fries are addictive, made with fresh pressed garlic, and pair nicely with  beer. If fries aren't for you, then the Blue Crab Artichoke Dip, or Ahi Tuna  is an absolutely must.I enjoyed several of the Marzen Beers and we finished our meal with a delicious Warm Apple Bread Pudding. I look forward to my next visit to GB in the future. The prices are fair,  the menu is appealing, and the customer service is great.
THEcafe at THEhotel=Our server was a horrible, lying bitch, to put it nicely.She didn't greet us at all; the first thing she said was, "What do you wanna drink?" with a bit of an attitude. We saw other tables with baskets of bread, so we asked her if we could also get a basket. Sh straight up told us bread was for the people who ordered from the lunch menu (not us). For some reason, she still brought out a measly basket of bread for us and said that was all that was left -- even though all the other tables had big ass baskets full of all kinds of different bread.When she took our orders, she didn't ask my father how well he wanted his steak, which we didn't realize until his steak came and it was all bloody on the inside. Maybe that's how it's supposed to be prepared, but she could've at least warned my father. I ordered a Strawberry, Raspberry, and Blueberry waffle which was actually really tasty. That was the best part of the meal.Then, she took 20 minutes getting our bill and finishing the transaction. We didn't even know what the hell she was doing. She kept circling the restaurant, going in and out of the kitchen, looking around, going back into the kitchen, and coming out with nothing. It was really unfortunate we were stuck with her cos the other server who was taking care of tables nearby us seemed so attentive, and she just failed upon comparison.And it wasn't just us who thought the service was terrible. The table right next to us were also served by this lazy ass waitress. Apparently, one of the ladies wanted white bread and the server gave her Sourdough. The lady told her it was Sourdough and instead of just apologizing and bringing her white bread, the waitress argued with her and insisted it wasn't Sourdough.  All the lady said was, "Uh, this is Sourdough. Trust me, I ate it," which did the trick. They ended up not finishing the majority of their food and left a $2 tip (for a party of 4), which was hilarious cos you know how expensive food is in Vegas. They didn't follow the "15% tip rule," and neither did we.I wish I remembered the server's name, so you can all avoid her. She seemed to be Hispanic, middle-aged, short, kind of on the large side, with curly brown hair.  I'm sure a lot of people have had great experiences here considering all the positive reviews before mine; they just really need to get rid of her. Never again! Go spend your money elsewhere.Straight up good, resort breakfast for the business traveler at reasonable prices.Side note: Stop reading if your idea of breakfast in Vegas is 15 strips of bacon, a couple scoops of greasy fried country potatoes, and heaping of eggs scrambled in butter and heavy cream finished with a glass of OJ (for that serving of fruit).  Nothing wrong with that, just remember the city's slogan as you're frantically searching for that special room a few hours later.The ambiance is contemporary.  Even the suit clad or dot com urban cowboy totes iPads and iPhones instead of printed WSJ or Financial Times.  Service warm and unobtrusive.  The food; the best breakfast on the Strip.The custard pancakes with vanilla butter and macerated blueberries is outstanding.  Warm, fluffy, and extremely moist.  The pronounced vanilla works so well against the tart berries.  The simple waffle with a warm, fresh fruit compote and the to die for maple mascarpone stays crisp to the very last bite.  Finally the white chocolate raspberry brioche French toast topped with macadamia nuts and frangelico syrup; perfect.  Rich, not too sweet, eggy goodness.Heavier eaters should opt for the incredible in house cured salmon with its melt in your mouth goodness or the smoked pork benedicts.  Pork with eggs and butter is the breakfast of champions right?Portions are very large.  Even the sides are huge.  The bone in ham easily 6oz.  The three strips of extremely thick cut, crispy broiled bacon 4oz.Around $20 per person, a real bargain for the quality and quantity.
Yard House=This was so close to being a 4 star review until the very end of my time here.  I'm giving it 3 because the food was decent, the beer selection was insane, and its convenient for brew and view.  To see why its not 4 stars read on....I went with my husband on a Friday around 3:30 for their happy hour to get toasty before seeing a movie - a pretty convenient location for that.  When we first got in, I remarked how I couldn't believe there was a woman at the bar with her friend and her infant child in a stroller next to them.  Something I'm not used to seeing but the place was pretty empty at that point so I disregarded it.  (Even though if I came with a baby in a stroller- which I would not-  I would choose to sit at one of the 50 empty tables and not AT the bar, but that's just me.)The place was big and as I said mostly empty, and somehow the hostess still managed to seat us in an area with no waitress.  After eyeing a few of them as they walked by our table to help the tables around us, one finally came over to us - "Is anyone helping you?  I can go figure out who is supposed to be your waitress."  No, you are going to take our order.Like I said, the food honestly was pretty good.  We had the chicken lettuce wraps which had a ton of pine nuts (yum!) and came with three delicious dipping sauces - hoisin, peanut satay, and a sweet and spicy.  We also had the chicken nachos and onion rings which were average.  The onion rings were served with your choice of dipping sauces- ranch or slightly pink ranch.  (I like to call it Ranch Rose)  I would highly suggest they develop a horseradish dipping sauce.  Overwhelmed by the beer selection, my husband asked for a recommendation, saying he usually goes for the lagers, pale ales, and amber ales, and the waitress had no clue what he should get, only that "I remember someone ordering one of the pale ales earlier and didn't like it."  Ok. . .I ordered a rum and coke, seeing as well drinks were supposed to be $4 for the happy hour special.  We got out beverages and I tasted my drink and thought the bartender screwed up and put stoli vanilla in it - my husband tasted it and agreed.  Oh well, I'm not one to complain.  When ordering our second round, I specifically emphasized "ANOTHER RUM and coke."  This time, a bus boy brought our drinks to us and handed me the glass and said "Your Captain and coke."  Here's a lesson to all the waitresses out there - when your special is $4 well drinks and your clientele doesn't specify the brand of alcohol they want, that means "well liquor."  Don't substitute it with "top shelf" liquor (if you can call Captain that) and definitely DON'T substitute regular rum with spiced rum.  "Captain and Coke" is a VERY specific drink.  "Rum and Coke" is not.  It turned from bad to worse when the kid in the booth behind us decided to toss his straw over and it hit me in the head.  I turned and scoured at the table of parents and they shrugged it off and pointed to the kid as if to say, "Oh it wasn't our fault, he was just a kid."  For all the parents reading this, if your children can't behave and you can't control them, don't bring them to happy hour.  It is NOT okay to shrug off bad behavior like that.  If it were my child, I would demand he apologize to whomever he hit.When we got the bill, I was glad to see that I was charged the full price for my "rum and cokes."  Stellar, exactly why I came to happy hour.  As we left, the place had filled in pretty well, and I saw ANOTHER stroller with a baby in it, only this time the parents were just standing around not even in seats or at the bar! (They also had a toddler who was sitting on the floor of the bar area.)  I'm sorry, I'm just appalled.  I've never seen babies saddling up to a bar before.   What if someone accidentally walked by and spilled beer on your baby?!  A bar is not a place for children, I don't care how bad you need a drink and its happy hour.I'm a fan of the Yard House, so when I saw that there was a location at the Desert Ridge Mall, I had to stop by for lunch.  I ordered some Sliders & Fries and a pint of Green Flash IPA:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=sy9P0ShsAXZrv2H-CVje9ghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=9i6Nv0PT-Uye96zJrz8W3Ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=uK60mVysXfTVfvznGgsozghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=4AbpvM3j4KJYChtYIz-SFwThe Sliders & Fries were pretty good.  You get a stack of 4 Sliders and a pile of Fries.  The IPA went down smooth with the meal...yum!Was there during lunch hour on a Saturday, so the wait was short dining at the bar alone.  One of the best things about dining at the bar is that your glass is never empty.....Return Factor - 90%
Tableau=See profile site for full review with formatted pics.Chatting on his Vertu in a strange language (something arabic I believe) I couldn't help but notice my neighbor's Constantin Patrimony Series watch flashing in the sunlight of Tableau's patio...clearly there was money around. When the waiter arrived to refill his water and asked if he could get the check the man pulled out a money clip, peeled off two $100 bills and said "that should cover it" before getting up and walking away...the man had ordered a fruit plate. Tucked away in the gardens and pools of the Wynn Tableau is both rich and beautiful in appearance, much like its patrons. Sure I didn't expect low quality from Steve Wynn, but to say the clientele of Tableau was "well to do" would be a vast understatement.Arriving at 7:45am I was greeted by the gorgeous lobby and the gracious hostess who asked whether I would prefer dining indoors or on the patio. As the patio was amply shaded and most of the patrons were outside I chose the patio and was subsequently offered a copy of the Wallstreet Journal, New York Times, or USA Today to browse. Seeing the headlines regarding the USC upset, I opted for the USA Today (clearly indicating my status compared to the rest of the diners who sat browsing the Times or Journal) and chose a wonderful table half sunny/half shaded with a great view of the pool and gardens. Water was filled and the menu was delivered while the waiter went to get my coffee.Browsing the menu I was instantly captured by the pastry basket and the Peach pancakes, but not being hungry enough for both decided to ask the waiter what was available in the basket. Approximately 10 items were rattled off including an apricot tart, apple scone, and nectarine turnover. When I asked if pastries could be ordered individually it was explained that these were 'petite' pastries and if I wanted to try only one it would be free of charge. "A nectarine turnover and the peach pancakes, please." "Certainly, sir."While I waited for my food I stood up and roamed the pools and gardens. Approximately 20 people were present at the time, all dressed either business casual or semi-formal and all dining on items ranging from the freshest appearing fruits to pastries to eggs and sausage that looked incredible. When I returned to my table (my tableau?) my coffee was waiting along with cream and sugar/spelda/equal. No nutrasweet was to be seen and when asked I was informed "Mr Wynn does not fancy nutrasweet." Fair enough (for what it is worth, Alex also didn't have Nutrasweet but noted they could obtain it immediately if I desired.)After approximately 10 minutes a fantastic yet dainty apricot turnover arrived fresh from the oven. Crispy, flaky, loaded with fresh nectarines it was the perfect opener to the meal and I'd have certainly enjoyed many more had I ordered the basket. Another 10 minutes and a laugh at the Trojans passed, my coffee was refilled once, and then my pancakes emerged from the kitchen.Described in the menu as Ricotta Peach Pancakes with lime butter and organic maple syrup, nothing could've prepared me for these pancakes. Fluffy and light, airy yet moist, sweet yet savory and absolutely jammed with fresh skinned peaches, the dish was presented with a simple dusting of powdered sugar, a side-pitcher of warm syrup, and a dollop on the side that tasted like a fresh key lime dissolved in butter. Having tried Ricotta Pancakes only once before but any number of stellar pancakes in the past, this dish was a revolution and I truly sat and savored each bite. Sure, $14 for three pancakes is not a bargain, but $14 for breakfast bliss? That is a bargain.When I finished my pancakes and resisted the urge to lick my plate clean my waiter arrived and asked if he could get me anything else. "Perhaps a coffee to go?" "....don't twist my arm....how about another turnover too?" "Certainly, sir." While I didn't tip $185 like my neighbor, I certainly wish I could have.On my way out everyone was very friendly, from the other waiters to the hostess, making each guest feel like their visit was truly valued. I was even invited to return for dinner, but when I told the hostess we had reservations for Alex that evening she noted "oh, excellent choice, perhaps some other time." All told the meal was fantastic and on par with Bouchon in terms of quality, presentation, and service. Go early, sit on the patio, eat, smile, and enjoy the richness of the food and the clientele...even if you yourself aren't rich...sometimes it's fun to see how the upper crust lives.Regardless of where you are on Saturday, this is definitely the place to be on Sunday! Well, for brunch that is.From the relaxing views of the well manicured gardens to the elegant dining atmosphere, no detail is overlooked at this posh "English tea party" inspired restaurant. The brew here is eye opening and the OJ is freshly squeezed. Small details IMO that make the dining experience that much more enjoyable. In this day and age, we all know little things do mean a lot!In regards to the brunch fare, I was pleasantly surprised with both the quality and flavor. You can tell the execution was performed with distinction & care.Although the white chocolate French toast was the claim to fame here, I was hooked by the pictures of fluffy blueberry pancakes on my iPhone Yelp app. Suffice it to say, I was not disappointed at all. It was as fluffy and soft as I expected. I would have preferred more fresh blueberries, but with all things considered,  it was still quite a treat. Especially when I drizzled a generous amount of that warm maple syrup on top and watched it cascade down each thick layer of divine, doughy goodness!However, the highlight of the meal had to be the Duck Croque Madame. I'd even venture out to say that it's the single best thing I've ever had for brunch thus far in Vegas! Topped with a fried egg (now how can that be wrong?!) this French sandwich was packed with mouthwatering deliciousness!  From the perfectly tender morsels of duck that tasted like it was slow roasted for hours, to the melted Gruyere and caramelized onions (reminiscent of a french onion soup), it was like a virtual foodgasm in my mouth!So there ya have it, pleasant atmosphere, beautiful views, and incredibly good food.  What more could you ask for? That's right, seconds!Happy Eats!A group of 5 girls wandered in here for brunch after a long night. We were told to wait for them to set up our table. We waited, and waited, and waited. And the place was empty! Finally we walked back over to the host stand and pretty much demanded to be seated. Things weren't off to a great start. We browsed the menu and ordered several items for the table. I thoroughly enjoyed my salmon Benedict. An egg white omelet was also a success. The lobster fritatta was thoroughly disappointing as was their homemade ketchup. The granola with greek yogurt was quite good. Food came out quickly, which everyone appreciates after a long night. Overall, the food was decent enough to return but the service is what was a bit annoying. Especially considering how empty it was. Five hosts were standing around doing nothing.Tableau is a very open and inviting restaurant. The one thing we enjoyed about Tableau is their outside seating and the weather was perfect for having brunch outside. The seating arrangements are done well, you're not close to your neighbors and can enjoy your meal freely. Service was efficient and fast. We never had to ask for our drinks to be refilled and they made sure our coffee was filled which was real nice.The first order was museli. It was made with cinnamon and small strips of apples. You are served with milk, brown sugar, etc. The museli was soft and tasty. The aroma of the cinnamon was enticing. We enjoyed the museli quite a bit.We ordered the lemon ricotta pancake.....need I say more? It was gooood! If it was a short or full stack, we would have eaten it in a hot second. The hint of lemon was perfect and the ricotta added a very nice texture to the pancake. It was served warm and moist. We didn't even use the butter or the maple syrup.  Next order was their benie! They make their benies 3 ways and we chose the most basic one. It had cured ham, poached egg, and a nice sauce to which we requested be put on the side. I still enjoy Mon Ami Gabi's benie more but Tableau was good.Overall, Tableau was a good surprise. We will be back for more in the near future!My best dining experience in Vegas thus far. I loved everything about Tableu, the ambiance, the service and the food was all 5 star quality for me. Is it expensive? Yes, but have you been to Vegas lately? Everything is expensive. This one however was worth every penny. We walked on a busy Saturday morning for brunch, a large group and our wait was about 30-40 min. We were seated indoors, due to the cold. Our server Georgina really took care of us, she answered all of our questions and really tended to us the whole two and a half our we were seated there. The food? AMAZeeeee! What I tried? Their fresh juices, the Bloody Mary, the intelligentsia coffee, the steak Benedict and the duck hash. The duck hash was perfectly combined with a creamy cheese sauce inside of a puff pasty  topped with eggs any style you want. The steak Benedict had decadent crab meat hidden underneath which complimented the steak and bernaise sauce beautifully!This was an amazing meal I will cherish forever and I cannot wait to go back to the Wynn to enjoy this amazing meal again. Oh did I mention they have a little cushion for your purse! This place is a must try, please try it, you will not be disappointed!Looking for a serene location to have breakfast, my friend and I decided to dine at Tableau. While the food was decent, the service was not up-to-par to that of other restaurants at Wynn. With the exception of several carb-heavy dishes, the food at Tableau was overpriced for its quality. Although I liked the fact that my butternut squash soup was not too sweet, I was not a fan of the stale almonds in it. The Greek yogurt was light and went well with the berries. While the orange zest juice was refreshing, its portion was small compared to its competitors like MOzen. At the same time, my friend greatly enjoyed the Duck Croque Madame - the duck meat was very tender and juicy, while the croissant was warm and flaky. In terms of service, the waitress was unfriendly and only stopped by our table once after she took the order. She also forgot about one of our dishes until I reminded her in the end of the meal. Since the restaurant is always packed, I definitely recommend Yelpers to make reservations in advance. My friends and I plan to give Tableau another try and order its famous pancakes in our next visit."Proper" is the word that comes to mind when I think of Tableau. It doesn't hold a negative connotation, but the space definitely is reminiscent of an English tea party. Servers were prompt and attentive and very, very proper, and the setup of the sunlit room was classy and elegant. Trio of fresh juices: Red Deliciousness, Purify, Orange Zest:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zdiMak6UuWRV5AlvsB8_7A&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)I was unfortunately allergic to one or more of the fruit mixes in these juices, but the other members of my party verified that these juices were definitely freshly-pressed. They also mentioned that these are healthy and do taste it, so if that's not your cup of tea, maybe go for.. actual tea.. Cream of cauliflower soup:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=FdKXwBSOKe2aBqpIBQvKKQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)Per proper preparation, this soup was served via pouring at the table. It was thick, gloopy, and luke. warm. I had one sip and was so disappointed in the lukewarm temperature that it immediately became a miss in my book. I did appreciate the bits of toasted cauliflower and creaminess of the soup, but any soup that is lukewarm is a lost cause for me.Chicken noodle soup:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nC5Jo6HDz4I6RpLxP2jkrw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)The temperature of this soup was slightly warmer than that of the cream of cauliflower, but it was still far from hot. The noodles were slightly overboiled, and the broth was too salty for my taste. Duck hash and eggs:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=StJ8amQAT9SBTS11CtBhMQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)The puff pastry on the bottom was rolled beautifully; it was flaky and melt-in-your-mouth despite being a little oily (as puff pastries can be expected to be). The duck hash was seasoned well, although I didn't get too much of a duck taste, and the egg balanced out the slight saltiness of the hash. I also enjoyed the roasted fingerling potatoes, as they added a cozy mealiness to the dish. White chocolate orange french toast:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mbPZyByuEpY0N7WRm4v9RA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)I love french toast, and I always itch to try it whenever I see it on any menu. After reading the rave reviews about the white chocolate orange french toast here, I was practically salivating even ordering it. When it was served, the presentation was beautiful and I was expecting it to taste as wonderful as it looked.. but it fell really short of expectation. The two pieces of bread were incredibly dry, and despite the beautiful browning of egg on each side, there was no egginess. I did get the orange flavor, but none of the white chocolate (and I prefer white chocolate to orange). Even plentiful syrup could not offset the dryness of the toast, and this dish was a crestfallen disappointment to me. It's possible it was just a fluke, but then it'd be a huge fluke.Filet Oscar benedict with beef tenderloin, poached eggs, blue crab, and housemade sourdough muffin:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=b4ZzfgTgNOQOMfyKJ9zabQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)I thought the pairing of beef tenderloin and blue crab was interesting, and it worked to a degree. The blue crab meat was slightly cold, as if it had just come out of the refrigerator, but the beef tenderloin was cooked a nice medium rare. The poached eggs had model runny centers, although the hollandaise sauce was a bit too watery for me. There was a lot going on with this one dish, and it's definitely something to dig into when ravenous rather than as an ending entree. I have mixed feelings about Tableau, but I'd be open to coming back for a second brunch visit.
Coca Cafe=My girlfriend and I decided to ride our bikes down to Coca Cafe and get some breakfast. Once we arrived we were told there would be a 10 minute wait.A lot of people keep repeating that the service here is bad. I guess I can see where they are coming from if you're a pretty high strung person who is used to being in and out of a restaurant and fed as soon as you sit down. The Coca Cafe is not this place and it's really obvious. It's a pretty small cafe and you're going to have to deal with a little bit of waiting. The owner, or at least what I thought was a manager of some sort did not seat a group of two while we were waiting because the rest of their party was not there. This is a simple rule and it allows people who are ready and on time to get a seat. In a place as small as Coca Cafe you can't afford to seat half of a party while they wait however long for the rest of their people. This might be considered "rude" to people but it's born of necessity. The "customer is always right" mantra is not universally accepted at every establishment you patronize.Anyway, with that out of the way. We were seated in less than 10 minutes and ordered two omelets. I had the wild mushroom omelet (shiitake and portabello) with Jarlsberg cheese, a side of grilled potatoes, and pumpernickel toast. My girlfriend had the tomato, feta, and pesto omelet. I got an orange juice with my water which was definitely freshly squeezed and delicious.After a little bit of a wait (see my earlier rant) we got our food which was amazing. The omelets were full and incredibly hardy. The mushrooms were fresh and springy with a tiny bit of crunch to them. The Jarlsberg cheese was so mild that I forgot it was in there at first; you can choose from two different cheeses so next time I think I'll try the other cheese to see if it is less subtle. The egg was cooked just right, a little crispy brownness on the edges and fluffy everywhere else. Nowhere in the omelet did I find raw yolk which I absolutely hate. The potatoes were cooked through and crispy on the outside, seasoned to perfection.I agree with Teresa T, LOVE the environment but the food....it's just OK.  I've been to this place on a couple different occasions and tried their lunch selections (sammies, salads, etc.) and I've always been underwhelmed.  The surprising thing is that people rave about it!  So when this place came up for brunch plans I decided to give it another try.  I had heard the brunch was the best part so I was cautiously optimistic.  I hadn't been here in a while and what I will say is I LOVE LOVE LOVE the renovations.  The bright red paint and the funky artwork really makes this place pop.  So bravo for whoever designed this.  I sat outside on the side of the building, which I never realized was there.  It was so cute and quaint.  I just really love everything about the atmosphere.  I SO wish I could say that about the food.  I love me some almonds and almond flavored meals, so I tried the Almond French Toast.  Sadly, again I was underwhelmed.  When I imagine french toast I want a puffy thick piece of toast.  This came on a flat thin baguette.  Not a fan.  It was drizzled in lemon sauce and had almonds and fruit sprinkled on top.  I could hardly taste the almond flavor over the lemon drizzle.  Was almond extract even used in the egg mixture?  That's what I would have liked.  I wouldn't be opposed to coming here but maybe I'll just pick up a chai latte and enjoy the great atmosphere instead of the food.  So the search is on for some slammin' almond french toast!I have been meaning to try out Coca Cafe for some time now, and my friend brought me here for an end of the semester brunch celebration.  Yay for finishing my first year of graduate school!There is no atmosphere to Coca Cafe, which I would have expected from the hipster-ish menu.  It's what I would refer to as upscale Yinzer atmosphere.  The tables are too close together so people will continuously run into you, and there will be children screaming at the tops of their lungs while their parents ignore them.  However, there are some really unique food options and the servers are pleasant enough.I ordered an omelette with pesto, tomatoes, and feta.  It was presented very prettily, and there was a cute orange slice to give it some more color.  I wouldn't order this again necessarily, as it was too salty for my taste.  I did enjoy it, but I would prefer to try something else next time.  My friend got shrimp grits, which she raved about.Overall, I totally prefer Coca Cafe to Square Cafe is Regent Square, and I would say that is the closest equivalent.
Rooster's Wood-Fired Kitchen=I was looking forward to my dining experience at Roosters but was greatly disappointed. Though I had a reservation, I had to wait 15 minutes for my table. The bar was full and it was raining so I was forced to stand in the doorway as they have no designated waiting area. The atmosphere was far too noisy to hold a conversation. The waitress did her best sales job and told me about the beautiful scallops that looked like "toasted marshmallows" when they came from the oven. She didn't tell me that they were miniature marshmallows, three of them to be exact. For $18.00 I got three scallops with no sides. The best part about the meal was the steamed green beans ($5 extra) and the bottle of wine. Hard to mess those up. I came home, made a sandwich and crossed Roosters off of my places to eat in Charlotte.Date night was a success because I chose Rooster's.Great attentive service, though the waiter was a little touchy feely. I guess that's how he likes to interact with his customers, touching shoulders and such. Odd, but not odd enough to say anything.We opted to skip appetizers and went right to the mains. My wife chose the roasted duck breast which she said was excellent. Very moist, very tasty, truly delicious. I chose the half barbecue chicken and it was awesome. Super moist, very tangy, really easy to eat with knife and fork. Yum and a bunch of it went home.For sides, we chose three veggies to share - roasted beets, Yukon puree (really, mashed potatoes) and steamed spinach. All were great.No dessert today. I should have saved room for that coconut cake.
Iguana Mack's=Iguana Macks can be a great reality check. If anything, it will remind you how suburbanites in the rest of the country get down. Take any themed tropical bar, ala Rainforest Cafe, that you might find in Bakersfield or Indianapolis, and throw in a dancefloor and some Buck Hunter - and ta da - you have Iguana Macks!We found ourselves here after a cornhole tournament died down a few neighborhoods away. This place is quite the mob scene on weekends and feels as if half of the singles in Gilbert and Chandler are up in here wearing their evening best -- whether it be from Wet Seal for the ladies or guys sporting black/white caps over their brows ensembles from TapOut. So you have a few choices:* Try to engage in some mind-numbing small talk with the regulars.* Be among the first (because no one else in the club is drunk enough) on the dancefloor to the local band doing mid-90s alt rock covers.* Or hide in the corner with your friends, and avoid everyone while sharpen your Buck Hunter skills.We tried those three options in exactly that order until we couldn't take it anymore.Pet Peeve #1 - When Yelper's give an establishment a bad review based solely on service issues alone without staying to eat. If you didn't even eat the food then are you really entitled to write a scathing review? ...knowing this...I'm about to piss myself off and break my own rule...because I'm going to do the exact thing I hate; as described above. Damn me. My brother and I went out on a week night a while ago for some reverse happy hour grub, and just so happened to cruise by this place. Upon seeing the uber-cool iguana wearing sunglasses on the sign which instantly reminded me of those cool 80's IZOD shirts, we knew we had to stop. Sadly, upon entering the place just had this grimy look and feel to it, the kind of feel you get when you stop at a Dairy Queen in some one horse town on the way to Vegas. The experience that followed is summarized below: -We park and enter the front door. -There is no hostess or visible employee anywhere. -We wait for a few minutes trying to figure out what to do. -Still no employees around...we wander the whole place...and to our shock do not find a single waiter/waitress/hostess/bartender/cook anywhere. -We go back to the front room, standing there confused about what we should do. -Wait five minutes. -Walk around again...still not a single employee of Iguana Macks to be found anywhere. -Leave to find a better establishment...in this case...Applebees. (Which is saying a lot because I hate Applebees.) ...can someone explain how a restaurant/bar like this can be devoid of any/all employees around 10 o'clock? I was tempted to go and ask one of the inebriated bar patrons, but it just didn't seem worth the hassle. I would have liked to try Iguana Macks; but sadly wasn't given the chance. It shouldn't be a challenge to eat somewhere...an establishment should be courting you for your business, and this was the complete opposite. Now the bigger question is this...where were the employees? Some of my theories: -An all at once employee weed smoking break -They were transported to an alternate timeline and are now living in a parallel universe where they work for a classier restaurant. Kind of like 'Lost' for wait staff. -Employee Orgy ...eh, who knows...but I'm just not too jazzed about going back to try this place. It left a bad taste in my mouth and I didn't even have any of the food; that's saying something.Not my favorite spot. It looked promising walking in, there was live music, but too loud so decided to eat inside. Each food and drink  item we ordered was disappointing. This included wings, and some kind of Asian tacos, and a handful of mixed drinks.  Service was pretty bad as well. Our initial server never came back to check on us after our order was taken.  We  had to flag down other servers walking by each time we wanted something. Probably won't be back anytime soon.
Sumo Sushi Bar=I've heard it multiple times from the Terri R and Alicia R.  Sumo is one of their favorite places for sushi.  And for them, it's all about the Lion Roll and Screaming Orgasm (Sashimi). Both of the Twins also claim that they haven't found a place out here that can make the Lion Roll as good as Sumo.  I'll just take their word for now. I've driven by this place a handful of times and with Blue Fin just around the corner, I never had the opportunity to eat here.  I got that opportunity recently when TR and AR invited me for a dinner with their co-workers.  No way I'm turning down food.  No way I'm turning down sushi.  No way I'm turning down food and sushi with my favorite twins.  This restaurant is located in the Henderson area off Sunset and Green Valley.  The restaurant itself is averaged sized, quiet, and the staff is amazing.  When I first walked in, the staff greeted me with a smile and started flexing their muscles.  Not sure what that meant at the time.  I assumed it meant that I better workout after eating here because eat is what I'm going to do. I had their Garlic Tuna Sashimi and Yellowtail Nigiri. The Yellowtail Nigiri is a little bigger than most and taste is about the same with most.  My nigiri was fresh and I didn't have a problem finishing it.  Now for the main event...their Garlic Tuna Sashimi.  First of all, no one warned me about the size of this dish.  I thought I was getting about 5 slices of tuna.  What I got had to be 15+ pieces of sashimi.  If I knew this, I wouldn't have ordered the nigiri.  This was so good, so fresh, and for tuna not fishy at all.  Texture was perfect, simply rolled down my throat and into my belly.  I tried to share, but everyone got their own dishes.  Next time I know better, this is a dish for two.  But don't worry, I still finished it on my own. Am I a fan?  I can't speak for the rest of the menu.  All I can say...it's all about their Garlic Tuna Sashimi.  Garlic Tuna Sashimi:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mcacEQbVaYaqExhwXZxG_w&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQYou Need These:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jVQBoohYcI0JVFCU-4ubYA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQYellowtail Nigiri:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=apQNpR8bhs5VdTuEm_38MA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQI feel like this place should be rated in WTF's instead of stars because if I was rating in WTF's this place would have like, the highest score of all time.I went in with a pretty large group at lunch time and my they were eager to eat all of the sushi. So it's not like we were wasting their time. I mean, lunch time... restaurant... hungry people: It all made perfect sense!We waited several minutes to be acknowledged. WTF? Once the hostess came out of the back we noticed she was on the phone. WTF? Amazingly, she looked at us and went away again without acknowledging us. WTF?When she came back she was still on the phone. Really? WTF.Then she pointed and grunted towards the dinning room. WHILE STILL ON THE PHONE. Seriously?We sat and she gave us one menu. ONE. There were 5 of us. We had to ask for more menus when we saw her again. She was still on the phone, and without a word she went and grabbed like 2 more menus and kind of threw them at us. WTF? I can't believe that was even real life.At this point we were all just madly uncomfortable. Like what if we wanted to ask her for something more complicated than a menu... like SUSHI? She was still on the phone when we walked out and barely glanced at us. WTF.I guess I can't say anything about the food because I was too busy WTFing to order any. But I definitely wouldn't go back so it doesn't matter if the food is the best. If I want service this terrible I can eat at home where my private cook is NEVER around.That is like 8 WTF's in the condensed version of this story. That is like 1 WTF/ minute for this place! Great job!One of the ol' school sushi joints in Vegas, these guys are doing an OK job. I was told by one of the owners that they were the originators of what is known as "Las Vegas sushi" I can neither confirm nor deny this claim.Came here with a bunch of peoples who were on the lookout for some AYCE sushi. After we came in, we were shown to our seats in which they used banquet chairs. The tables are a little smallish for 4 peoples but we were able to squeeze in. I had to hold my breath.Now off to the AYCE. Everything was good, some standouts include the tuna karai, the coconut shrimp which tasted like TGIFridays version, and salmon kama.One thing though the service was inconsistent. Sometimes they were thoughtful, other times, I had to flag down a server several times to refill our water.Another note, the portion size was a little bit too big for AYCE. Normally, I complain when a business is too stingy. But for AYCE, I wish they were smaller so that I could of had a chance to try the nigiri, and other rolls. I would come back here as a fallback in case bluefin was too packed. But it is what it is, so next time take care of yourself.. And each other.
Sushi Ken=Trying to find a Sushi place that is open for lunch on Saturday was tough but we did find Sushi Ken. We were served complimentary miso soup and edamame. Their sushi picture menu had a lot going on so it was hard to decide, we ended up getting an avocado roll, a vegetable roll, a crunchy roll and a tempura fried California roll. I wasn't really paying attention to the sushi being made because I was busy eating my soup and edamame. All our rolls looked good but sadly, not tasting all that great. The seaweed was so chewy, the Crunchy Roll is advertised as using snow crab but it was obviously mixed with Krab as well, not to mention what tasted to me like a gallon of Miracle Whip, it was soooooo gross!! The Avocado roll was the best one despite the chewy seaweed, the deep fried roll was just gross too, definitely made with a roll that was quite possibly rolled days ago and the vegetable roll was just OK, it had a strange mix of veggies inside, I don't even know what they were. Now another couple walk in and sit near us at the sushi bar and I was able to see the sushi being made since I was done eating. Sure enough, I see the chef grab pre-made rolls from across the counter and top it with fish for a rainbow roll. GROSS! There is no reason why these rolls could not be made fresh to order. Now on to an even bigger surprise, you know how they usually grab a piece of seaweed and a hand full or rice and begin to work it onto the seaweed........ I saw the chef grab a piece of seaweed and take it down behind counter for literally 1/4 of a second and come back up with it covered with the pressed rice WTF!!! Their rice and seaweed it also pre-made not wonder it was so damn chewy! I would rather wait and wait for freshly made sushi any day than be served soggy chewy old  pre-made Crap! Seriously I'll never go here again!!I could only imagine how bad the service in a restaurant could be, until I visited Sushi Ken with my family on 8/12/2012 for lunch.   The waitresses who served our table, (I really wish I knew her name, she is the taller / older one, and with *less* Japanese accent),  she performed the worst service I have ever seen, it was as if she did everything in the purpose of offending customers.(1) Our party was 6 adult and 3 kids occupying 3 tables putting together, when she came over to take order, I was sitting at the far end of tables and I told her "we are ready to order", she said "That's what I am here for." and just stood still there, I had to raise my voice to finish ordering for everyone with her.  I mean, I was the one who's talking and couldn't she just move a few steps toward me ?(2) We ordered some sushi rolls and 5 complete meals, she told us we will get 5 appetizers and asked if we want salad or Edamame, we said 3 salad's and 2 Edamame's, and they were served, no problem here.Later on she brought over 4 bowls of miso soup.  I think it is quite normal that you would expect 5, right ?  I asked her "Shouldn't it be five?"  Guess what?  SHE ASKED ME: "WHY?"  Oh my god, she asked me back "WHY" and then we went totally silence waiting for me to find out the answer by myself,.  It took me about 10 seconds to guess and said "is it because one of our meals only comes with appetizer but not soup ?",  then she have me a "uh -ah" and walked away.  Are you serious ??(3) After we had our fried rice and curry beef delivered, we looked around for spoon and not finding any on our tables, I waved her over and said that we need spoons for eating THIS fried rice and THAT curry rice.  I even pointed at these two plates because I was already afraid of mis-communication.Then she brought over "one" spoon!!  1, o-n-e, single, uno !!I told her again that we needed two, she stared at me as if saying "Why didn't you tell me clearly you want two?"  Hey, I told you we need it FOR THE FRIED RICE AND THE CURRY RICE !!  IT IS YOUR PROBLEM serving plates that need spoons and not bring spoons with them, not my problem.(4) After that moment I think her attitude turned from "not friendly" to "rude", when she brought over my noodle, SHE THREW THE BOWL WITH NOODLE SOUP TO MY HANDS, can you believe that !?  She delivered the noodle to my hands, not to my table !!  What if I did not catch it ??She definitely had gone over my edge at that time, if I were not with my parents and kids, I would have exploded right away, it was my family that saved a confrontation from happening right there. (5) The food is plain, actually after all of the above happening, I didn't care about the food anymore even it was 5-star quality.  After the kids were fed, I waved her a couple times for check and I don't know if she overlooked me deliberately or she really didn't see me, after about 5 minutes I walked over to the cashier's stand and asked her "Can we have the check, please?".  YES I SWEAR TO GOD THAT I STILL USED THE WORD 'PLEASE' TO HER.   She did not bother to raise her head or even speak up, she just keep doing what she is doing, and nod her head.   At that time I immediately told myself two things:(1). I am not stepping into this restaurant ever again in my life, and(2). I will do whatever it takes to let the store manager know what happened today, or let the store owner (if she happens to be the manager).  Having this kind of employee is definitely hurting the business !*** To that waitress ***.If you do not like providing service, then don't do this job.  I am not expecting you to show any passion, if this is just a source-of-income for you; but you need to have some basic manner and attitude and respect if you put 15% gratuity on my bill.  If I wasn't forced to pay that, you were not getting ANY tip from me because you do not deserve any.I'm warning you already, I am very grumpy in this review. More than usual. I am a very lenient Yelper most of the time. This one isn't going to be a pretty one.Oh man. I was really looking forward to this meal. Having to drive 30min for the highly-recommended Sushi Ken? It'd be worth it, right? I had even skipped lunch in the hopes to be famished and love every bite of the dinner even more than normal.:( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( It was the worst Japanese food I've ever had.I had the Beef Curry and Tonkatsu Ramen combination with a salad. The salad was colorless and wilted, and the dressing (I love Japanese dressing), was overly vinegar-tasting. The Beef Curry was ok, but I make better Japanese Curry at home using the curry cubes in the boxes sold at supermarkets. The Tonkatsu Ramen....should not have been called such. The ramen tasted worst than instant ramen! It was mushy! There was no taste in the broth of marrow-y goodness. It was a salty, lifeless broth with shriveled bamboo shoots, too much wakame, and one measly thin slice of charsiu. I had about 4 bites and left the rest to die. I didn't even take it home to try to remedy it.My husband had the Tempura Bowl and Shoyu Ramen combination with an Edamame side.The edamame was the grayest-green shade I'd ever seen. Frozen edamame from the supermarket looked better than that! His tempura bowl was bizarre...gone was the flaky, crunchy Panko breading. What was brought out was a glazy, weirdly crusted abomination that was overly sweet. I would like to dip my tempura myself, thank you very much. His Shoyu Ramen was terribly salty. My husband even likes things very salty, and he couldn't drink it. He also left 90% of his bowl untouched. The only thing they didn't mess up was their California Roll, which is pretty impossible to mess up so thank goodness for that. And the service? Terrible. Absolutely terrible. We were a table of 9, and they could have cared less. The 15% was already included in the bill, so maybe that's why they didn't even bother to try to be nice to us. The ladies were so mean! It looked like they just hated everyone they were serving! And usually Japanese waiters are SOOOOO nice. I know, cause I used to wait tables alongside co-workers who had just immigrated from Japan.Funny thing is, the rest of the table really enjoyed their food. (Update: One of them messaged me after reading this review to tell me she actually didn't like the food...lol I guess my husband and I were not the only ones that didn't enjoy it) Nobody enjoyed the service though, I can assure you of that lol.I live in Los Angeles and I come out to AZ every other month. I have been to Sushi Ken many times, and every time I have had terrible service. This last visit was the last straw. The girl who was our server approach us with such a poor attitude and a sour look on her face. Needless to say, we tried not to ask her for much. At the beginning of our order, I notified her that I will need to place a to go order toward the end of the meal. She walked by our table many times, while our water glasses were empty, she never once stop to ask us if we needed anything or just fill our water glasses. I then asked her nicely, that when she had a chance, could we get some more water. She then said, "don't you need to place an order to go?" I said "yes, but when you bring the water, we can do it then". She walked over, slammed a pitcher of water on the table and then walked away. I proceeded to serve our table the water, then walked over to the register to place my to go order and pay my bill.I have never in my life stiffed a waitress. However, in this case it was necessary. The waitress followed me out to the parking lot and asked me where I had left the tip. I told her that expecting a tip for NOT doing your job is not the way it goes. T.I.P. means "To Insure Promptness" and since I did the job for her, she did not deserve a tip.The unfortunate thing, is that the sushi is actually good and affordable. I might suggest take-out for this place.You can't buy happiness but you can buy ramen and sushi and that's kind of the same thing.Le grr.  I was hoping to start the new year off with a 5-star worthy meal!  At least it's not as bad as the Japanese-Mexican fusion place I went to earlier this week.  Yikes.  Anyways, met up with the in-laws today to celebrate my sister-in-law's milestone birthday.  I have never been here before so I jumped onto Yelp last night to see what would catch my eye.  Since it's been pretty chilly due to the winter storm, I was leaning towards ramen.  It ended up being a safe choice after seeing and tasting a little bit of what everyone ordered.I ordered the Miso Butter Ramen with the Deluxe Dragon Roll on the side.  My ramen came with either salad or edamame and three California rolls.  I should have checked the tips on Yelp because I chose the edamame thinking the warm soybeans would help warm me up as we were seated under the only ceiling fan that appeared to be running.  It was cold and old and I ended up sliding it over the Mr. W. who had a very gross salad.  The California rolls are basic so it's nothing to write home about.  The ramen was satisfying.  Although the noodles seem to be the store-bought variety, I enjoyed the flavor of the miso broth immensely.  Paired with the butter that made the soup base creamy and coat my mouth with a wonderfully richness, I was pretty happy --- even with the hard-boiled egg [I was hoping for a soft-boiled egg].  I wish they had corn instead of bamboo shoots in their ramen but that's just all personal preference.  The chashu in my ramen was also nothing special.  The Deluxe Dragon Roll is a fancified dragon roll with the addition of cream cheese and tempura shrimp.  I also got to try some sashimi that didn't seem all too fresh, a cold lovely-dressed jellyfish salad, and other little bites.Service was a little lacking but it's understandable since it was super busy.  It was a full-restaurant for the two hours we were there.  If I ever stop in again, I think I want to try their udon.I came here for dinner last night and finally remembered why I didn't come back here for more than 5 years.Sushi ken's menu is so extensive. They serve almost anything Japanese. I had chance to try variety of food in the past including ramen, sushi, tempura, donburi, curry, grilled fish to name a few.They are not bad, I am sure one can find similar quality restaurant in Japan. For me they all tasted like cafeteria type food. Cafeteria food serves its purpose and they are there to please diverse people.It's just such a drive for me to visit, unless I am already in the area, I don't think I would make an effort to drive there just to eat their food. Thus being said, if you are in the area, and with picky person or not sure what to eat, this place is a good option to visit.
Lulu=French food in Plaza Midwood? Sure, sounds great - let's give it a go!Hubs and I rolled into Lulu quite literally at 5 pm...hoping for an early bird special. Well, not really, but we were the only customers in the restaurant. That being said, our service was just peachy. Inside Lulu is quite adorable, albeit a bit nondescript. For a French eatery I was expecting more Parisian flair, but instead Lulu is charming, quaint and comfortable. The menu is pretty diverse - everything from mussels, to calamari, to pork. They also have a great wine list with some fabulous French wines. We had plenty of time and attention to choose a smattering of inspired dishes, I samples the: Calamari, French Onion Soup, Mimosa salad and Chocolate Bread Pudding. First off, the calamari was delectable! It's lightly fried and accompanied by the tastiest "Asian love sauce", which is a conglomerate of a myriad of spices...I'm thinking Chinese 5-spice? The portion was plenty for two of us and it also comes with an Asian slaw. Mmmm!Hubs ordered the French Onion Soup for an appetizer, which I promptly dug my spoon into. Taaaasty! Real Gruyere bubbling over flavorful onion broth and large slices of onion - absolutely spot on. I went a bit lighter on my meal - the Mimosa Salad. The salad was full of mixed greens, two toasted Brie chunks, apples, spiced walnuts and topped with a light coating of super delicious champagne vinaigrette. It's the perfect summer salad, IMO.And lastly, dessert. I toyed back and forth between their classic Creme Brulee and one of their feature desserts, Chocolate Bread Pudding. Sadly, this was the only disappointing part of my meal. I should have listened to our waitress when she mentioned how delicious the Creme Brulee was. The Chocolate Bread Pudding wasn't bad by any means, it was just ok. It tasted more like a nice French toast than a chocolate bread pudding - I especially didn't taste any chocolate in it. Le sigh - I guess I'll just have to come back and try a multitude of desserts! :)
Barrio Fiesta of Manila=I had dinner here last weekend with friends and shared a couple of dishes. We started the meal with delicious, crispy calamares then went on to nilagang baka (boiled beef and veggies), sisig (a spicy pork dish), relyenong talong (roasted eggplant covered with ground pork and scrambled egg), and fried chicken. The portions were generous, the dishes were good, and with rice it turned out to be too much food for the three of us, meaning we had some pretty good food to take home. It was Saturday night, so there was also Latin Dance instruction being given on the dance floor at the end of the restaurant, with several people enthusiastically trying out the steps being taught. I came back today to try the lunch buffet with fellow yelpers Rand H. and Mike  C. The restaurant decided to venture into offering a lunch buffet option only recently, so I guess they are still feeling their way around in this field. The selection of viands was limited (especially if you're used to going to Chinese buffets). I liked the dinuguan (pork stewed in pork blood; this could be a bit daunting for the uninitiated), the lechon kawali (deep fried pork belly), the tapa (thinly sliced beef fried in garlic), the ampalaya (bittermelon with beef) and the kinilaw (the Filipino version of ceviche). Some of the dishes could have used some tweaking: the lumpia (spring rolls) could have been a bit more crisp, and the pancit noodles had an overcooked texture.  Come for the regular menu for lunch and dinner. The buffet also offers authentic Filipino dishes and will hopefully incorporate the needed tweaks in some dishes as they get more accustomed to offering this option. Four stars for the regular menu, three stars for the lunch buffet at this point.
Romeo's Euro Cafe=If you had told me last week that I would be giving a cafe in Gilbert five stars I would have told you you're crazy.  Folks, YOU CRAZY!!I was not expecting to be wowed by the unassuming uptown Romeo's Euro Cafe in Gilbert's little downtown district.  But it delivered and outdid itself.  After the painfully hard decision based on the huge and extensive menu, I ordered the Avocado Feta Pita ($7) and was BLOWN away by the taste. The inside of the pita revealed a sauteed melange of grilled turkey, avocado, feta and a special dressing.  I'm a huge fan of avocado, so I had an inkling I might like this - but I was a bit skeptical of the sauted part of this.  That's a bit too decadent and rich for my tastes. But I didn't care.  That's how freaking good this pita was.  I'm a dude and don't have hips or anything, but if bigger hips were a consequence for this, LAY IT ON BABY!!  Was it authentic Greek?  Not at all.  I would consider it more New American, with Mediterranean influences.It didn't stop there though.  My fellow eating partner ordered the Corinthian salad ($11), which looked mighty attractive I might add - and I don't care for salads at all.   It was gigantic and came appointed with grilled chicken, artichoke, hearts of palm, red peppers, mushroom, feat and capers in a Italian dressing.   Sounds pretty pedestrian until you see the size of the presentation and the veggies used (marinated mushrooms, for example).  Dessert was just as incredible.  That's what you first notice when you walk in the door, btw - the big glass counter full of freshly baked desserts - from cheesecakes to tarts, you name it they probably have it.   The apple strudel was a rather large portion, flaky and not too sweet.  But the runaway winner (that even the server agreed on) was the caramel kiss cheesecake - caramel marbled with dark chocolate.  The texture and taste outdid even the Cheesecake Factory. While lunch was pretty cheap and basically consists of pitas, burgers, subs and salads, the dinner menu is larger (chicken, seafood, Greek plates and pasta) and seems to run a bit higher at $15 - $20 for entrees.The space itself lives up to its name with marble tabletops and wrought iron chairs.   It feels very Euro and very cafe inside - with a decidedly boutique feel.  While it's not overly lady-like in here, it would be kind of uncomfortable for a casual everyday Joe used to steakhouses and burger joints. Good service despite the busy and brisk lunch time crowd.  Romeo's Euro Cafe is really out of the way for me but definitely worth going out of my way for.  I can't wait to return.5 stars? How about 6? 6.5?We had such an amazing experience here. The menu was massive but delicious. The service was fantastic. The deserts were mouthwatering. I can't say enough.The hubski and I went with a few friends last weekend. Lucas was our waiter and I swear I have never had better service in my life! My friend and I both ordered the spankophillo, which is a cross between spanakopita and pizza. Pictures will be posted shortly. Lucas advised us that the dish is very large and maybe we should split it (at the risk of lowering his tip by lowering the overall bill). We decided to get our own anyway. All meals came with soup or salad. The soup of the day was cream of asparagus, which I ordered. Perfect. The asparagus was obviously grilled before being creamed in the soup, and there was a smoky flavor to it. You could tell that it was made there and not just out of a bag like some places. It was also not microwaved.My main dish arrived. Lucas was right- it was ginormous. I stick by my decision to have my own. After my delicious soup, I only ate one small slice of the spankophilla in the restaurant. I would love to tell you that this monstrosity re-heats well, but I didn't get that far. Maybe I'll be a little less impatient next time. What can I say? I am impatient. It tastes better warm than hot. Its also great cold.Spankofilla? We've been spanked!My friend had the salad with her meal and she loved the yogurt dressing. He husband ordered the gyros and was told by our waiter that it is "the best sandwich in the country". And it was.Hubski ordered a tuna melt. If I thought my dish was huge... it came on a big Italian roll with slices of tomato and melted provolone cheese. It was $7. For this size and quality, we would have paid twice that.For dessert, because I saved room, I had a piece of the "Morning After" cake. It is a white sponge cake soaked in sangria... amazing. Our friends had the tiramisu, which was out of this world.On top of that, while hubski was drinking coffee, Lucas the magnificent was watching which kind of sugar he was using, so when he refilled the coffee, he brought a whole container of just raw sugar. He checked on us regularly, but was not on top of us. He had plenty of suggestions but was not in our faces, and he was just overall the best waiter I have ever had.Eight thumbs up. We'll be there again soon.This was on my 'To Try' list forever.  My wife and I finally got around to going and I was pleasantly surprised.  As soon as you enter, there is a tiny little gift shop.  Quaint, but not what I'm looking for in a restaurant.  Service was quick and polite.  We didn't wait too long for our food to arrive, and our drinks were always full.I got the Greek Salad, and I wasn't disappointed.  Strange, the salad didn't come with any leaves (i.e. lettuce, spinach, etc..)  It was more of a humongous plate of finely chopped vegetables in an outstanding oil-based dressing.Next time I go, I want to try one of their Gyros... They looked amazing!After spending most of Saturday grazing at various East Valley locations, who would have thought any of us could find more room to eat any more? Well, we did. And Romeo's was the perfect fit for topping us off. Instead of going with entrees, we opted for a few appetizers. Good, filling and flavorful.Afterwards, the desserts seemed to be a hit since their plates were nearly licked clean. (Since I'm not one to eat sweets, the cleanliness of a plate afterwards is the only gauge I have for such things.)Our server was the sweetest thing ever! I wanted to wrap her up and bring her home. But, that's frowned upon in certain societies.I had such high hopes for this place, especially after reading all of these great reviews and I was thoroughly disappointed. First of all, they request that you do not make any changes to their menu items - which is just nuts to me. I couldn't request that a salad NOT have mushrooms thrown on top for some reason....apparently it's too much trouble? Second of all, the one or two things I did find on the menu without mushrooms were salads and one didn't even come with lettuce. So I defaulted to another salad and it came how it came - which was pretty bad. The dressing had no flavor whatsoever, and the salad as a whole was just boring. Iceberg lettuce, red pepper, and artichoke hearts...that's it! Now, my coworkers all loved their meals so I may give them another shot, but it's not likely. Any place that doesn't let you modify your order is just not a place I want to go.Euro Cafe used to be in Mesa across from Fiesta Mall.We LOVED the pizza and the fries.Then they closed. :(So, when we saw they had re-opened in Gilbert, we got rather excited. :)Then we went to the new Gilbert location. :(They have no pizza oven, so without our favorite menu item, we were forced to start trying the other pricey items in their large but restrictive menu. Over several visits it's all been fine, but nothing's been great. On our last visit, we tried the spinach-ball appetizer thing, and there was some strong herb or something that tasted almost like chlorine. We got through most of 1 (out of 5) ball, then asked the server to take it away. They didn't offer to replace it with anything else.When our bill came, the appetizer was still on there and it was like pulling teeth to get them to take it off. They finally did, but this last experience left such a bad taste in our mouth (both literally and figuratively) that we won't be coming back.Ambiance: 3 (too small, but there are some cute things in their shop area)Restrooms: 2 (outside with a key - lame)Food: 3 (no substitutions and much of it is overpriced)Service: 2 (often understaffed, weird with food issues)If you feel you still must go, get the fries appetizer - still pretty dang good.An interesting place theme-wise - quaint, crowded. As the name suggests, european in both look and feel. A bit fussy somehow. Huge menu. I really liked the pasta salad I ordered - huge portion as previously mentioned. However afterwards I couldn't help thinking, damn, I could do this myself at home! It inspired me to explore vinagrettes in general and eat more vegetables which is a good thing. And I was right about being able to make the dressings. BTW, walmart has this new thing called a multi-mixer which is great for making (and storing) your own vinagrettes at home. Check out epicurious. But I digress. To wrap up, huge menu, ok to good food, mostly high prices especially on dessert items. I took home the peanut butter cheesecake but was not impressed with it. Plus it was about $6 a slice. The case definitely beckons but I wouldn't fall to temptation there again.Also notably, the wait staff was slow, unresponsive and not particularly friendly even though there was only one other couple in the whole restaurant. Maybe they've been told to be that way in line with the European theme??? just kidding but it does make one wonder..."WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE"I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS on places but this one had to be done. My wife and I have travelled many places and eaten at many restaurants. We go out to eat every weekend and when we like a place we tell everyone about it and go back many times. My experience with Romeo's was so shocking, rude and offensive I could not not post my review.This was our 4th time going to Romeos in the last 3 months since reading about them in the paper of how great their desserts were. My wife and I love desert cafe's and Romeo's had a large selection. The first time we went we each got dessert and liked what we got. The 2nd time we went with freinds for dinner and thought it was pretty good. The menu is so huge it took us 20 minutes to order as we couldn't decide on what to eat. The 3rd time we went for desert with 10 people from my office. The final and 4th time we went which was on Friday was litteraly the worst experince of my life. 3 out of 4 times we went we alaways had the same waitress who I am assuming now is the owner. (I did not get her name).We came once again for dessert and my wife and her sister spent about 20 minutes trying to decide on what to order. They went to the restroom for a bit and then came back. They had ordered a piece of white cake, baklava cheesecake and some fudgy pie cake thing. The cheesecake was pretty good, the fudgy thing was decent although at 5.50 was extremely small and the white cake thing was terriable. It was dry and basically no flavor. We all tried it and left basically 3/4 of the cake.When the bill came it was 3 pieces of cake and tax. I told our waitress that I did not wish to pay for the piece of white cake as we did not think it was good and dry. She just looked at us and walked into the back of the restaurant and told the lady that had helped us the 3 times in the past.THIS IS WHERE IT GETS SHOCKING:The waitress (owner) came over to our table and said I was told you didnt like something you ordered. I proceeded to tell her that we would pay for the other items but didnt think the white cake was good as it was to dry. She then proceeded to pick up the plate with my fork on it. I knew what she was going to do and sat there in shock. She litteraly cut a piece off the cake and ate it and said "there is nothing wrong with this cake, it is not dry". I told her I cannot believe you just did that. She said I am not going to take this off of the bill just because you didnt like it. She then asked me and my brother in law if we owned our own businesses which we do both happen to do. She then walked away from our table.As we all sat there in SHOCK I said I am not paying for that cake. I left $11 in cash which was 2 cakes and tax and walked out. My wife, sister in law and her husband stayed in the restaurant. The waitress then came back to the table and said so you just are not going to pay for the food. They again told her they would pay for it all but that piece of cake. She then proceeded to say to my sister in law out loud to the whole restaurant. "Are you not the one who was just in the bathroom throwing up" trying to make her look stupid in front of the other patrons. At this they left the money on the table - minus the cake money and walked out.What was this person thinking? We estimated that this piece of cake cost them .80 to make. Was it really worth the amount of lost business they will be recieving? The least she should have done was to offer us something to replace this piece of cake with or just offered to remove the charge from the bill. Besides the 12 other people we told to come to this restaurant who will never go again. How many people will they tell.Like I said I never post reviews but this experience to me was so shocking I couldnt not leave a review.They don't make substitutions, actually they won't even leave off a piece of cheese because as the waiter told me"The menu is exactly as the chef wants it."when I replied I had food allergies I was given a smug response "No, we don't do substitutions."again I asked if I could have something without cheese. He said "no" and walked away from the table.Then some fussy lady walked over and told me very loudly  "no substitutions!"I walked out embarrassed. The staff are rude, obnoxious and classless.I often use extremes in my reviews...."best service" or "worst logo"...you get the idea. Unfortunately, I'm not concerned about overusing superlatives in this review. Instead, eating at Euro Cafe turned out to just be weird. Like seriously weird.We walked into the cutesy gift shop/waiting area (think LGO for old ladies) and we were greeted by a very chipper young teenage hostess with whom we had some fun, pleasant banter. I was thinking....hmm, this place should be cool. Before we sat down, I glanced over to the large dessert case, which--from my friend's recommendations--was likely to be the highlight of the visit, and I was a bit surprised to see that it was half-empty. And this was at 7pm on a Saturday night.I wasn't too worried, though. Our server seemed great at first. She actually just sat down at our table and talked all about the menu with us....she was very helpful and made a couple of recommendations. She proceeded to take our drink orders, for me a glass of the Malbec and, for my dining companion, a vanilla latte. We had to re-try on the wine because they were out of the Malbec, but no big deal, right? Our drinks arrived, and she asked us if we had decided on our entrees.This was when her attitude got a bit weird and pushy. We told her what entrees we wanted, but before we could even tell her that we also wanted to try an appetizer, she jetted away from the table. If I may add, she left the table grabbing my companion's latte without asking if she was finished (she still had about 10% of the drink she wanted to enjoy).The server then brought our salads. Their salad is a nice, standard mixed greens and I ordered the yogurt dressing which was quite nice. We finished our salads, and being the good former server I am, I placed our plates--along with my fork--in a small pre-bussed stack on the side of our table. My friend asked me if I thought they would want me to re-use my fork, and I replied "I'm not planning on eating a $20 entree with a re-used fork". Note: I'm aware that $20 isn't like haute cuisine pricing, but I mean I just don't think you should have to lick the dressing off of  a salad fork to eat your entree at that price point. What happened next was very weird. The waitress stopped by, saw my dirty fork on top of my pre-bussing pile, then proceeded to--while I sat there perfectly still and silent--take my dirty fork off of my salad plate and move it over to my place setting next to my clean knife. Weird.Then our entrees came. Well, they were really tossed at us more than anything. She dropped the pork tenderloin in front of me and the almond tortellini in front of my friend, which is especially odd since the server had made such a big deal about me being a vegetarian. I'm not surprised, though. I had--just five minutes earlier--seen a full-on food auction at the table next to us because the server had no idea who ordered what. Anyway, back to our food. Our server just dropped the food and walked away before we could say anything....not asking "does everything look ok" or "is there anything else I can get for you". Of course, it wasn't the end of the world for us to have to switch our plates, it was just really weird.The good news is that my Almond Tortellini was amazing. It was full of fun surprises like sunflower seeds and pine nuts, and the sauce was heavenly. The tortellini were the perfect texture and consistency. My dining companion ordered the tenderloin, and although I couldn't try any of it, I couldn't help but notice that the amount of sawing it required to cut off a bite was more reminiscent of a pork chop than a tenderloin. In spite of the dryness of the meat,  it looked to be a nice balance of flavors, with a cherry sauce, grilled onions, and horseradishy mashed potatoes. The odd service continued, though. No one ever checked back to ask about the food, and when my friend's water went empty it was a full 8 1/2 minutes for the hostess to finally come by and refill it. Even more odd was that once we had clearly finished our entrees, it was a long time before anyone came by to take away our plates. It was 18 minutes between our last bite and when our server came back (yes, I was keeping track by now, because the whole thing was just so odd). She offered dessert, but by this time, we both just wanted to leave, so we asked for the check.When she brought back the check and my card, she suddenly was miss personality, telling us how glad she was that we came and how much she looks forward to seeing us again. Honestly, I wish she had been so helpful when we were actually still having our meal.Overall, the environment at this restaurant is just plain weird and uncomfortable. I would love to eat the Tortellini again, but if the price for enjoying that great dish is sitting through another hour of awkwardness in this restaurant, I'll just have to go withoutWalked here after having dinner at Liberty Market, since I couldn't have any of the desserts offered there.  After the friendly and very helpful female host helped to phone the pastry chef to address my food allergies, I placed my order of a slice of "Dangerous Dilemma" and a chocolate-covered walnut strudel and was seated at a two-top next to a window with a view of a parking lot.  I decided to while away the wait on the dessert by looking at the baubles on display by the entrance.  A few moments later, the host notified me that the strudel had cornstarch, so it's a no-no for me, and that  I would not be able to dine inside since I should not have been seated with an "outside drink."  "Would this be a problem?," she asked. I said no, paid for my to-go dessert, and settled on a bench outside the cafe.  While the two forkfuls that I tried of the multi-layered dense cake (cookie crumb bottom layer, dark chocolate fudge cake, white chocolate mousse, another layer of dark chocolate fudge cake, and then topped with raspberry coulis) were delicious, I inadvertently became the meal of ghost mosquitoes (so I had to pack up and leave, yet again).  All because I had a lidded to-go cup of Liberty Market drip house coffee with me.The $6.54 (tax included) cake slice was tasty (although almost a bit too sweet), and I can't fault someone for following house rules, but I wished my drink could've been overlooked.  (There were only two occupied tables out of 12 to 15 tables.) Heck, I could've ordered a glass of wine, or another cup of coffee, with my dessert had I not been turned away...My wife and I tried the Euro Cafe this weekend. Place is small and quaint with a huge dessert display case in the entrance and looks amazing! We were greeted by friendly hostess and servers and were excited to give it a try.Received our menus. All I can say is WOW -- overwhelming. Although many items seemed to share similar ingredients, it's extremely difficult to do that large of a menu well -- especially in such a small restaurant. We got even more nervous when we saw one of the staff walk right through the dining area with a large bag of frozen stuffed pasta to the kitchen. This happened again later with something else, but I couldn't see what was in the bag. Not sure if they are making trips to the grocery store or they have a walk-in in a different area of the building, but it wasn't very professional and was an indicator of what was to come. Anyways, the food. Well it looked nice and was a large portion but it went downhill from there. Both entrees seemed like a confusing jumble of flavors and textures overwhelmed by the different marinated/flavored ingredients that made up the dishes. In both cases, the protein (shrimp, chicken) tasted like they were boiled or poached and had little flavor. Anyways, maybe we just ordered the wrong things. But to be honest I won't take the chance again to find the better ones. Maybe the chef/owner needs to reduce his menu by 50-75% and concentrate on what works well. Its pretty hard to do 100 menu items (my estimate) without compromising.BE ADVISED:  A group of 4 employees where I work and some vendors that took them to The Euro Cafe in dowtown Gilbert were diagnosed with food poisoning just last week.  A few have been treated at the hospital, while others are home fighting through it.   VERY SERIOUS - the proper authorities were notified and are collecting data of everyone affected for the department of health.
Bravi Tuscan Kitchen=I don't get to Glendale very often... but I headed over to Bravi for a tweet-up this afternoon, and I ended up staying a bit after to get some work done.  The restaurant is located in a newer looking shopping center off of Union Hills and 59th Avenue.  The service was fine and the restaurant itself was clean and welcoming.  I saw there were a handful of people dining outside on the patio while I was there... I can't be too critical since all I had was a Mediterranean Salad (to-go) and a diet coke (with a few refills).  Jared and I had the salad along with an acorn squash and baked cod for dinner... and it was fresh, enough for both of us, and A-ok in my book!  Will I rush back? No.  But the rest of the menu looks appealing and if I am ever in Glendale seeking somewhere to get some grub or a glass of wine, I'd gladly return.
Cortez Room=It's been about seven years since I've been here and not much has changed.  We met a friend from Toronto who was in town for 2 weeks for bridge tournaments and gaming.  This is one of the places he hits up every time he comes to Las Vegas.We had reservations for 5:30--not needed as it turned out--but there were more people there than I had expected.  We were quickly seated, brought menus, and our drink order was delivered.  We then ordered and the server split the order into two checks as we requested.My wife ordered the Chicken Cortez and Jack and I each ordered prime rib.  Each dinner comes with soup or salad and choice of starch.  I got potato leek and a baked potato.  I asked for my prime rib to be blue and the server said very rare to which I nodded.  We also ordered a side of scalloped corn with prosciutto to share.Bread was brought to the table along with two plates of pastry piped butter.  There didn't appear to be any difference in taste among the three.  The lavash was not as flavorful as some I've had and the pretzel roll was somewhat dry.  It seemed like the bread was a little on the old side.The soup was good.  One of the bus people came to grind fresh pepper which was a bonus.  There was a good separation between courses so we could chat and catch up with what our friend had been up to since we saw him a few months before.Our mains arrived.  The prime rib was red as I wanted and Jack's was a medium rare which was what he ordered.  Andrea's chicken was, well chicken with cheese melted on top and some avocado.  My baked potato was large but needed a bit more baking time.  I got the normal accoutrements--butter and sour cream and the waiter left extra horseradish if we wanted to charge up the creamy horseradish served with the prime rib.  All three of us liked our meals.  The scalloped corn was very good.  Creamed corn with lots of cheese baked until the light bread crumb top was browned.For dessert, I got carrot cake which was quite good.The Cortez Room is OK.   Service was OK if not a bit nonchalant.  The price was good because the casino had mailed a BOGO to my wife and we used points to pay the balance.  For the price of gratuity, we had dinner for two.  The A-OK rating is apropos  because while nothing stands out about the whole evening, the food was OK and done the way we wanted.This place is hit or miss! Some nights the service is great and the food is perfect...other nights its terrible service and average food. I have tried every cut of steak that they offer and I will say that their best piece of meat is their Prime Rib and New York.The seafood is good...I typically get the lobster tails or the Alaskan Crab Legs. I would say that their biggest let down is the older woman at the front desk...she seems very lazy and is EXTREMELY SLOW!
Buffet Roundtable=I write this review not so much as a judicial examination of the palatableness of the meal I had here last weekend, but rather as an urgent public service announcement meant to warn potential customers of the gastronomical suckerpunch they stand to receive should they make the mistake of eating at this wretched trough of culinary embarrassments.My meal was quite possibly the worst meal I have ever paid money for. And please, do not for one moment, think that is hyperbole.Below is a brief list of the sufferings I endured at brunch on Thursday morning.Omelet bar? Not exactly. Instead all the egg choices were fabricated in some sort of Omeleton 5000 device which creates strange semi-circle discs of "cooked" egg. In execution these abominations were really more akin to salmonella Hot Pockets with the outside cauterized into a leathery shell and the inside a viscous snot pocket of uncooked egg. Not even wrapping them in a tortilla, slathering them with cheese, salsa and sour cream could even save these leatherback puke pouches.Alright then, eggs are a pass. Let's move onto the pork products. You can't mess up pork products, right?Good god, yes you can apparently.The sausages were finger-length vessels of fail wrapped around latex-strength casings. To fully understand how it felt to cut one of these things I recommend you take a Robusto sized cigar and attempt to cut it crosswise into one inch segments. I think I used to make log cabins out of these things when I was a child.Terrible bacon? A statement like that should be nothing more than an oxymoron, or perhaps an ironic band name. But seriously, how do you fuck up bacon? It was more like tasteless crumbling wood chips. I'd just assume glue a bunch of Bacos together and eat that instead.Next I thought that perhaps the French Toast would make amends for the pillaging my taste buds have already incurred. Nope, the pillaging continued as I tried futilely to cut a bite-sized piece of the eggy bread bricks with my knife and fork. The slices were so tough that they actually resisted the maple syrup I had drenched them with. You know, the French have a version of their eponymously named bread called, "Pain perdu". Now, while the word, "pain" is certainly a poignant way to describe eating one of these Rubbermaid breakfast sponges, I really feel the best way to describe the Roundtable Buffet's French Toast is to use the literal translation of "Pain perdu", "Lost Bread". Truly, this dish was a tragic loss indeed.In the end I settled on a bowl of cottage cheese, an unpeeled orange and some pith-heavy grapefruit slices. For the next half hour I nursed a cup of (serviceable) coffee while my stomach curdled, whimpered and bubbled in discontent.Before we left however, my friends and I made one final gruesome discovery. The meatballs.Having arrived during brunch a small number of the buffet stations were serving luncheon fare. As almost a sort of macabre experiment to attain absolute certainty that the Roundtable Buffet at the Excalibur was the worst dining experience found on "The Strip", my friend brought back a small sampling from the Italian station. On his plate lie a minute serving of penne pasta with a meaty marinara sauce and a single, innocent looking meatball. A Tuscan inspired amuse-bouche perhaps? No. More like a vomi-bouche, or even, an amuse-fail. The meatball positively reeked. My friend couldn't eat more than a thumbnail-sized sliver before pushing the plate away in disgust. His wife, upon catching a whiff of the plate, rather insistently demanded that it be removed from the table. Somewhere in the distance I'm sure I heard a wolf howl.To those who claim, "You get what you pay for!" I call bullshit. I consistently eat far superior meals for well under $14.00 every week. The fare here in inexcusable; the fact that we waited in line before entering is baffling.So, to all the lords and ladies staying at the Excalibur, I say the following. Should you be swept up in the medieval theme that surrounds you at the Excalibur, please know that bravery is not attained at the Roundtable, only food poisoning.Tom: "hey honey, what are you girls doing?"Me: "looking for a buffet. hows the one at excalibur? i got a coupon for buy one get one free. is it worth checking out?"Tom: "OMG THAT IS THE BEST ONE GO GO GO"Me. "..oh. ok."I'm actually quite surprised that this buffet has such a low ranking, I really didn't mind it and my boyfriend was super jealous when he found out I was going.First off, check your coupon books that you get when you check in (most hotels do this, or if you ask can get you one). I stayed at the Luxor and had a buy one buffet get one free, so for me and my girlfriend it worked out great! It was $17 for the both of us at lunch and we came at the perfect time. We got there at about 345, so they charged us for lunch, but put out the fresh dinner foods right at 4, so we basically got a whole ton of stuff for not a lot. Pretty awesome. And by awesome, I'm talking fresh crab, fresh shrimp, fresh, carved to order prime rib, and because we were there on st. patrick's day there was corned beef and cabbage. aw, that's sweet.There was an entire alley of soda machines, tons of food, pretty decent price, and a dessert-ed island (see what I did there?)Overall I had a great time, had a ton of pretty decent food and I'm happy with it all. I'd definitely do the same thing where I go in have a salad then chow down on some dinner food but hey, that's just me. I like to hustle.WOW, this buffet has really gone downhill ever since the last time I was here, which was a couple of years ago. The first time I was here, everything was flawless. But now, a lot of the dishes were mostly bland and mediocre. The only thing good here were the desserts.
T-Bones Chophouse=We had a little left on a Station Casino gift card and a weluvlocals.com coupon which made this a very reasonably priced dinner for us. I really like the atmosphere and style of the restaurant itself. The big fireplace on the left side makes it feel cozy, the high ceilings and their outdoor bar is the best place to have a beverage or 7 in all of Red Rock. I noticed a lot of complaints about the prices in other Yelp reviews. Here are some ways to keep dinner under some kind of budget: 1. Skip the appetizers completely. Let's be honest. There's nothing you haven't had before here. Crab cakes, caprese salad, oysters, shrimp cocktail..zzzzzzzzzzzzz. And there's no way they'll do it better than your favorite place anyways. The bread is good enough here if you're starving. Plus you're at a freakin steakhouse for chrissakes! I for one always end up getting tons of things boxed up since the portions are so big. Why stuff yourself with pricey and meh things? 2. Go with the Chateaubriand for $99. Its a complete dinner for 2 and it comes with a rainbow of roasted vegetables and potatoes. That means you don't need to pay for $10 side dishes. On a side note, it continually blows my mind how any steakhouse charges $10+ for steamed asparagus. Good god! I want them to at least work a little bit on the damn vegetable. Grill it!! Sautee it!! Show me the chef put some elbow grease into it. It's simply wrong on principle alone to spend that much on steamed anything unless it's a whole fish. Like any real restaurant that serves Chateaubriand, they will cook the beef tenderloin table-side, carve it and plate it in front of you. Its like the soft rock music of steak to teppenyaki's heavy metal. The presentation could also be potentially semi-impressive if you're on a first date. Just throwing that out there. The tenderloin itself is good enough and enjoyable. No way can it compare to some other places in town but it still makes for a nice steak dinner. 3. You could also keep it cheap for dessert by going to the Grand Cafe or Ben and Jerry's in the food court. Neither of which we did since we were so stuffed from the entree but there's another suggestion. I would only come back here for a proper dinner if I had a significant discount. There are too many other cows in the sea.I went here last night and was really disappointed in the whole experience vis à vis the price and the surroundings.  First, it's a beautifully done restaurant with a nice gas fireplace and elegant surroundings.  That comes with a fatal error.  There is a glass wall that separates this lovely dining room from the bar and several large TVs all tuned to basketball.  Can't you put some drapes on the glass and keep the dining room a dining room?  One other thing, it would be nice if you used real candles instead of those cheap plastic battery operated ones.  Goodness knows your profit margin on each steak would allow that.As for the food, it is very over-priced.  Total bill for 1 person before tip was just under $80.  That was for 1 iced tea, a bowl of French onion soup, an 8 ounce filet mignon, a side of fingerling potatoes cooked in duck fat with thyme, and chocolate bread pudding.  That's it.The bread basket had a nice selection with a slice each of olive, raisin, and sourdough bread, a pretzel roll, and one lavash.  The onion soup was standard.  It wasn't a rich tasting broth but standard.  My server didn't understand "blue" so I said black and blue and then he responded with Pittsburgh style, and I said yes.  The steak was more medium rare than extra rare as it should have been.  The potatoes were much ado about little.  The bread pudding was excellent.  Service was quite good with several people seeing to more iced tea or checking on my dinner.I recently had a 5 course chef's tasting menu at a steakhouse at a Strip hotel and it was only a few dollars more and it included an 8 pounce American Wagyu filet.  I guess my expectations for t-Bones were simply too high.  It just doesn't produce a meal that merits the prices they charge.  It's a shame when you walk away from a pricey dinner and you remember the bread basket and the dessert.I should have listened to Holly!Over the past 4 years, I've been here numerous times for a variety of occasions (a date, business dinner, birthday celebration).  The service is fantastic, the setting and decor devine...but the food just doesn't stack up against better known steakhouses, and with virtually the same price point.  The location inside the Red Rock Hotel makes it an easy-peasy, no hassle, off-strip choice...might be the only reason to choose it (especially, if your staying at the hotel, or if convenient to Summerlin residents).  For me, having an appetizer or a drink at the inside bar, or better yet -- the beautiful outdoor bar with a firepit, large sofas and chairs -- is absolutely terrific.  For the main course, I'd take my business elsewhere.A tip for parking is to valet park on the backside, the hotel entrance, with just a short walk thru the hotel lobby and either up the stairs (passing the outstanding chandelier), or 1 floor up in the elevator...takes you right to the T-Bones entrance.T-Bones is a beautiful place and elegant place.  I was thrilled to be invited to dinner there, since I'd never been.  First, the good:  the bread might be up there with the best bread I've had in Vegas in the 10+ years I've been here.  Maybe it's an East Coast thing, but I like bread with a crunchy crust, and this had it in spades.From the beginning to the end:  the crème brûlée was outstanding.But man (or woman, in this case) cannot live by bread and dessert alone, though I wish I could.  I would have been content with both of those.  My appetite was whetted by the beautiful, jumbo shrimp sitting atop ice in a huge bowl brought to our table.  While they looked great, nothing about their taste was remarkable.  They were just THERE.  And as soon as the shrimp were whisked away, the waiters started to remove the bread basket and bread plates of all the others at my table.  I caught them in time; when there's good bread I save a bite for the end of my meal.  Did I play hooky from etiquette class the day they taught this topic?A very ordinary Caesar's salad was followed by what should have been the raison d'être of a steak joint:  the steak.  Mine was a petite filet.  It looked like it was cooked just the way I liked it, i.e., medium rare.  Somehow it didn't taste that way.  Actually, it didn't taste like much of anything.  I'm not a huge steak aficionado to begin with, and this one didn't do anything to change my mind.  If I had paid the menu price of $43, I sure would have been ticked.  The green beans were just about raw.  Lots of folks like 'em that way.  I am not one of them.  The mashed potatoes were eminently skippable.  My husband had the salmon, which came out as a thick slab.  It wasn't as rare as it should be, but he likes it well done, so he had no complaints about that.  But it, too, wasn't flavorful, unless you count the excessive amount of salt on the top, almost a salt crust.  Ix-nay on the salmon, too.  We've had great salmon, and this wasn't it.If we were on our own dime, we would have been sorely disappointed.  Instead, we were just disappointed.
Brazilian Bull Steakhouse=Wow...this was absolutely the worst dinning experience of our lives.  (This wasn't our first Brazilian Steakhouse)We called before to see if they took reservations.  The girl who answered the phone was clueless.  She didn't know the answer so we just asked how long the wait was since we were only about 30 minutes away.  She started rambling about seating us maybe at table 30 or table 36 and then just paused for about 30 seconds.  She finally said there would be no wait.When we got there, after a few minutes we were seated.  We waited about 5 minutes and then our waiter came by and said, "Hi, how are you doing?  Have you been....Oh, hold on, this table was here first." And then he turned around and started helping a table across from us that actually just sat down!!  (They had 6 people so he probably expected a larger bill)  After another 5 minutes with them, he came back to us and we ordered water and he explained that we turn the block to red when we're eating salad bar and to green when we want meat.  We got our salad from the salad bar. (Best part of the meal but it was still very average in our opinion)  After another 5 minutes we asked one of the server assistants for our water and for some bread that comes with all the meals.  It took another 3-4 minutes after that before they brought our water.  No bread.  We got seconds on our salad bar and came back to the table.  At that time, we decided we wanted to start trying some meat with our salad bar items.  I flipped over the block to green.  The waiter came by and flipped BACK over the block and said "NO, you're not ready!" and kept on walking by!!  We we're floored by his response, if they wanted us to wait until the sides came they could have said it more tactfully.  A few minutes later we pushed our salads to the side and flipped over our block again to show we wanted our sides and meat.  They brought over our sides (rice, beans, fried bananas, and a few other things).  Still no bread, we asked again.  They brought it a few minutes later.  So I put some rice and beans on my plate and waited for meat.  They brought by our option of meat and put it on our plates (we accepted every meat they brought by).  I started eating and took a bite of my rice.  I felt something stringy in my mouth and proceeded to pull out a long, blond hair.  We were disgusted.  I waited for our waiter to come by but after 5 minutes he didn't show up.  Finally, a meat server came by and we asked him to get our waiter.  He came by and I showed him the hair, he asked for it and examined it.  He then looked at us and said that no one in the kitchen has blonde hair...inferring it wasn't from them.  My wife and I both have brunette hair so we knew it wasn't ours.  He took away the rice and my plate and they brought by new rice and plates a few minutes later.  (No apologies at this time)  I didn't care for rice now and really wanted to try some more meat.  I waited for about 7-8 minutes until the next person came by with meat.  They put a small portion on our plates and walked away (never asked if we wanted more or a larger piece - none of the meat servers do this and they all give tiny pieces).  I ate that piece in 2 bites and waited again.  This became a pattern.  It was usually about 10 minutes between meats.  (Shouldn't be this way)  We mentioned this to our server and he said okay and walked away.  After another 30 minutes and only 2 more pieces of meat (one was pineapple) we said we had enough.   It was extremely frustrating looking around for someone to bring you meat and having to wait 10 minutes between bites.  We told the waiter we were finished.  They brought by dessert but after our experience we passed.  A few minutes passed and he dropped the check on our table and said "sorry bout the hair" and walked away.  We expected to see a discounted tab, however it was for the full amount of $65.  He came back by and we asked to speak to a manager.  He walked over to one, talked for a bit and then came back and said no manager was available, but "I am available".  We told him how unhappy we were with the experience and that we didn't believe we should have to pay this enter amount.  He then asked "Did you both eat? You both ate food so you have to pay."  We again explained how unhappy we were and brought up everything that happend.  He said there was nothing he could do.  We asked to speak to a manager.  He said no, there was nothing they could do.  We asked again and he got one. The manager walks over (and guess what, she had long blond hair) after we explained the evening, she rudely asked if the waiter saw the hair, then she said that they had people out and it was too busy, and then said they couldn't do anything about our tab.  We argued and they finally took half off.The reason why we are so upset was the customer service.  Places can have off nights, hair falls in food, but the way they handled it was absolutely pathetic.  SAVE YOUR $. DON'T GO HERE!Dinner. This visit was premeditated. I fasted for most of the day and abandoned the health-conscious mentality. My stomach was stirring up mixed feelings prior to the long drive to this place, due to some who did, or did not like Fogo E Brasa. Thoughts: 1) hope the drive is worth it, and 2) being challenged by hungerSo, arrived around 8ish, snooped around the salad bar while slyly checking out the meats in the kitchen. Salad bar was alright... you can have potato or pasta salad any day, so I skipped that. The fresh calamari looked appetizing, but it seemed as if everybody had picked out all the "good" parts. I think it was scallop ceviche, or some shellfish ceviche... it was good. But again, the good parts had been captured. Were served sides of rice, beans, pico de gallo, and breaded bananas. I thought I would enjoy the slightly carmelized, fried plantains that I'm used to, but unfortunately, not here. Onto to the M E A T.  And, into my intestines, still slowly digesting: ham, chicken enveloped in bacon, barbecue chicken, sausage (slightly dehydrated, but okay), trip tip, garlic steak (hm... this thing was tough, and will ignore next time), sirloin, prime rib, and lamb (favorite, prepared well- tender, pink middle, familiar aroma).Whoa, and you would think, after those generous cuts of meat, I'd be done. Not quite yet. Of course, you need to round it out with something to cleanse the palate. So, behold the cart of desserts. I chose the tiramisu, and I guess the gal sensed my hungry eyes, and gave me a large piece of this tiramisu. It was good tiramisu, but I couldn't taste the undertones of rum. I'll have to say I've had better. I consumed copious amounts of water thanks to the attentive waiters. Also had some red, and capirinha to aid the flow of food in system, and lilliputian-sized espresso to end the night. Now, I'm just feeling all sorts of lethargy and other things that prevent me from being productive. My initial thoughts were tended. I'll drive here again, and the food did, indeed conquer me. I won't be hungry for days.I had always wanted to go to a restaurant like this where they serve the meat to your right at your table and you have such a big variety of choices.  The service was very quick, almost as soon as we had turned our little signal to say that we were ready for food, someone was coming out with a fresh skewer of meat.  All of the servers were very friendly as well.The food itself was good but not great.  Some varieties of meat were very very salty, others were great.  Luckily they come around with all the different meats multiple times so you can figure out which ones you like and want more of.I would suggest saving some room for dessert though as there is a multi-tiered cart of different delicious choices.  I tried the Tiramisu and it was some of the best I've had.I can honestly say, eating here was the worst dining experience I have ever had. I've been to worse places. I've dealt with worse service. But bundle together the entire experience of the evening and top it with the hefty price tag for a bow and you've got something you would wish on nobody.I had high hopes for this place, really I did. I recall going for lunch a couple of times when they were Fogo E Brasa, and they were very good. Something changed. We saw our server (who turned out to be the manager...) only once, meaning no drink refills. The person bringing the meats around could best be describe as a "meat pusher"; he would butt his way into our conversations, mumble what he had, then start sawing, without asking if we wanted any. The meat was inconsistently bad... I saw everything from overcooked to the point of burning, to something that looked like it was in the pan for no more than 15 seconds. Add to that an apparent total lack of seasoning and you get a rather unappetizing meal.For this lovely experience, we were charged $31 each, not including any drinks or desserts. This is the first time I honestly considered walking out on a check. I will never be returning here, and am making sure to spread the word of just how bad that dinner was. I actually went to Applebees afterward to get some better food in me. Yes, Applebees was better.We came here for dinner the other night and we weren't overly impressed and, honestly, I'm quite surprised by some of the higher reviews. The atmosphere was fine; low lighting, decently decorated, but it was much smaller than I had expected. It was also nearly empty when we first got there at 6pm.Service was decent; a couple of the servers were hard to understand but we got by. Now, I understand the whole concept of how the servers will keep coming with the meat  until you turn over the little colorful toy looking thing but it was a bit distracting to have a conversation when the servers are circling around you and interrupting. Maybe it would be better to just bring out a dish of the samplings and if you want more then you could ask for it.The salad bar was...okay. It wasn't anything to rave about. I tried a sampling of six different salads; mushrooms, tilapia and tomatoes, chicken salad, egg salad, crab salad, and garbanzo bean salad. Of the six I thought two of them were good; chicken salad and egg salad.After we finished with the salads they started bringing in the meats. Again, we thought they were okay. The beefs were definitely way better than the others. I liked the prime rib, the sirloin, and the fillet, however they were a bit over cooked for my taste but they were seasoned well and moist. Although, the sausage was dry, the ham was so-so, the pork chop was completely dried out, the lamb I didn't care for, and the piece of rib I got didn't really have any meat on it.They also brought rice, beans, some other sauce, and a small dish of fried banana's. I didn't try the beans or whatever the sauce was but I did try the rice. It was plain, nothing exciting, plus it was slightly undercooked; I got a few crunchy pieces. The fried banana's were really good though.We had the flan for dessert, it was actually really good. Keep in mind though, flan is pretty easy to make, but it was tasty.I think that it's a great concept and would be an enjoyable experience if the quality was better. While I'm glad we at least tried it, because it's always good to try something new, I doubt we'll ever be back. The price we paid wasn't worth it. Unless they lowered their price to $20 a person, I probably wouldn't come back. I think it would be a better idea to take your money to one of your favorite steakhouses.Now I was going to give this restaurant a 2, maybe 3, star rating however, after reading other reviews and seeing how the manager of Brazilian Bull responded to negative reviews I changed it to a 1 star rating. Tip to the manager: if you want people to return after a bad experience, being rude, disrespectful and extremely defensive is not the way to do it. Being argumentative and trying to prove a point won't help your restaurant and you should keep in mind "word of mouth" is a powerful tool. Learn some customer service and common courtesy.
Social House=Crazy that some people are giving this place 2 or 3 stars...!!Social House was a real highlight of my recent trip to Vegas.  Terrific service (thank you, Louis), great ambience, good and stiff drinks, amazing food, orgasmic desserts, and even FABULOUS coffee.  FIVE STARS ALL AROUND!  We went here based on the findings of our friend who was buying us dinner (thanks a million, Rob!), and it's a memory I will treasure for a long, long time.  (Photos of some of the food uploaded.... well, when I remember to take photos, as I was busy chowin'!)We started with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno.  Thin, delectable slivers of hamachi, topped with a crispy-fried slice of jalapeno, doused in a very tasty sauce.  At a whopping $17, it is rather pricey but a very interesting and tasty dish.  The Tuna Tataki Spicy Ponzu was also excellent.  The Gyoza with Spicy Ponzu was out of this world - fried perfectly and full of taste.  YUM.  Their cod dish was good but a little bland, though fresh and well-prepared and presented.What was exhilarating was their Tamarind Short Ribs.WOW.WOW...WOWWWWW!!!  Their curry fried rice with vegetables was very light and flavorful.  I did not try many of their nigiri - but the few that I did try were very good to downright excellent.  I'm a firm believer that one must try the mackerel (saba) at each Japanese restaurant to decide just how good the place is - - and Social House's saba was seriously amongst the very best I have had.  Their rolls were decent - - but all we tried was a typical Spicy Tuna Roll, so perhaps that is not enough to fully comment on their sushi roll selections.On my next trip - I am not even going to bother with anything else - I'm going to these ribs, with a bowl of their rice.  The meat just fell off the bone, and the sauce that graced this dish was just heavenly.  What it consisted of, I cannot say, but the taste.... WOW.  This, and an order or two of their saba, and I won't care how much money I lose at the tables.  Amazing food.After dinner, Louis moved us out to the patio area which has a nice view of the Venetian Hotel across the street, as well as a direct view of the Treasure Island Pirate Show.  The weather was perfect, and the patio area is just beautifully done - - has a great feel to it, comfortable seating, and just a wonderful place to finish off a perfect dinner.  Then came the desserts.Now, I am not big on sweets.... but we ordered a chocolate cake, and something called "dough balls".  The chocolate cake was rich and was accompanied by several different sauces, or scoops of other fattening and really tasty stuff.  DEFINITELY WORTH IT.  But the dough balls..... they came out in a paper bag as promised, and was acccompanied by two sauces, one chocolate and the other vanilla.  You take a hot dough ball and dip into one of the sauces and bite into it.... and you swear, if this is your last meal on the planet, you'd die happy.  WOW.Then our server brought out our coffee.Holy Sh*t.  Best damn coffee I've had in Vegas, and hands down, there is no "Japanese" restaurant on this side of the planet that serves this type of coffee.  I could still be sitting there drinking my millionth cup and would not complain.  It was THAT good, and I am a real wench when it comes to good coffee....Social House is by no means "cheap" or even "moderately priced".  In fact, it's downright expensive, really, given the servings.  But based on taste/flavor alone - - it's worth it, and worth doing again and again, and again.  Perhaps it was the good company that added to my opinion of this restaurant, but I'd swear this was excellent food.  Service, once seated, was topnotch between Louis and Robert - - but I will add that the hostesses left something to be desired in terms of courtesy but not enough to affect my rating of this place.  We got Mojitos and Lychee-Tinis from the bar - - both were strong and excellent drinks.  Hit the spot.  :-)I don't much like Treasure Island as a hotel, and do not visit often, but guaranteed - as long as Social House remains inside this hotel, I will be back on each LV visit....Update Sept 07:And everytime I go back, this place exceeds my expectations again and again........ I LOVE SOCIAL HOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I had the prix fixe dinner here before the Mystere show.  Everything was fantastic!  And I am spoiled by all of the top notch sushi joints in the bay area.  This place could easily rival the best sushi anywhere.From start to finish, everything was top quality.  Especially the cod.  I wouldn't have ordered cod if it wasn't a choice on the prix fixe menu, but I'm glad I tried it.  My mouth is still watering as I think about how tender and tasty it was.Try the sparkling sake; you won't be disappointed if you like bubbles.  If you aren't a fan of the sparkling variety, there is an extensive list to choose something to your liking.So, why not 5 stars, Keeks?  Well, it's at TI, which means that you have to put up with that lame-ass Siren's cheesy hoochie fest with pirates while you eat.  If you can get a table away from the Pirates of the Caribbean meets raunchy Showgirls, then go for it.  Unless you are into that sort of thing.Being a Bachelorette rocks. Free drinks, free entry to clubs, everyone smiling at you and congratulating you. So that's why I hang out with so many of them... to reap the benefits, over and over. Social House did not disappoint! The evening couldn't have had a better start for our Bachelorette Party escapades. No longer located at Treasure Island, we were able to catch Social House during the first week of it's reopening in the swanky City Center next to Aria. The Manager stopped by our table to congratulate the beautiful bride-to-be and to offer shots for the table since we had the honor of being their first Bachelorette Party in their new location. Whoo! Donning pink tiaras, pink feather boas, and hoochie dresses, our six-pack of chicks got the party started knocking back choice cocktails and fancy sakes. Our super helpful waiter had tremendous patience explaining the menu to our drunk asses. We choose an assortment of sushi rolls, one of my favorites being the Crispy Kalbi Beef Roll. I was also digging the Sesame Kelp Salad. The specialty cocktails were eclectic and worldly, but I think next time I'll stay Asian instead of delving into the South American... their Pisco Sour 2.0 was interesting but I still prefer the traditional version over their take with hibiscus syrup. The Red Champagne was delicious, especially if you like sweet and bubbly. The winner of the night was the sparkling blueberry sake by the name of Star Rabbit. It came in a little blue bottle with a hot pink label... delicious and a perfect fit for the theme of the night. I think we killed about 3 bottles of that stuff. Since we couldn't bring ourselves to leave, we decided to order dessert as well. The Milk Chocolate Cake was a hit with the table, but the Coco-Nuts a bit too out there for our palates. Also, an arrangement of chocolate truffles was sent out to our party which ensured that we left with full bellies. After passing out "Hottest Jawline" and "Nicest Eyes" stickers to our waiter, other waiters, the manager, and busboy, we left Social House and continued on elsewhere with our Bachelorette festivities. Not without a quick romp in the fountain outside Aria... watch out for those Star Rabbits!!!3 words...Pulled Beef Fries!!! These were one of the delicious items on their happy hour menu and they were amazing. Perfectly cooked shoestring fries covered with pulled beef in an amazing slightly sweet and smoky sauce with wasabi creme fraiche...mind blowingly good!  There are also sushi, beer and sake specials. The service was fantastic and the restaurant is beautiful. I would make the 4 hour drive to Vegas just to get these fries again!Contemporary decor matched with diverse selection of  trendy, modern interpretations of Japanese food.  A great combination.The food is bold.  Flavors always pronounced.  No dish is overly delicate and it works perfectly in a social setting with good drinks and great friends.  It is a running theme at social house that you should be social.  Share your food.  Portions are large and with the exception of mains are plated to be shared.The cold starters are all very fresh.  Top props to the yellow tail. Each piece topped with a jalapeno slice, micro cilantro, a hint of garlic (garlic dust), and a tart but salty calamansi soy.  The subtle flavor of the fish is quickly lost but its texture is the perfect foil to the bold flavors.  The toro tartar is also worth a try.  Love the texture from the arare (Japanese rice crackers).The rock shrimp tempura starts the list of great hot dishes. Sweet shrimp surrounded by a fluffy yet crisp outside and served with a spicy ponzu dipping sauce.  Perfect with any drink.  The citrus peel miso cod in a lettuce cup is phenomenal.  Deeply infused miso flavor and a juicy peace of fish.  Add the sauteed foie to it and the richness will blow your mind.Sushi? The crispy eel, shrimp tempura, avocado, with a spicy aioli and teriyaki unagi sauce make for GREAT eats.Several visits and the food never disappoints.Service is very good and never intrusive.Although there is a good and fairly priced wine list,  its more fun sampling their cocktails and matching it with the food.Note: Sure you can dine here alone but that wouldn't that be antisocial?Recommended.I came here during a busy night and I do recommend getting recommendations since this is a place where parties tend to linger and drink.  I had two rolls the Kalbi Beef and Seared Albacore both of which were tasty but the Kalbi won out since it's not often I eat beef in a roll but I think the Kochuchang sauce really pulled it all together.  This place has a full bar and great sake menu.  It has great intimate lighting and can be loud but that helps keeps the conversation intimate and not have to listen to anyone else.  I've had a sit down dinner and spent time at the bar with friends and enjoyed both, if you're in Crystals and want a fun place this is a great stop while window shopping.I love "family style" Japanese restaurants. Even though "family style" may remind you of Bucca Di Beppo, I assure you this is nothing like that!  Let's break it down for you... order a plethora of items and dig in! I love when you can trust a server to pick out the best items and just let them go for it!  We just told them a price point per person we wanted to stick with and off he went.  Honestly, for $60 per person, we ended up with A LOT of food.  I was a little nervous, considering Japanese can get pricey, but by the end of the meal I could hardly finish the last dish (although I did:)I think the marinade for each sashimi we got made each one, topped with the extremely fresh fish made those the stand outs of the evening for me. I thought they were all killer and would recommend any of these:Yellowtail Jalapeno - garlic, cilantro, calamansi Soy with a fried jalapeno to topSalmon Wasabi - wasabi crème, lemon Soy, crispy shallot, chivesFluke Soy Salt - chili Oil, soy salt, citrusKobe Sashimi - a play on thinly sliced kobe beef, yumm-o!We also ordered the Cod Bibb Lettuce Cups. I thought the contrast between the cool lettuce and fried cod was really good.  I know this wasn't a favorite of the table, but I really enjoyed it!Our last course was the sushi. The angry tuna roll was pretty amazing. I mean, deep fried sushi roll? Who wouldn't love it! The seared albacore was good and so was the yellowtail, but angry tuna, the star of the show, for sushi at least. I would definitely recommend making a reservation before you get to Vegas, but one thing I will note is that we came in around 7pm and the place was dead, so you may be able to squeeze in last minute.  Ambiance is classy yet hip, so wear your hot cocktail dresses ladies and for dudes... something other than jeans and sneakers will do!I believe that good ramen can cure most any non-communicable disease related ailments, and great ramen can entirely change your day. The bowl I had at Social House lies somewhere in between, but considering it's found in a strange land where such simple pleasures are hard to find I found it worthy of extremely high praise. I cannot say that I tried any other dishes here, as unfortunately on the day I visited they weren't offering the lunch special that's available during the week which includes 2 other courses in addition to the ramen, however, this one bowl was enough for me to lock Social House in as a regular stop when visiting Vegas.My service was also exemplary here, which isn't an easy task considering I sat at the bar and only had one item to eat, but Jonah managed to do his best to keep me from dozing off and winding up with noodles on my face at 1 in the afternoon. Yeah, long night watching the sun come up, although thankfully I wasn't stuck out at the Vegas Motor Speedway like my friends who attended that night's EDC event, which was shut down due to wind, trapping everyone in an ecstasy induced frenzy for a few hours. From what I heard though the Steve Aoki protest set was pretty memorable and well worth the headaches. Jonah seemed to know all the blondes who looked like they had just left a "Peepshow" audition by name and typical menu orders as they strolled in, so clearly the guy is doing something right.But, back to the ramen. It's about $17 for a bowl with pork belly and tonkatsu broth, and I think slightly cheaper if you want the seafood or miso versions...pricey, but what here isn't? I definitely recommend the pork belly though, even if you're vegetarian, because it's Vegas and whatnot, so if you can cheat on your husband you can cheat on your diet (and it might help take your mind off all the meat you had in your face at Thunder Down Under, which you just know your "best friend" Orphelium has photos of and will be eagerly awaiting the next time you forget to return her organic sewing kit to accidentally break them out in front of Thadly). The pork in this bowl is quite plentiful (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g?select=nHoa4e7h9Fe8ocEHkMI44w#-PhxZpR8PqXM_IFuzOupXg), and after a minute or two of soaking in the steaming broth it's extremely delicate and easy to dice up with your chop sticks. The broth itself has a good bit of depth as well, but I highly recommend dumping the entire side portion of pepper and spices and crispy garlic in for added flavor. By the time I got to the bottom of the bowl there was a really nice subtle burn going on in my mouth, exactly the thing I needed to get the day started in the right direction.The setting here is pretty sexy (it's located inside the super luxurious Crystals mall), in a bold and brooding teahouse sort of way, and while those ideas may seem rather juxtaposed, I promise it works. I would love to return to Social House for a full course dinner meal, if this ramen is any indication, but for the time being I'm content in knowing I found what is likely one of the only places, and quite possibly the best, to offer up one of my favorite post-drinking-night cravings.Funny story: in 2007 I went on a blind date to Social House when it was operated by someone else in TI.  The guy insisted on ordering for me: sunomono (cucumber) salad (the size of a soy sauce dish) and 1 order of tamago (egg) sushi that he split with me.  No joke!  We sat outside and that was my first view of the siren show, ugh.  After that I tore off to Godiva in Fashion Show and bought myself chocolate.  Good riddance.  Fast forward, Social House left TI, and I forgot about it.  Then I was in Crystals one day walking around and saw an ad for desserts in restaurants there.  The yuzu frangipane called my name.Last night Eric R. and I attended a really cool event at Social House in Crystals.  It was a sake lesson from a sake sommelier, paired with different bites from the food menu.  First we had junmai premium sake paired with yellowtail sashimi with tempura jalapeno, garlic dust, tiny cilantro, and calamansi soy.  Did someone say tempura jalapeno slices?  Yes indeedy.  Next, we sampled another sake, some higher level, paired with big eye tuna sashimi, sweet chili sauce, crispy shallot, red onion, and negi oil.The next dish was amaaaaazing: nasu spicy miso: small delicate roasted Japanese eggplant with spicy miso glaze.  This was truly delicious!!!  Our last dish was a set of rolls: salmon avocado, hama-chimi (hamachi, avocado, jalapeno-cilantro chimichurri, garlic chips), and negi toro (fatty tuna with green onion).  Our final sake was Ty-Ku coconut flavored nigori (unfiltered).  This was actually really delicious.  I have long been a coconut fan but I am on a huge coconut kick lately.  This one is worth purchasing, and I can get it at Total Wine or Lee's according to the sommelier.This ended up being a really fun event.  At the end, I ordered the yuzu frangipane, which is made to order because it is a molten cake!  Warm almond cake, molten yuzu cream cheese filling, raspberry sorbet, almond toffee, and fresh raspberries.  It was tasty, more like almond than yuzu.  The idea of it is really good, but I am looking for yuzu to punch my taste buds, so this in the end was not quite yuzu-y enough for me :) and it cost $12.  Anyway, I would come back for some bites here, especially that eggplant!I haven't been to Social House since it was located in TI years ago. From what i can remember there seems to be some similar items on the menu. Of course my guy and I decided to go big and get the 10 course Omakase w/ a side of a 5 course saki tasting. I'm not as young as I used to be and I just can't hang with 10 courses anymore! Luckily my guy can pick up the slack! Everything was delicious -  kobe sashimi, scallops, braised beef, mango pudding and these leche donuts, holy crap! I drank too much saki so I honestly don't remember it all.At the end the chef came to talk to us. When he found out we were local he told us to come back and make sure we mentioned we were locals who had been there before so he could make sure we got to try something different. This made our night. There is no point in doing a chefs tasting and spending all that money to taste something you have already tasted. We'll go again to see what else the chef can do for us.This review is for their happy hour only. We walked in and being a Thursday at 6PM, it was not busy. As the happy hour is only available in the bar lounge area, we were seated at a table next to the shuttered windows looking outside (to the mall walkway). The happy hour menu consists of cold items, warm items, rolls and beverages. I ordered the most expensive happy hour drink... $9 for a sparkling sake Bellini, and it was yum. So easy to drink, I could have easily had 3 of them. For food, we had: Ramen with poached egg and pork belly - O.M.G. This is a hidden gem for ramen. The Tonkotsu broth was creamy and rich (thinking about it makes my mouth water). With the poached egg, the broth became even more buttery. Amazing. There were 2 slices pork belly I thought there was a good mixture of fat and meat, but it was perfected with the seared outer layer. You can tell it's a good sear when it's still firm after sitting in broth for a couple minutes. Some of the noodles were stuck together but at least they were all cooked and not al dente. Salmon tartare with Taro chips - I didn't get a picture of this because it was our first dish and I was bordering hangry, so I devoured it. The taro chips were house made and fresh. The salmon tartare was good but it came with a load of Ikura on top, and I'm not fan. Also, there was a layer of wasabi? cream in the middle which added to the creamy texture of the salmon and gave good color contract but I didn't think it added to the dish. Thai Beef Salad - these were essentially Thai beef butter lettuce cups. The beef was tender and flavorful but this was certainly not spicy and I was expecting spicy. I guess I could have asked for sriracha. Kalbi beef roll - I usually don' like rolls and especially cooked food rolls, but this was not bad. I think this is how they made it.... take a long slice of cooked kalbi (cut out the fat), bread with panko, flash fry, and then roll in sushi rice. Topping each roll was the Korean sweet spicy red sauce. All in all, great food, great value. Would definitely come back!We were on our way to the Cosmo Pool for Lorde and wanted a quick small meal, so we decided to give their happy hour a try.I arrived first before my friends, and when I approached the hostess stand, I was "greeted" by a very bitchy hostess. I told her there were two more people coming, and we were there for happy hour, so she leads me to the bar area and gives me one menu (not even the happy hour menu) and promptly leaves. I sat for a good 10 minutes before someone even came over (the place was dead) my friends arrive and someone finally makes it around. We place our orders, I went with Salmon Tartare and Steamed Broccoli with Calamansi Soy. The salmon was so salty, it wasn't edible, I ended up eating the taro chips it came with and the broccoli was all dried out. For 2 items and 2 drinks, my bill (with tip) was $40. Sorry Social House, this is "not so happy hour". Won't be coming back.This place would have had a full 5 stars if our hostess had paid attention to us when we walked in. She didn't really even welcome us which only lead to us sitting anywhere near the bar area and waiting for a few minutes before someone noticed that we were there to hand us over a menu and gives us a better welcome. I did notice she was on her phone while at the front as a hostess, not cool if you ask me. She also left a few minutes later so I am assuming she didn't really care being that it might have been the end of her shift. Ok on to the better things about this place. Super cute and cozy, somewhat romantic atmosphere. Our waiter was nice and even helpful when we asked about the drinks. We also happened to show up during their happy hour. Their happy hour menu is pretty decent, 5pm -8pm every day INCLUDING WEEKENDS!!We ordered their kokonattsu ($8) coconut flavor, semi strong drink and a Mothra Japanese Bellini ($9) sweet and refreshing, both drinks were easy to drink, enjoy and get a nice little buzz going. We decided to try their Angry Tuna Roll ($10) to share. The Angry Tuna Roll consisted of spicy tuna (duh!), avocado, a little jalapeno that wasn't spicy, and sweet amazu ponzu onion (which was super delicious). The roll is also deep fried. BOMB.COM!! I loved it! We were very tempted after the roll to order some more food such as their salmon tartare, kobe slidders and ramen.. Gosh,  that only means we totally have to go back!! Get a few drinks in, some tasty food and roam the Crystals shopping center. I wonder if I would have gotten a few more drinks in the husband, if I would have had any lucky coming out with a new purse or fancy shoes hahaha. Will definitely come back to Social House.
5th Avenue Cafe=My office is now with in walking distance, but we have been going here since it was Dee's. We being a couple of guys and I. So today Bruce said; lets go to lunch, I say, ok. He then says; I know anywhere except 5Th ave. The boy knows me so well ;-[) I tell him no I will go today, it has been a while since I have given in and gone with the masses. I just do not like the place. So we walk over and are greeted by a bubbly waitress. This place always has nice wait people. She talks with us for a few minutes and then takes our order. Oh the food, the food. I order a french dip with Cole slaw and a side of onion rings. Bruce has his usual a BLT with well done bacon and fries.Now mind you we are the only folks ordering at the time and still it takes an unusual amount of time to get the food. Which by the way would have been better if we had never gotten our food. What I get is roast beef cut thickly and with the grain. Now anyone who likes a french dip knows the meat should be supple and sliced thinly, piled nicely on the bun. It should also have a rich beef flavour as should the au jus. I mean even the lowly of the low line cook should know one slices meat against the grain, always. The bun on which it sat was just that, a meat seat. I also love Cole slaw and usually will eat what is served, not this. Totally lacking any inspiration resulting in no flavour. The rings looked good, but looks can be deceiving.So Bruce you are right, any place but 5Th ave.
Nathan's Famous=So you're looking hot and feeling the fire in your white tuxedo. You have a bodacious babe on each arm. They're licking their lips waiting for you to roll a 7 at the craps table because that means a wild menage a trois with Dom Perignon champagne and caviar at the fanciest penthouse suite in the Venetian. You let one of the bodacious babes blow on the dice. You roll. CRAPS! You lose!The bodacious babes leave you for the dweeb on a winning streak at the next table. You have to kill your reservation at AquaKnox, the Venetian's most exclusive restaurant. Where do you go, loser? Why, you come to the second floor food court and eat at Nathan's, of course. Yes, they have one here in the otherwise plush casino hotel. I guess the food court is for the rest of us who are too stingy to consider dropping some do-re-mi to dine at the nicer places.I had the Chili-Cheese Dog with their standout Crinkle-Cut Fries. You know, the tray of fries with the red plastic pick on top that makes you think for a moment that you went to Sizzler's and ordered a steak. Those are kinda too good in a greasy way. The dog not so much. Look at the picture I uploaded in the gallery. Is that appetizing to you? Oh really. I guess I know which side of the railroad tracks you come from.FOOD - 2.5 stars...a dog and those friesAMBIANCE - 2 stars...it's a food court...what d'ya expect? a hostess with bodacious ta-ta's to take you to your plastic table?SERVICE - 2 stars...uhhh...what?TOTAL - 2 stars...sorry Nathan, Coney Island just called for you
Franktuary=My stomach, my palate, and hot dogs have at best what could be described as an abusive relationship.  My love of chili, cheese, jalapeno hot dogs hurts so good.So if you love hot dogs and are in pittsburgh missing a Chicago style hot dog, a New York style dog, or a Texas chili cheese dog then Franktuary is the place to go.Hot diggity dog these are darn good hot dogs!I am ashamed at not coming here much sooner!  But in my lame defense, it's tucked away in in the back of Trinity Cathedral.  All tiny and unassuming.  Even when you first walk into the "church" doors, you have to ask yourself, am I coming here to confess some sins or eat some sinfully delicious dogs?After reading through the many reviews on here I decided to opt for the "healthy" locavore dog.  It's awesome they carry this particular dog because it's made local AND doesn't have all those little mystery ingrediants that our other little dog friend has.  As soon as I read banana peppers I was sold on the Chicago Imposter gourmet dog.  It also comes with a whole pick, relish, tomatoes and celery salt.  It was really a great dog, although I still had to add ketchup, because we are in fact deeply in love, to the point where I have to add it to anything burger, dog, fry related.  I was sad to find out they were out of their slaw because I'm a huge fan of the slaw, when made right.  I opted to get the Greek Salad instead.  Good for me they were out of the slaw because the Greek Salad was KILLER!  I had to ask if it was made in house and it in fact is made by one of the chefs there.  It comes HIGHLY suggested!  I had to carefully inspect the salad so I could figure out how to make it at home.  Artichokes, cucumbers, banana peppers, orange peppers, onion, tomatoes and olive oil....amazingness!  To be completely honest, I don't think I'd have been disappointed by any of the sides because I had to steal a taste of my friends baked beans and they were also stellar!  Mega plus, they carry Boyle's soda!  I love me some Diet Cream Soda (I know...diet + hot dog = defeats the purpose).  AND, they give you a fun little gummy hot dog treat.  So freakin' cute!Totally cheap option for anyone working/lunching or visiting dahntahn Pixburgh!  Then you can head into the church and tell God how thankful you are he created hot dogs.  Amen!
China Grill=The best meal I have had in a very long time. I'm so excited to review this place i don't even know where to start...!Met a friend here last night and decided to grab a drink at the bar before sitting down. The bartender was a tall bald guy (cant remember his name) but he was so awesome! he made me a ginger mojito but used vodka instead of rum, it was delish!We sat in the gorgeous intimate dinning room. With the high ceilings and kitchen behind a glass wall it was a very enjoyable setting. Our waiter (Arty i believe his name was) was amazing. very informative and accommodating with my peanut allergy request. He suggested I start off with a Lychee Lemon Drop. this was mixology at its finest. Sweet but refreshing and with rock candy sugar i cant wait to try to replicate it.We started off with the lobster pancakes as an appetizer. More of a crepe then a traditional pancake filled with plumb lobster meat, mushrooms, red chili, scallions and dressed a lobster and coconut milk sauce they were melt in your mouth goodness.Moving on to the main course. We decided to split two entrees. Grilled Garlic Shrimp- Huge prawns over a bed of black fettuccine in a red coconut curry sauce they were mouth watering delish. The sauce truly made the dish. With the spice of the curry and a sweetness from the coconut milk it was the perfect combination.Our waiter then suggested the Short Ribs- totally melt in your mouth meat accompanied with goat cheese mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of Wasabi mashed potatoes... which i ate the entire portion. don't judge me.I also had the Strawberry Burst cocktail. Made with cachaca (a Brazilian rum) it was packed full of strawberry flavor in every drink. We finished our meal with a bottle of pinot gregio. This was an amazing experience and i highly recommend it to everyone.
Ticoz Latin Kitchen=ok, first review, here goes....sangria- killer, and if i recall correctly they have a pretty fancy happy hour, so i recommend a dd.guacammus (guacamole mixed with hummus) yes and yes.ticoz chop chop- i'm a huge fan of salads with lots of stuff in it. i really don't dig it when i get a big pile of lettuce with a few random veggies thrown on top. there are so many great veggies out there. live a little. the chop chop is great, jicama, hominy, chic peas, red beans, black olives, etc. good stuff.as far as the rest of the menu goes i really couldn't tell you, because for some unknown reason they decide to put chicken stock in about everything, and i happen to be vegetarian. my question is this, why on earth would you find it necessary to ostracize a substantial portion of the population to "add flavor" to your rice? no one notices anyway! i dont think i am asking too much, really. i'm ok with the fact that there isn't any tofu on the menu (i mean it would be nice, but hey), but can you please leave the rice alone?!?!? seriously. i don't get it.ok, so maybe i'm just bitter because i've had my eye on the coconut ginger curry rice since ticoz opened. whatever.Oh, how I love thee Ticoz.  From your close proximity to my work making for the perfect happy hour spot, to your very large glasses of pinot grigio highlighted by your awesome patio with the couches.  And, let's not forget about the great food and the wonderfully adorable bartenders and servers.My first time at Ticoz was last summer for a birthday happy hour.  It was hot and sweaty, but I had a great time.  About 10 of us gathered on the patio and talked and laughed until the sun went down.  I've had quite a few happy hours here and 1 lunch and one evening meal.  The lunch was amazing!  I don't remember what it was called, I believe "palm frond chicken" or something to that effect.  Their chop salad is to-die-for with a light dressing and corn, garbanzos.  Just amazing.  Their service is always great and when I was going in regularly they always remembered me and knew what my friend and I wanted to drink.  They've taken down their sign (don't know why) so it is a little harder to find now and its kindof a bitch getting there when 7th St has that suicide lane thing going (thats a whole nother review) but I will always love this place and will deal with the traffic to get there.I'd been wanting to try Ticoz since it opened. There was so much buzz surrounding it for a couple months after it opened, and some of my gay friends still rave about it. So I finally tried it on Saturday for lunch and was a little dissapointed.First off, I don't care if you are gay. That is absolutely your choice and I respect you making choices for yourself, but please for the love of god hire ONE person that still talks like he has a pair of testicles. Every waiter, bartender, and host that we encountered was almost inaudible and spoke in such a high tone of voice that I actually thought I was speaking to women.Secondly, being the only table in the bar (+1 table in the patio area) should mean that we get decent service. Watching 4 staff members stand in a close proximity circle behind the bar talking about how much they drank last night and forgetting to bring us more drinks, a bill, my credit card back after I paid the bill, etc. is a little disconcerting. Perhaps even more disconcerting than my lack of ability to spell or my run on sentences. Finally, when I tell you that I think your Pork Chile Verde dish has an almost inedible salt content, and you reply back to me "I've been telling them that for a long time and they wont change it," it's obvious that something is going wrong in your lines of communication. You wouldn't tell me that if a) you didn't also feel that way or b) you've heard other customers say the same thing. Regardless, what you should have said is "well I appreciate the feedback sir, may I offer you another dish with a lower salt content? and I'll be sure to let the chef know what you thought as well."The atmosphere was cool, but not nearly up to Fez or Switch levels. It's obvoius that I am in the minority, but this restaurant really didn't score many points in my book.4 STARS???If I could I would be all up in giving 0 stars in this motherfucker.I visited Ticoz based on the many good reviews. FAIL!Is TICOZ short for TOSTITOS?Because I swear... the chips served by the waiter were out of a cellophane bag from Costco. Margarita.... more ice than anything. Bleh.Service.... poor. We waited to be seated. We waited to have a drink order taken. Waited to get our drinks. The main courses were bizarre to say the least.The "tamales" were more like 2 scoops of sweet corn polenta.The shrimp were in a pile next to it, rubbery, frozen, slightly off flavored. The rice and beans, generic.The burgers were more like sliders. I think the burgers are prepared far in advance and assembled prior to serving. The bun was made soggy by the watery salsa. The mayo... became watery from the salsa as well. The cole slaw was bleh. The waffle fries were decent.The waiter was just weird. He was disengaged, unfriendly, and sluggish.Yo what be up wit yo foolz an yo fo stah reviews?!@!One of the worst places I have eaten in Phoenix - super trendy looking, with miserable vittles.1 star, only because there is no way to give 0 stars.Word is bond!In a city teeming with Mexican and Spanish cuisine, Ticoz offers more.  Its melange of Latin inspired dishes, lovingly prepared by Chef Holly Gibson, offer a variety of flavors from Puerto Penasco (Ticoz Street Tacos) to the Caribbean (Coconut GInger Curry Rice).I had the opportunity to speak with Chef Holly when coming here for a "YAP." (Yelper Appreciation Party)  Invitees were lured by drink tickets and a specially prepared spread.  Ticoz' reputation had previously awakened my culinary curiosity, so this was my first experience of the restaurant and its food.Ahhh, the sight before me when I walked into the restaurant brought back visions of nights in Puerto Vallarta; ordering tacos and tostadas from street vendors at 2 in the morning.  Or was it the talk I had with Chef Holly, when she talked of her inspiration for one of Ticoz Signatures?  Though she grew up in Arizona (so rare, i know!) she spent much time in Mexico, vacationing with family.  It is here where she discovered the "street taco" and brought it back to Phoenix. I was to enjoy four of these ambrosial tacos the night of the event.  House braised meats on soft corn tortillas, festooned with cabbage, and blanketed with chipotle and an avocado crema.  To give the right amount of tribute, I want to describe Chef Holly's simple secrets to the taco meats.  The chicken is braised  in pineapple and chipotle, the beef in lime and cilantro, and the pork in orange and clove.  These make for distinct flavor combinations, and the juiciest and most tender meat.   The tacos caused a great well being, as everyone was magically transported to the Mayan riviera, with a cold margarita in hand.I have to digress here, because i just typed one of my favorite words.  Margarita.  I easily enjoyed four of them, to go with the four tacos.  I could not help myself, they were pure titillation.  Not to mention, all the exotic libations are1/2 off between the hours of 4:00p-6:30p.   An unbeatable value, considering the average tropical cocktail here costs only $7.   In addition, the owners were extremely generous in offering its "Yelping" patrons two free drink tickets - even for 16oz. of jubilation.  The drinks deserve a list all on their own:#1 Coconut Margarita.  (who would have thunk that agave and coconut make great bedfellows? a first for me, now i will never go back to anything less than...)#2  Passion Fruit Margarita. (a contender for the number one spot. perfect balance of ingredients - so much so that one hardly tastes the tequila and instead thinks they are plucking Maracuya from the vine.)#3 Blackberry Margarita. (hold me back! I thought there was nothing more divine than a blackberry capirinha.)#4 Lychee Margarita. (this sweet and fragranced fruit makes the cadillac margarita pale in comparison)I will not admit to drinking any more than the above stated, but I did sample the other signature cocktails such as the kiwi white sangria, and the peach mojito.  With so many exotic and enticing blendings of flavors, I was overwhelmed.  The list of flavor combinations for mojitos and sangrias, as well as margaritas and martinis goes on...I only wished my liver had not been so well fortified after my drinking expedition.  I would have explored the wilds of this potable jungle, but I settled instead with putting the flowers, that came as decorative adornments in the drinks, in my hair.So, after that wonderful veer, my focus was back on the food.  Other items my taste buds explored on the generous spread were the BBQ meat sliders, as well as the pork tostillados and guacummus.  What is guacammus?  It is Ticoz famous blend of house made guacamole and garlic hummus - a unique gathering of mediterranean and caribbean.  Go Chef Holly!What one will find here on the appetizer menu are the characteristic  southwestern and even south american comfort foods such as empanadas (a taste of buenos aires) and flautas.  In addition to the guacammus, the basket of corn waffle fries seasoned wtih lime and chipotle distinguishes this eatery from the rest.More than a half dozen salads grace the menu, with unique ingredients such as grilled peaches or hearts of palm.  Burgers and sandwhiches are available for the unadventurous, but the signature dishes is where Ticoz defines itself as a Latin Restaurant.From the house Paella prepared in a citrus saffron broth, to the shrimp and lobster arroz in crab filled coconut rice - Ticoz will give you a small tour of the Latin World.Consider this 3.5 stars for now...a return trip is merited.Chef Holly wowed me with the delicious food at the UYE YAP at Ticoz a week ago.  So much so that we decided to return for a lunch date.I was not as impressed on the lunch date.  I had the burgers (two decent sized burgers served on slider sized buns) and subbed green beans for my fries.  The burgers were fine.  The green beans were pretty good but it was kind of difficult getting to them.  I had to talk my way to subbing a vegetable for the fries (I was on a low-carb diet...mercifully done with that) because "they don't do substitutions"...they "don't really have vegetables"..."maybe we can do something"..."I think we can do some green beans."All in all I will return to Ticoz for a third visit and update from there.  It was kind of odd to be wowed the first visit and underwhelmed the second.Why the hell did no one drag me to Ticoz before now? Seriously, you all call yourselves my friends? I'm disappointed and saddened everyone kept this secret to themselves.As usual I was craving breakfast this morning and was able to convince the amazing Tony A. to meet me somewhere. He recommended Ticoz. I will go out on a limb and say this probably ties for one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Similar to Bri D., I am practice a non-tomato diet, and therefore, usually have issues with many places I eat at. I suspected I would have to order everything today minus tomato. However, I was clearly wrong.Let's start with the salsa and chips. For brunch. Yum. One of the salsas was pineapple based, which in itself would've made me completely content. Had my breakfast not arrived in a timely fashion I would've asked for them to take the other two away and replace it with three bowls of the pineapple salsa. Establishments that can make a great salsa without the use of tomatoes are hard to find. Along with my salsa and chips (I swear I didn't eat the salsa only with a spoon despite my desire to) I had a $2 mimosa. Yep. Only $2. It was super fantastic and had minimal amount of pulp which I also appreciate, not to mention that it looked sunshiny and happy.I went with the huevos rancheros for breakfast, which is comprised of 3 eggs any way you like, green chili, pulled pork, and potatoes. Um, please Sir, may I have another? It was one of those just about perfectly sized meals (had I not front loaded on salsa and chips) that made me all happy inside as I consumed it. The server told me it would be spicy. It did have a kick, but a little more of one would've been welcome.Stepping away from the food, the service was prompt and the staff was super friendly from the moment I walked in the door before I could take my sunglasses off until I was headed out the door on my way home. Very conversational. Very prompt. Very much appreciated. The prices were also extremely reasonable. Although the menu for brunch is limited, at least half the items appealed to me, which means there is hope of a future trip.I adored the laid back decor which was perfect on a Sunday morning. The colors were warm and inviting and the seating was creative. The bigger chairs at the table though almost don't work for short people, but I managed. I want to go back again. Now.Maybe this will be better:The food was gross period. IN MY OPINION (that's for the owner)  and the beef tacos tasted like what I would imagine dog food would taste like. Wet, nasty .99 cent dog food. It was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had, the service was snarky and bitchy and on a Saturday night it was DEAD. *shocking*. I see a lot more nights like that in your future Ticoz. This place will never see another dime of my money. So sue me.  :)You can't point fingers and blame others when clearly inferior product (In my opinion) is the problem. I have no ill will toward any establishment. If you want good reviews, provide quality ingredients and good service. It's that simple. If this much effort was put into creating a positive dining experience, I wouldn't have written such a negative review in the first place. Now go away.I'm the newest fan of Ticoz after trying it last week for the first time. Myself and two wonderful ladies...shout out to Dottsy Z!..hit up happy hour on a beautiful Wednesday evening. Only happy hour turned into happy HOURS! Things I loved: *the over all vibe and styling of the place. Great decor and great hint of Spanish flair without over doing it. *the food was excellent. I had some chips and salsa which were pretty standard. The tacos, although, were outstanding. I had one chicken and one beef. The beef was AWESOME! I am trying to eat red meat only two times per week and I may just have to have both meals be these tacos! *The service was great as well. I've heard people say this place is "gay friendly". This day and age, "friendly" anything is wonderful. But seriously, our server/bartender was very knowledgeable, friendly, and prompt. I can't wait to head back to dine on the patio and explore the menu more!here goes, Ticoz, a bad reviewafraid. what will the owner do?see i don't harbor mal-intentand haven't  broken, TOS yetso please don't, Ticoz, jump my shitlike you did that other chickwho didn't care much for your foodcalled her out, i thought that rudeso risking hate mail, well, here goesthe food we tried at Ticoz, blowsi know, i'm sorry, wasn't goodi'd dish more stars, you know i wouldif the host had greeted us within five minutes, in no rushturns out he also waited tablesTicoz, you're busy, and surely ableto hire someone, for up frontto meet and great and seat at lunchliked our waiter, real nice guytook our order, things we triedincluded 'pozole'  served with limeand cabbage, oops, i'll pass next timei love posole, when done rightbut only managed, a few bitesalso the blue corn enchiladaswith sour cream sauce, sorry, nottafan, too heavy and too rich  stuffed shredded chicken, gotta bitchsame goes for your shredded pork tortaboth proteins dry, the flavor sortalike they'd seen a couple daysin a steam table, tasted that wayon the plus side, décor and vibecozy, hip, way cool insideprivate dining room, great bartrick patio all worth more starsbut the food, Ticoz, is why we camenot for drinks, though I must sayi could imagine, hanging outcocktails only, highly doubti'd order food, but never saynev....maybe the chef, had a bad dayFirst of all  BIG THANKS to Alex our waiter. Saddled with the party of women celebrating, he never was rude or impatient but handled us like a pro at customer service!  He made the evening click with smoothly timed drinks and ordering. Brought some of my friends to TICOZ  for a go away party for a friend  getting married. So glad we came here..the ambiance was festive yet upscale.  We loved the food , music , guacahummus and the the nice big table which we hogged all evening. The gals loved the guacahummus , salsa and chips , a great start with drinks , we had wonderful entrees  like the special of chicken pasta and my delicious blue corn enchiladas which I would gladly have again. Nice touch with the complimentary  Churro with ice cream and raspberry sauce. I will be back!I feel like I've been all over with my reviews for this place, but don't worry, this may be the last update. My last experience at Ticoz was awful... It seems like as soon as Lola Tapas closed, everything went completely downhill. The happy hour went way up (used to be $2 sangria on Tuesdays now $3.50), they hired a new staff, service became crap during busy hours, they altered their menu (to cheapen it up) - like Kat S said, there used to be 3 salsas that came with freshly fried chips...now, there is one crappy salsa that, last time I visited, came with cold, stale chips - and to top things off, their sangrias lack the greatness in flavor and quality that I once saw in them.It really sucks to regularly go somewhere and watch it crumble. Ticoz initially ticked me off, but then won me over for the longest time. I recommended people go there and have a great experience (and sangria), but like any roller coaster relationship, the highs and lows are beginning to take their toll on me, and I know I need to just let go. I may wind up at Ticoz if a friend of mine wants to go, but I won't be leading the pack there anytime soon. #sadfaceWhoa!  What happen to Ticoz? This place use to be awesome.  As I waited for an eternity to get a drink I looked around the place and it looked like it was in desperate need of some TLC - furniture and carpets need to be cleaned, walls need to be repainted.  The plants were all dead in the women's restroom.  This place is dying a slow death.  What used to be a happening place for happy hour was dead, it was sad hour.  The service was terrible!  We were sitting in an empty bar and it still took a while to get a drink.  My friends and I were going to order apps but they never came back to ask us if we wanted food, thank god too because we would have had to stay there longer.  We chugged our drinks and bounced out.I used to really like Ticoz -- like 3-4 years ago. In fact, I'm surprised I hadn't already reviewed it! Loved the drinks and had two favorite entrees: the grilled burrito with fish and the coconut curry rice with chicken. Both are still on the menu and neither are as delicious as they once were. In fact, they're both kinda gross now! :(The grilled fish burrito contains breaded fish and the breading texture is mushy inside the burrito. The flavor is weak.The rice is skimpy on the chicken and you are given the option of if you want it spicy or not. It used to just have a nice mild spice to it. Now? Now, it is sweet! Blech! And, if you make it spicy, it's still more sweet than spicy.Sorry to say, I'm in NO rush to go back.  :(The food here is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. No idea what's going on back in the kitchen, but they really have it going on. Our four top was immediately seated on a lazy Saturday morning. Ok, maybe my Friday wine brain thought it was morning. I'm not really sure. But we were in the market for eggs.My eyeballs read, "$2.99 weekend brunch drinks!"So....I asked what a Greyhound and a Cape Cod consisted of.  I heard mwah mwah mwah VODKA...and then something that sounded like a Bay Breeze. Then Jordan recommend a "Big Girl Mimosa". I assumed (incorrectly) this was also part of the weekend brunch drink pricing. Yes, the drink was $2.99. However, when the bill came there was a supplement for $1.83 for a shot.  Boo! Hiss! Not really a big deal, but, per discussion with the two other adults at the table, none of us heard the additional pricing for the shot. (Nor did the highly intellectual teenager.) The Big Girl Mimosa was really easy to drink, a bit tart for my friend, as it was heavy on the grape fruit side. (I sucked it down like a camel in need of water.)  See my photo for evidence of empty glass.Alright, so I ate out today with my favorite family that allows fork-fuls of food to be traded. So I got to taste four very different things. I'd order ALL of them again. Listed in my preference order, here's what we Hoover'd down (like the savages we are, but with linen):1. Lobster Egg Benedict2. Mexican Eggs Benedict2. Huevos Ranchero3. Hot Cake Trio with Schreiner's SausageThe Lobster Egg Benedict really is something. It's hard to describe. The sauce isn't too heavy for a benedict and there's plenty of lobster on the plate. I was a bit envious of this dish.  To use my usual sound for food this was "Hhhhhooooohhhhh my good." Yeah, that good. GET IT.The kid at the table went for the Mexican Eggs Benedict. He pretty much orders chorizo at every restaurant in Phoenix. (I don't understand teenagers.) Buuut, if anyone is an expert on chorizo, I'd say this smarty pants would be. He liked it. I did it too. And he even let me take THREE fork passes. The green chile hollandaise is hot but not "burn your eyes down" hot.  He called it "intense". I agree.I went with the Huevos Ranchero as I wanted something with eggs over easy and meat. I asked for a recommendation and Jordan suggested this. I absolutely LOVED the spice on everything. The eggs were great. The texture of the stuff underneath the eggs - eh. But I still ate 80% of my meal :) If you're in the market for a staple - the pancakes and sausage are WONDERFUl. I put them last as they're basics. But they were really well delivered. The sausages "spurted" when poked and "popped". They weren't over cooked or rubbery. The three stars are for service. I'm bummed about this. Although we were checked on my friend's ice tea was not filled often enough. (It was empty most of the time.) Nor were we asked if we wanted another round of drinks. (Strange!). And then there was the odd thing with the pricing on the Big Girl Mimosa. Otherwise, I'd Four Star this all the way! They have a super cute patio, a nice bar area and plenty of table seating. I'd give this place another go round!Oh Ticoz.. You've joined my great happy hour list! =)My friend wanted a Mojito one night.. So of course Yelp came to the rescue and I heard this place has some of the BEST mojitos. You guys were not lying! lolWe came after 9 because they have happy hour. Quite a selection actually. A majority of their drinks are on happy hour and pretty much half of their appetizer menu. For the drinks we ordered the passion fruit mojito and the mango mojito. I really liked the mango mojito. It tasted soooo fresh! I ordered the street tacos. You get two tacos for $5. So I got the shredded chicken and beef. I really liked the chicken, the beef one was a bit salty for my taste. I really liked their waffle fries too. They're seasoned and very crispy.I really liked this place! Great happy hour items and prices and their Mojitos were really worth the long drive for me. lol. I definitely want to come back to try their other Mojitos not to mention  I love me some happy hour! Til next time Ticoz! =)
Tides Oyster Bar=Bellying up to the bar, the Husband and I wanted a light dinner before our movie date.  We ordered Pan Roast with Lobster to share.  In the meantime, we enjoyed their complimentary baked items.  No cheesy flat breads this time, but the sesame one was available.  They also had warm sourdough bread with butter that wasn't too cold to spread and it was just so good.  When our pan roast arrived, they were nice enough to split the portion into two bowls without charging us for a split plate charge (nor us asking them to).  There were chunks of lobster meat, which surprised us both, and it tasted so good with the warm bread dipping into the yummy goodness.  We left satisfied! Service was fabulous - from the staff working behind the counter and the staff coming around from the floor.A friend and I decided to try this place for their $29.99 AYCE Crab Legs. This comes with soup or salad and dessert.  I was excited since I hadn't had crab legs in a very long time.  We decided to sit at the bar.   They weren't overly busy in the entire place so I figured service wasn't going to be a problem.  Big fat WRONG! Our waitress took a while to even come over to get our drink orders...  and even to bring them to us! We both ordered the New England clam chowder. They offer Manhattan also. This also took a while to get placed in front of us.  Hmmm..  Are you seeing a trend here? I will say the clam chowder was really good! They bring a bread basket so this went well with the soup.And we wait...  and wait... and wait for the crab.  Once it was brought out, it was delicious.  It was served with a small piece of corn on the cob and red potato.  I didn't try the sides since I was devouring the crab! About 2 minutes after we got our first plate of crab, another plate was brought out and set in front of us.  This would have been great if we were almost done with the first.   When we started on the second plate, they were already cold. Bummer. Of course cold crab is fine but just not what I was wanting. Then our finished plates sat in front of us for a very long time.  Was she really that busy?  No.  Even just a 'how is everything?' would've been nice.Finally dessert was brought out.  It was a little Banana nut cake with whip on the side. I would say it was good not great.  I ate about half.  So the meal was good.  The service was absolutely horrible. I guess I would say that I probably wont be back since there are many other places to get crab legs.
Maggiano's Little Italy=We had Melman bucks. So we came for dinner. Just four of us. But holy shit. They fed us like we we're three hundred pound men. Don't get me wrong. I love food. But there's enough, and there's just too much. We split a pasta as a first course. It was adequate, taste wise. But portion wise? How one person could even think of ordering it for dinner is beyond me. I would blow up. Wafer thin? I think not.We followed with baked clams which were pretty darned good. I like to put a little finely grated lemon rind and romano in my homemade version. I tasted both in theirs. I may sue.We moved on to a chicken saltimbucca, which was actually quite good. We followed with a salad. I could see the dissapointment in the servers face. When we only asked for espresso after, she seemed sad. I almost felt sorry for her. I guess she's used to people who live a week off the leftovers. We did, however, enjoy some very nice wine. So I think that may have made her feel a little better.Happy hour at the bar (I ended up w/ a couple glasses of wine - nothing special but not bad for under $5 each, either) yesterday turned into "hey, are you hungry?" "I could eat..." "well, let's see what they have..." "what do you see?" [back and forth like that for a while] turned into our waitress saying "i'll send the chef out to talk about what we can do for you."  ah, the joys of #glutenfree dining. chef aiden was the consummate salesman - describing the veritable smorgasbord of options. TWO gf types of pasta, nearly all of the sauces, as well as all of the veggie sides and meats. he was detailed yet efficient, and demonstrated (separate fry oil!!!!!)  that he really cared about my party's food intolerances. i was quite impressed. we'll be back soon.8/11/11After reading so many reviews about how great Maggiano's happy hour was, I decided to check it out myself and use a $10 gift card that Maggiano's had sent to me in honor of my birthday.  [Yes, I'm writing this review almost two years' later... I am that backlogged with reviews and photos- bear with me.  I don't think that these should be discounted based on how long it's been since these visits, because I (and others) could use these observations to see if the restaurants and their service and products have improved, or in some cases, worsened.)]  Was going to try a couple of the apps when I spotted the Four-Cheese Ravioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maggianos-little-italy-scottsdale-3?select=GzMWRgNr3Im5eTXGK5rFiQ#GzMWRgNr3Im5eTXGK5rFiQ on the dinner menu.  The description mentioned ricotta, cream cheese, mozz, and provolone in a pesto-alfredo cream sauce, and I was hooked ("ricotta," "pesto," and "alfredo" hook me in 95% of the time).  Unfortunately, the dish was a HUGE letdown... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maggianos-little-italy-scottsdale-3?select=dMECY1zFqidngRglm1e3sA#dMECY1zFqidngRglm1e3sA  All but two of the ravioli were half-frozen (especially at the edges), and the flavors?  All of the cheeses, marinara sauce, and pesto-alfedo cream sauce tasted the same!  All bland, without any distinction between them.  I tasted samples from allover the plate, from all components, separately and together, and couldn't discern any difference.  Even the entree's appearance was subpar.  Suffice it to say, I have not stepped foot into another Maggiano's since.The two good comments I could say are that the restaurant was quiet (no one was there) and the plates were quaint-looking, with that old-fashioned rose-and-bone tinted floral print.Honestly, the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars was because the cheesecake was heavenly. Everything else was a disaster; and this place deserves 1 star.To start off... we had a reservation for 7:30. The reservation was for 20 people. (Yes I know serving 20 people can be very difficult, but it can be done... Apparently this is not something that can be done at Maggiano's.) When we arrived the hostesses needed an EXACT number of people who would be dining. That would be 20; hence the reservation for 20 people... This was about 10 minutes of pointless back and forth with the hostess and how many freaking chairs needed to be at the table. 20! SHEESH! The next run around we got was that we were not allowed to be seated until all of the guests had arrived. After some of our guests arrived a few minutes later we were still all standing in the lobby. We were told our table would now be ready in 15 minutes. After 20 minutes of clogging up the front door and part of the bar area we walked up to the hostess and asked what the status was. Once again our table would be ready in 15 minutes. Another 20 minutes painfully ticked by. Oh did I mention we had a 3 month old and a toddler in the group? Anyone with a baby/toddler knows how great it can be waiting 45 minutes for a table. NOT! 50 minutes after our reservation had passed we were called up to be seated. Not one of the 3 hostesses apologized or even batted an eye that we had been standing there for 50 minutes?!?! ARE YOU FOR REAL!?Once we were seated we were understandably STARVING. Two waiters appeared to take our drink order. The young lady who helped was pleasant and very hospitable, but the gentleman who served us was rude! RUDE! RUDE! RUDE! Like we did something wrong spending our money at this establishment.  We asked him if the toddler who was with us could get his water ASAP, as the long wait had been hard on him. He looked at us like we were from another planet. Not only did he not apologize for the wait he huffed and puffed and started stammering "YOU HAVE TO BEAR WITH US". WE HAVE BEEN BEARING WITH YOU FOR AN HOUR!!!!!!!!!!!!! The rudeness continued throughout the entire meal. After all of this, the food was mediocre. Nothing special. Bland.  We were never apologized to from any of the staff nor were we even offered a fee appetizer or drink for the wait. If I ever return to this restaurant I can assure you it will be by force and not by choice. I can find good cheesecake at a lot of other restaurants that will be happy to take my money.
Pizza Palace=An Italian restaurant in a Chinese casino?  It's just like North Beach, then!  Our quest for Chinese food took us to the Imperial Palace, but the Italian restaurant inside turned out to be perfect for us.  It was decorated like an Italian wine cellar, with the tuns of wine in the walls, old columns, the barrel vaulted ceiling.   Like we were deep inside a hillside.  Brick walls exposed through plaster finish.  A mural of Venice, for some reason.  It reminded me that everything on The Strip is a copy of something else.  The pizza was great.  The menu had all kinds of Italian food, and it was a very pleasant experience.  Dinner for two came to about $35.
Little India=Delicious. What do you think of delectable 'chaat' that melts in your mouth? In a way, you're always left unsatisfied after you dig in to these tasty treats, simply because you yearn for more. And yearn I did! I've been frequenting this place for the past two years or so. It is relatively close by to campus, and is definitely on the route to my house, so if it's 100+ degrees and you're experiencing a craving for a flavorful treat, what better place is there other than Little India? Honestly, I haven't had a myriad of foods here. When I like something, I'm quite obstinate, and I stick to it. However, I have tasted bhel puri at five or so other Indian "chaat" places peppered around the valley, and nothing can compare to the bhel puri in Little India! Anyway, instead of yelping about it, I'm going to shut off my laptop, leave campus in an hour or so, and then go to Little India because I'm hungry.
Cafe Bellagio=5 girls were hungry and wanted a bite before we started our journey back to the OC so we pulled over @ the bellagio...after we smelled the lovely flowers we saw the line for cafe bellagio...long but it would have to do. LUCKILY as we stepped into line a hostesss came around saying "5?? 5?? anybody have a party of 5??" thats when i jumped out saying "5 here!!!!!"so we got seated QUICK. our table ordered a pulled pork sandwitch, french toast & sausage, steak & eggs, caramelized grapefruit, yogurt parfait, and my penne pasta.our server was a really sweet lady and she claimed my pasta was the BEST CHOICE!!the pasta was....alright.. the sauce wasnt out of the world plus (I HAVE SOME BAD LUCK WITH PASTA!) the pasta was a tad overcooked. as the girls tasted it they confirmed i wasnt crazy and it was a lil mushy...blah but it was ediblethe brownsugar coated grapefruit was yum and the parfait had the yummiest fruits & granola!everyones food looked alright. the lady substituted my friends toast from steak & eggs for a bread basket for the table which didnt rock nebodys world...it was MEh bread.i expected more from the food. but service was superb!btw iono whats goin on but wen i got home i saw i did get charged the $70 on my debit now i check today and that charge is gone and now im charged $12 for cafe bellagio...wtheck?The food overall here is probably a 4 star but the service is really lacking here. I feel a little bad as well because I recommended this place to my friends. We had a big group here and the automatic service charge of 6 or more people took affect so I guess the servers were in the state of mind that "We're getting our money anyways so who really cares?".  Our food literally took about an hour or so to come. The service used to be pretty good here before. I have no clue what happened? Luckily for us we were having a good time and weren't too upset about the slow service. I ordered the Oriental chicken salad which happened to be pretty descent. I remember the Bellagio Cafe having a pretty good French onion soup as well, although it's a bit pricey at $11.I'm not sure if I will recommend coming here after this past experience.I arrived in Las Vegas pretty damn late on a Friday night.  By the time I checked into my hotel and got to the Bellagio, it was already midnight.  I was hungry and needed food badly, and Café Bellagio was the only restaurant open that late.  Being that it was so late, I didn't want to pig out, so I decided to share the Crab Cakes Benedict with my friend( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/V0tAJLQlgYNCWAj5di3AoQ/l ).  The crab cakes were huge!  Instead of an English muffin, the crab cakes were on a bed of crispy hash browns.  The dish was really good, and it definitely satisfied my late night hunger.  The service here was good.  We were seated right away, our food came out fast, and our server was very friendly.  This is definitely a good spot to cure the munchies!I don't give out many one stars (you have to really fail to get that), but our trip to Café Bellagio = brunch fail.Since my friends and I were too hungry for crepes at Jean Philippe Patisserie but not hungry enough to tackle the buffet, our options for brunch at the Bellagio were rather limited.  After wandering around the casino to check out any other alternatives, we ended up at Café Bellagio since the line was relatively short and they were able to sit our group of nine pretty quickly.I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and it came with a decent amount of food - homemade corned beef hash, two poached eggs, hash browns, and choice of toast.  The eggs and hash browns were fine, but the hash itself didn't do much for me.  While their generosity with the amount of meat they used would usually be a good thing, it felt like I was eating a salty corned beef patty than an actual corned beef hash.  Ironically, their attempts to make it a "hash" didn't help either, as the shreds of potato they threw in tasted a bit undercooked.Although I might have given the food two stars on its own, I'm giving a one because I thought the service wasn't entirely there...literally.  After bringing out our food, our servers seemed to disappear for long stretches.  We had to motion several times to get our bill and once we did get it, one of my friends had to practically hunt them down to give them our check.  After what felt like 10-15 minutes, our server finally returned with our credit card  and slips...but only the merchant copy (none for us to keep).  Rather than wait around to ask for our copies, we just signed and left.Considering the quality of food and service, I'd rather take the $14 I spent on my "hash" and head over to Hash House for something bigger and better for the same price.This review is based on a single dinner at Cafe Bellagio.The first thing I noticed was the nice opulent decor, followed by friendly greetings by the hostess and our server, Julie K.  The meal then began with a warm tasty roll and butter, followed by a good Crab Dip spread on toasted baguette slices.  But the dip could have been creamier.A crock of French Onion Soup with well-melted Gruyere Cheese was excellent, and dense Meatloaf topped by Brown Gravy and mushrooms was very good with Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans.  Unfortunately, the chef read the ticket wrong, and Diane had to send her medium burger back to receive a medium rare replacement.  Then she pronounced her Bacon Cheddar Cheeseburger with Parmesan Fries as tasting very good.3-1/2 stars overall!  We will likely return for another meal when we are in close proximity somewhere on the Strip as dinner time strikes, and have no other dining plans.After working a nine-hour shift, rushing through a quick shower, and driving for five hours to get to Vegas to meet up with my girlfriends, we stumbled into Cafe Bellagio haggard and famished.Service here is awful.  Maybe it was the way we were dressed [it was 12am and we were all in a different array of pajamas], maybe it was because we all had our travel faces on, or maybe it was because they lacked decent customer service but waiting around for 30 minutes in a near-empty empty restaurant on a weekday for a glass of orange juice and a sandwich with fries is ridiculous!  At least give us some water if you can't pour me a glass of oj!  I get that the servers deals with the drunks and asshats that venture into their beloved city but we were nothing but polite.  My friends and I all work in different fields of customer service and the lack of manners and a smile is just rude.So how was the food?  Mediocre at best.  I daresay that even Denny's or Village Inn can slap together a better sandwich and deep-fry some frozen fries.  Oh well.  We ate, we paid, and we left.  Never again, Cafe Bellagio.________________________________________Side-note:  I received a nice message from Mark H., the customer representative, offering me to give them a second-try.  I'm flattered for such a gracious offer and I admire they're business integrity on trying to bring the best service possible.  It shows great work ethics and I respect that 100% but I must decline.  Definitely noted though and very cool of them to try and kiss and make up.Cafe Bellagio gets three stars for food and five stars for the ambience, making it an even four star rating for me!  The line to get in was ridiculously long on both attempts to go.  We finally stuck it out on attempt #2 and were then underwhelmed with our breakfast.  Can't put my finger on why, but the whole breakfast just fell short of our expectations in regards to taste--didn't hate it, didn't love it.   The best thing about the whole meal?  The beautiful ambience.  I. LOVED. the. ambience.  Overlooking the conservatory listening to Christmas music was just lovely.  The whole experience put a smile on my face and made me not care about the food whatsoever.  I can't wait to go back to see what the display is post Holidays and try something else.Decent food that's priced for the Bellagio clientele.First I must say that this place is super anti-kids they don't have a kids menu and really just don't seem like they want them around at all.We walked up and were seated very quickly which was a plus but it didn't make up for the accommodating situation of them not liking the little ones who were with us.They had a few beers on tap of those a chose the Goose Island as that's a great brewery with delicious glass of brew!Their chicken salad sandwich just sounded right and it was! The sandwich had a good amount of flavorful chicken with the right sprinkle of pepper on a yummy roll w/ a juicy tomato that went well with the crisp lettuce.The sandwich also came with fries they had this crispy awesomeness to them that rocked!One thing that I did like is they serve breakfast all day long so no matter what time it is you can get your pancake on!Overall I can't see another visit here unless I'm staying in the hotel as it's just not that accommodating and there is many other choices in the area.
Grand Wok=This is probably one of the most expensive Asian fusion restaurant I have been to that serves mediocre food. For two people, our check was a hundred dollars after gratuity.  I don't remember how much each dish costs, but I know the broccoli with beef order was a whopping $23.00.We ordered two bowls of hot n sour soup, a dragon sushi roll, a pork pad thai, a broccoli with beef, and a large beer.The hot n sour soup was extremely salty. So salty that I had to dilute it with water. The dragon roll was okay. It's basically a regular California Roll with avocado and eel added to it. Nothing fancy,  and it's no big deal.  The pork pad thai was also okay. It had enough flavor in it, but the rice noodles was a bit too clumped together. The order was tiny, not enough to feed two people.  The broccoli with beef was probably the best tasting. The oyster sauce made it really good, and the broccoli was fresh. Yes, this order was also very small. And finally the beer was cold and refreshing. The service was not too good. We had to keep flagging down the waitress before she came. She probably had a bad day since she was on the grumpy side.The restaurant is really nice. Very comfortable setting. I could have enjoyed my dinner more if we didn't have to sit in between obnoxious people.  Boy, they were loud the whole time.  Since our dining choices are in abundance at Sin City,  I probably won't be back to this place.  A hundred bucks for a meal that is probably 30.00 elsewhere is not worthwhile for me. I should have gone to Panda Express. LOL.
Ping Pang Pong=With a name like Ping Pang Pong, you're not sure if you're headed to one of 'those' shows in Thailand or sitting down for some dim sum at a Chinese restaurant.  When in Vegas, it's the latter...at least in this case.Seeing billboards all over town advertising their dim sum, I must admit, I was very hesitant.  I would even say I wanted not to like it.  But I did, believe or not.  Ping Pang Pong located in the Gold Coast Casino has some of the better dim sum I've tried in Vegas, and I've been to a few.It's a smaller restaurant than the only ones I've tried (listed below) and you can watch the casino floor as you dine.Saturday morning and we were seated rather quickly.  Quite a few Chinese people eating dim sum here as well, which is always a good sign.  They give you a menu with prices which is a bit unique for dim sum, but definitely helpful.  (Price ranges split into four categories for the most part - A plates are $2.18; B plates are $2.88; C plates are $3.88; and D plates are $5.88. ) Immediately after you're seated, the dim sum carts come your way.  If you can' t find what you're looking for, but it's on the menu, wave a server down and they'll order it for you.  Ping Pang Pong has a surprisingly large selection of dim sum choices and it's pretty good.  Regular steamed dim sum range in the A and B categories.  They even had the elusive Shark Fin Dumpling ($5.88), but no Shanghai dumpling.  They also give you the bottle of red vinegar as opposed to the dinky little soy sauce dish amount.  The Shark Fin Dumpling had a nice mushroom broth too that was quite tasty and stood out.  They didn't have the Pineapple Custard bun that I love so much, but they had the plain Pineapple Bun ($2.18).  The BF especially loved their Macanese Egg Tarts ($3.88).  He hasn't had them since being in Macau and even had an order to go. They have a decent amount of 'cool sweets' in the B plates - Red Bean Pudding Cake, Chilled Mango and Pink Grapefruit Cocktail, Tapioca and Purple Rice Pudding, Lychee Pudding, etc.  'Warm' and 'hot sweets' range from A through C categories and include Baked Tapioca Green Tea Pudding, Steamed Egg White and Sweet Cream, Seared Water Chestnut Pudding Cake, Thousand Layer Cake, etc. Service was okay.  We did have to wave the servers down as only certain people can assist you with special orders while others only clear tables and push the carts.  Prices weren't too expensive either and I would say it's moderately priced for a casino.  The only downfall would be if you came with a very large party.  It might take awhile to get seated if they are extremely busy.  Nonetheless, looks like Ping Pang Pong might be where I'm headed when I want some dim sum in the desert.Rankings for dim sum in Vegas thus far:1) Ping Pang Pong2) Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine3) Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant4) Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant5) Cathay House RestaurantSidenote: When you ask for hot sauce, be sure to specify hot chili oil.  It'll be the good stuff instead of the red sauce with chili flakes.  Well, it's the good stuff I prefer with my dim sum.  And of course, hot yellow mustard too.Updated! 06/10/07 - We returned again yesterday for dim sum and imagine my surprise when I saw pickled pig's feet being served!  This delicacy is usually only served after a woman gives birth.  A bunch of the older women relatives would come over and take over your kitchen while stewing up this stuff for you.  Once in awhile, I would wake up to this wonderful aroma when my mom felt the desire to make it.  I used to joke that I would have kids just to have people make this for me!  Now I can enjoy this vinegary fatty goodness anytime at Ping Pang Pong!  Yay!  For our party of five, it was about $100 with tip and tax.Updated! 03/02/08 - Went to dim sum on Sunday...arrived around 2:35 pm and was reminded they closed at 3 pm.  We were fine with that and were quick to load our table with all the dim sum dishes we wanted.  The staff horded around our table asking if we wanted to make any final orders since the kitchen was closing up, and we said we were good.  With that, the check was presented to our table.  We continued eating and it wasn't long before the server reached across for the bill.  (I told her it wasn't taken care of yet.)  She pulled back in surprise and walked away.  She then returned to tell me they were closing out the register, so could we pay?  I have been to other dim sum restaurants where you are 'allowed' to eat, despite the kitchen part closing.  It was pretty discouraging that they were so overanxious to get our money and to get rid of us.  The dim sum lady obviously hated her job 'cuz she was banging the little dishes around.   Note to self: Don't bother going to PPP after 2:00 for dim sum, service is crap.  Food is okay though...but going downhill.  Seek other dim sum restaurants SOON!  I brought their star rating down from a four to a three!Maybe it was all of the bad restaurant that I have tried prior to coming here but I thought this place was FANTASTIC. Granted the service was not that great and they were a little slow. It's also in one of the oldest casinos with probably the oldest clienteles. But this place is an actual gem. I got to give it to them.............they know how to make dim sum. The dofu fah, har gow, sui mei, Chinese sausage and egg white fried rice, beef cheurng fun were all very good. If you are here for the Koi Palace atmosphere, with the Koi palace experience then this probably not for you. This is more of a down home Chinese soul food restaurant........ the way it was meant to be. Good, reasonably price being that it is in a casino, and rude servers pressuring you to buy from their carts.We were looking for a Chinese Restaurant that serves Dim Sum late.  We stumbled across this restaurant in the Gold Coast Casino around 1:30 am.  At first we didn't know if they were closing.  No one acknowledged us for a good five (felt like 10) minutes, and nobody else was waiting.  There was no staff in sight to welcome us or take our name.  Right before walking away, someone finally confronts us.  Because we were hungry and lazy, we ended up waiting another 5 minutes since the place was packed.  Once we sat down, service was tolerable.  Our drink refills came frequently, and the food was prepared quickly.  We got our Dim Sum fix with Shu Mai and Hargow...pretty average.  Everything else (Fu Chow Fried Rice, Black Pepper Beef, Kung Pau Chicken, and Walnut Prawns) exceeded the standard except for the Hot & Sour Soup.  Bad start...but good finish..What's up with the name?  Seems a bit racist if you ask me. I kid. I kid. Every person in this joint was Asian.  Everyone.  That may be because it's in the Gold Coast and this place was nicknamed the Pan Pacific by my friend.  It was literally an Asian invasion.  So, when you see that all the peeps in a Chinese restaurant are Asian, that's gotta be a good sign, right?  The food was good, great even.  The prices were extremely reasonable for large, family style dishes.  We tried the usual offerings, including a spicy fried rice that had some serious kick.  Loved it.  The salt and pepper pork chops were delicious, but didn't have a ton of meat on them.  Minus one star for the wait.  Service wasn't great, but remember the saying...the worse the service, the better the food.  That always applies to Chinese food, so if you know this, you get it.Our second day of $25 food credit, we decided to try the Dim Sum again here.  Our visit this time seemed better.  I liked the food and the service.  You can't compare this with all the Dim Sum restaurants in So Cal, but Ping Pang Pong gets the job done with some of the classic dishes; Ha Gaw (Shrimp Dumpling), BBQ Pork Buns (both baked and steamed), Sticky Rice Wrap, Salty Sticky Rice Dumpling, Sesame Balls, Porridge, Egg Tarts, Chiese Broccoli, Fried Shrimp Balls, and so on and so on.  It seemed like they had more varieties this time than I remembered.  It could be because we were there earlier than last time, too.  Do get there earlier than later or there will be a wait (and also they don't run out of your favorites)  since the place isn't very big.  The prices are fairly reasonable.  Most dishes are around $2.88 (for B dishes).   We tried to order enough to use up our $25 food credit and ended up packing some left over to go (ate it for breakfast the next day). I've tried going to Dim Sum at the restaurants on Spring Mountain Road and it was almost impossible due to the wait time.  I'd much rather come here.  If you're in the mood for Dim Sum, give this place a try.I met a friend from Canada for dinner at Ping Pang Pong tonight.  My only other dining experience here was with the same friend about 4 years ago.We ordered three dishes to share:  The Singapore rice noodles were excellent.  There was a fair number of shrimp and some small slices of pork along with onions.  The curry flavor was good.  For my taste, I could have used a bit more.  We got an order of wrinkled green beans.  I don't think they were seared as much as they should have been to make them wrinkled.  They were crisp.  Their flavor was very good.  Finally, we got the half roasted Cantonese duck.  The flavor of the duck was a winner, too!  I'm not a big fan of duck when it's on the bone, but this was cooked well.  Service was good.  My iced tea refilled often without asking.  We did have to ask a server to bring us some clean plates so we could get rid of some of the duck bones.  The one drawback of Ping Pang Pong was the loudness of the place for the first 1/3 of the hour and a half we were there.  It was so noisy from people talking loudly and the kitchen staff, filling orders for take out and yelling the orders to each other.I do like the place and I will be back if only for the Singapore noodles.  That was my highlight of the meal!PS:  I love the name.  I can't help think of Puccini and Turandot!  Addio amore, addio razza....Brought the parents here at opening time, and it was good that we made it almost on time, as a line quickly formed outside.Very decent dim sum service, with the carts and everything.  Quality of the food was good, though the selection could have been a little better.  We are always on the lookout for slightly non-standard dim sum, and though there were rumors of some interesting things, what we saw was the basics.  Price to quality ratio was really good compared to anywhere on the strip.It's not quite high end.  Service and food are on par with places in other cities with a big Chinese population.  I have no problem with the idea that this is the best dim sum in Las Vegas.This place has grown into one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Vegas, for a couple dishes, entrees, and appetizers its a good $100 plate, the prices are reasonable and the food is mouth-watering. I enjoy the shrimp chow mein & the chicken fried rice has the perfect amount of salt & seasoning. The sauces with the Kung pao & honey walnut shrimp are out of this world! On weekends the kitchen closes at 3.How the hell are Asians supposed to convince everyone else how offensive the term "Ching Chang Chong" is when we go off and name one of our own restaurants "PING PANG PONG"? My Hong Kong-hailing real estate agent was visibly horrified when he found out in casual conversation that my parents and I had not yet been privy to the local dim sum experience at Ping Pang Pong (how is anyone supposed to take me seriously when I say this aloud?) in the Gold Coast casino. So while showing us detailed French doors, luxurious hardwood flooring, and expansive high ceilings, he kept peppering home features with "shao mai" and "cha shao bao." I was sold - on the food, not the house - so not long after that, it was off to Gold Coast we went. The casino is not the most convenient to navigate, but the restaurant sits pretty much smack dab in the middle of it, and that's where my biggest issue with it lay. The restaurant is open to the casino pits with hip-level pillars that whisper, "Smoky Smokerson! Enter, please." On the flip side, however, the dim sum is solid. Every dish we hailed off the cart was well-prepared and got a stamp of approval. The xia jiao, chicken feet, congee - all good in the hood. It's just that this hood carries a bit of an eau de FUMAR!I would give this place 5 FROWNNIE FACES :( . Where should I begin... FIRST OF ALL, they open at 10am, but don't have any food ready. We placed an order for a few dim sums at 10:10 am and got our order at 11am. UNACCEPTABLE, REALLY? 50 mins for dim sum?! Servers could barely speak english, messed up our order and manager was too busy to care. ALSO, the worst part is dim sum cart lady DROPPED food on the wet, dirty ground and procedded to place it back on the plate and back into the cart to be served to unknowing customers. GROSS, LADY..GROSS. I had to ask her to throw it away and she at first said " it's okay." WTH. NO LADY, IT'S NOT OKAY. No worries, I made sure she threw it in the trash..where it belongs. Finally we get our food at 11, after asking multiple times and our consolation prize for their mistakes were some cookies.. WOOHOO. Probably the ones that fell on the floor... Seriously, DO NOT EAT HERE.One of my highlights during my recent trip to Vegas was visiting Gold Coast where I tried the slot machines and came out ahead with some change.  And then visiting Ping Pang Pong for lunch and dinner.  PPP offers authentic Chinese dim sum with some unique items which I don't see in SCal, or maybe I have yet to visit to the ones that serve the similar dim sum fare.  Chill waitresses, friendly service, they are more than happy to show you what's in those little tins from their carts. The porridge with century old eggs was very satisfying, I was half full after eating it.  Enough century old egg pieces in it to qualify for the name if you know what I mean.  Here is my YAY!(‿) The slow cooked/simmered snails ($5.88) on dim sum menu is probably quite common in Hong Kong, but it's rare in the States.  Definitely a winner.  They were easy to be taken out from the shell, nothing broke off in the process, marvelous!  I enjoy doing that!  They were very flavorful, slightly spicy but not too spicy and had a nice chewiness to them.  What a treat!  Good times. ()The shrimp ball with sticky rice is a variation from the well known 绵阳三蒸，but theirs have more vegetable matter and less shrimp matter than I expected.  Still good though, and goes well with the egg white dipping sauce.  After I spotted the snails, fried shrimp balls with sugar cane ($5.88) were put on the back burner, I ended up taking them to go.  Those shrimp balls got nothing on them snails.  They didn't taste that good when they were cold, they probably taste better when they were freshly made.  The disc shaped sticky rice patty with lotus seed paste is the kind of mochi that I like to have for snack.  Not too sweet but sticky enough.  I should have got some to go.Can't resist the sight of any pan fried dumplings, how can I?  Just look at their pan fried bottoms.  In this case, the bun was perfect but the filling needed to be bigger and more substantial with more meat.This restaurant is shaped right, the circular floor plan goes well with la rotunda breadbasket of mine. I like the decor too, very Chinese in a traditional way.  (¬‿¬)Encouraged by the dim sum success, I thought I would try their dinner.  I wasn't particularly inspired by the porridge with abalone ($9.99) which didn't have much flavor as I expected.  I had better ones at a friend's house with chucks of abalone pieces.  But this is how they make it in most Cantonese restaurants, you get the thinly sliced abalone pieces in the porridge.  Dried abalone is some kind of delicacy, but quality various.  Those were definitely not the best I've had.  And they don't put much in there.  If you read the knock-off version of Sun Tzu Art of War, and take the last strategy's number, minus 2 dozens, that's the number of abalone slices I got in the porridge.When I was having dinner, I noticed they (the managers or the ppl by the register) just let the customers waiting by the door without acknowledging them and telling them how long the wait would be, that's rude.The name almost sounds like the punchline for a bad joke you wouldn't dare tell at a Chinese restaurant. Except Ping Pang Pong is not that, nor is it the name of the Azn triplets in your cringeworthy joke.At Ping Pang Pong, they take their dim sum quite seriously. At least I'm pretty sure their dim sum is among the best I've ever had. I love how they add these bits of salted shrimp to their taro cake for flavor. Yum.It seems a bunch of the older casinos in Vegas have a 'hidden gem'; Ping Pang Pong is Gold Coast casino's. We went there for lunch & there was this mega queue of Azn ppl (as myself), a queue that stayed long, long after we were done eating lunch (we stayed to play a bit of Wheel of Fortune). I figured this meant that a continuous stream of people kept coming in - & that that's maybe because the food is good. The things I learn from watching Sherlock.TIP: How do you skip the super long line at Ping Pang Pong? No, this isn't that non-PC jokeIf you spot a big empty table that will seat you/your group & the people in front of/behind you, consider befriending them, at least temporarily, for the purpose of sharing the table. That's what we did. There were 3 of us, 2 of them, & a few empty seats separating us from them. Otherwise, we would've had to wait another 30 minutes to an hour.I'm a fan of Dim Sum, and usually try to make it a point to try them when I come across one.  To this day, I have yet to find a place that blew my mind.  Din Tai Fung was probably the closest (is that even considered dim sum?), but in the more typical joints where they come around with the trays, I've never been super impressed.  We decided to try Ping Pang Pong since it was in a casino, and we figured it would provide the necessary cleanliness that I find to be generally lacking in dim sum spots.  We got there 15 minutes before they opened on Sunday, and there was a line of 3-4 parties waiting in front  of us.  By the time they opened, there were another 5-6 parties behind us.  Shortly after we began dining, the place was full.  Good sign.  The wait staff was surprisingly Chinese - I say that because this is inside the Gold Coast and I would have thought the wait staff would be more diverse - and resulted in a service very typical to other dim sum restaurants.  They spoke little English, and often called out the dish in Chinese even after realizing we were not Chinese.  The décor was clean and typically nice for a casino restaurant, so this part we enjoyed quite a bit - dim sum in a clean environment.The food was actually quite good.  It was quite distinctly lacking of the dumplings and shumai that we were looking for, they just kept telling us it would come later and they would come in trickles.  But what did eventually come - shrimp shumai and shrimp & pork shumai - were very good.  But alas, no har gow, no rice noodle rolls with shrimp (they had one with beef...), and just not enough choices of these little pieces.  What they did have though, were interesting and not common.  Congee porridge is common, and theirs is good.  They have a large bowl for the table and a smaller bowl for one.  They had cooked congee in spice broth which were excellent, and clams in similar sauce that were great also.  Their souffle-type dessert (they only make 10 per day) was delicious, as well as the custard flavor rolls.One big issue I had with them were that the dessert dishes started coming out first, and just kept coming around.  Why do they do that?  Bring out the porridge and dumplings first!  We kept having to tell them "later, after we eat!" as the dessert trays passed by probably at least half dozen times.  They've got to fix this.But all-in-all a good meal, and our meal for 4 came to $49 plus tips.  That's not a bad deal, and perhaps I can overlook some of their glaring shortcomings.  3.5 stars is more appropriate, but I'll bump up a half based on the quality of what we actually did get to eat.Table-for-1 Factor:  May be for regular lunch & dinner, but for the dim sum brunch it's probably not a great option.We like to eat here occasionally when we are here to play bingo. It's good Chinese food, decent sized portions, but terrible terrible service. Open late hours so when I've come here it has usually been on the later end of the evening. They pretty much have a very traditional Chinese dining menu, but a small bowl of white steamed rice is 50cents which I was surprised with all the entrees we were ordering we were not getting a free bowl of white rice. Tonight we had the Kung Pao Chicken, Dry Beef Chow Fun, Salt and Pepper Pork, BBQ Pork Fried Rice, Gobo Beef, and seafood mixed Soft Noodles which probably is their fancy name version of lo mein. All the food actually was pretty good.Kung Pao Chicken - I enjoyed how tender the chicken slices were, and the sauce for this particular dish was just right, right amount of spicy and right amount of sweetness to it. Gobo Beef - probably my new favorite dish to order when coming to this restaurant. Small thick cut cubes of beef sirloin, every flavorful and savory taste of beef cubes. could be more on the tender side, but otherwise very tasty.Beef Chow Fun - average tasting chow fun, a little on the oily side for my liking, but chow fun is my all time favorite chinese food dish, so I normally will order this entree at any chinese restaurant i'm eating at. BBQ Pork fried rice - it was a little on the dry side for me, but I guess it's better to be dry than oily. nothing unique or special, pretty standard dish for fried riceSalt and Pepper pork - a little too much on the salty sideseafood Mixed soft noodles - this name of the entree to me is in no doubt that it's their fancy name for lo mein, very standard display and style of cooking for the seafood lo mein look-alike, their hot tea was very very good, but their service overall sucked and some people (the hostess) really have terrible and rude attitudes and I know the customer can sense and see it. slow service, and just overall even if they are understaffed, they dont have to be sour faced or rude about it. 3/5 for pretty standard okay food and terrible service :/It's had been some time since my last visit to Ping Pang Pong so I decided to give it a try for our pre-holiday dim sum meal with friends.We arrived around 1pm and the line was pretty long. We were seated by 1:30 at a table that was a little on the tight side for our party. Drinks and refills were plentiful, but the cart service was extremely disappointing. They were slow with the carts and despite us trying to flag them down, they were hard to catch and skipped us a few times which irked me and my friends. We eventually got their attention and got everything we had hoped for, but the bad attitude and service was annoying. The food ranged for just ok to downright flavorless. Service issues aside, I can't think of a single dish that stood out to me as being good and I think I can safely cross Ping Pang Pong off my dim sum list from now on.I wasn't expecting much from this restaurant after reading some of the reviews but I wanted to try this restaurant with the silly, ridiculous name anyway. My friends arrived before me so we didn't have to wait in line. There was a small line already. We arrived right when they opened at 10 a.m. The restaurant is the smallest one I've seen from the other dim sum places I've been to in this town.The server took our drink orders right away. The dim sum ladies came by with their carts. We picked a few items. Some of the carts can be a little slow because a few times, we were waiting to eat more. The service is the least friendliest compared to the other dim sum places in town. Nothing too friendly or too abrasive...just your typical, nonchalant Asian service. Moving on to the food...It was fresh, good, and hot. Shumai, shrimp har gow, fried shrimp ball with mayo dip, shrimp in rice noodle, shrimp in bean curd, egg custard tart, & the donut resembling a malasada with red bean were delicious! The only thing that bugged me...We asked for hot sauce twice but never got our hot sauce. It's not a deal breaker but I like my foods with a little kick. Whatever, no biggie. I'll be back and I will make sure I get my damn hot sauce!I was looking for a good dim sum joint in Vegas. When I travel, I like to try the dim sum from other places. This place did not disappoint. It's located at The Gold Coast Hotel, all the way in the back. I have to give this place props for the nostalgic Chinese feel to it. Everything from the  tables to the uniforms scream Chinese. It seems so out of place at this hotel. It's as if it's in it's own little bubble.We got there about 10:30am and there was no wait. The place opens at 10:00am. When we left an hour later, the place was packed. When we first got there, I heard the workers speaking in Cantonese, a good sign. The hostess sat us at a table and gave us one of those stamp cards. Every time we took something from the cart that they pushed by us, they would stamp the card. That's how they total the bill at the end. This is the only dim sum place that I've been to that charged for tea. With that being said, the dim sum here is a good deal compared to Hawaii, where I'm from. All the items were about a dollar cheaper. We had the black bean spare ribs, chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, stuffed eggplant, and the hot tofu dessert. These are pretty much my staples. I tend to order the same items at dim sum. I have to say the food is excellent. Everything that we ordered was on point. The shrimp in the dumplings was fresh and the wrapper translucent. The chicken feet was plump and huge. The eggplant was stuffed with shrimp paste. My favorite was the hot tofu dessert. It was silky smooth and so yummy with the ginger syrup. It was as good or better than most dim sum places in Hawaii.As with most dim sum places, you get better service if you speak Cantonese. After the hostess sat us, no carts came around for a while. As soon as I asked for shrimp dumplings in Cantonese, the hostess waved all the carts over. Within 10 seconds, I had all four carts in front of me. My husband was laughing because he knew the drill. This happens at a majority of dim sum places that we go to."Sundays are for Dim Sum. While the rest of America goes to church, Sunday School, or NFL games, you can find Chinese people eating Cantonese food." ― Eddie HuangSo our friend wanted to grab some dim sum at a place he was profusely gushing about.  I was pretty unimpressed as a Cantonese person and after the meal, he echoed my sentiments.  What's the big deal?  I suppose it's the best dim sum in Las Vegas but places in Arizona have impressed me more.  I can't believe we drove all the way to Gold Coast to try this place!It may be because we were here for dim sum on a Thursday but the food was pretty cold despite being in steam carts.  We tried a wide variety of dishes and the salt water dumpling, egg tarts, and the chicken feet were the only ones that were particularly good.  Salt water dumpling is always good because they're fried, the egg tart is generous with custard filling, and the chicken feet had a good sauce on them.  Plus, they were really plump!  I did find the roe on the siu mai and other various dumplings to be interesting.  They didn't add much the dish themselves but it was okay.Service is that of all dim sum places: basic.  They do treat Cantonese and Mandarin speakers a lot better than the English speaking customers. 3.5 stars!
The Landmark Restaurant=I was intrigued by all this talk of the salad room. I had to check it for myself.I thought the interior atmosphere was quite nice, a little dated but nice.I decided I would try the Salad Room. (see pics)While I was impressed with the Salad Room itself, the contents were mostly things I wouldn't  care to eat, not even sure what some of the stuff was. I only made one trip and ate only half of that, And the Little Debbie Pinwheel wasn't one of them.Everything looked and tasted too institutional if you know what I mean.  Maybe you don't.....OK how about looking around and seeing waiters coming out of the kitchen serving plates with those plastic lids over them(they really did)......I Just got taken back to the convalescent home I used to visit my great grandmother in during dinner hour.......blech......I've never seen those lids used in a restaurant?I really just got grossed out while eating there, maybe it was the guy next to me me having the all you can eat fish and chips with his little jar and spoon of cocktail sauce that was served to someone else after he left I don't know, but I do know I wont be going back.this place always smells like geriatrics. the green wall paper doesn't help with that ambiance either. don't forget to note the brass light fixtures.for some reason my family loves this place and i'm always forced to go for birthdays or whatever. I personally don't get it. The food is pretty nasty. Everything I have ever had here reminds me of the marie calendars frozen dinners...except that marie calendars frozen dinners taste better and are priced to match the quality of food. The service is mediocre, I guess. They have a salad bar which also has a few other options but all nasty, again. nothing grosses me out more than plastic bowls filled with cold and cheap ranch. and not to be mean or anything but the people who dine here gross me out. There are certain ages of people who just gross me out when they eat: infant-3 yrs old and then it starts again somewhere around age 80-death. I love old people and babies, but I hate watching them eat or thinking about their hands being anywhere near food that I have to eat.  This place just isn't for me I guess. I will say that my step dad thinks the bread pudding is to die for- keep in mind he's in the same age range as most of the diners here so take from it what you will...
MGM Grand Buffet=An important part of a Las Vegas trip is eating at a buffet. You're exhausted from the night before, dehydrated from not enough water and too much alcohol, and already given into gluttony, so what do you have to lose? Well, your standards and possibly your dignity if you choose the wrong buffet. I have had the good and the bad, and I would say MGM is neither. It's just okay. On a saturday morning just before noon, I was starving. So starving, that by the time we finally sat down to eat I literally grabbed a plate from the closest food station and filled up a plate with things I couldn't even pronounce. I actually found it quite tasty, so I was curious about what other delicious things were out there. Well, that's where the okay part of it all comes into play. Everything else was just okay. For $25 though, I like a little better than okay. I go to Silverton for $17 and it's AMAZING, so I wasn't impressed by the price.I was, however, impressed with the pay here kiosks! Instead of waiting in line for eternity you just walk up to the kiosk, get your receipt, and get seated. Done. Simple. I appreciate that. I would eat here again if it was very convenient or I was starving and couldn't wait, but I don't think I would really plan to eat here.Being from Portland I cannot believe I went into a "buffet" place. That is one thing Portland does not do, and if they do do buffets they are horrid little places.  I guess Las Vegas is the opposite because this place had some pretty decent food and the price was fantastic for the location as well.We only ate there when we got out of bed for two mornings so I can only talk breakfast. However, there was lunch out there as well.  Tons of food, all tasted fresh, and they always had it full and plenty hot enough.  My inlaws back in the day, used to make us go with them to a Portland buffet and they would have the nastiest food in those big square containers with the boiled water underneath. The food would be crusty around the sides and be overcooked and pretty much canned. The desserts would be things like puddings that had a layer of hardened pudding on the top and you would have cool whip to put over it. There would be the fruit cocktail with the cherries on top and the dried up pizza.. Like I said, Portland does not do buffets.I digress, but I was making a point, sort of a contrast from what I saw here. First, none of those square containers with the boiled water below like a cafeteria was anywhere to be seen. Their presentation was appetizing instead, and the items were things like:smoked salmon, smoked trout, homemade crepes made on the spot with any fruit you wanted them to make for you, root veggies, apricot, prune, mango fruit salad, all kinds of olives, lots of egg choices, and even homemade grits. The servers were friendly and helpful as well.The price for breakfast all you can eat was a good deal, especially since we just did not eat lunch after that meal anyway!  And Las Vegas charges so much for meals!I think Portland could learn a thing or two from the buffet here. There's a niche in this market that's waiting to happen. I mean it's kind of like a brunch and we do that quite well.If you have a VIP card, you get to cut the line. For being 35+ a person, this place is not the business. They have a good amount of options, but all very meh. To keep it real, the best thing IMO was the salad...which I made on my own. Lol. Even the dessert wasn't all that great. One thing I didn't like was that they don't tell you if the items are spicy. The guacamole I got was actually pretty darn spicy..not that I don't love spicy, but still.My dad got these clams, and he almost started crying because of the spiciness. Warn a brotha!Formally called, "The Oz Buffet," the MGM Buffet is a step lower than the Bellagio, Wicked Spoon, and Bachannal Buffet.  To me, it looks like an upscale Hometown Buffet with premium eats.  I bought a comp buffet pass from playing MyVegas and decided to give it a try since I'm always eating in the pricey buffets. The Buffet is located right on the left side of the casino by the strip entrance and across from Rain Forest Cafe.My buffet pass was only good for lunch and I made it a mission to make it all the way from the Cosmopolitan on time before they switched to dinner. =DThe food they serve here is typical in any other Vegas Buffet, like: Italian, Asian, Mexican, Seafood, Meat Station, Middle Eastern, and Japanese. Overall the food was just average and the customer service was on top of it's game. The surroundings weren't fancy or eye catching, just plain boring. No, "Wow Factor" at all.I expected better from MGM, since it's one of the biggest hotels in the Las Vegas and the world. They need to step up their game or they'll just end up being mediocre, like the Excalibur and Luxor Buffets. I'd sure eat here again, only if it were free.I was hoping for a gourmet buffet experience. I decided I wouldn't look at every rating and read reviews of everything prior to my trip to Vegas recently. Unfortunately the overall rating here is right on. Have you ever been to Golden Corral buffet? Well, GC is better than this buffet. BY FAR. Not only was the price for what you get, totally shit, it lacked amounts of offerings. Three dinky rows during dinner? Not worth it. They offer the buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We tried it for dinner on the first night and said nope, not coming here again. The prices on their website also are incorrect. It is $33 for the dinner buffet, and extra for any drink at all. I assume they fluctuate their pricing based on busy times.The best part was the dessert offerings. Save your $$ for gambling and just eat elsewhere.It's been about 10 years since I was to the MGM buffet.  There was no line at the register and the person at the register told me to go to the VIP line as I had a comp.The layout is different since they renovated some years ago.  I checked everything out first.  After looking around, I got a New York steak piece (not really NY steak) but it was OK and there was still a small amount of pink.  There were also creole shrimp and they were very good, very spicy!  I added a chicken cordon bleu which was not the best of my first selections.  The fried wonton were not good at all and should be avoided.  Rounding out the first plate was some pasta Bolognese which had a surprising amount of heat from ground red pepper.  It was pretty good for a buffet.  Someone wasn't afraid to spice things up a bit.For the second plate, I got some sushi roll slices which was standard buffet type.  I got two pieces of spicy Portuguese sausage which was quite good, and I went back for more of the pasta.  I loved the pepper heat of it.I had some carrot cake and a chocolate pudding for dessert.  These were standard buffet type desserts.  Nothing special but not bad.The staff was a little slow with bringing my first iced tea but when she did bring it, she brought two glasses at once which was nice.  The buffet is OK but for the price, I'd go to others which have a better selection of items.
Carrabba's=Located on the strip. . . not THE Strip, just a long, long strip of strip malls full of chain stores endlessly repeating themselves until you start to feel more than a little insane.  This eatery appears to be one of the better options amidst the sea of Applebees, Taco Bells, and Burger Kings.Standard American-Italian fare, is what you'll enjoy here, with lots of bread and large portions, which were quite welcome to our table of hungry hikers and climbers.  The tomato-basil soup was divine and the chicken marsala with mashed potatoes was A-ok.  My friend had some sort of lobster pasta that she was still swooning over the next day.  Service was energetic and pleasant.  Prices are higher than what you'll pay at other places on this "strip," but the food is noticeably better.  This is no destination restaurant, but if I found myself driving up and down Charleston again, I'd happily eat here again.Tip: If it's your first time here, don't try to big-time it and act like you've been here before.  If they learn you're a virgin to Carrabba's, you get free fried zucchini sticks!  (I might be a virgin every time! - Ladies, don't try that at home.)
Ben Thanh=Oh Joy! - Ben Thanh is a treasure!  Let me explain.  Years ago I started eating at Lang Van when it was just a  few weeks into a hasty neighborhood pharmacy renovation.  I got to know No Duong and her wonderful husband Robert and became a long and loyal fan.   For years it was the only Vietnamese restaurant in town for me.  Let me emphasize that it is still a very nice restaurant with good food and a great crowd (emphasize crowd lol!).  Then they sold out and moved to California and I was sad to find that Robert had had a serious stroke.   Now nearly twenty  years later and quite by accident I stumbled into Ben Thanh and there was Mai Duong,  sister of  No.  During this visit to Charlotte I have been here to Ben Thanh twice.  First I was amazed to see many of the old North Charlotte Art, Music, and Poetry crowd.  Mai is now all grown up with a great husband and wonderful children and owns the restaurant.  The food was excellent.  The first visit I had perfectly prepared shrimp and squid Pho. Actually to be proper this was the rice noodle variety called Hu Tieu Hai San. (#34 on menu)  It was fantastic!  On the next visit, this time with friends and old Lang Van pioneers, we had Curry Lemon Grass with shrimp and squid. (#78-81on the menu)   Very spicy and absolutely perfect.  Not over cooked so the squid was not the least bit rubbery.  I had my usual sparkling water and one of my friends had her traditional 33 Vietnamese  beer.  I hope I have time to go back for one of their Hot Pots. ( Tom, Buc, Bo and Lau, Thap Cam Chaua Cay to be proper.  # 82 and 83 on menu). This is a great dish in which you are served a great  bowl of noodles and broth along with a platter of assorted chicken, squid, beef, etc. that you add to the very hot  broth (it has it's own little heater).  This is accompanied by a large plate of greens, peppers, bean sprouts etc (as in Pho dishes).  It is a wonderful do- it yourself-at-your-own-table delight that is plenty for two people.  Check it out on their web site menu.  But the best tip I can give you is to ask Mai to just recommend something.  After a brief examination of your preferences regarding spice, noodles, rice, etc. She will make a perfect suggestion.  You can't go wrong.  All and all this place is just wonderful - the ghost of Lang Van past as it were and it will surly  be my new favorite when I come to Charlotte.Six yelp stars Fantastic! !  !  *** ***Like a significant first date I was here for the first time in September 2010.  A friend took me here and he ordered what he usually got  #40. Bun tom, Thit Nuong, Cha Gio (until this meal).  I ordered the Lemongrass Curry with Beef (having no idea if I would like it).  My friends dish came out first and I took one bite and said "wow I wish I would have ordered what you got"!  He said something like "I told you how good this place is".  Then my dish came out and I think the next several times we both ordered the Lemongrass Curry with Beep though it is very tasty with Chicken too. More than half of the time I get the Lemongrass Curry and my second Favorite is # 41. Bun Tom Nem Nuong Cha Gio: Grilled Pork, BBQ Shrimp, Pork Meatball, Imperial Roll, Carrots, Minced Peanuts and Cilantro on top of Vermicelli Noodles, Mint, Cucumber, Bean Sprouts with a Fantastic Fish Sauce.About half on the time I also get the Wonton Soup!  The Canh Chua Ga (Sweet and Sour Soup with Chicken is also good though it is entree sized.  The Vietnamese style of serving Coffee with Sweetened Condensed Milk is my Favorite and Dessert I like here.The Service is Perfect!  The Decor is umm, some may call it a hole-in-the wall and OK maybe it is... Who Cares - The Food is Spectacular!The neighborhood used to make me want to write a fast song and wait to sing it in my car!Lemongrass Curry is a "Gateway" Curry so watch it!  EAT it and see for yourself!My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. This place is such a gem! As they offer a good selection, you take just about anyone here for lunch. We recently took my boyfriend's mother and she was so in love. The waiter got the hint that she was Laotian and tried translating some of the dishes to their Lao counterparts for her to know what they are.Best things to get are the Bun Bo Hue (spicy noodle soup) or the Hu Tieu Mi (egg noodles in pork broth). You can never go wrong with Pho Dac Biet (combination rice noodle soup) either.
Terra Rossa=Had lunch here today - was bummed to learn that whatsherbucket from Hell's Kitchen doesn't work here any more.  I wonder if the food would've been any more "wow" if she did.  The restaurant is lovely and the servers very helpful (although in the interest of full disclosure I should note that we were dining with hotel staff, so. . . ).The food was okay.  We started with an antipasti platter with olives the size of my head, giant blocks of parmesan the size of my torso, and roasted peppers and artichoke hearts (both standard sized).  I also had a yummy piece of bread with cheese and herbs baked on top dunked in oil and vinegar.  A simple mixed greens salad was nicely dressed up by chucking some of the items from the antipasti platter on top.  The pasta was okay, the chicken was okay, the greens were too bitter for my taste, but my fellow diners loved them (and the salmon).The tiramisu was seriously good, with a sticky consistency to the mascarpone cream that made it super easy for me to imagine how well it'll stick to my hips.  I only had three bites and I'm pretty sure I can see them right where I imagined them going with the rest of the carbs I carelessly wolfed down.What an underwhelming dining experience! This was my first time EVER stiffing a waitress, the service was SO crappy that I honestly felt she should tip me for putting up with her for my meal. We arrived at July 18th around 7:10pm. We were greeted by a not-so-smiley hostess and seated at an extremely wobbly table. We sat unacknowledged for at least 5-8 minutes without being offered a menu, water, bread, ect. Once we were greeted, we let our server know that we had an 8:30 pm movie to catch. She took our drink orders, 5 minutes went by and then she came back to let us know they were out of Glenlivet  12, 18 and Glenfiddich Scotch. Acceptable, she doesn't do the liquor order... We picked new drinks; but when I finally got my margarita I immediately told her that I couldn't taste anything but straight sweet & sour. She laughed, kind of rolled her eyes and said she would get me more tequila. SHE DID NOT MENTION SHE WAS CHARGING ME FOR A PREMIUM TEQUILA SHOT! I have been a bartender on the strip for awhile now, so I know what a margarita should taste like. At this point, I looked around the restaurant. I took note that the people next to us had A BLACK PIZZA. I decided to avoid that entree and I mentioned to my bf that maybe we should just leave because I didn't see this place as improving. My menu was also inserted backwards, my place setting didn't have a napkin and our waitress seemed not interested in waiting on us. So maybe they just suck? 25 minutes into our meal we FINALLY got water & bread. Our orders were taken and we were placed. We don't see our server for awhile... 8:10 pm rolls around (20 mins until our movie) and we finally see our waiter. We ask her whats up. We say we are probably going to just have to skip the movie and she says "what, its only like 8pm?" She then smirked and walked over to the hostess stand... Wouldn't the right thing to do be go check on our food??? At this point, we are kind of frustrated because we feel we gave them plenty of time to cook a salmon and a piece of veal. 8:15 our food FINALLY arrives. We try to eat it super quick... Not exactly how you want to eat dinner... The food was decent. I felt my spinach was slightly over salted, but I ate it. My boyfriend liked his dish. We may actually have given this place a second try if our waitress wasn't so snotty and slow! We didn't have time for an app or dessert, Although you think an hour and a half would be enough time for a casual italian place?? She didn't offer my bf another scotch even though his was clearly gone... The surprise came when we got the bill. Our waitress had charged us for an extra patron shot... I was pretty furious. Why? Not because we cant afford to have as many shots of patron as we want, but because my margarita was absolutely wrong in the first place! AND the extra shot cost $12, somehow more than the margarita itself ($11). We asked to talk to a manager because we thought maybe he may want to know his server wasn't up to par; she wouldn't bring him over. SO we left. I would feel horrible for her support staff for not tipping, but to be honest I didn't see a busser or anything. They actually didn't pre-bus our bread plates or our cheese plates at all. I WONT BE BACK! Worse $100+ meal I have had in Vegas, and trust me I have had a lot. We have better service at the yard house. Heck, the Pinks Hotdog place is probably a better choice because at least their staff has some pride.  If you MUST eat here, at least make sure you don't get a short girl with a brown ponytail (Michelle)  as your server. Check total: $130.80Check #: 9143471
The Vig=I've been to The Vig a handful of times... for at least 4 lunches, a few times for just drinks / happy hour, and at least 2 dinners.  I think that is a fair amount of visits to justify the 4.5 star review rounded up to 5 stars that I am giving it now!I've always had friendly and attentive service, and I've never had a problem with the food or drinks I've ordered.  Granted, I've probably just ordered beer, iced tea, or water, but still :)I'm adding The Vig to my list of places to go for great sweet potato fries.  They also offer really yummy starters including the Vings (grilled wings), Grilled Veggie Platter, Hummus, and Ceviche.  At lunchtime, I recommend the Cobb salad although several friends of mine consistently order the Vig Azz Burger.  For dinner, I love their "Miso Hungry Salmon."  As mentioned in other reviews, their outdoor dining area and bocce court are just what Phoenix needs more of on a beautiful day or evening!  So much fun!If this beautiful weather continues, I'll be hanging out at The Vig again very soon!Nice.    I was thinking about writing a big long rant about how trendy/yuppy everyone at this place seemed to be but I thought "hey wait a second, I'm here too".Great food, great drinks, maybe just a bit pricey.  For a Wednesday night this place was packed.  Wonderful outdoor patio.Good thing you can park across the street so that way they can't see that you don't drive a Beemer and spit in your food.  There must be some sort of shuttle bus from North Scottsdale to this place every hour or something, or how else could you explain where all these beautiful people came from.Awful!  First, let me start by saying, I have waited nearly a week to cool down and write this.  In addition, I have worked in the restaurant industry for over six years.  I have cocktailed, managed, waited in fine dining and bartended.  This place is totally overrated, they need to shut down, hire new staff, and start over.  I went here last Friday night with some girlfriends for my birthday.  From the minute I walked in, I knew it was going to be a bad experience.  My party had already arrived and been sat, but I didn't know where and no thanks to the retarded hostesses that failed to greet me, took me 10 minutes just to find my party in the giant mess.  The place was WAY too crowded, the staff couldn't even get around and their sections were clearly too big for them. Once I found my friends on the patio, which is lovely, it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to greet us, and then another 10 for her to come back and take our drink order.  She then arrived with an appetizer my friends had ordered previous to my arrival but failed to bring silverware or plates.  Well, the spinach dip looked good, not sure how it tasted because by the time she remembered, it was cold.  After this it took another good 15 minutes just to order dinner and I figured I better get a drink in while I had the chance.  Food arrived, by now we actually had eating utensils.  The food was OK, nothing spectacular.  I had the shrimp appetizer and hummus, friends had the chicken sandwich, sweet potatoe fries and a cheese quesadilla (not many veggie options), oh and they charged her $9 for it.  The food was nothing to write home about.  After our meal was finished was when things got really bad.  A woman came up and asked for one of our chairs, we told her someone was sitting there, and her response was, "I just don't understand where all of our f-ing chairs went".  My immediate reaction was 1) you work here? 2) did you really just talk to a guest that way? and 3) I don't give a rats @$$ where your chairs are, stop interupting my birthday dinner and move along, that is not a problem for us to solve.  She started to step away, look around, and then had the audacity to return to the table, demand the chair from us and continue to argue with me.  I told her that my friend was in the restroom, she was still sitting there, which should have been evident by the fact that her dirty plate (along with all of ours) was still on the table, and her purse was in the chair and I demanded to speak to a manager.  Needless to say, she went away in a huff.  At this point we decided it was time to leave.  Waited another 10-15 minutes for the check, only to have a birthday brownie and candle arrive as I was standing up to leave.  Where was that 20 minutes ago when we were finished with dinner?  Oh, and by the way, bad waitress, you took all of my silverware away.  At this point I told the waitress about all of the issues, the manager never did appear, maybe they don't have one, it sure would explain a lot.  She did offer to comp one of our appetizers, but at this point I didn't care, she had already charged us our bill!  To top it all off, as I was leaving, the hostess and wine steward/manager/not sure but he was in a suit, were having a playful little fight in which they were slapping each others butts and bending over....great first impression, and last might I add, in the entry way.  After the girl almost slapped me I politely excused myself and walked around her to exit the place, NEVER to come back.  There are so many better places in the valley to go: Postino, Chelsea's, Radio Milano, Portlands, Barrio Cafe, La Grande Orange, Houston's, Merc Bar, Zen 32, Tarbell's, City Hall, Rokerji, Phoenix City Grill, Sierra Bonita, etc., all within a few miles, why would I bother coming to this yuppie place ever again?  Needless to say, the service was HORRIBLE and the food wasn't good enough to make up for it.  Oh, and the people that go here: I might as well stay up in North Scottsdale, it's the same yuppie, "I'm so important"/30K millionaire crowd that has taken over what used to be the great city of Scottsdale.  It's sad, I really wanted to like this place and it has the potential to be fabulous...if they just start over.Don't waste your time or your money.Dear Vig Hater,If you don't like going to places with snobby, "Scottsdale" patrons, don't pick a restaurant/bar that looks trendy, has trendy menu descriptions, and describes itself as a "modern tavern." If you want something more laidback, find yourself a local spot with a more casual feel and leave the Vig alone!ChristineDear Christine,It's definitely possible that a trendy place draws a crowd who either is or considers themselves trendy, but I have another problem with the Vig: it's in a sketchy neighborhood! I don't feel comfortable coming here at night or parking next to the check cashing place. Vig HaterDear Vig Hater, The area around the Vig borders Arcadia, considered one of the nicest neighborhoods in Phoenix. I wonder where you live that you consider this area "ghetto." If you have an aversion to check cashing joints and Circle Ks, I strongly suggest you never make the field trip to Pizza A Metro.ChristineDear Christine,But isn't the food at the Vig not that great?Vig HaterDear Vig Hater,There, I'm going to have to meet you in the middle. My veggie sandwich (called "The Vigan") with a side of sweet potato fries was really well-prepared, but I can see some of the other dishes being more amusingly-named than well-executed. Since this place is only two minutes from my office, I plan to go back for happy hour or dinner. I will definitely update when I do. ChristineTO BE CONTINUED...Dear Vig Hater,I went back to The Vig for happy hour a few weeks ago, and I'm going to have to officially declare my disagreement with you. Even thought it was ridiculously crowded (and we had to wait for a seat on the patio at a mere 5 p.m.!), I thought the happy hour scene was dynamic and exciting; people were having a lot of fun, and the whole place felt alive. Plus, the well drinks were really cheap and the duck & mushroom quesadilla I had was really well-executed and satisfying. I would return here for lunch or happy hour in a second, and that my friend, makes for a five-star experience. ChristineThe Vig has DEFINITELY become one of my very favorite spots, so I am doing an update. You absolutely have to sit out on the patio for the best experience! Especially this time of year (early spring). Try the artichoke dip and the Alfredo tortellini with a glass of the Kung Fu Girl Riesling. I'm serious. If you don't, you are making the worst mistake of your life! The service is always friendly and pretty quick. Pam, the manager, is normally bopping around making sure everything is running smooth. I don't mind walking across the street to park, and it is super cool that they have The Vig Rig ... a free van that will pick you up AND take you home, all for a tip! I have never taken the Rig, but I keep the card handy in my wallet should I ever have an insatiable need to visit the Vig once I am already imbibed. Or without vehicle. Also, it is worth a trip to the bathrooms. They are really cool and smell so great!When Jared suggested The Vig as a dinner option tonight, I jumped on it... I hadn't been there in ages and on a night like tonight with perfect weather, who wants to eat inside?  Not us!So we headed over there... and enjoyed another positive experience - for just $30 too!  Actually, it was $35 with Valet parking (my pet peeve).  We were seated outside right away and service was attentive... I was disappointed to see that the menu changed and my old standby favorite salmon entree was no more.  I decided to try the new salmon entree despite a totally different preparation (it went from teriyaki to a spicy achiote pepper rubbed grilled version).  It was ok - not great, but the side of corn cake it came with was uhmazing.  Jared had a grouper special that was tasty as well.  We used our will power and did not order the sweet potato fries tonight, but I am still kind of wishing we did!After dinner, we played a quick couple games of bocce ball - beware, there is a kitty cat that hangs out on the 'court.'  We mistook it for an injured rabbit for a moment, but were happy to see it was just resting!  I'm sure we won't wait so long to return to The Vig again soon!Okay Pro: the atmosphere on any spring sunday on the patio makes it worth five stars all by itself.Con: can't I get a well drink special on said sundays?Pro: half off all bottles of wine though!  even my favorite, sonoma cutrer.Con: the manager (who was named after a cooking spray, no more info than that for you) doesn't appreciate drunk stupidity.  I know this, because she doesn't appreciate me when I'm drunk and stupid--according to sources--and i am the very epitome of drunk stupidity.  Now, wouldn't you, if you were a bar manager, realize that the very life blood of your business is drunk ppl making bad decisions?  Come ON people?Sorry about the aside.  Pro: the quesadilla they have is goddamn good--it even has shrooms in it which I ordinarily avoid.  But solid food, drink, and atmosphere give this place 5 stars for me.  With a 1 star deduction:)If it is Sunday, I am at The Vig.I love Sunday at The Vig so much that I made my family come for Easter dinner.I can get a bottle of my favorite wine (Kung Fu Girl Riesling) for $15 and sit there drinking it all day on the patio whilst listening to covers of songs that my band also covers, except they sound so much better when 1) I'm drunk and 2) The Daelins are playing them.My only beef is that some of the douchettes that come got my squirt guns taken away. Next time I will just dump water on your head and you will shrivel up like the Wicked Witch of the West. Also, The Vig is singlehandledly going to fill up my new website: www.uradoosh.comUmmmmmmm. 32 douche bags in camouflage pants and an endless supply of cougars pretty much sums up my Thursday night at The Vig. I was wicked wicked excited to try this spot because everyone else seems to love it so much. Even though my first impression of the crowd wasn't the greatest, I too, am a fanFantastic wine options, many bottles were split amongst friends and no-one, not even my asshole connoisseur friend complained. If I weren't so intoxicated, I would be able to tell you what exactly it was, that I was drinking.. but I cant.. Carmen something? Their menu is awesome, lots of variety. The Double Down Hummus plate is the shit. Lovely outdoor seating area to boot. I hear Sundays are the best to come, mostly for their phenomenal drink specials. I could really see myself loving this place in late October.. not only because it is my favorite time of year, but also because there is nothing better than scarves and boots, wrapped in a shawl, enjoying the autumn air with a nice glass of Cabernet.g and i drive up and see the valet sign - $2. really? you offer no onsite parking except valet and you require me to pay for it? i will tip ... i always tip. but actually charge a fee? ugh. so not classy. that started things off on the wrong foot. g and i were the last to show up. our group of 6 was seated at a table on the patio that was clearly made for four, five at the most. i was smashed between  two others - i'm all for being the peanut butter, but this was absurd - i spent the meal dodging elbows. tables were too high or the seating was too low. either way, it made for an awkward and uncomfortable dinner. the staff had to notice the awkward arrangement - i don't know how you could miss it. anyway, onto the food ... well, it was fine. my caesar salad was fine, as one might expect - it is pretty hard to screw up caesar salad. g had the wings and the sauce was more bbq-y than buffalo-y. the menu seemed to be a bit pretentious: words like "deconstructed" and "dauphinoise" litter it. the energy was really, really strange. yes, it is a modern pub, but i kind of expected more. and yes, the valet situation and the place's creepy energy really irked me.One of my best friends sends me a text that she's having dinner with her mother and I should join them.  There was an hour wait, so I had plenty of time to throw something on and make myself look presentable.I show up and the place is packed.  Crazy busy.  Full of men.  The place is a meat market.   I spot my friend and her mom, who have known me since I was 12, in a dark corner below a TV screen.  I haven't been to dinner with my friend's mother since we were in high school.  It seems they have had a little wine, well my friend had a little and her mom apparently drank a whole bottle before she even got to the restaurant. I perused the menu while my friend's mom tells me that she doesn't want to date divorced men because there must be something wrong with them.  She herself is divorced and in her fifties- what else is there?  I decided on the gnocchi because good gnocchi is like crack to me.  It was rather delicious, but I would have swapped the edemame for peas.  Nobody like peas anymore except for me, I guess they're just not cool. I start to feel like I need some air.  There are so many damn people and I can't possibly scoot my chair in any further to let more by.  As soon as my gnocchi was no longer occupying my attention I felt like I just needed to get the fuck out of there.  Something about the atmosphere made me uncomfortable.  I'm not deducting a star because it could have been the awkward conversation with my friend's mother about how she would rather be alone than date someone another woman didn't want.  I don't know how that even makes sense, every woman has been with a man she doesn't want anymore.  It doesn't seem to bother my ex's new girl.   I would give this place five stars if it was a little less popular.  It won't keep me from coming back, but next time I'm sitting in a booth where random people won't be bumping into me or hanging over my table all night.  Although, that will probably only add to the wait time.I love The Vig. I've been on so many first dates at this place I've often worried that the staff was going to think I was receiving compensation for my...ahem.. "services". It's just easy, (unlike myself) truth be told, most of those first dates were last ones as well. :)The food is decent. Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken seems to be my meal of choice. It's quite good, even with my aversion to mixing fruit and meat. Half price bottles of wine on Sundays!! ... I really don't even need to continue the review at this point, but I will.The only things I don't like about The Vig are : (1)  the polished concrete floors. I've slipped and fallen (sober mind you) on more than one occasion. Yes, I wear 5" heels just about everywhere I go. So yes, partially my fault. (2) Men old enough to be my father coming on to me like they think I don't see the tack marks behind their ears from their nasty face lifts. It grosses me out. I can handle the young DB's, these guys make my skin crawl. If I'm avoiding eye contact with you or have a constipated look on my face this is NOT game on buddy...mmmkay I have few other complaints. Good music, interesting crowd, love the forced valet so I don't have to end any of those first dates awkwardly hovering at my car door like a 16 year old. Sweet deal if you ask me!Every time I visit AZ, I find myself at The Vig following an evening of hardcore Scottsdaling, and this trip was no different. Although I have missed out on the Sunday Fundayness of The Vig, I can easily understand how it gets hoppin'!  The outdoor patio is spectacular for lounging, glass clinking and chatting, and when you add music, you can see how the place would just light up.My experiences have been less rock n roll and more just rock-esque, but wonderful nonetheless. This past time we were waiting for a friend to join us and we were starving (read: hung over), so I asked the gentleman filling up my lemonade (refreshing and just enough tart for my taste buds) if he could bring us some bread (which I don't believe is customary), but ask and you shall receive must be The Vig's motto, because that is exactly what happened. It wasn't a half-ass attempt either, it was a country loaf with a butter marmalade spread in the middle. Delightful!Then came my Hot Chick (which I ordered for obvious reasons) - their version of a sensational toasted sandwich (grilled chicken breast, arugula, roasted tomato and smoked mozzarella served with spicy avocado spread on ciabatta). I only ate half because of the generous portion of vig rings accompanying the 'wich. They were so well prepared and struck the perfect balance of onion and ring!Another exceptional dining sesh at The Vig. One of these days I will go for just their cocktails (this eating thing is getting out of control)!We met friends for a 7pm dinner tonight (Wednesday) at The Vig... We sat outside and Cesar was our waiter.  There was a live jazz trio playing and we were also paid a visit from our kitty cat friend.The menu changed since my last visit which was some time ago.  I recognized many Old Standby items, but some new ones too... We started with drinks - I had a glass of Malbec, the boys each had beer, and our pregnant friend had a virgin mojito.  And while the five spice edamame appetizer was missing a spice or three, we still managed to eat most of it.  For main courses, I went for the Veggie Korma, J had the decomposed fish tacos, Jeremy had the Steak Salad and Johanna enjoyed the chicken sandwich.Next time I'll hope to try the new Vig, but this one is super close, convenient, and fun.  I still highly recommend it after all of these years!I went to my monthly philosophical gathering last Friday...we examine, ponder and discuss some of the more esoteric aspects of life!I had so much fun!It's 2-3 hours of defining, questioning, cussing, discussing, opining, agreeing, disagreeing...well, you get the drift...last week's topic was "What is Art?"I did not know that people felt as passionately about art and artistic expression as they do...and that includes me:)Normally, I would try to have a couple of pops before a discussion like this (that's to honor Socrates, Aristotle, Plato and their students...their sessions were often drunken debauches and the last man standing was the "winner" in the philosophical debate of the evening...good times:)But I didn't ...I was stone cold sober for this discussion...I might have even made sense! After we finished our discussion, several of us decided that a cocktail was a very good idea and headed to the Vig...I know, you thought it was hip nightspot, but it's really renowned throughout the Valley of the Sun as a philosopher's hangout.Nice place...all concretey from the outside, all wood and fabric and leathery inside...pretty...even "artistic":)When we got to the Vig, the scholarly discussions were occurring at full volume all around us:)* "Gimme a cig"* "DUDE!!!!"* "Don't look...it's Cindy and Darrel"* "Hey Baby...wanna go see my (car, house, dog, condo, wiener, etc.)"And much, much more...accompanied by enormous clouds of cigarette smoke (another aid to a good philosophical discussion).We sat and chatted and had a couple of pops...and I would have said that The Vig was A-OK...except for one minor philosophical disagreement...you, Mr. Waitperson, don't get to unilaterally upgrade my order to something far more expensive!I had no idea who was going to be buying (although it turned out to be me) and I ordered J&B with a cube and a splash (I didn't want to put the hurt on my philosophically minded buddies by ordering the expensive stuff:)...but when the waiter brought my drink, I knew instantly that this wasn't J&B...it was Macallan 12!And while I do love it so, it was almost 3 times as expensive as the J&B...I asked the waiter why he didn't bring what I ordered and he said...and I quote..."quote"..."The bartender is a scotch guy and said this is better"...end quote.No sh*t!I quietly said "I didn't order the Macallan...are you saying this is going to be the same price as the J&B?Oh no...it wasn't:(But as my waitperson said..."It's already poured...what do you want me to do about it?"I could have made a scene, caused a problem, left a $0.10 tip...but I didn't...this was philosophy night...I was in a philosophical mood!And my philosophy is this...I have a giant problem with any establishment that pulls this kind of crap...it may only be an isolated incident, but it could also be systemic....how many drunks check their tabs?I know, you're saying "well, Donald, it's only the difference between $5.50 and $14.00 for that drink", and you would be right...I spill more than that most days:)But I get to decide what I spill it on...not the bartender and waitperson at The Vig. At best it's corrupt and at worst, it's, well...worse than corrupt.From what I've heard, The Vig is quite the hot spot for bronzed local youngsters to collaborate over food, fun, and the occasional dabble in over-imbibing on Sunday Funday. While I can't say I've had the opportunity to day drink in this lovely venue, I can attest that they don't do a bad job with the food + fun part.Popped in last night for a little post-work snack, and it's pretty clear that the place is a veritable who's who with enough good looking people milling about to to fill an auditorium of extras for the set of Bring It On 3 (was there even a pt. 2?). In addition to smiling 20-somethings with Adonis DNA, the food was also pretty interesting and had options for just about every type of eater (carnivorous, health conscious, vegan, et al.). Because I've been on a bit of a plant kick as of late, I went with the Vigan (very clever working in the name of the establishment with the sandwich itself), and while I did have to ask to remove the Mozzarella cheese to make it a truly vegan entree, the sauteed portabella mushrooms, squash, red peppers and caramelized onions sandwiched between soft, rectangular focaccia with a side of onion rings was enough to leave me satisfied while wading in unknown dining waters. They also featured a pretty impressive 5-spice edamame appetizer, but their guacamole left a little to be desired. I take my whipped avocado seriously being that I hail from the avocado capital of the world, and while it's much like pizza in that even bad guacamole is still pretty good, it certainly fell somewhere towards the bottom end of the bland spectrum.On a nice night in Phoenix, something I experience very, very rarely in San Francisco, I can't imagine there are many better places that offer up a sprawling patio like theirs to soak up a warm evening in the city. In the immortal words of Charlie Sheen, "Winner!"It makes me sad to have to write this update... Almost.  Let me just start by saying that I am not all that difficult to please, although my bf may disagree.  But seriously, I waitressed and cocktailed my way through college, both in bars and fine dining restaurants which makes me almost TOO forgiving when it comes to poor service since I know how many things can go wrong that aren't particularly the wait staff's fault.  This was not the case here.    We arrived on a Monday evening to meet some friends for dinner and drinks.  We chose the spot expressly for the fact that both my friend and I had purchased Care Cards that benefit charity while giving you a 20% discount at participating retailers during Oct 14 - 23.  The Vig claimed to be one of these businesses.  Our party turned into about 7, and I had been seated for 15 minutes before our server came over to ask if I was thirsty.  I ordered a bottle of beer.  I see her next about 10 min later when she is delivering food to the table, although my beer is no where in sight.  She asks my companion if they want another, I politely let her know that I still had not received my first.  ANOTHER 10 minutes goes by, and my beer is finally delivered to the table.  In the meantime, my food had arrived.  They changed the menu and took my beloved seared sea scallops off and replaced them with Pad Thai (WTF?! there is no shortage of Thai offerings in the neighborhood) but they did add a few more healthy salads which is nice so I ordered a deconstructed fish taco salad.  This was the standout of the evening, and the reason for the 2nd star.  It is one of the best salads (healthy) I have had in recent memory.  Huge piece of perfectly grilled fish, crunchy salad with cilantro, salsa, guac, and black beans and cute little hot corn tortillas on the side.  As the evening winds down, we ask for the check.  My friend had presented her Care Card when she first arrived with her husband, yet when the waitress brought the bill, there was no discount taken off.  Fine.  We see her about 5 min later and remind her.  10 min later she comes back with a revised bill with a whole $4.20 taken off.  Our check was $200.  I was no math major, but come now. After another 5 minute wait, I asked her why only $4 was taken off, she informed me bc only what the Care Card holder ordered had been discounted.  This was also bullsh!t because my friend ordered more indeed.  I asked to speak to the manager, and informed her that I also had a card.  Nowhere on the exclusions did it say: will only discount on the items the card holder orders (the nerve!).  We are all one party, with one check - and if you are participating in a charity benefit- effing do so!  They are providing you with free advertising and 7 customers you would not have had otherwise on a Monday night!  I have to use the restroom, so my friend says she will speak to the manager.  I walk back to the table to see a brown haired dude (the manager) rolling his eyes as he walks away assuring my friend he will "take some more off".  We wait another 10 minutes.  I wish I was joking.  She comes back and presents the bill with $15 taken off the total.  I have never experienced such poor service and attitudes.  Sadly, this was not the first time this has happened in the year that I have lived down the street and probably frequented this place 2-3 times a week at my peak infatuation with the Vig.  But just like most relationships, what starts out all champagne and roses eventually turns into complacency and laziness which is why I am dumping the Vig.  It's not me, it's you.  You may look cute on the outside, but your personality sucks and I certainly won't introduce you to anymore of my friends.  I will never date you again, and I vow the only time I will ever contact you  in the future is if I'm already drunk and decide to meet up with you late night, but it won't mean anything.Came here last night with a fellow yelper and it was both of our first times here.  I've heard great things about the Vig in the past, and have been meaning to stop in for some time.The Vig is really a great little spot.  Plenty of seating, with a full bar and menu.  Staff here is awesome, and I love the way the place is decorated.  Enormous patio, decent bar seating, and plenty of great people watching.  Menu has a variety of options, and we went with the Artichoke dip with chips.  I stuck with a resling wine, and it was great.  There's TV's at the bar, along with plenty of space to move about.Place has a great feel, and I would gladly return in the future.  The parking here is a bit tight, and I did valet for only $3.  If you don't want to do valet, you can park across the street in the lot and stroll across.The Vig boasts one heck of a patio. Imagine sitting on an enclosed patio with friends, live music and twinkle lights. This is how it feels at The Vig. The Vig reminds me of a friend's home who has a great patio. It's easy to spend hours sitting on the patio and enjoying some good food and drinks. Plus on the weekends, you'll most likely enjoy live music as well! First of all, I love that they have freshly squeezed cocktails, including a delicious greyhound with fresh squeezed grapefruit! Their food here is delicious as well and I especially love their sandwiches and sweet potato fries. On a healthy day, I opt for the deconstructed fish taco which is fish and all the toppings that you can pick and choose to eat from. All in all, the reviews speak for themselves. The Valley could use more Vig's around town!Came here the other day with a few friends for lunch. I have never been to this location before only the one on 16th street.Same type of deal here. To park in their lot you must Valet. Which is free at lunch, but costs @ Dinner.Any way 3 of us were lined up,they must of been a little over whelmed 11:30am. We had our cars parked and proceeded inside.Nice restaurant, very cozy inside despite the Concrete walls. I see it as very 60's modern and I love it!. We were seated where inside meets outside, the patio is wonderful. It is my favorite part of the setting.Food was very good,awesome actually.  The entire party really enjoyed what they got. Our server was nice, but he was on a very slow mode. I know we waited over 30 min for our food to come out. There was 4 of us and it was lunch time. But, I really think they need more servers. Because, they really seemed over whelmed. Luckily we had a lot of time for a long leisurely lunch.But, had we of been on a schedule it would not of been cool.Bathrooms are clean ,nicely designed ,but very dark. Yes I looked good in the mirror, but reality was it was sunny outside, and I was not going to look so good out there! Oh well! HeeheeI  will diffidently come back. I like the atmosphere and the Food is good.Though you spend a little more than you would may have planned because, then you have to tip the valet a few $$. So be prepared for that.I was lucky I had some cash with me. More and more I never carry cash.Oh Vig, you simply sucked!!! Such a waste of time and money. The food and service here was awful, all except for the girl at the door the night we were there, which was on February 16th she was pretty nice. She was they only exception though, the guy at the bar was such a flirt, but in a very uncomfortable way. Then after waiting for our party at the bar we decided to move to a table and enjoy our drinks there. Then we come to realize that our server was a real stuck up and rude girl, that was nowhere to be found when needed and that took forever to come back to our table for assistance or further request! I don't think that's acceptable, we had to get other servers attention to get things for our table. Then after all that hassle, we stumble upon the nastiest nachos ever and okay drinks and wine, this was just plain awful and not worthy of your time nor mine!! Never again, never again!!!!!happy hour! they have a pretty darn good one. 1/2 off happy hour prices on their specific menu...we opted for the fish tacos....4 small tacos with a side of a rather spicy hot and delicious guacamole style sauce. excellent!i had 2 kiltlifters at 2 bucks off the standard menu. the wife and her friend had 2 premium cocktails for the same price. there are plenty of options for food and drink and their happy hour prices are top notch. the place itself is very cool. we sat outside, and yes, it was a tad bit warm. it's all shaded and misted but it was still warm. no matter as the food and beverages cooled us down. service was good. our water glasses stayed completely filled the entire time and our server was prompt and courteous, without being overbearing. but valet...i swear, i could live my whole life and not ever use valet. i understand the concept when dealing with small parking lots where numerous people park and/or you can get ticketed for parking in another properties lot, but i hate it. especially mandatory valet. well, i guess it's not mandatory, but anyway....i really enjoyed this place!If you like to gamble, and by gamble I mean serious sports betting, then you're all too familiar with the term vig. (short for vigorish)Which is why I've avoided this place for so long, the name simply repulsed me. No wait. It didn't repulse me. It dredged up bad (really bad) images of Super Bowl 36, where that piece of shit Tom Brady staged a last minute comeback, killing my point spread. This is about the time you learn what a vig is, and how much it means to a bookie.Fuck. I digress, sorry.The Vig is full of good looking people, so the ambiance gets high praise.Food is well above average, try the Thai Chili Chicken Wings. Coors Banquet served in old fashioned 12 ounce bottles had me fantasizing I was a cattle rustler in the old west. Crowded on a Wednesday night, our crew sat on the patio. It was hot out and I got a bad case of swamp ass. Luckily, I carry a small ziplock of gold bond mentholated powder which resembles about $10,000 worth of coke. The guy in the men's room who saw me putting it on my butt thought I was crazy. I told him coke on your sack is quite the experience if you can afford it.  After that, my ass felt like it was smoking Newports throughout dinner, enjoying my  Vig experience for the first time since Super Bowl 2002.Anyway, I like this place and you probably will too. Wait till the weather cools off if you're going to sit on the patio, or else have some mentholated butt powder handy.I have been to Vig for many an afternoon, happy hour, lunch and dinner. I live not far from there and I can promise this: The Vig is very, very popular. The Basics:+ Casual (like 85% of Phoenix). There are TVs inside.+ HH is M-F 3-6pm. ($2 off cocktails, $1.5 off drafts, $1 off domestic beer & well drinks)+ 1/2 priced wine on Sundays+ Elvis Before Noon plays on Sunday (time varies depending season, 6pm in summer, earlier when it's not god awful hot.) Great cover band. If you come once you'll know the rotation. + The Vig Rig will scoop up Arcadia residents. (Free!) 602-722-5976. Fr/Sa 5pm-2am. Su 2pm-10pm.+ Parking is tight. Bring cash for the valet. Otherwise play Frogger and park across 40th street. Far enough from Mamma Mia that no one gets upset.)+ And yes. That is a Vig cat you see leisurely making rounds. Don't pet him if you're allergic to cats. Stop complaining about it.+ Follow them on Facebook to catch specials. (A current summer special is $4 Titos Vodka for the summer.)+ Additionally look at their website calendar for deals. (Ex: Twenty-Twosdays = 1 app + a bottle of wine.)SEATINGMisters abound outside. Fireplace in the winter. Lighting almost makes you feel like you're in someone's backyard. Booths line one wall inside that seat four.People really want to sit outside. ESPECIALLY when Elvis Before Noon plays. If you have any interest in nabbing a seat on Sunday come early. It's ridiculous. Otherwise there is a bar setup in the back. People have been known to dance in the middle of everything. Kind of like watching someone shimmy at a wedding. You don't want to watch, but you can't help stare, in open fascination with your mouth open.FOODPretty good. And plenty of options for vegetarians and individuals who eat healthy. The sides are excellent to nibble on. (I'm a fan of sweet potatoes.) Can't go wrong with the guac and chips or "double down" hummus. Salads are delicious. My favorite is the prickly pear. Sharing is fun with the smoked salmon or deconstructed fish tacos. I've never met a daily flat bread I didn't like. (Note: These can be made vegetarian. The Vig will just remove meat. No additional customizations.) I've shared the banana bread pudding more times than I can count. (Shh!)MISCThis is a popular first date spot. I've run into other first dates here. I have NO idea why so many men want to take women here. Seating might be tough and you'll be hovering in the aisle trying to get a drink. Alternatively, you'll be seated up front waiting for a booth to open. (The Vig unfortunately doesn't have little beepers to hand out.) This place is kid friendly. But only in the way people bring tiny human beings and sprinkle them in with a bar crowd. I have no idea why this happens.And that's The Vig!The Vig has four locations:Arcadia, Fillmore, McCormick Ranch, UptownThis was my first visit to The Vig Arcadia. I had to meet a friend for lunch and he chose The Vig. I had heard a lot of great things about The Vig Arcadia, so I had high hopes.Although the atmosphere is super cute and intimate, it borders on too closet-y tiny when the restaurant starts filling up. I got there early, so I sat at the bar and decided to check my phone. My battery was very low, so I asked the bartender to point out the closest outlet, or I suggested she could take my phone, so she could charge it behind the bar. Unfortunately, the self-proclaimed "staff manager" was rude and positional beyond belief, which are literally the only 2 qualities a server doesn't need to have.Me: "Hi! I'm m waiting for a friend for lunch, do you mind plugging my phone and I'll have a greyhound."- We don't have outlets. Me: "Well, that isn't exactly the true, because everything in this bar is using electricity, including the blender you just used, so what you're really saying is that you can help me, you just don't want to. I find it shocking that an upscale restaurant in Scottsdale doesn't have outlets."- This is Arcadia, not Scottsdale. At that point, as she was completely rambling about the difference between Scottsdale and Arcadia, as well as the status of the electrical systems and a fierce desire to convince me that an upscale establishment doesn't have outlets. "Obviously, there are outlets in restaurant. Clearly, you just don't WANT to plug in my phone."I asked to speak to the manager, which apparently they didn't have one of those either or she wasn't allowing me access to him. I did still had hope that she might serve me that greyhound. Anyway, my friend arrived and we moved from the bar to a table. Then, the second part seems almost like were at another bar altogether. A new waitress cheerily gave us waters, told us the specials, said she would give us a minute, and was gone. She came back a minute later and took our order. All the appetizers arrived in minutes. The food was delicious. The server was a delight. The Menu:AppetizersArtichoke Kale Jalapeño Dip (which I had)Steamed Edamame (which I had)Guacamole & Chips (which I had)FlatbreadsNachosHot WingsSaladsSandwiches BurgersMains:Vanilla Braised Short Rib Tacos (which I had)Fish TacosMan n CheeseGrilled SalmonPad ThaiDessertsI have to say the the vanilla braised short rib tacos are some of the best food I ever put in my mouth. It's a shame to see an owner and the chef putting so much effort into making the restaurant a success, lose an extreme amount of business just because of one argumentative server who can leave such a lasting impression on customers. There is limited parking out front. Valet service is available. Hours:Sat/Sun 10am - 2amMon - Thur 11am - 2amFor more information:thevig.usI give The Vig 1/5 stars for putting a hot head up front to deal with customersOVERALL, I 4/5 highly recommend The Vig Arcadia!
Nanay Gloria's=Yes another Filipino Food Buffet.Yes we ate a buffet with food we could have had here at home in SD.Yes WOWOWEE was on the tv and we watched while we ate.Yes, I know, why do all that in Vegas?Don't judge me.Food was good! You know why? Because they had SISIG!! Spicy too!! YUM!Masarap ang lutong ni Nanay Gloria! (Nanay Gloria's cooking is good). The food was pretty decent and nicely flavored. We were surprised at the selection- we were expecting to have maybe half the choices offered.From what I recall there was- mungo (mungbean with bittermelon and pork), - pretty okay, but I make it better since mine is very meaty/savorypaksiw baboy (pork slices in a sweet soy sauce), * - BF loved this. Sweet, sticky, but nice flavors. ginesang pusit (sauteed squid w/ chilies, and bellpepper), *- I really liked this. Right on with the flavors.pancit (thin glass noodles),- was okay sisig (chopped pork with vinegar, chilies and onion), *- made with the lechon kawali, lots of chilies, added more vinegar for a kickginetaang baboy (pork in coconut &shrimp paste sauce), *- this was good. I love coconut milk based disheslechon kawali (crispy fried or roasted pork belly), - good, crispy. Like always, big layer of fat, but at least you can pick it off it you're not a fat lover. lengua estofada (beef tongue slices in a tomato soy sauce)* - the tongue was really soft, but I like how they kept them in thick slices to keep it juicy inside. The sauce was good, but I scraped a lot off since I like tasting more of the lengua flavorafritada manok (chicken in a tomato sauce- has bellpepper, potatoes, carrot),- I didn't tryginisang (squash, shrimps, green beans, bittermelon sautee)- grabbed only some green beans, okayginisang ampalaya (bittermelon sauteed with eggs)- didnt tryseafood ginetaang (mixed seafood in coconut milk)- didnt trydiniguan (pork cooked in it's blood and spices)*- pretty decent for the standard style of doing diniguan. I do it in a different style which no restaurant makes and I feel is tons betterpalabok (thick rice noodles in a sortve "gravy" sauce)- mushy, didnt likepork afritada (pork tomato sauce stew- has peas, potatoes, hotdog, bellpeppers)- had a small bite only, decentNilaga Baka (beef broth soup with chunks of beef and veggies like bokchoy, cabbage, potato)- didn't havekaldereta (beef stew)- pretty decent, but a bit more oily than I make itkare kare (oxtail, tripe, eggplants and green beans in a thick peanut sauce)- no oxtails to be found, way too oily, but the tripe was nice in it.beef steak (sliced beef and onions in soy sauce)- this was okay...it was straight soy...lacking that signature sauce lemony/soy/beefy flavor fried salmon- didnt tryfried bangus/milkfish*- pretty good! my favorite fish and it was fresh. pata na paksiw (pork leg/hocks cooked in soy and banana flowers)- didnt try, I dont really like the fatty leg rimsginetang (warm coconut milk dessert with sweet yams and tapioca)- too full to have dessertbanana que (bananas fried with sugar) - too full to have dessertfresh fruit bar- watermelon, oranges, pineapple, etc. - looked freshThe * are some of our favorites. BF really loved the paksiw- tender and nice flavor, I love the lengua the best. There are some extras you can buy but we were hella full to grab them. They have chicken empanadas, crispy pata (deep fried pork leg), sweets like polvoron (powdered milk "cookie"), pastillas (chewy milk candies), cashew tarts, tamarind candy, turon (fried banana and jackfruit "eggroll" cooked with a coating of sugar on the wrapper), kuchinta (steamed rice cake), pichi-pichi (rice and cassava cake rolled in grated coconut).  BTW- they are CASH ONLY. Lucky I had cash today, I normally don't roll with much more than a few bucks for tips and my cards. Simply put- compared to the Filipino a-la-carte places nearby, this is better in terms of quality and flavor and freshness (they have decent traffic so it doesn't sit forever). Add in the kicker that you can eat all you want for $7!. Some items were a miss like the palabok was mushy, but most were decent to good, spot on flavors. I can't complain since I can pick and choose what I want to eat and can skip out on the a-ok items and pig on the things I love. Yes, there's a bit of fat, a bit of grease, but nothing that you can't scoop out. It's kinda part of the culture...Flipinos enjoy their fat. It's not  really more than say other greasy cuisines like diner food, chinese, soul food, etc.. It's why I don't eat out all the time though is so I can savor these when I do decide to eat something greasy and homey.  I think that's partly why MY mother's food is best to me- she tends to buy only higher end, leaner meats, but cooks with all the love and flavor. I got used to my moms health conscious, yet still flavorful Filipino, but she's no where close so I'll take something 2nd best to moms cooking....specially since I don't cook my own cultures food on a regular at home (for shame, I know and I call myself a "cook"). Will definitely be back!I give it a 3 1/2 stars.My Pilipino Peeps say Nanay Gloria's is great!  "Hoi nakong, you will bee pull!  Da beep-stek is delicious!" I was told by an older patron, which I think thought I was one of her relatives.  Oh well, we do what we do!  Be respectful and tell nanay 'salamat'.  Nanay Gloria's is a Filipino eatery, they do either choices with rice and soup, or you can go for the gusto and do the all-you-can-eat-especially-if-you-love-pork option for about $7.50.  Do the buffet folks!  It's worth it if you have the time and are familiar with a lot of the dishes offered.  Which day to day will differ, but it's a good thing especially if you don't mind change.  We manage to always miss breakfast at Nanay Gloria's.  Some say it is probably the best meal they serve.  Rice, eggs, tocino, tomatoes, sweet longanisa (oh how I relish those potent loganisa burps), what's not to like?  And for a buffet?  Even better!  And with the breakfast buffet usually the lunch items are already mixed in there as well.  Brunch if you will.  All for the same price!  If you're gonna go, go BIG I say.We usually get here for lunch and there's often a crowd.  It can get busy between late breakfast and early lunch.  Seating is pretty limited, but at least there is a dining area on the opposite side of the buffet line.  But be aware when you go to Nanay Gloria's, the rooms are warm!  Even with the AC on I was still sweatin' a bit.  I don't know if they are just trying to save money by keeping the thermostat at the 80s or folks working there want to feel like they are back home in the islands...hot and humid!  Bring a fan to cool yourself down just in case.  The food?  Overall not bad.  Everything there goes lovely with white rice (which they server plenty of).  If you're into the carb and gluten-free life proceed with caution.  Hell, if you're watching your cholesterol proceed with caution!  Nanay Gloria's is some down home, stick-to-your-ribs food, and is often sitting in 'juice'...aka 'grease'...aka 'fat=flavor'.  Don't nobody be draining the fat!  Bastos!I like my crispy pata.  I like my bistek.  I like my adobo.  I like my bangus.  I like my sinigang.  I like it all over my rice.  Trust me, there are a number of pork dishes available at Nanay Gloria's, but I stick with my basic favorites.  Just hook me up a plate of food with a side of vinegar and garlic for dipping, some jufran, and a bottle of all-purpose sauce...and I'm set.  Let the battle begin!  We literally cannot go there more than once every couple of months.  It just takes a lot out of you!  Cholesterol and salt content must be monitored!  And extra runs on the treadmill help too.  But oh do I like the food.So the next time you want some pretty authentic Filipino food and you're on a budget, hit up Nanay Gloria's.  You will be greeted with a smile and and empty plate.  Fill that sucker up!Nanay Gloria's serves authentic Filipino dishes buffet-style. What you should expect from here is an abundance of food that sticks close to traditional Filipino culture. The food reminds me of the things made by your titas or lolas. I'm the type of person who really likes eating at places like this because it reminds me of the Filipino home cooking from my family that I truly miss.They have two rooms: a room with the buffet line and tables with chairs and the other room with booths and a water dispenser. They did not have a soda fountain, so all the drinks have to be purchased from their mini-market section next to the register. All the staple dishes are there: kaldereta, kare-kare, sisig, fried bangus, etc. I don't think they have a set menu, either. So you might not see some of the things I listed, but I'm pretty sure the popularly requested ones are always put out. Try their chicken tinola or the chicken adobo if you just want a common cultural dish. I was skeptical about their sisig at first, but when you try it I'm pretty sure it'll wow your tastebuds like it did mine. If you have an appreciation for true Filipino cooking, then this is the place for you. Don't expect anything but the full cultural flavor from the Philippines.Thanks to Yelpers, we found a solid Filipino lunch buffet in Vegas.  Unlike where I live (Sacramento), Vegas has plenty of Filipino restaurants to choose from.  Most averaged 3 stars, so really, I chose Nanay Gloria's based on the close proximity to our hotel (The Orleans) and I-15.  For $8/person, you can fill up on about a dozen entrees.  Their selection was satisfying enough for my family.  I was sad they didn't have any lumpia or any type of desserts except for fresh fruit, but overall, everything tasted pretty good.  There's a few shelves of dry goods from the Philippines and also a refrigerated section that sells salted red eggs and Eden cheese, amongst other items.  The mom and pop (Nanay Gloria and husband?) who run the place were very nice and humble people.  They had one busser who worked his butt off clearing plates and wiping down tables.  They seem to do a big takeout business.  My mom got some stuff for our mirienda ("snack") on the drive back home to Sac.Thanks, Nanay Gloria!
Agave=Friendly Staff, huge portions, Nontraditional "3.5 Star" Mexican FoodDrink Strength, Dessert, and Service gave them the extra half star.I understand how someone could have a bad experience here.  When the tortilla chips and salsa's were delivered to the table they looked lovely, but lacked in flavor, texture, and were watery. Their blue corn tortilla chips were excellent but they only made up 10% of the chips in the basket, and the corn tortilla chips did not compare. Waiting and snacking on this appetizer doesn't put you in the right frame of mind - thinking that the rest of the food will be great.   Two limes, some salt, and a bottle of cholula sauce later,    our Main dishes arrived and these seasonings saved the day.  We started with the Potato Portobello Mushroom tacos.  The tacos were in theory a great idea, my Uncle loved them, but all I could taste was potato.  The flavor had a lot more potential.  They could easily be improved by cutting the Portobello thicker, and marinating the mushrooms before they're cooked.  Perhaps grilling some white onions cut long and thin would enhance the flavor profile too.On the upside the Margaritas were pretty big, and reasonably priced for their size.  :-) This makes most Yelpers very happy. Well done Agave.Our second dish that arrived was the Filet Mignon Steak Fajitas.  Priced at $16 this dish is incredible; the quality of the meat alone and the amount included warranted a much higher price. Rice, beans, and  fresh tortillas (the tortillas were delicious), definitely helped. These guys do not over season and I doubt they add salt.  So you're probably going to want to ask ahead of time for lime, something spicy, and some salt.  After I doctored up the Fajitas they were delicious.  They had potential, but didn't  quite live up to it.In theory this restaurant is awesome.  Huge high ceilings, spacious booths, long wrap around bar, nice staff, fair prices, and all around plenty of parking in the shopping center they are in.  Really enjoyed our meal here.  I really wanted to give them a fourth star, but the flavors here just fell a little short. Now that's not to say that I wouldn't be back.  I will definitely come here again when I'm in the mood for Steak Fajitas.Unreal Dessert.  5 Stars for their Coconut & Espresso Flan.  3 Stars overall for food.5 Stars for portion Size.Date Rating: 7Pick up Scale: 1Strong Suggestion: Ask for hot sauce, lime, and salt.  Definitely helpful.Was here recently to meet up with some friends.  The weather was great, so we ate on the patio.  The heat lamps and fire pits were on, so the slight chill didn't bother us too much.We had the Chicken Quesadilla and Duck Quesadilla....both were simply amazing!  Of course, we ate too much Chips and Salsa (complimentary).....but who doesn't?  We topped it off with several rounds of Pacifico.Overall, it was a great experience.....the service was awesome.  I highly recommend the patio area during the warmer months.Return Factor - 90%I have never paid more than $80 for Mexican food in my life.  This place was very expensive and the food was decent.  I posted pictures for you to see.  My favorite thing was the Civiche.  They did make strong Margarita's.  The average meal price was $12-18.  My Cheese Enchiladas were $13.00!The one thing Agave has going for them is their ambiance and patio.  The patio has 4 fire places and the option to sit at the fireplaces (couches) or tables.  The service is less than average.  We waited for a host to show up to seat us for 5 minutes.  The server continually forgot to check on us and we had to ask twice for waters.  And when we asked when he recommends he said "everything."  I wanted to get up and leave right when he said that.I will not be returning.So I've been here two more times since my previous review and I think, unfortunately, this is going to be my LAST review of this place and the last time I ever come here.Agave and I came out to a rough start when it first opened many years ago and it seems that it has reached its pinnacle a year ago and it's down hill.  Very quickly.My wife and I visited on a Thursday night to make use of a Groupon that I purchased a month ago.  I called and made a reservation for 8:45pm and that went off without a hitch.When I got there, it went downhill from there.It was like they only had one waiter for the ENTIRE restaurant.  We waited forever for our drinks, our chip refills, our order.Rock Lobster Guacamole for an appetizer to complement the chips was good.  The chips ran out and we waited 10 minutes for more.Our main entrees were OK.  Refills never happened.  After waiting patiently for 30 minutes for our waiter to return, we went and talked to an employee - who was the hostess (hopping around merrily and fraternizing with her friends) while service just went down, down dooooown hill.Well, we were talking to the hostest saying our waiter was nowhere to be found and she condescendingly says "he's been helping you!  He's at your table."  (and he wasn't.)  Then when we walked back to the table I saw her giving my wife a very dirty look.I'm done with this place.  Agave needs to seriously look at how they're treating their customers.  It is a shame that this restaurant is taking up space in Summerlin when a restaurant that cares to give customer service and EARN their money could be here instead.Arrived at 8:45pm.  Got our check at 9:55pm.  Be prepared to waste an entire night if you dare venture here.
Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant=We've been to so many different dim sum places in Vegas we thought we'd give yet another one a try. Boy the wait is hella long during lunch time. We waited about 40 minutes! However, once we were seated, things started to roll rather quickly. They asked what kind of tea we wanted and it was brought out really fast. The carts started to roll our way and it had most of the stuff we were wanting to eat so that was a plus.The har gaw was slightly above average (compared to the rest of Vegas) and the soy sheet rolls weren't bad at all. My fave was the fact that they had 'ma lai go' and it was the authentic kind -- tan brown in color rather than sponge cake yellow.Like what the other reviewers have mentioned it's dirty and the bathrooms are filthy. However, pee before you leave your hotel and go early so you don't have a wait -- avoid having to go to the bathroom at all and you'll have a good meal. Very cheap dim sum I'd say!I must say that Dim Sum in Vegas is definitely an adventure. One has to find a balance between good quality and value. The best authentic dim sum place? I would definitely say Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine. The problem? Its pricey. The worst? I would say Harbor Palace. I would not ever go back there again. The middle ground? Orchid's Garden. Dont get me wrong. This place is definitely not a five star kinda place... but it gets the job done. If I'm going, I always (and I mean ALWAYS) go on a Saturday morning around 11-Noon. I think the food is the freshest and the wait staff is most tolerable. On Sundays, I feel the food is recycled from the day before and the workers try to rush you in and out like cattle.They have the normal dim sum fare. Nothing too spectacular. The food is pretty consistent and I know what I'm in store for. The cart pushing ladies are pretty nice to me now since I'm a familiar face. What I mean by that is now they dont try to force dishes on my table or recommend stuff that is catered towards the novice.If I had friends in town, I would most likely bring them someplace nicer. If its just me and my buddies, this place is fine. Why go to Changs and pay up to double for a slightly higher quality when you can go to Orchids Garden and possibly taste a few extra dishes instead?To put it in layman's terms, Changs is like a Wynn/Bellagio Buffet while Orchid's Garden would be a Planet Hollywood/Mirage Buffet. Easy enough?Dim Sum is a traditional Chinese cuisine in which small portions of a variety of foods, including an assortment of steamed or fried dumplings, are served in succession.  Easter Sunday and it was my cousin Manny, my mother and I eating out for lunch.  Usually Easter is dominated by hotels, casinos offering the standard higher priced brunch  However, we decided on Dim Sum (not a tradition) but I was willing to try it because it will please my mother and I am the one visiting Vegas.  The place itself is in northwest of the strip on Sahara and was not really far from where my mom and Manny lived (if there was no traffic) we got there in plenty of time to get a number and wait.  The proportion of Chinese speaking patrons were probably  90 to 1 to non Chinese.  The newspapers outside the lobby was chinese, all the writing on the menu board is chinese..  The good thing about dim sum is point and taste.  If you picked something you didn't like then you are fine to eat something else.So steamed or fried.  Most of the items we did get were steamed (not as in angry) but were in a metal or wood container, it's like lunch a la carte but they move the food around and ask you if you want something (sometimes the same thing several times).  Of course if you like it, then you can get more of the same.  We picked a range of food from simple short ribs, pork roast, pork and shrimp dumplings.  But Manny my cousin was apt for the challenge, he said I like chicken feet so we ordered it.  In all my experiences in eating Chinese or Asian food, chicken feet has never touched this lips.  However convinced by my cousin to try this slightly battered (coating not beat up) chicken feet.  I tried it, it was not as bad as I thought.  It was gelatinous and easy to eat and spit.  Now I can say I ate chicken feet but would I try it again, maybe next time when its deep fried and I have had several beers.Overally service was hectic but good.  The only caveat is the long wait for the check to be completed.  We thought they would rush us out but because the restaurant had slowed down since we came in, the new customers were getting the attention, we were just waiting.  Always drink tea when you are eating dim sum, it helps with the greasy food you are ingesting.  Oh, we did eat chinese broccoli, the designated vegetable.  We also had some smelt, my mom' s favorite (not crunchy or seasoned enough for me)The ultimate surprise which I always try to look for dim sum is the tofu.  This is not the tofu you buy in the supermarket, this is one is silky and warm and with a little syrup and was delicious - taho in the Philippines.Overall, for the clientele who believe this is good enough for them and good enough for us.  It cost us about 60 bucks which is 20 per person (no I didn't make my Mom pay - Manny and I split it)..  I had a good and new experience in Las Vegas away from the strip and the namebrand chef cuisine.Dim sum is the best hangover cure, and nothing screams Vegas like all day dim sum.Orchids Garden serves dim sum from 10:30 AM until 10:30 PM, every day.Called for lunch reservations at a friend's recommendation, then took a taxi over. Didn't wait long for our table. The Saturday we were there, the main dining room was chock full of families, locals, and those who probably taxied over. (Yes, all good eats are off Strip.) Orchids Garden is ready for crowds: they have a large parking lot and a second high-capacity dining room purposed for lunch, dinner, and banquets.We feasted on chicken feet, delicious green peppers with shrimp, tender tripe, tasty siu mai, pork buns, flour rice sheets, and fried shrimp balls wrapped about sugar canes - my favorite of the morning. Plates were strewn about, chopsticks flew. Servers constantly came by to clear our dishes and to ask if we wanted more food which was always appreciated. Drinks-wise, we skipped alcohol and sipped chrysanthemum and jasmine tea.The bill was reasonable, especially split amongst friends. I'll be back!Took a buddy here for lunch the other week.  I had never been here before and we were both starving.  Little did I know how ridiculously aggressive the dim sum servers were.  Do they work on commission or something?  Man.  We had 7 plates on our table within 3 minutes of sitting down because our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.  The servers annoyed my friend to no end but I actually found it pretty comical.  All the usual suspects for dim sum here and all done well.  I'll definitely be back.As usual, this place serves quality dim-sum and at a great price. Personally, there are only two decent dim sum restaurants in town and this is one. Overall, the food is great, service is on par and the prices fair. Some of my personal favorite dishes include the calamari, shrimp noodle and sesame bun with red bean.... Yumm..... Actually just typing that makes me want to go back. With regards to dim sum, I can only speak with regards to lunch. And yes... I will be back again, again and again. Good times Orchid Garden!Superior dim sum all day and every day!!!! What a BIG surprise!Who could ever expect this place to be in Las Vegas? Well, that's a factor in my opinion why reviewers trip out on Orchids. I rate my restaurants based on flavor more than any perceived authenticity and this place serves really tasty food!!!!I've been to a really decent place in the San Gabriel Valley (SGV) called Ocean Star which is pretty much the best true dim sum I've had and I much prefer Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant. Let me also say that Ocean Star is one of the top four dim sum places in the SGV according to Yelpers. I also went to a really, really bad dim sum place in Las Vegas too. If you look at the Elite reviews for Orchids you will see that they are mostly three and four star ratings! Few dim sum places in the SGV do better than 3.5 stars overall! Trust me, Orchids is great!!!!Lately, my BF and I have been to a bunch of places that do not serve Chinese brocoli - but they've got it here! We love our Chinese brocoli too! Just as in Los Angeles the dim sum arrives in carts. There is a great variety of items to eat and they were all good. My BF loves the seaweed wrapped stuffed rice here and he's really picky! All of the shrimp was fresh as can be! I really liked the dim sum sauces here. Another great thing about Orchids is that the dumplings do not fall apart nor ar they too sticky! They are alsonice and juicy! Not as great as Din Tai Fung in Los Angeles, but heck, few things are as great as Din Tai Fung haha! The tea was well steeped too! I really take my tea seriously and sometimes places serve yellowish and flavorless water. Not here!The place is packed with a mixed crowd! Service was a little better than in Los Angeles SGV places! Lots of free parking!3.5 stars, rounding up to 4. Partially because, lets get real, there are limited dim sum options here in Las Vegas. I was introduced to dim sum when I lived in the Bay area, so my standards are a little higher than your average bear.Came in for an early dinner at about 6PM.Love how they have the cart ladies circulating around with goodies- so many places in SF simply have you order from the menu and only have carts on Sundays or lunch service. Here you can do carts and also order menu dishes if you want.We got probably half the menu, including shrimp shu mai (tasty), shark dumplings (have to try), shrimp noodle roll (personal fave), fried shrimp ball (BF's fave), crab ball (star of the night, at $7/a pair), steamed pork bun (mediocre), chinese broccoli (must-have) and duck (which we didn't need at all but was tasty- especially with the sauce).Made the mistake of ordering the soup dumplings, which they said would take 10 minutes- and we waited and waited and waited. And my eyes are bigger than my stomach, so I got steamed pork buns while I waited (way too sweet, did not even finish one).  The lady told us they were "coming right out" four times. Eventually it was a solid half hour to get our three soup dumplings- and they weren't very good, and only had about a sip of soup inside of them. Underwhelming, would not get again.We spent just shy of $50, which is absurd for dim sum, but predictable for our over-ordering habits. It's probably also why we only have dim sum once every month or two. Dining room is nice, much larger than expected though you san see it's a large place from the outside. Service was friendly and attentive throughout, other than that ridiculous wait for the soup dumplings.Having done dim sum at many different spots around time, I am surprised it has taken me this long to give Orchids Garden a chance. They serve dim sum all day. The carts come around and it was relatively busy. Obliviously, it s better for freshness if they are pretty busy so the food can be replenished often. Most of the items we tried were decent. Obviously some had been sitting on the carts a little longer than was optimal. I can't say any one item was a standout but for the price it was good and filling. I'd be interested in giving them another go during a busy weekend morning to see how they hold up.2015 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 058/100Solid dim sum restaurant in Vegas!My boyfriend wanted to get dim sum while we in Vegas, so we did a little Yelping and found this to be one of the better places in the area. NOTE: If you do not have a car and are staying around the Strip area, this may be hard for you to get to. It is about a 10-15 min drive away from the Strip in a random shopping center.We came this past Sunday a little after noon and the place was packed. However, we must have only waited 5-10 min. tops before being seated!I love dim sum places where they push around all of the different dishes on little carts. There's something satisfying about being able to see your options and pick and choose what you want, and having it brought straight to your table rather than selecting from a menu book of pictures of all the different dishes. This place had a great selection of dim sum! We got a TON of different dishes. From what I can remember, I saw:ha/har gowsiu maiwu gokcha siu bao (baked + steamed)cheong fanlo baak goufung zaodaan taatjin deuido fu falai wong bauWe got lucky and were seated right by the kitchen, which was awesome because we basically got first dibs on all of the hot and fresh food that came out of there! I also liked how frequent the women pushing the carts came by. I felt like I was constantly checking out the carts and the dishes, and there was always a decent amount of food on our table. I've been at other dim sum places where it seems like you have to wait forever for another person to come by with a different cart. They were on top of their game here!Overall, I had a great experience at Orchids Garden. Would definitely return whenever I'm back in Vegas. Worth visiting if you love dim sum!I've been here twice during the day and twice at night. I definitely prefer dining during the day since the restaurant is much busier, so the food is fresh and there's a better selection. Unfortunately, I get a hankering for dim sum and we can only visit for dinner. I'm sure it's fine during dinner if it's busy, but I seem to keep missing the crowd. During our last dinner visit, the dim sum was cold and had obviously been out for some time. I didn't mind terribly, but I would hate to have that situation again.What continues to draw me back here is the service. It's much, much better than service I've received at other dim sum establishments. I'm not ignored and the carts visit often. Also, they're very accommodating when I ask for a dish and it's not available on the carts. They even inform you of how long it'll be for the dish to come out.The food is all right. It's not the best dim sum I've had, but most of the dishes are decent and still hits the spot when I'm really craving it.Group A ($2.40)Steamed BBQ Pork BunPan Fried Daikon CakeDeep Fried Meat BallGroup B ($3.20)Baked BBQ Pork BunSteamed Pork SpareribsSteamed Chicken FeetBaked Sweet Cream BunSteamed Pork Shiu MaiSteamed Shrimp DumplingShrimp Har GowPork PorridgeSteamed Beef BallBean Curd Skin RollShrimp Pasted EggplantBaked Egg TartSteamed Soup DumplingMushroom Shiu MaiChiu-Chow Style DumplingGroup C ($4.25)Fried Shrimp BallFried Shrimp PuffSticky Rice in Lotus LeafShrimp Rice NoodleBeef Rice NoodleGroup D ($6.25)Chinese Broccoli Pan Fried XO NoodleI like the Pan Fried Daikon Cake, Deep Fried Meat Ball, Baked BBQ Pork Bun, Steamed Pork Shiu Mai, Shrimp Har Gow, Bean Curd Skin Roll, Fried Shrimp Puff, Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf, Shrimp Rice Noodle, Beef Rice Noodle, and Pan Fried XO Noodle.I don't mind their other dumplings, but they're just okay. Not the best skin, but good fillings. Daikon (Turnip) Cake is one of my favorite dim sum and although I'll still eat theirs, it's doesn't have the best texture and it's slightly mushy. I like the flavor of their Pork Spareribs, but there is so, so much fat in relation to how much actual meat is available. I also don't like their Steamed BBQ Pork Bun as it's really dry. Stick to their baked version if you want Char Siu Bao. The only dish that I really don't care for is the Steamed Beef Ball; it's such a weird texture. We spent a little over $50 for two people (including tax and tip). You tend to spend less money with groups of 3-4 since you're sharing more and tend to get less food overall. Also, most plates come with 3-4 pieces.
Thai Original BBQ Restaurant=This joint might be the shit, but I'll never know.I am confident in my formula for a good thai place: a grungy, ghetto-fied exterior with a clean and tidy interior packed with actual thai folk.Excited by the nasty, dirty exterior of the building and its sketchy location, I was disappointed to find the inside to be less than spotless.I was quickly, if nonchalantly, greeted and seated with a menu, among about 2-3 other full tables.After sitting over 10 minutes with nary a glass of water or a peep out of the staff, I had hope that the approaching server was on the way to take my order.Alas, my hopes were dashed when the server went to the table that was already busy enjoying their meal and proceeded to take a To-Go order from them, so that it could be ready when they left.Seeing that the other two tables hadn't received food yet, and had been there long enough to deplete their thai teas completely, I was very upset to know that I would be sitting starving, waiting for my food to be cooked AFTER these folks who were already eating their food had their To-Go order cooked.  Uh uh.  I left the menu I'd nearly memorized by this point and my non-existent glass of water on the table and skeedaddled.
Cheeseburger=I had a pretty good large Kobe Beef Pastrami Cheeseburger with side salad and Cheese Fries here.  But the meat did not taste better than normal Angus beef, and though promised a medium-rare burger, what I received was more medium than medium rare.  The Cheese Fries were clotted with Cheddar Cheese, and while still tasty, the cheese had largely hardened, causing the fries to become stuck together.  Diane's Aloha Fish and Fries were good on the inside but overcooked on the outside.  For me the surprise standout of the meal was the Onion Rings.  They were heavily battered but delicious.Our server was friendly, but not very attentive.  The laid-back casual island ambiance was nice for a relaxing meal along the Miracle Mile.XXX-1/2 overall!
Restaurant Mexico=Inside tip- ask for a "Claire Enchilada"- beans and avocado for a refreshing and one-of-a kind flavor.  The crumbled cheese is a fresher, healthier, and more flavor full way to prepare Mexican food- I will forever prefer this cheese over the gooey, slimy, fatty stuff used by other Mexican places.  For desert, be sure to request them to set aside a flan for you (otherwise they tend to run out on busier nights).  It is a secret family recipe that the woman who makes it for them refuses to ever divulge.  Again, this is unlike any flan you've ever experienced before.  Happy eating!Warmly,Kirin :)
Shuseki=Since our little jaunt to San Diego, yakitori has been on our mind.  Seeing the sign for Shuseki for the first time, the menu fit right into what we were looking for.  Their menu offers along the similar lines of other izakayas and yakitori-type places.We tried a little of everything: (All their skewered stuff comes in an order of one.)* Takowasabi ($3.99) "raw octopus in wasabi dressing" - A slimy texture mixed in with the heat from the wasabi.  It was an interesting dish, although I can understand why others may not enjoy it.  Eaten in moderation with other food is necessary.* Torihatsu ($1.00) "chicken hearts" - I like the taste of crunchy-like texture of chicken hearts done yakitori-style.  Plus, it had a nice taste to it with a fresh squeeze of lemon and salt.* Gyutan ($2.50) "beef tongue" - Again, pretty tasty stuff.  Speckled with sesame seeds too.* Sunagimo ($1.00) "chicken gizzard" - I like the texture of chicken gizzard as well, although the Big F wasn't as impressed.  It reminded him more like liver this time, so he passed after the first piece.* Tontoro ($1.50) "pork" - Pork on skewers are just good, period.  When the fat hits the grill, it's just  brings out the flavors that only pork can provide.* Kurobuta Sausage ($1.50) - I was afraid this was going to taste like a hot dog, but it actually had a lot more flavor than a hot dog.  It was pretty good.* Yakitori Chicken ($1.50) - Nothing special about this, tasted like chicken with teriyaki sauce.  It was probably they least enjoyed out of all we ate.* Buta Kakuni ($4.99) "stewed pork belly" - Fatty chunks of pork belly stewed in a soy sauce concoction along with a hard-boiled egg.  You should probably order some white rice with this dish 'cuz of the strong taste.  (The Big F said my version at home was a lot better.)* Sashimi Salad ($7.99) - Their sashimi salad was a combo of raw seafood that included kani, ebi, maguro, tako, masago, seared albacore and saba on a bed of field greens, cucumbers and daikon.  The sauce they used was pretty good, although I could always do without the imitation crab meat.  There might have been some other fish in there as well.They have a bunch of other dishes that range from your basic sushi rolls to unique dishes (sea snails with kimchee sauce, bang bang chicken, simmered guts in miso) and ramen bowls (which we noticed other diners gorging on).  They have a lot of seating room, and a few tables in the back for sitting on pillows.Like other yelpers said, it's not a bad alternative to Ichiza.  They even sell Honey Toast for $6.50!  We definitely would like to go back and order a few other things off their menu.(Pics posted!)Couldn't get same day reservations at Ichiza, so hit up Shuseki again.This time we didn't go all out, but did have a few bites:* Ankimo "Monkfish liver" ($7.99) - I love this stuff, the creaminess of the liver is just divine on the tongue!* Okura Ika "Okra and Squid" ($3.99) - I like when squid is cut up in strips, and the okra gives a bit of slime feature on the bottom of the dish.  * Shishamo "Grilled Shishamo" ($5.99)* Agedashi Tofu "Deep-fried Tofu" ($4.99)* Tontoro "pork" ($1.50) - We ordered three skewers so we each could have one. * Buta Kakuni "Stewed Pork Belly" ($4.99)* Sushi Rice Bowl topped with Salmon and Salmon Roe ($10.99)Service was slacking...they were just so busy and couldn't handle the flow of customers.  The place was packed despite it being a weekday night.  Nearby tables were left waiting a long time just to get the check.  It was a good thing we were too busy enjoying the company to really notice that much.3.5 stars for this visit.(Pics posted!)Why do people still go to Ichiza when they can come here instead? This place is four times bigger than Ichiza, so you don't have to wait 45 minutes for a seat.  The menu isn't written in Kanji on the back of pieces of cereal boxes and scotch taped all over the walls. The seats are padded and comfortable unlike Ichiza who has wooden benches for chairs. This place doesn't smell like a public restroom like Ichiza does. And best of all, you don't have a psycho old man working here. Why not come to SHUSEKI instead?I walked by here and saw a sign that read Rauman instead of Ramen. It could have been a spelling error, or it could have meant that this place serves Yokohama style Rauman(a Chinese influenced variation which no other place in Las Vegas has).  I decided to gamble and walked in. I looked at the menu, and noticed that it literally had over 200 items on it.  I immediately noticed that they had Tan Tan Men. That's an extremely rare Chinese dish which is unrealistically popular in Japan! I've been to every famous Ramen house on the Westcoast, and there might have been only about 8-10 restaurants that serves authentic style Tan Tan Men. So the fact they had it here is a big deal for me! I decided to order the Tan Tan Men, Miso Rauman, and Karage Chicken. You might think that's a lot of food for one person, but because my body fat is less than 4% and I run anywhere from 8-15 miles a day, my body literally never gets full. When the Miso Rauman came, I couldn't believe how big the bowl was. I thought Anime Ramen had gigantic portions, but this place was actually maybe 20% larger than Anime's bowl which is already double the size of Monta and Sora.  Yes, this is a gigantic bowl of Ramen!!  I immediately tasted the broth and I couldn't believe it. Yes, it really is a Yokohama Style Rauman. FINALLY! Finally, they have Yokohama style Ramen in Las Vegas. They got a Sapporo style(Sora), a Tokyo style(Monta), and a fusion style(Anime), and now finally a Yokohama style. Ironically, Shin-Yokohama is the city where they have the world famous Ramen Museum. I heard it's like being in a chocolate factory, but with Ramen instead.  They use rib meat for charsiu here. Why hasn't anyone else ever thought of that? I still think that Sora and most Sapporo style Ramen houses have the best tasting charsiu, but the uniqueness of using rib meat made this Ramen very enjoyable. Off course Monta has the worst charsiu, they cook it ahead of time, keep it cold in a refrigerator, then while it's still cold they just drop it into your Ramen and serve. SHUSEKI, Sora, Anime, and Yagyu all have far superior charsiu to the overrated Monta. The Ramen also comes with egg, corn, large portions of bamboo, bean sprouts, ground pork, shredded onions, and extremely straight noodles. Yokohama Chinatown Dan Dan noodles are always straight and so pure white that they are almost transparent. The Tan Tan Men was just as good as what I used to get at the restaurants that were operated by ethnically Chinese residents of Japan.  Of course it could never compare to the extra thick Tan Tan Men of Chin Ma-Ya in Little Toyko, but it was still the best thing on the menu and of course the best Tan Tan Men in LV.  Also, remember that Yokohama has possibly the largest Chinatown in Japan. So the vast majority of Yokohama Ramen-Yas are going to be Chinese variations. The honey toast here is far better than Ichiza's and it's actually taller and they give more ice cream. It's only like 6 bucks too!The Karage Chicken was perfect.  It came plain with no dipping sauce. They use dark meat, and give you a slice of lemon. The meat was very juicy and tender. You know, everyone always says that Monta is the best Ramen house in Las Vegas, and Monta has these fanatic fan boys that give 1-star ratings to all of the competing Ramen houses. Last time I was at Monta, I overheard a boyfriend and girlfriend talking about how they never ate at Anime Ramen but gave the place 1-star, and made up a fake review all because it was Monta's rival. So, Monta does have a psychotic fanbase. But, let me tell you: Monta is far from having the best Ramen in LV. Places like Yagyu, Anime, Sora, and even SHUSEKI have a far superior style of Ramen.   While I was leaving, I spoke with one of the owners who is an ethnically Chinese man who was born and raised in the Tokyo area. He informed me that he ran a restaurant in Japan for over 15 years before coming to Las Vegas. We Las Vegas Ramen fans are very privileged to have a restaurant in town that serves the cuisine of the Chinese immigrants of Japan. These places are very hard to come by. BTW, he also said he might start serving a variation of jajangmyeon in the future. 5-Stars, and one of my top 10 favorite restaurants in LVYeah..I am one of them easily offended Japanese guys who is overly sensitive and gets disgusted when people order Ramen the wrong way. In Japan there is actually a proper protocol to order Ramen that has existed for thousands of years. Click on this link here to see the traditional Japanese way to order Ramen.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwGql-FyXjE&feature=youtu.beNot long ago my Dad told me a story about how he went to Ichiza to eat because everyone kept telling him it was "authentic Japanese food". Immediately when he walked in, the crazy old man ran up to him and said something to him in Japanese. Even though my Dad is 100% Japanese, he does not speak the language since his family came to America in the 1800s. So, my Dad was like: "what the f*ck are you trying to say to me?". And then the  old man informed him that he could only eat for 40 minutes and then have to leave... but he did not say this to any of the "western" customers. I didn't believe this story when my Dad told it to me because I thought it was exaggerated. My Dad tends to talk a lot of sh!t on people and pick fights so I assumed the old man had to have asked him to leave on account of his bad behavior. Well, in the last 2 months I had a conversation with my favorite Japanese sushi chef and he told me the exact same story. The old man had singled him out for being Japanese and given him a time limit. This makes me believe that Ichiza is trying to market themselves towards "western" customers, and they really don't wanna see our faces there anymore. You won't get sh!t like that at SHUSEKI.   I have probably eaten at SHUSEKI more time then I have eaten at Fukumimi, Monta, Sora, and Anime all combined. Mainly because they are happy to  stay open when I show up after midnight. I work 12-16 hour days and usually SHUSEKI is the only Ramen-Ya still open after 11PM. We all hate how Japanese businesses usually close very early....but, SHUSEKI is actually owned and operated by an ethnically Chinese resident of Japan, so he is willing to allow his business to open later.  When you walk into SHUSEKI, you will most likely recognize a person eating here who works for another Japanese Restaurant.  The evil old man from Ichiza frequents this place. The girls at INABA can be seen here. The legendary Hiro-San(the former fugu sushi chef who is semi-retired and working at Sushi on Rainbow now) can also be found here and he actually tells me that this is his favorite Ramen-Ya.  So, it does tend to be popular amongst the LV Japanese community even though they see it as a Chinese restaurant. Because this place is operated by an ethnically Chinese man who was born and raised in Japan, it's gonna have Tan Tan Men on the menu. The Tan Tan Men here at SHUSEKI is more of a Chinese style with a miso broth.  At Los Angeles Ramen-Yas they would actually have this on the menu as "Tan Tan Style Ramen" instead of Tan Tan Men. Well, I guess due to some of the negative comments by yelpers, the cook here at SHUSEKI has decided to modify the Tan Tan Men a bit.  I'm a little disappointed because some days I'm actually in the mood for a more traditional Chinese variation. I like the service here.  Ryan is my personal favorite worker. If he is working, he will make sure you get your ramen the way you want it. For example, Ryan can actually get the cooks to make me a bowl of Ramen that is so spicy that I just can't finish it. Last time he made me a Spicy Miso that was hotter than Orochon's. He also can get the cook to make the noodles more firm or soft depending on your preferences.  The girls who work the late night shift are really nice, but tend to be on the super shy side. Unfortunately, only Jen and Ryan speak perfect English and it's difficult to communicate with the other workers. My recommendation is to get the Tan Tan Ramen with a side of Karage and Gyoza. Why? Because I command you to do so...What can I say, I'm a big fan of Shuseki. Yeah, I know the fish isn't the freshest I can find in the valley and the menu doesn't really set itself apart from the other Japanese spots... But hey, I rarely have anything to complain about when I hit this place up. Not a fan of the loud and boisterous vibe of other tapas places? Looking for a place to come and dine and have a casual conversation without shouting over your tapas? Then Shuseki has got you covered. I am a big fan of a relaxed, chill dining experience and Shuseki is low-key enough to coax me back for multiple visits of the same expectation; a big plus in my book. Also, the servers are always nice and friendly so that's additional cool points that I'm throwing their way.Some of my favorite grubs here include the sashimi plate, the grilled whole squid, and the garlic tuna sashimi cuts with avocado on the side. However my usual go to plates are the Japanese fried rice omelet, the okonomiyaki, or the oyako don (the latter being my favorite). I could go on and on with all the other dishes, but these are the few that I find I order the most. The thing I love most about this place is the price. For example, the oyako don (my favorite) is big enough to ease my belly into satiety as it comes with a big bowl of chicken with an egg on top and a flavorful bowl of miso soup. Surprisingly enough, it's only $7.99 and I somehow find a way to take some home as leftovers. When you have an appetite like I do, the fact that I can take home some leftovers is just.. Wow. Even when I'm with the lady, we usually never hit the $30 mark when we are just grubbing and have no intention of getting involved with libations. Now that's what I'm talking about. Like I said, some people prefer the loud and exciting atmosphere of the other Japanese Tapas bars in the area but Shuseki hits the spot better for me. Price is good, food is grubbing, and the atmosphere is nice and comfy.DON'T EVER EAT HERE!  OWNER STOLE MONEY FROM US!  My family and I have been going to this joint for years.  One can say "we're regulars," even my daughter got excited each time we went there.  Few yrs ago, we decided to purchase a gift-certificate for our daughter since she loved eating there.  We were re-assured that the certificate will not expire.  Fast forward to tonight.  We decided to dine there tonight and finally use the gift-certificate.  Upon paying, we were all shocked that the OWNER REFUSE TO HONOR the certificate!  He claims: "it's not my signature."  What?  We BOUGHT THIS CERTIFICATE AT HIS ESTABLISHMENT.  Not only he refused to honor it, he also refused to give us a refund for buying HIS RESTAURANT'S certificate.  After all these years of being a patron to his restaurant with lots of fond memories of dining there with friends and family, even during the holidays (Christmas, New Years) and birthdays - this is how we are treated!    We paid for tonight's dinner regardless (awful memory = awful taste); however, I felt it was WRONG FOR THE OWNER TO TREAT US THAT WAY.  We've already file a complaint to BBB and considering legal action.
Top of the World Restaurant=Okay, I was in Vegas a couple of weeks ago for the biggest gathering of nerds, techies, rocket scientists and geeks on the planet.  And yes, I admit, I'm one of them, and yes, we are HOT.Anyways, it was time to make a decision for dinner. The choice was to either have dinner with my fellow co-workers from out-of-town at this place or eat by myself at another hotel buffet (ugh, not another...).So, simple enough, join the group.The view is indeed spectacular and the service, attentive.  But, and a BIG BUT, the menu was predictable and boring consisting of your typical red-meat Black Angus Schmangus shit, salmon, and sea bass (woohoo) and pairing it with sides like garlic mashed potatoes (good gawd),  asparagus (yippee), plus salads (Caesar's, told you they're predictable), and soup (lobster bisque, oh come on), desserts (creme brulee....lord almighty)I got the lamb chops which was, ehh, okay but cooked a bit too rare.It's a revolving restaurant, so please, do yourself a favor and mind how much you drink  because I don't want to pick you 1,000 feet down, your pea brain splattered all over the sidewalk, nor smell your fucking puke in the elevator 104 floors up!  And don't get lost going around in circles trying to find the restroom. It's always been on the same spot, it's the table where you're seated that's moving, dumbass.Good thing it's on company expense because I'm not going to spend this much money on this place. Minus 1 more star for the looong ass way getting to this restaurant. And stop frisking me already, I'm not going to bomb Stratosphere, you TSA wannabe!The space elevator already exists. Ride it.  When I took the Stratosphere Tower Tour five years ago, I knew that the next time we went to Vegas we had to have a meal in the Top of the World Restaurant.  So, with a month's advance booking, we enjoyed a Saturday lunch here.  Looking out over the desert, no wait, out over the city, no wait, out toward the mountains ... from this rotating restaurant we saw the expanse of The Meadows as never before.  We could see the runways at Nellis.  We could see the red rocks.  We could see an entire train, all 4 engines and 100 cars, in one sweeping view below us.  Oh, how about 8 helicopters flying below us?  Yes, from 1,000 feet up, everything looks different.  Daytime or nighttime, it's a spectacular view.  Yes, we ate.  Let's see ... iced tea ... no, you know it was fantastic!  Here:  an appetizer of salmon with salsa, cream, and homemade chips, you had to be there to believe it, but go ahead and look at the pictures.  A Caesar salad that was not so Caesar, but an interesting mix of things.  Surf & turf.  You bet.  More salmon, on a bed of asparagus, or some such thing.  House champagne, which is why my notes were less than perfect.   OK, I forgot to photograph the entrees, what am I, a columnist?  No, I'm a guy who was having a great time in the sky.  Oh, yeah.  Stratosphere chocolate for dessert.   A variety dish, with 3 desserts on it.  Hey, I got a shot of that one! OK, so lunch for 2 was $109.18 + tip.  If you need to work up the nerve to go there, try the Stratosphere Tower Tour first.  Then, when you want to impress Your Lady, take her to this "romantic experience" restaurant.  You won't be sorry.Still coming off of my 'Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crabs' dinner, I was weary of what meal was ahead of us.  We decide to check out Top of The World for lunch. I really enjoyed our meal here.  My husband and I both choose the premiere tasting menu ($36).  We both enjoyed salads as starters instead of the lobster bisque.  The salad was delicious. Light, flavorful, crisp, and well portioned.  For our second course I opt for the steak and crab cakes; my husband gets the steak with the lobster tail.  We really enjoyed the crab cakes and lobster, but our steak was not cooked to our liking.  We both ordered them 'medium', and got them at medium-well.  And they're pretty tricky by sitting it on top of a mini portabella...making me think I have more meat than I really do.  Lastly the dessert.  Excellent array of raspberry mousse, bread pudding, and chocolate cake.The service at Top of the World was excellent.  One thing I found amusing was our host had under his name: Compton Hills, CA (all employees have a notation of where they're from).  Compton Hills, CA.....highly suspect. Haha.  The view is spectacular, and the food is good.  I wouldn't put it on my list of 'must-haves' in Vegas, but maybe 'must try at least once'.I think about 50% of the bill is going towards the atmosphere.  The food is not outstanding.  We went with the 5 course tasting menu since I couldn't justify paying $60+ for an a la carte steak when I could just go to Carnevino down the street.We still had a fun time and the service was excellent.  The jazz band was a nice touch and it was great watching people do the sky jump.  Definitely a tourist trap though.  Restaurant.com coupon helped the bill hurt less.  But I'm pretty sure this will be the only/last time I eat here.  Dinner some place else and then the bar here all the way next time.Top of the World or Vegas world at least.  At the last moment, my eating companions decided to eat here versus somewhere else.  It was off the strip but was told well worth the cab ride and the view is spectacular.Yep, despite the location away from the strip, I would have to agree that this place is great for the breathtaking views and their food.  Located in The Stratosphere tower, you have to make your way up to the 106 floor to this lounge/restaurant.  I am told that it takes approximately 120 min to go around the valley of Vegas.  The views are great during your dining experience with no obstructing view for your enjoyment.  Though the menu is a little pricey, you get good food and view.  We bought our own bottle of wine so it saved us a bit for the food.  For our appetizers, I got the tuna tartare. That was ok. Kinda fishy.  The oysters were good along with the foie gras.  Better eat them while you can before California's law goes into effect in July. No foie grae. Ugh!!!!Again, I decided to order the Muscovy duck with a light glazed with asian bok choy and lightly seasoned salad on the side.  It was asian fusion-like that was quite good, surprisingly.  While my other companion decided to go with steak, lamb chops and more foie gras.  The food was quite good.  I would come here for the food more so than the view.  I can't take the view home but I certainly can take the food home.  In my belly. LolThe service was attentive and I have to give it to our waitress who did an excellent job to accomodate our palates. Again, it was an expensive dining experience, but for the view along witht the food, you can  not put a pricetag on such.Had lunch with my brother and sister here, we didn't have reservation but were seated shortly.Service was 5 stars-Even when we didn't look much, we were still taken care of with 5 star treatment. The waitress was very nice and didn't hold it against us that we were not in our Sunday's best.Food 4 1/2 stars-We ordered from the lunch menu, they had the 2 specials, my brother got the burger and sister went for the crab cakes. Both were great. I had the salad which was scrumptious too. We shared a petit four of desserts. Unbelievably moist chocolate cake, the other 3 were good too but I was too blown away by the chocolate cake that I can not imagine talking about them.  Ambiance 5 stars-Whilst you sit enjoying the food, the restaurant imperceptibly revolve, thus you are afforded a spectacular 360 view of Las Vegas. Every so often you witness some bad @$$ bungee jump off the side of the building. Talk about extreme!One of a kind experience and only in Vegas!I'm so incredibly disappointed in this place. I was so excited to come here for my birthday. We made reservations months ago. I'll admit, the view is breathtaking. You get panoramic views of Las Vegas, and at night the lights make it even more gorgeous. If you get motion sickness like me, you had better come prepared. The restaurant rotates and even though they say you hardly notice, I'll have to say that you really do notice. I came here with a group of six. My sister joined us, even though she's on an extremely strict diet and would only be ordering a plain salad. That's when it all went downhill. Our server treated us like we were poor folk venturing out to a fancy city meal. We hardly saw her. She didn't explain the menu, and I was so sad because all the servers around us were being so friendly.  She, was not friendly. And honestly, if I'm paying they much money for food, I expect a certain level of service. The bill for 6 people was just under $400. We however left unhappy.The food wasn't spectacular, and I think it was really overpriced for that it was.  I got the ribeye, and it didn't have any flavor. My boyfriend got the salmon, and it was decent. I won't be going back here, I was so upset. If you want the view, they have a lounge. Check that out instead.
Swish Shabu Shabu=This place is now on my list of, "I don't care if I ate this earlier this week, I'll eat this again tonight!" foods.  Yes, I know, that's not a very memorable or catchy list, but it gets the point across!  I think I have to get my sukiyaki fix every couple weeks, or else I start to crave it!When ordering your meal you're presented with several options: the type of meat/chicken/seafood, the portion size and shabu shabu or sukiyaki style.  Once those details are out of the way, food is brought to you almost immediately.  The waitress gets your stove going for you, and you're off!  Your choice of meat is brought out to you, along with an assortment of vegetables that include onions, green onions, asparagus, carrots, mushrooms and cabbage.  You also get some udon noodles and a bowl of rice.  Additional condiments are chili paste, radish and green onion that you can add to your broth.I've had the shabu shabu here before, but it wasn't something that I'll be eating again anytime soon.  The broth seemed quite plain and didn't seem to do much more than boil my veggies and meat.  The sukiyaki however, has won me over.  I love the sweet/soy sauce flavor of the broth itself, as well as the fact that the veggies and meat do take on the flavor of the sauce.  Bonus Tip: Checkout the front table by the entrance that has business cards and newspapers.  One of the newspapers is a Korean newspaper, and on the cover there is a coupon for Swish that gets you 10% off your meal! ;)So i've a little confession, I'm a groupon addict. I bought the $15 for $30 coupon to come here, and let me tell you I was impressed.  From the minute I walked in, the aroma of yummy goodness filled my nose sending my stomach into a raging fit.  The interior decoration was pretty simple and low key, which I did like.  The lights are dimmed out, almost seemingly romantic if you ask me.  Upon entering we were immediately greeted by the hostess, which quickly seated us to our seats.  From there she handed us a thin menu, which seems to still be in the works I presume? Regardless of that, me and my friend both confessed to never ever doing shabu-shabu before.  The waitress was kind enough to explain what it is, and what she recommended. In my eyes, that was great customer service.  She recommended that we try "sukiyaki" mix if we weren't too familiar with the shabu-shabu flavor, since it does have more taste.  My friend and I skimmed through the menu and came to the decision of trying their prime beef and the garlic chicken.  As soon as the waitress collected our menu, our food was out within the next 10 mins. I was merely impressed with how fast they worked to keep their customers happy, and not waiting.  The garlic chicken was amazing, crispy and fried to perfection.  The sauce was just I imagined it to be, if you're from Hawaii and had the Mitsuken garlic chicken.....lemme tell you, this is almost an exact replica.  The meat came out for the sukiyaki portion, and yes, it was amazing too. The taste of the broth was uncanning almost like an outter body experience.  I loved the udon noodles they gave, and the nappa cabbage.  Honestly, just eating that in your broth makes the meal amazing....adding the meat is just a plus.  I indeed shall give this place another try.  Their appetizers looked to enticing to say no, if you're ever in the neighborhood come by and give it a try. I promise you, you won't regret it.Yet another Groupon alert. I've been to the Swish on Sahara on quite a few occasions (usually when I scrounge up a coupon or two), but had never tried the newer location on Spring Mountain. When the Groupon popped up a few months ago, I snatched some up and have been planning my trip. We ordered the Kobe large portion Sukiyaki and the mushroom party Shabu Shabu to share. I'm not a big fan of cooking food myself. I will often make the sacrifice for some AYCE Korean BBQ or Shabu Shabu and this was one such occasion. My fella had never tried Shabu Shabu or Sukiyaki, but I knew he'd love it. What's not to love flavorful meat, rice, veggies and noodles. The staff was friendly and attentive. The place was really empty for a Friday evening around 9, though. There are so many great places to try on Spring Mountain, I know there's a lot of competition for them, but I highly recommend this place, especially with a coupon. Excellent deal!The place was very dead when we went on a Monday around 2pm. We were literally the only customers there for a good 30 minutes or so. Then the regulars/friends came in and started eating. I figure more people come here for dinner though. The ambiance was dark and intimate. There is a bar area where you can sit or many tables that seat about 2-4 people. When we sat down at a table for two, the waiter asked me if a wanted a chair for my purse. Let me repeat that...A CHAIR FOR MY PURSE. Well f*ck yes my purse would love a chair! I don't think I've ever been asked that in my whole history of dining. My boyfriend and I were both a little taken aback when he asked me that. We started off with the Crispy Garlic Chicken ($7.95), which was phenomenal. The chicken was crispy, juicy and garlicky and the sauce was just oozing with all sorts of flavors. We were originally going to get the calamari, but if there's one thing we love more than calamari, it's garlic. After being schooled on the difference between Sukiyaki and Shabu Shabu, I opted for  healthy size (6oz) prime rib-Eye Sukiyaki ($14.95) and my boyfriend got hungry size (8oz) prime rib-Eye Shabu Shabu ($18.95) in their new Spicy Miso broth. These both came with a small bowl of rice and a plate of veggies, udon, and tofu. This was actually my first time ever having Sukiyaki, so I don't have much to base it off of, but I still found it to be pretty damn delicious. My boyfriend actually enjoyed the Sukiyaki more than the Shabu Shabu because it was just so flavorful, although a lot less healthy than the Shabu. The waiter told us to wait until the sauce got a little thick because it would make it have more flavor, so everytime I took out the cooked meat, it was drenched with all kids of goodness. The Shabu Shabu was okay, but just boring compared to the Sukiyaki. I'm sure if I tried the Shabu first, I would've liked it more, but my taste buds were spoiled from he awesome Sukiyaki. *Tips-Ask them what flavors they have for their Shabu Shabu broth. When we went they had Spicy Miso and for an extra buck, you could also get soy.-Lately, there have been a lot of Groupon Now deals for this place, so you should definitely check that out before arriving. We got a Groupon a few months ago, so our bill only came out to $17 for all that!Will the real Swish Shabu Shabu please stand up??So I had some issues with the faux Swish in another location, and was invited here after that epic Groupon fiasco but never got around to it until today. Well I am so sorry that I waited. This Swish is absolutely fabulous! (It also helps that I can go down the street for a Trader Joe's run afterward...) My husband and I both ordered the vegetarian platter and shared an order of edamame. The young woman who was serving us was very helpful and personable, and I loved that they brought all the condiments to you so you can more into the hot pot to your liking. She gave me a very healthy dose of garlic so I refrained from adding anything else. This vegetarian dish was HUGE! It was one gigantic plate filled with lettuce, mushrooms, baby corn, carrots, noodles, a little tofu, onion, and green onion. Although it was bountiful, I would have personally liked maybe some zucchini, some extra tofu and a bit more mushrooms than the extreme amount of lettuce on top. Just my preference ;) It was really good though and I liked that the hot pot was right on the table and was in very easy reach. This also came with white rice which was deliciously sticky. I would have preferred brown, but white was good too. The edamame we had as a side dish was tasty. I cannot even begin to tell you just how full I was - well, am! It's been a few hours since eating and I am still pleasantly stuffed to the brim! Our server was attentive, and to have a ridiculously filling and healthy meal for two for under $30 was a great deal. I will definitely be back to THIS location and no others.My family and I come here often for shabu shabu. It's tucked away in the same plaza of SF market and right underneath Bazic. The layout of the restaurant is somewhat off. All the tables are scattered everywhere, but it's nice to be able to sit at a 8-top table when it's only the three of us. Service can be a hit or miss. The times we've been there, it's been a miss. The place was busy and attentiveness lacked so much that we got up to get our own condiments that we asked a few times for. Sometimes, even getting a menu could take a awhile. There was also a time when they forgot about our rice and I waved my hand in the air, but the staff that looked dead at me just didn't care. I was like damn he's faking the funk game is stuuurdy, real sturdy. It can get frustrating at times. When the service is a hit.. it's a wonderful experience here. Everything comes all at once, drinks are refilled, rice is given without being asked. So it's all about chance here.We usually get the Kobe Chuck, hungry portion that comes with a small amount of sliced white onion, mushroom, tofu, cabbage, broccoli, green onion, and udon noodles. I love their dipping sauces which are a ponzu-based sauce for your veggies/noodles and the goma sesame-based sauce for your meat. I add the minced daikon, garlic, and green onion from the condiments selection to my ponzu sauce to intensify the flavor. I also add garlic and green onion to my goma sauce to give my meat the same effect. Delicious. If you don't get your white rice or condiments by the time your meat and veggies are done.. Ask for it! I highly suggest to avoid the soy milk broth. There isn't any flavor whatsoever and it's so translucent that it's almost all seaweed broth with a sake shot of soy milk. I was looking for more of a heavy cream based broth as in all soy milk not half or a shot of. I stick with the Spicy Miso Broth, which has the most flavor from the three of Seaweed, Spicy Miso, and Soy Milk. The technique for shabu shabu is to you its own. I prefer to use half my tofu/cabbage/mushroom/broccoli portion, all my white onion/green onion, and save the udon noodles at the very end. While the veggies are almost done, I swish one by one my Kobe Chuck slice, then dip it in the goma sauce and get a veggie.. dip it in my ponzu, then combine both (meat/veggie) with my white rice and there you have the magic of shabu shabu. Lastly, I save my udon noodles for the broth that had everything boiled in it. Think seasoning the broth for a soup ;)Shabu shabu is soul food at its best. I always leave here with a smile on my face. It's therapeutic, yet fun at the same time. Love the music they play here. Top 90's, Reggae, and some old school like Sinatra got me movin' while I'm swishing away. Keith Sweat - I'll Give All My Love To You... Ready For The World - Love You Down just to name a few. Dining here with music that I love is a plusplusplus!Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall.. I can always go for Shabu Shabu whenever. That's how much I love it. It's one of my favorite cuisine! And Swish is our Family's favorite place for it.I went here with a bunch of people. The place was not busy at all. Service was not consistent. It would good for a minute then they forget about us for a while. I was almost done with my meal and my friend's shrimp still hasn't gotten to the table.We tried: steak, shrimp; miso, spicy miso, seaweed broth; sukiyaki. I enjoyed the sukiyaki. I don't remember being offered more veggies so, I'm not sure if they have unlimited veggies or not.One thing we all noticed was the bizarre playlist. Tupac, Biggie, Enya, Whitney Houston...This place isn't bad but I've had better.
Pie Zanos Kitchen=OMG! They have Gluten-Free Pizza & Beer! This might not mean anything to 99% of you reading this, but for people like me who can't eat anything with wheat in it and thus can't eat normal things like pizza, beer, bread, etc...this place is heaven on earth! They have a great variety of pizza combo's to choose from (both normal and the gluten free variety) and the staff is really up on their gluten-free product knowledge and go to great lengths to avoid cross-contamination. You can build your own personal pizza for around $6-7 bucks and they have weekday specials and happy hours.They carry Redbridge Gluten Free Beer and also have gf desserts in addition to all the regular staples you would find at a great neighborhood pizza bistro. My husband really likes their pizza and a friend of mine tried the pasta and ravioli and really liked it.Check this place out if you have the chance. It's right next to Trader Joe's.
Wingstop=All I can say is "boneless" and "garlic parmesan" wings. Their fries are yummy and different as well, they have a delicious ranch dressing that I just want to dip like crazy. Mmmmm juicy fresh made to order wings, they never let me down, have been here multiple times and always a success!Wingstop you rock!
Pink Pepper=10/16Stumbled upon Pink Pepper as I was heading towards a second Thai option when my first option, owned by a coworker and his children, was rented out for a reception Friday evening.  I've wanted to visit PP for years, but never had a chance.  Darol (RIP), an ex-coworker, and I would exchange foodie stories of our fave places, and PP was the only place he'd go when he had a craving for Thai.  (He resided in Thailand for a few years and considered himself well-versed in the cuisine.)  So, en route to my second choice, I spotted the Pink Pepper logo in the distance and said, "Why the hell not?"  "Today's the day!"It was very dead in there.  (Ya, not just dead.  VERY dead!  LOL.)  Besides me, I spotted my server, who must've been the owner, and an elderly woman rolling up silverware in cloth napkins.  Granted, it was around 3, 330'ish in the afternoon, and lunch had just ended at 2:30p.  (The buffet pans were still emitting heat as they cooled down.)  But I'm not one to let empty rooms sway me away, so I asked for a table.  I liked the ambience- warm, inviting, w/ lovely colors.  Loved the floral salad plates that sat at the table, which I've spotted at Sur La Table before.  Made me wish I'd splurged and bought them then.  Apparently, these plates are only used for show, bec. they were removed moments after I sat down.  Chose to skip the app course and ordered green curry w/ chicken (came w/ rice).  At $9.50,  I thought that this entree better be good!  While I waited, I checked out the rest of the menu and liked what I saw.  If the dish turned out great, I'll be coming back to check the rest out soon enough.  I also spotted a cocktails menu on the table that had quite a few good-tasting options to choose from.  My entree arrived after about 10 to 15 minutes.  The portion was smaller than I'm used to seeing for the price, so I was really hoping that I was getting a very tasty meal.  I shouldn't have worried!  Pink Pepper's green curry has placed Pink Pepper Thai pretty high on my list of places for green curry!!  (Try that for a tongue-twister!)  The coconut curry sauce was thick and super-creamy, and medium heat was just perfect for me!  I also loved the variety of veggies used- there was an extra item there that wasn't listed on the menu.  (Thank goodness I did not have any adverse reactions.)  It took all of my will AND the thought of ordering dessert to keep me from finishing the entire order!  Looking back, I could've squeezed three decent servings out of that meal, especially knowing what I know now... that Pink Pepper's homemade coconut ice cream is freaking AMAZING!  Those w/ a peanut allergy should know to alert the server of this fact, bec. this not overly-sweet sweet comes w/ a generous topping of peanuts.  Ohhh... I just got the shivers up and down my spine (the good kind!) recalling how great my meal ended! Service was friendly and efficient, if a little lonely.  I'm going to assume it was bec. he was by himself in the front.  Perhaps w/ busier hours it'll be easier to flag someone down.  One low point was the restroom visit- the temperature was significantly warmer at that part of the building.  Consider yourself warned.Today I had lunch at Pink Pepper and I couldn't help remembering my history with this restaurant. Pink Pepper is a family run business that originally opened in 1983. I remember when I first moved to Phoenix to attend ASU and went on my first date with my first boyfriend to Pink Pepper. When it was first starting out, Pink Pepper was a visual and taste sensation. There was no other Thai restaurant like it in the valley. The only way to get a seat was by reservation only. Now, Pink Pepper has mostly the same cute decor from back then and could probably use a little updating, but the service is always perfect and the food remains impeccable. There is a full menu including appetizers, Thai curry, soups/salads, seafoods, entrees and desserts and a full bar, and lately they have the regular full lunch buffet for $8.95. (see pics)The all you can eat lunch buffet is one of the best deals in town which includes appetizers, salads, fruits, soups and a good variety of entrees. (see pics)I've been coming here since college and it's always nice to see the same friendly faces and to always be able to count on guaranteed good food with every visit.Hours:11:00am - 2:30pm, 4:30pm - 10pm DailyI 4/5 highly recommend Pink Pepper!
Jin Mee Korean BBQ Restaurant=I don't know what to say about this restaurant. I can see the ones who gives good ratings are either locals or tourists. If you live in L.A, do skip this sorry ass Korean BBQ restaurant, you will be disappointed. First of all, the customer service sucks balls! We purchased this Groupon deal, asked the waitree if we can use it towards the "All you can eat" option, she rudely said no. We need asked for a few minutes to decide what we want that the Groupon covers, which is nothing because we really wanted some BBQ. Oh, their regular price BBQ plates are $20+ per plate, and you must order at least 2 orders. Seriously what the fuck?! Why do I HAVE to order 2 orders if we only want 1? Anyways, we decided to just pay for the all you can eat deal for $21.95 per person. The waitree came back and I told her we want the all you can eat option, she then snatched the advertisement from the table and said, "Your groupon will not cover it." I rudely said, "We can't just fucking pay for it?" She then put the advertisement back. I was so pissed then, told my boyfriend (right in front of the waitree) "Fuck this place, let's go." We then left. She brought out water already but that's too bad for her. Restaurants like this doesn't deserve any customers period. She also said something about the menu how "There's the L.A style". I wanted to say, your restaurant will not survive in L.A. Like I said, if you are from L.A, skip it because its a total ripoff and the service sucks Llama balls.After two visits in the last six months, I remain totally unaware of their a la carte offerings.  It's like a small bolt of electricity triggers my brain to point at the picture of the AYCE deal (now $25) and tell the server in what feels like slow motion to say "I'll......have......this.".  This incurable auto reaction would even prompt me to order AYCE KBBQ if I saw it on Denny's menu. With quite a few popular restaurants in this plaza now, Jin Mee feels like a forgotten place.  The space is big and looks like it could easily fit a crowd of 100+.  I wonder if those banquet tables to the rear of the restaurant ever get used anymore. It doesn't take a lot for me to enjoy spots like this.  As long as there's pork belly, bulgogi, the other usual offerings and they are of reasonable freshness, I am a happy man.  But there are a few things that make this place a standout.  My wife loooooves the spicy marinated raw crab.  I am not sure if anywhere else offers this but it's pretty awesome.  You gotta get all barbaric with it and just break the shells in your mouth to get those glorious slithers of spicy crab. Then they bring out a ton of other dishes before the meat comes out.  You get a large plate of salad, a bowl of steamed egg, a hearty tofu soup with beans and potato, and then 8 dishes of banchan.  A very impressive Korean feast indeed!!  I look at it all as a clever trap.  If customers stuff their faces with this, they'll eat less meat.  Everything I mentioned above probably costs them less than $4 in ingredients.  All tasty and worth sampling for sure, but keep your eyes on the prize!  Kind of like the salad bar at Texas de Brazil.  Trap!!!!The owner, Chu, was there during my last visit.  He said he was a good golfer and gave me his card saying we should golf sometime.  I hit my friend with a golf ball in the leg after a ridiculous slice 30 feet away the last time I golfed and dutifully informed Chu of this.  He decided to quickly change the subject by offering some grilled shrimp on the house.  That's only on the more expensive AYCE package that includes choices of several kinds of seafood and ribeye.  The shrimp were delicious and unusually sweet.  Nice guy.The table grills were decently ventilated meaning I wasn't wearing full on BBQ cologne afterwards.  I am a fan!
Acacia Cafe=If you are looking for a simple, moderately priced, fresh place to eat where parking is not too much of an issue at lunchtime, this is a good bet... The staff is friendly and open to you altering the menu items.  The salads and sandwiches are tasty and portion sizes are just right.  I am excited to go back for breakfast sometime soon.  Just one warning... the atmosphere is not much.  Acacia Cafe is located in a strip mall and it's clean, but not too much unique inside.  Go for the food if you are looking for something fresh and simple - do not go for the atmosphere or with extremely high expectations...Finally got around to trying this place out for breakfast Saturday morning and loved it - shared the veggie scramble sandwich and cinnamon french toast, both of which were delicious, and reasonably priced. Kind of a limited menu selection, but if everything else is just as good, that's not necessarily a negative thing. Extremely friendly staff - and they've got frequent customer cards, which I totally dig - my wallet's full of 'em. Most of them I don't ever get around to filling up or cashing in, but it's the thought that counts, you know - that promise of the free food reward at some point in the indefinite future... This one, though, I have a good feeling about - I might just cash this one in.Four stars because I've only been here once, when I return a few more times I'm sure they get the final star.This place reminds me of a European cafe. No frills, simple decor, and pleasant staff willing to help you make a decision.I had a breakfast burrito, forgot what it was called, it looked a little small on the plate but by the time I finished I was full and satisfied. Yummy.I wish this place had a bit more of a patio/landscaping, just my 2 cents.
Merkato Ethiopian Cafe=I'm in Las Vegas with my father for one night (don't ask, we're not getting married or any sick Red state shit like that) and I refuse to eat where we are staying because as much as I love me some free room service, I cannot handle when my only choice on the menu is a STEAMED VEGETABLE PLATTER.  that is right.  it is a platter of steamed vegetables and a scoop of white rice.  just typing that sentence makes me want to get sick all over this computer.  now, you might be thinking, "Laura, aren't you on Weight Watchers?" and to that I say, "Fuck you."  So anyway, I decide we're going to be adventurous and take a trip off the strip to a mostly vegetarian restaurant that I've been to before called Long Life Vege.  It's about a ten minute cab ride away, it's cheap and they have delicious fake meat.  Delicious.  While my dad may hate fake meat product, there is nothing the man loves more than cheap (the dude likes to be told how much you spent on his birthday present and if it's under $10 he will be all, "HIGH FIVE!" Once, my sister got him a pair of toe nail clippers from Mac Frugal's (RIP) for 99 cents and the man shed a tear.  HE CRIED, HE WAS SO PROUD) so we were in a cab faster than you can say, "faux chicken chow mein."  Well, our cabbie was a delightful chap from Somalia who was very affable and talkative and when he asked why we were going to a vegetarian restaurant, my dad said, "Because this one's a VEGAN!  Hahaha!' and they laughed and laughed.  Good one, you guys!  It IS hilarious when someone is vegan!  HAR DEE FUCKING HAR HAR.we pull up to Long Life Vege and the motherfucker is closed.  GODDAMMIT.  we ask our cabbie for restaurant recommendations and he suggests Merkato since it is nearby and he is a regular.  We get to Merkato and as we are getting out of the cab, both my dad and I realize that we forgot our wallets.  Well, actually, my dad forgot his wallet and I "forgot" mine, you dig?  I ain't paying when money bags is around!  I wrangle dogs for a living and my father gets hundred dollar bills poured on his head just for waking up.  Plus, there will be no social security left for me when i'm old and I gotta save NOW!  and by save NOW!, i mean buy that new ipod phone because it's SWEET!  do you think it comes in pink??We take a cab back to the hotel, my dad get his wallet, takes out another $100 from the ATM and we drive back to Merkato.  The cab is $45 at this point so my dad gives the guy what he thinks is $70 because he has put up with our insanity for the evening.  You're saying to yourself, "Who gives a fuck, Laura?" And to that I say, "Wait for it. You will get a mild satisfaction at the end but it's probably still not worth reading the whole long ass review."We walk into Merkato and are the only non-Ethiopian people in the place and it's crazy crowded.  Both VERY good signs for potential deliciousness.  I order the veggie combo (which was a very typical veggie combo: yellow lentils, red lentils, mustard greens, enjera salad, etc) and it was MAGNIFICENT.  One of the best i've had and I've had A LOT.  my dad got the dead lambert and said the flavor was fantastic but there was too much fat and gristle.  now, contrary to popular belief, i haven't always been vegan.  i used to eat meat and let me tell you, i liked the grossest meat.  tendons and gristle and marrow...i mean, i would CLEAN a chicken bone and then use a splinter to pick my teef.  i was a hardcore red neck of an obese 9 year-old until i figured out i was eating bambi.  ANYWAY, if you are currently like i was when i was 9 years-old, then get the lamb and when you're done, have your cholesterol checked because i'm pretty sure you're gonna drop dead at any moment.  So, we finish our fantastic meal about 15 hours after we first walked in (that's how they roll in Ethiopia.  Slowly.  But friendly.  Like this review.) and as he's paying, my dad realizes that instead of the $30 tip he thought he left our lovable cabbie, he gave him $115 tip.  MY DAD'S BAD!  we also realized that we had no way back to the hotel. luckily when i asked our waitress to call us a cab, she was all, "hold on" and disappears.  two minutes later, a guy who was eating a few tables over has us in his cab, headed back to the hotel.  Major bonus.In the end, we're dealing with:Cab rides: $135.  Dinner: $25 (for two HUGE plates plus two beers and tea)Average Cost of Dinner for Two People in Las Vegas in Some Cheesy Rip Off Restaurant On The Strip: $200.  So anyway, I think we still did good.  And there's a cab driver (Yasin!  Holla!) who is high rolling tonight.  Or, you know, sending money back to his family in his war torn country.  As my dad put it, his company is paying and screw those jerkwads, the better man (Yasin! Holla!) wins tonight!  I love my dad.  I am finally done, you can rest your eyes.  Get up, stretch, do some squats, get the blood flowing...you've been here awhile.Finally made it here just recently!  First experience with Ethiopian food and we are already contemplating going back the next day haha.  We went with an Ethiopian friend of ours which made the experience SO much better because he explained everything in detail, reasons why things are done a certain way and he had a great rapport with the owners and many customers in the place.  We felt like we were on a tour or something..it was great!We all shared the vegetarian dish with the beef tibs.  Oohhh the beef...soooo tasty!  Everything was delicious right down to the Amoeba water which is their version of Pellegrino.  Planning to do the raw beef dish next time.COMPETITIONThis is the best of a trio of Ethiopian restaurants within about 1000 yards of each other. The other two are (1) Lali-Bela is one street north and (2) Axum (across the street). A fourth restaurant named Meskerem is in front of the convention center.MANNERSEat with only your right hand. Very important! BEST ENTREEI had the Kitfo "Ethiopian version of steak tartar, raw red chopped beef" ($8)  and an Ethiopian beer for $3.50 and sat at the bar. For $8 you couldn't finish the food and it is very tasty. Take a chance on the raw meat! If you are scared stick with lamb tibs.SERVICEVery friendly people, nice service, excellent cuisine and rock bottom prices. Waitresses are very attractive.  They speak in a very quiet vernacular of British-African English which can be difficult to hear.DIRECTIONSThe strip mall is pretty seedy , and half the stores are empty. BUS: route #203 you catch on the Palazzo side under the overpass to the Wynn. Your 24 hour Deuce pass is also good for 24 hours on local buses. Try to be there on the half hour interval 15 minutes before or 15 minutes past the hour.DRIVE: Less than 2 miles from this intersection, plenty of parkingWALK: Questionable at night, OK in the day. It is a half mile from the southern back entrance to the convention center. Head south on Swensen and make a left at the 7-11.   If you walk between the Venetian and the Wynn you will follow the monorail route until you get to Paradise Ave. After you cross Paradise, Sands Avenue turns into Twain avenue and you begin passing McDonald's, gas stations and Latino themed strip malls, and apartments. The restaurant is about 1000 yards past Paradise Ave after you cross Swenson . There is a 7-11 on the end of the strip mall. The windows of Merkato are very dark, but it's near the corner of the L shaped building.I do not enjoy giving bad reviews, but based on principle, I have to give Merkato one star.First, I should state that the dining experience itself was good. We enjoyed the food. Being Filipino, we grew up eating with our hands. The prices are cheap. We went with a combination sampler plate for $15, which gave us a great introduction to their cuisine. We also ordered their whole fish dish for $10. It actually came with two nice sized fish and a large plate of rice with tasty sauce.If you want, you can stop reading here and head on over to try their food. You'll probably enjoy it.Everything was going well until it came time to settle the bill. I had a TownHog certificate for $30. I had mentioned it before we ordered, but suddenly the server said she didn't know what to do with it. She tried calling the owners but was unable to reach them after several attempts. Strangely enough, when she had me call using my phone, they picked up right away.To cut to the chase, the owner said he would not honor the coupon. He said he had called the company back in June and told them he no longer wanted to participate. So after sitting there for a long time, we ended up paying and leaving with a very bitter taste in our mouths.I just got off the phone with TownHog. The representative said that because Merkato has already been paid, she would have to call them to confirm that they refused the coupon before I can get a refund. They've already been paid? That just makes the situation worse. It's just not right. You agreed to sell these coupons in order to get people into your restaurant. That's exactly the reason I was even there in the first place. It's essentially marketing and it worked. It got me into your shop.It's really a shame because we did enjoy the food. But there's no way I can return based on that ordeal. Luckily, there are other Ethiopian joints around town with similarly good reviews.I -really- wanted to enjoy myself at Merkato Ethiopian Cafe.  I've never had Ethipian food and my companion had only enjoyed once so we decided to go to the highest rated place in Vegas that was the cheapest - Merkato seemed to be a great choice.We have been doing 30 days of vegetarianism so we decided on the pastries with lentils as an appetizer and the vegetarian combo that most people on Yelp rave about. I found it a bit strange when the vegetarian combo came out without the pastries/lentils - but figured that they would bring it out later or forgot to get it. She spooned a red chili-consistency food onto the sponge-bread plate that was the vegetarian combo. At this point I had finished my water before beginning to eat. Everything tasted good; the Injera (spongey bread) went well with everything but I found that it might have tasted better if it was warm instead of cold (not a beef with the restaurant). My companion took a bite and pulled something out of her mouth. This is where things took a turn for the worse.She showed me a small black rock that was in the yellow food that looked like mashed corn. I thought it might be a seed, and she dropped it on her plate - making a loud chink sound. I felt it and we definitely agreed it was a rock. A rock in our food? Really? A waitress never adressed if we were doing okay; but to be fair they were busy chatting with each other ALONE at the bar instead of helping their customers. My water was empty the whole dinner and was never refilled. I had to walk to the waitresses and ask them for the check. This is when the second strike happened.The check read a vegetarian platter and then an $8 appetizer that we did not order. Instead of giving us the pastry, they had given us a more expensive appetizer that they had scooped on to the plate. However, there was no way we could have known this during dinner because 1.) nothing was ever explained to us what each thing was and 2.) they appetizer apparently came at the same time as the vegetarian platter (and the description of the vegetarian platter is vague on the menu). I asked if they could take some of the cost off of the appetizer - I acknowledged  that maybe there could have been more communication, but it really was a mistake on the waitresses part for taking down our order wrong. She said "Oh no, because that's good stuff and you're taking it to-go." to which I responded "I don't want to waste your food, if you want to throw it away and take some of the charge off i'm okay with that;" She said she couldn't do anything and was completely unreceptive and unapologetic. Her view was that we should have told the waiter that we had received the wrong appetizer. My companion told her and showed the the black rock that was found in the food. No emotion. No apology. She just said "Oh..." Are you kidding me? We were astounded by how terrible the service was.Poor communication takes two parties, but they really dropped the ball on this one.Poor waiting service because I had to get up to ask for the check and no one came to check on us - they weren't busy with anything else but conversing with each other.Poor kitchen - there was a rock in the food. A rock.I'm very upset. I'm very sad that I'm writing a poor review; before this my companion always joked that I always have a great time and enjoy all dining experiences. That streak is over. Thanks a lot Merkato; avoid this place at all costs just in principle of the way they treat their customers.Restaurants that care more about money than sharing an experience with their customers don't deserve to be open - there are too many passionate and loving business owners/workers that are struggling to support an operation like Merkato.
Tomaso's=I had high hopes for this restaurant as I was directed to it by my friend and fellow Yelper, Donald S., and oh...my...God...was the squash ravioli at Tomasos AWESOME!  It was perfect.  It arrived quickly, was presented well, was a good portion for lunch, and geezuz, the sauce was to die for!  It was a bit expensive for lunch, but those of you who know me, know that I say that at almost every meal.  I'm cheap, what can I say?Oh, I forgot the bread!  It was perfectly baked and came with the most wonderful herb butter.  For bread lovers, this will be on the top of your list!I highly recommend this restaurant, and I can't wait to try it for dinner!
Satay Thai Bistro & Bar=I know I really busted balls with this place the first go round but hell I'm a paying customer and I expect a little decency. So 1st go round I just left & never ate so to be fair I ordered for take-out some pork & rice with some little egg roll/taquitos Im not quite sure what they were other than overdone. The meat was pretty decent-real tender and looked good but not any flavor and the dipping stuff was kinda orange marmalade stuff. The jasmine rice was really dry and just flavorless which i guess most rice is but i like some soy or sweet n sour with mine. It cost me $9.50 and I was still hungry after eating this. Not good Not bad just plain and a little pricy.What's not to love about a tower of beer the size of me? Throw in a couple of fried-grilled-baked-appetizers along with some good company and you have yourself a fantastic time. I can't wait for the temperature to warm up a bit and I'm going to this Happy Hour spot for Tuesday Karaoke Fight Night. The owner Jayson is actually very personable which makes my review even more biased because I only ate 2 items on their menu. Chicken wings and Satay were delicious! But any joint where the owner puts their sweat and soul into the food (minus real sweat) is a good joint for me. I really hope this spot will be busier than Firefly because I love both in this plaza. Next visit :sit on patio, order everything on happy menu,  and beer tower.
The Gelato Spot=I ~heart~ Gelato Spot!  Yum yum, it only took me 3 samples to make my choice.  The hazelnut was nutty goodness, the pistachio was delis, but I went with the passion fruit.  Great location, I love the heated patio.  I didn't even mind the smell of exhaust fumes from traffic, the gelato was that good!Im putting the same review on the 2 listing because My expeirence involved both locations. One location should not be isolated.I wrote an email to the director of quality control. I have pasted the conversation for you all!Hey,I love your gelato and I eat there once a week. It is expensive, do you have any programs like a punch card or something to give loyal customers a reward once in a while or like a free b-day gelato? Most websites have a place you can sign up for news and deals. I didnt see that on your site. I also wanted to say thanks for not using hydrogenated oil, I would reccomend and love if you considered removing it from your cones, or using a vendor that does not add it. It is becoming increasingly taboo. Plus the gelato is for the most part natural so Why stuff it in a cone that has oil banned in the entire state of California and on th ballot to be removed at tons of major citys.Lindsay,Thanks for contacting us regarding your concerns and praises.  Thank you very much for the kind words.  Please send me your address and I will send you some free coupons for being a loyal customer.  It's funny you brought up having a loyalty card for the gelato spot because this week I put the order in to have a electronic combo card.  It will have both features loyalty and gift card.  It will be similar to a Starbucks card but with more rewards.  It will be at least 1 month before this feature will become active since it interfaces with our Point of sale system it is a complicated process to integrate everything.  Also I did look at the ingredients for our cones and you are right about having partially hydrogenated oils in the mix being taboo these days.  I will look for another alternative to this problem quickly.  I will definitely let you know when I find new product. Unfortunately we do not make the cones from scratch like our gelato so I will have to do some research on possible making our own waffle mix.  Feel free to contact me anytime.  Thanks for hitting the gelato spot. Thomas PlatoDirector of Quality ControlThe Gelato Spotthomasp@gelatospot.comI love you Gelato Spot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So, it happens to be quite WARM here in Arizona. Like, ya know...105 degrees. Only. Psssh. That's all you got desert!? Bring it on. I want to cook my eggs on the pavement. Ok, I don't really. And if it gets any hotter here, I'll quite possibly melt. I'm just not cut out for extreme heat, unless the pendulum swings the other way and it's 25 below zero. Layers. Many, many layers. I'm way off track. So, it's hot. That means, we must eat cold stuff. Like gelato. And the world (and my body temp) was righted by a small peanut butter gelato with a cute little chocolate stick. Super cool (pun intended) cafe, funky furniture, creative coffee concoctions, free wifi, friendly people...Chillllllllll. I like. Dessert in the desert.I needed some caffeine to get me going this morning, so I met Jared at this G Spot location.  Who knew they were open for coffee and breakfast from 7am - 10:30am?  I had no clue - but I do now!  The coffee did it's job and kept me going all day... and Jared's breakfast sandwich looked awesome!  Fresh yogurt, fruit, granola, pastries, and muffins were available as well.  Since it's right around the corner from our new place, I am sure I'll be back soon... It's actually tempting to go back for an afternoon snack - I've been thinking about their 'pumpkin pie' gelato flavor of the month since hearing so much about it from the Yelp Birthday pARTy!  Is that bad to visit the G Spot twice in one day?!It's twofer Friday in the review column (I know, it should be 2-fer Tuesday, but that's just not how things worked out).After lunch at Stax, my daughter and I took a short stroll down Scottsdale Rd. to the G-spot. I have had coffee there in the morning few times, but I had not been in the mood for gelato at 7:10 am, while walking our pup.So today, in spite of the freezing temperatures outside, we had a gelato.Really good gelato! These guys are the real deal and the gelato is, I think, comparable to pretty much anything you'll find in Italy. I'm pretty pedestrian, and to me it's almost impossible to beat good old vanilla bean (I did taste the strawberry, too, and it was also delightful). The gelato was smooth and creamy, not too sweet, just great stuff!Whitney, my daughter had something chocolate and italian, which, try as I might, I can't remember the name of. She has more gelato experience than I do, and also thought hers was great.So, why 4 stars instead of 5? The 2 people (kids?) behind the counter. They could barely be bothered to respond to us, and appeared to very clearly not want to be there. I wouldn't go so far as to say the service was bad, but when I say "thank you" to someone or ask a question, I would like to get a response.So good coffee and gelato, with a little attitude on the side, at the G-Spot.In keeping with the Italian theme today, I decided gelato would make nice sweet treat after my delightful experience at Best of Italy (see how I interweave these things together...but wait, there's more!).In a rare "daily double" I am able to interweave National Pizza Party Day (come on...pizza is mostly Italian) with National Strawberry Month...That's right...strawberry Gelato!!!!There has been much less attitude and better  service by the staff on my recent visits to the G-Spot, and for that they get my thanks and my gelato dollars.It's funny, ever since Gabi posted the thread about strawberries...I've had a bit of a craving.G-Spot...you scratched my itch very nicely today:)Love some of their flavors here- coffee, roche (if you're familiar w/ Ferrero Rocher's chocolates, then you know what this selection will taste like), peanut butter, and now cheesecake!  My latest purchase was a combo of coffee and cheesecake... a must-try!I've tried some of the sorbets here a long time ago and liked them, but since it's been awhile, I'll have to make it a point to try them again to make a formal review.  With the weather heating up very fast, this task won't be very hard to do!   ;)Homemade gelato, Pascucci coffee, and now delicious salads, panini and wood-fired pizzas... this G spot really has it all!I was hesitant when I learned that the Gelato Spot in Old Town was coming out with pizzas and salads, but after my lunch there today, I'm completely sold!  I was there with Lindsey F, so I have a feeling she'll be updating her review soon too, but I wanted to beat her to it, so here it is.We shared the chicken louie wedge salad (iceberg wedge, chicken breast, cherry tomatoes, diced cucumbers, bacon, chives, avocado, champagne vinegarette, blue cheese crumbles, louie dressing, grana padano) although opted to get it minus the chives and blue cheese, and the american pizza (di napoli Tomato sauce, mozzarella fior di latte, italian sausage, spicy pepperoni, tuscan olive oil, grana padano) with mushrooms.  Both were delicious!  Seriously, the quality of the ingredients in both the salad and the pizza was evident... I cleaned the salad plate and ate my fair share of pizza too... We learned that this type of pizza is an art, and the pizza chef came from another well-known wood burning pizza place in town.  It was cooked just right and we were told it's best right out of the oven, so plan on dining in if you can.  Warning - the pepperoni really does have a kick!  I love the fast-casual ordering system (order at the counter and then your food will be brought to you).  Prices are reasonable ($9 for our huge salad and $10 for the pizza).  I may have to go for a panini next visit as they look pretty awesome too, and there is a huge selection with hot and cold choices ranging from Italian grilled cheese, veggie, sausage & peppers, turkey, tuna, and more!I enjoyed my  lunch so much that I forgot to save room for gelato, so I suggest saving a spot in your belly (a g-spot so to speak) when you go.  Buon Appetito! ;)get on their text club to save 20 percent!So very, very, very good. I'm staying at a hotel down the street and really wanted pizza for dinner (and also wanted to take a little walk!) so the Gelato Spot it was. When I saw "gelato and wood fired pizza" together on my Yelp app, I knew it was going to be a win-win situation.I have NEVER seen a place with this many gelato flavors. Holy cow! Any flavor you've ever wanted is here, and I was trying to decide which one I wanted to go with, when I laid my eyes on the sign... for gelato shakes. Gelato? Shakes? Gelato in a shake? I had to try it, and went with the small which meant I got to choose two flavors. Yellow cake batter and cookies and cream, it turns out, make quite a nice pair. They put them both in a blender with milk, and voilà! Something tells me I'll be visiting this place later in the week for another genius flavor concoction.For my pizza, I ordered the marinara, which comes with Di Napoli tomato sauce, fresh garlic, fresh basil, oregano, and Tuscan olive oil. I also added cheese to it. I carried it for about fifteen minutes back to my hotel and I was surprised at how well it held up! The pizza was so good, and the flavors all blended together perfectly. I really enjoyed the thin and chewy crust, and you could tell that the ingredients were high quality.I hear they have amazing coffee here and I want to try that next time... but if I had to choose one thing from this place, it's the gelato shake. Go try one for yourself and find out!"Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, you know? I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it? Unfortunately, in my case, it was only one woman for her.Joey: What are you talking about? One woman? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing. Cherry Vanilla. You could get them with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream. This is the best thing that ever happened to you. You got married, you were, what, eight? Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.Ross: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny."I find myself with a similar conflict at the G spot. And Ross hadn't even begun to explore the world of gelato yet. Wood fired pizza AND gelato in the same place should be illegal. There is just way too much happiness occurring all in one experience. And did I mention they are about to have cocktails as well? You know how after you experience your first orgasm, you want to just hide in your room and experience it again and again? Well, that's how I feel about the G Spot. They named it that for a reason, after all.SO-SO gelato in downtown Scottsdale!I was in the area of Scottsdale's little art-walk village and needed a little snack. The Gelato Spot sounded really good for an afternoon fix and so I went to check it out with my fellow travelers. Known for their homemade gelato and many flavors, I thought this place was going to be a hit, but unfortunately it was the opposite.Popular flavors recommended from the employees: Tiramisu*, Chocolate Caramel Brownie*, Almond Snickers and Coffee(note: * = what I ordered)- You can order a small, medium or large. - Prices range from $3.50-$5.50 per cup. - If you order a medium, you can have 2 flavors in your cup. - If you order a large, you can have 3 flavors in your cup. - Unfortunately, only the small can have one flavor. I ordered the a medium and tried the tiramisu and chocolate caramel brownie. The gelato was UBER sugary! I thought gelato was a bit too much in sugar and not enough in the flavor. I sorta kinda tasted a banana flavor in my tiramisu gelato. Not sure if the spoon that was used to scoop my flavor was mixed up with another. The chocolate caramel brownie was rich, but was probably a better choice than the tiramisu. Topped with a triangle cut piece of waffle cone and a cylinder chocolate swirl cookie, you can imagine this is sugar overload!I did have a chance to sample my grubber's coffee, almond snickers and pistachio flavors. I thought the coffee was the best out of all the flavors I had tried. Service was decent. No complaints there. It's nice that you were able to sample the different flavors prior to you making a final decision. Parking is within the downtown Scottsdale Art Village area.Not sure if I'd come back to this gelato spot. And to be honest, I've had better. I do have a sweet tooth, but unfortunately I was not impressed by the over-sweet gelato that was offered. I may have ordered the wrong flavors, but not sure if it's compelling enough for me to come back and re-challenge other items on their menu. I do hope that in the future - they don't make the gelato as sugary as I had during my visit. Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #267/27/113.5 stars.Took Mom here for her first visit and tried a couple of gelato dishes**.  The first was a "sundae" that consisted of two mini-scoops of roche and mango, with a chocolate crackle topping and some crushed almonds. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-gelato-spot-scottsdale-4?select=uFQNSuTdlIVr0JknTh8YZQ#uFQNSuTdlIVr0JknTh8YZQ  D'lish!  The second dish was a warmed brownie sundae, with a scoop of bacio gelato (chocolate-hazelnut gelato with chunks of dark chocolate).  Also quite good, but was made too rich with the addition of the chocolate syrup.  (I prefer rich and ever-so-slightly bitter ganache, or hot fudge as a topping, rather than sickeningly sweet and runny chocolate syrup.)  **I stopped going to Gelato Spot when I noticed I was getting allergy symptoms afterwards (rashes, stomach aches, and worse symptoms, of which I will spare you the details- you're welcome).Yummmers... the gelatos were looking perfect in their display and presentation was on point. So many flavors to choose from, many friendly staff to help you. I'm more of a fruity person so I always opt for a fruity option. When I was in Italy I went on a gelato eating spree- breakfast, lunch and dinner. And this place reminded me of why I wanted gelato because it's oh so delicious. I went for the some kind of berry mix (as usual) and it was delicious! My friend got the thin mints gelato and that was OMG good! It was a perfect balance between the actual thin mints and the vanilla. One thing was I felt the portions were smaller for the price. I believe it was like $4 ish and the scoop of gelato was stingier than others I've been too. It was deceiving because it looks round and full at the top but there's nothing down in the bottom ... boohoo. Oh another thing I liked about this place was you can sit on the patio and people watch, they have misters so you won't get hot. Also one of the few gelato places that is actually well ventilated.
Roberto's Taco Shop=Roberto's is a chain thats been popping up all over the Las Vegas valley. What do they serve? Good cheap mexican food. The burritos here are a little different from the ones I had back in Cali. Usually I'm used to having rice and beans in my burrito but the ones here only come with meat, sour cream, guac, and some pico di gallo... Not that I'm complaining or anything. What I usually end up getting is either the Carne Asada Nachos or the Carnitas Burrito. They have a huge menu with tons of other things but I stay loyal to my choices. Another thing thats good about this place is the consistency. I've eaten at Baha Fresh several times and each time its pretty hit or miss. Roberto's is guaranteed to fill you up and/or give you some comfort food to cure your hangover.So the next time you're hankering for some good cheap mexican food at 5am after a night of drinking and partying... GO TO ROBERTO'S! The kicker? You can go there when your not drunk either and its still good!Check out the picture I posted. I guarantee it will make you HUNGRY!Who can really complain about mexican food. Always come here whenever I want a quick bite in the random hours of the night.The 5 rolled tacos with extra cheese The Carne asada fries after a nice workoutThe California burrito to hit the spotAnd the breakfast burrito to eat half and save for when I wake up.Finally refreshing Jamaica to wash it all downThat's my story when it comes to robertos. The cashiers are always funny and cooks always hook it up when I ask for that extra queso! Like whopping handful of it!There is a need for a place like Roberto's in just about every city. Cheap, greasy, open late at night Mexican food should practically be a god given right. Food baby seekers look no further, just about anything from Roberto's is coma inducing (food and more) , and is the promised land for Mexican munchie heaven.I heard through the grapevine (read: drunk guy waiting in line to order) that this first ever Roberto's to open in Vegas. While I can't be sure of how true that is, I am certain the place practically looks it. A total dive with a handful of tables and a counter for ordering, along with suspect odors permeating the air that make you question if that's food or just the bathroom door left ajar. I've been to much nicer Roberto's before, but the dodginess of the strip mall and shady parking lot are charming enough to keep me coming back.Be it burritos, rolled tacos, or their infamous carne asada fries, all options here are a guarantee for satiating that hunger. The wet burritos are of worthy consideration and the enchiladas are plenty saucy, not to mention cheesy. Not to be confused with rich textural Mexican platos, Roberto's is more akin to junk food 2.0 with a little Mexican flair. Beware of too much crema, the back of your pants might just start whistling.Over the years, the prices haven't changed much. Most items are in the $4-7 range unless you decide to go baller status and throw in a few camerones (shrimp) dishes which are as much as $12. Seafood isn't cheap in LV and Roberto's is no exception. Thank goodness they accept credit cards.While I can't say I would recommend the tamales (dry, a bit of YMMV), I am definitely a sucker for their breakfast burrito. It's not too big, but it's hearty enough to pass for any sub 1,000 caloric breakfast item. Eggs are usually fluffy, the meat is solid, and the spiced out potatoes give an extra kick. For those of you who are back and forth with the meat selection, just know that machaca (shredded beef) is the way to go.Open 24 hours. Gracias to all who made this happen.
Layers Bakery Cafe=I'm so happy something locally owned open up in the shopping center closest to my house! Overall this place is pretty damn perfect - and a place I will be frequenting often when I'm eating carbs, or need a cake for a special occasion, or I feel like I'm not fat enough (it could happen, right?).The space is clean and bright and modern. Right up my alley there. I've been for breakfast a few times now and tried many many things. They have all been AWESOME. From the blueberry breakfast cake, to the cranberry scones (and I normally hate scones!) to the bacon egg bake, I really do love their baked things. So much yummier than panera or any other chain type place. I recently ordered a cake for a coworker's bday (the Boston Cream cake!) and it was really great. It was moist and covered in dark chocolate ganache so it wasn't too sweet. I highly recommend their cakes - especially if you are tired of the overly processed, too sweet garbage ones from the grocery store. A few things of note:*They don't do Vegan - a huge plus to me! I like to support places commited to a more natural way of baking. The idea of a vegan bakery is rather freaky in my book, so I'm pleased these guys do things the right way. *They do organic as much as possible - sugar, eggs, flour, all organic!!*All their egg bakes have tons and tons of veggies. I pick around most of them, but it's hard to find veggie free savory items for my husband here. *You do have to bus your own stuff. I find this really akward and annoying - if I wanted to do dishes I'd just eat at home and not spend $7.99 on a sandwich.Layers used to be next to Trader Joes on Sunset and Green Valley, I went a couple of times and was blown away by their pastries and the wonderful atmosphere in the place, so I was very excited to learn that they were relocating their store down the street from us. Unfortunately since the new location has been open there have been many minor disappointments adding up. For starters they've expanded their menu to include sandwiches, salads and soups. The atmosphere is now that of an eatery, cold and uninviting and the savory food is overpriced and deeply mediocre. They are clearly brilliant at preparing baked goods, and perhaps they should have stuck with what they are good at. I've had several of the sandwiches, all are greasy and overly heavy. I have a very adventurous palette and I always appreciate more experimental cooking, when it's done right. Unfortunately, the flavor and texture combinations here are bizzare and inappropriate at best. There is a chicken sandwich with smoked cheddar served on heavily buttered oatmeal molasses bread with bacon, caramelized apple and overly sweet caramelized onions. The description claimed that it would be served with bbq sauce, which could have alleviated the bland heavy sameness of the flavors, but what we got instead was something closer to mole, with definite hints of cinnamon and cocoa. The sauce by itself was interesting but it had no business on that sandwich. I've also had their meatloaf the flavor of which is good in itself, but is again, served on overly buttered bread with nothing to give the palette a rest from all that heaviness.The truth is that their baked goods are still fantastic and they have what I think is the best coffee in town. I could just not have lunch there and focus on the positive, right? Well... the customer service is chaotic and disorganized, and borders on rude, orders get forgotten and no thought is given to little things like if you get your coffee and your pastry first, and the pastry is heated up and sits on the table while you get through lunch it's going to be hard as a rock by the time you get to it.  At any given time there are 4 or 5 people behind the counter at what is a fairly small establishment, so being overwhelmed is not an excuse. Also, for the price, you would think that the food could at least be brought to your table. This place is not cheap. All minor things that make it a less than stellar experience. It pains me to write this review, I am always very excited about mom and pop places, and I want them to succeed. I wanted to like this place. The last straw came this past week when Layers posted a discussion on Facebook about a customer that complained about the taste of an order and expected an exchange or refund. It seems that they feel that their food is above reproach and that the basic rules of customer service don't apply to them. Blaming the customer for having bad taste when they don't like your product is not a smart approach, and in this case it succeeded in turning off at least two additional customers (my BF and myself) that were trying very hard to give this place a chance. I won't be returning any time soon.yes i do believe in giving a place a second chance, so i went in to layers with my nephew to get him a cookie and i got one. after we finished our cookies i did get a dozen cookies to go, the dozen did cost around 21 bucks so not the cheapest cookies but hay they were good. i do have to say their pastries are good even though their customer service and lunch options bite. i was actually not going to write this review and was going to continue stopping in for pastries but after the rude comment the owner themselves left on my last review i was prompted to make it knows that i will NOT ever set foot in the place again. the fact that they cant take simple criticism and respond to it childish and rudely is very sad. the fact is the place ain't worth a penny you drop at the place. LEARN SOME MANNERSThe stars are for the food.Zero stars for the owners. Why do you have to be so unpleasant? You are in the service industry remember? If you are trying to be funny stick to baking.Not great....In fact, I can't understand  the glowing reviews of this location.  Perhaps, as the owners so charmingly posted in a previous review, I just "don't get it".  I thought that the rather "charming" experience I had at Layers was simply the result of the owner or employee having a bad day but now I can see it is just part of the culture of this company. I came to this location with my child, who is rather rambunctious I can attest...but who was treated a bit more like he had some kind of airborne disease.  A look at their website will show you the kind of attitude that they seem to have towards the family oriented customer.  What's the charm in a place that treats its customers poorly?  I cannot believe that you suggested that a customer bring back their child's cake so that you could tell them what was wrong with it...or more accurately I imagine that you would tell them what was wrong with "them".  Not friendly, not spectacular food and horrible customer service skills.Keeping it real.That's what their sign says as you enter their parking lot from the corner of Green Valley Parkway & Horizon. After multiple visits to this wonderfully cute bakery, I'm now convinced they are doing just that, keeping it real yummy!Layers is a mom & pops bakery, serving made-from scratch comfort goodies. They use all-natural ingredients in every cookie, cake, quiche, salad, sandwich and loaf of bread.  All our dairy, fruits, vegetables, nuts, meats and cheeses are organic, and their menus change seasonally.Why do I love Layers?- They'll modify their menu items upon request to fit any dietary need. Allergic to nuts, gluten-free, no soy? No problem.- Great bakery selections. Cupcakes, brownies, cheesecakes, pastries, etc. So many delicious looking goodies!- Custom cakes. Good flavors, some can even be made gluten-free. I ordered a carrot cake for a birthday. Hands down, the BEST CARROT CAKE I EVER HAD. And I've had a lot!- Great service. All employees have been very helpful, friendly, efficient, and most of all, smiling!That awesome carrot cake I talked about? I was running late and I showed up at 5:25pm to pick it up. They closed at 5pm. They gladly let me in, took their time, made sure the cake was to my liking. They probably didn't have to, but they did, which won big points with me! Pay them a visit and see for yourself!I'd heard about this bakery from other Yelp friends for a while, so we met up here on a rainy Saturday afternoon so I could try it for myself.  First of all, it's not just a bakery, but a cafe, too.  Bright and cheery, there were quite a few customers here at 2:00pm.  Greg, the owner, started off well, impressing me by greeting friends Shirley and Tracy by name; they either come here all the time and/or Greg has a great memory and knows his customers.  I really wanted to try the Godzilla bar that Shirley had described, but they were out of them.  There were a lot more baked goods to choose from, though.  I settled on the Cinnamon Walnut Breakfast Cake with a small almond milk latte; yes, they have almond milk, another plus! I love cinnamon desserts and the breakfast cake did not disappoint; Greg warmed it up for me and it paired well with the hot latte, a delicious duo.  The cafe had a steady stream of customers the whole time we were there, even for the late afternoon hour.  Service was excellent and I look forward to my next visit to try that Godzilla bar.Another great place for breakfast/lunch in the Henderson area!One of my friends always brought their baked goods to our office, but I recently decided to try their actually food items!BIG plus for the organic, all natural, gluten free, nitrate free items they use for their food! Their Bacon & Egg Pie is to die for! Moist, succulent quiches with bacon, spinach, onion and cheeses! I've also had their Cafe Croissant - one time with gluten free bread and another with the actual croissant! The gluten free bread has a hard crust but soft middle, yet still tasty. The croissant has the light, buttery goodness to it! The sandwich comes with nitrate free turkey breast, white cheddar, honey mustard, bacon and greens!An almost guilt-free lunch if I must say!I have yet to return and try the other yummy items on the menu!Go in. Do this...- Check-in on Yelp and get a free small iced coffee. - Then get the banana bread with walnuts and chocolate chips. - Look at the chocolate covered bacon with confusion and wonderment. - Sip coffee. - Chew your insanely moist banana bread. - Think about going to Target. - Don't go to Target.- Finish snack and feel energized. - Write Yelp review about your experience. - Smile awkwardly. ProTip: The Wi-Fi is nonexistent. Hope your 4G is tops govna! Cherio!
The Capital Grille=Some say the first time is always the best and, in my case, I found that true. In between politicians kissing ass for my vote in DC, I went to my first Capital Grille just down from the Capital Building (no kidding) because it looked like a nice bar. And it was. Crammed chock full of political memorabilia, cigar smoke and wine, they also made a killer martini. Since I wore a short skirt, the martini's were free. What got me eating was the curious slabs of beef hanging in the window. "Dry Aged" is what they call it. This is not a new way of curing a steak but the very first way, pre-refrigeration, allowing the connective tissues to naturally decompose creating a very tender meat. I had what they call the Kona-Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin (or something like that) and it was fabulous! The meat melted in my mouth. Definitely a must return-to place. Then, I took a girlfriend to the Vegas one and down went the opinion polls even though I ordered the very same thing. Maybe it was the pretentious, lah-di-dah crowd waving $100 bills (newly-minted rubes from down in the holler?), the mall we had to wind through to get here fighting off aggressive Israeli "Red Sea" salt-crystal venders, or the over-the-top waiter ("Eh, gulls, I killa fa yew") and so-so steak (it obviously wasn't made for Ted Kennedy's gluttonous taste ) but that'll be an Aye vote for DC and a Nay vote for Vegas. Maybe the climate will change in '08...I stopped by here yesterday for dinner and ordered the french onion soup, rib-eye steak, creamed spinach, truffled fries.The onion soup was strong with huge amounts of cheese.....great flavor except the soup was so hot that it burned my mouth:(The steak was super, super tasty.The fries and creamed spinach were super good...perfect sides!!THE VIEW and furnished interior is OUTFUCKING STANDING..........!!One of the most beautiful restauants that I have been in.....love the seats....love the sights of the strip!.Very romantic.....Today, I have to raise my review of Capital Grille from 4 to 5 star.  Here is what is going on.....1.  I eat here at least 6 -8 times a year for dinner, with clients. Easy choice due to my last review details of class, extraordinary service, food quality and reservations.2.  Last night, I was in "trouble" because we were taking my son out for dinner for his 18th birthday with his friends. I was feeling a bit generous as he is doing so well in school, his friends are great and so, we wanted to have something special.3.  Special meant, on the strip, good view, great food, feeling pampered and special.4.  I made reservations at the last minute, 5:00 pm for a 7:30 pm dinner. Why, because i needed class and where we were going wasn't special enough.5.  I asked for a window seat due to my son's birthday. They did not promise, however, they said they would request.6.  Here is what we got...a.  Best table seat in the whole restaurant. Right in the corner with great views.b.  A birthday card with a nice touch, a wax seal envelope, that wished my kid happy birthday and thanking him for dining with them.c.  The service was beyond extraordinary. It was simply staggeringly special.d.  The food, was beyond really good. It was just right.  We had the Delmonico (bone in rib eye), the Porcini rubbed Delmonico (dry rubbed porcini finished with a 12 year balsamic dressing), sliced Filet Migon, Calamari, and Prosciutto wrapped Mozzarella as starters.  For sides, we had the Lobster Mac and Cheese, the Au Gratin Potatoes, Truffle Fries and Creamed Spinach.I guess, when all said and done, the best review is from the young men..."Best Steak ever".  OK, while we know that they haven't been to all the best steak places in LV to qualify, the fact is that it was great and I have been to many  steak places in the world.People, when you are looking for an experience, this is the place.  Kudos to Tiffany for taking my reservation and making it special.  Kudos for Eric who helped us make decisions, and made for a great evening.Thanks Capital Grill for making our night so great.  It doesn't get better in my book and Happy Birthday son!Before a show at Wynn, I came here for dinner.  I was early but it was OK and I was seated at a window table with the marvelous third floor view of the boulevard and the Wynn/Encore towers.I was brought bread, ice water, and iced tea quickly.  My server, Eric, was top notch!  He explained various things on the menu since it was my first visit to the restaurant.  He then left me to mull the choices before coming back to see if I had any questions or was ready to order.I ordered a cup of potato leek soup, the bone in Kona crusted sirloin and the parmesan truffle fries for a side.  Everything was very, very good.  The potato leek soup was creamy and served with a few very thin, slightly deep fried fingerling potato slices.  The soup was rich and very enjoyable.I ordered the steak blue and that's just the way it came.  It was very good and I almost picked up the bone to gnaw before I let them take the plate.  The parmesan truffle fries were addictive.  If anyone from the FDA comes to this restaurant, the fries will be listed as a Class xx addictive drug.  I hated to finish only a small amount but I didn't want to overdo it.For dessert, I got the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  It was very rich and had a good dark chocolate/coffee flavor--strong but not overpowering.  I gave my compliments to Eric for the staff on such a good meal.  It was a great start to the evening.  The view through those windows along with the excellent food and service make the Capital Grille a real winner.
Yasu Sushi Bistro=OK, so I don't normally blog like this, but I've just gotta write about this place.  Yasu Sushi Bistro.  The most amazing resturaunt experience I've had in a long time and probably my new favorite place.  Hiding in a strip mall in PV (53rd St & Cactus) is this brand new, upscale little sushi/sumibiyaki joint.  Introduced to me by my wonderful friend Eric.  I met Ryan Kim who showed us the best of the best they have.  First off, atmosphere was great, dim light but not too dark, interesting but delightful music selection, eclectic but themed art selections hanging.  Small patio area outside and just a handful of tables inside.  I passed up the delightful list of sake for the night and started off with edamame, very fresh tasting with just the right amount of salt.  Eric had the miso, which looked quite good for just soup, I hear it's all made from scratch, so no wonder.  We ordered the Power and Phoenix rolls after Ryan explained what was what (my Japanese isn't much of anything yet).  Also after reading the New Times review I was eagerly looking for the Washu.  Ryan also informed us that they have quit stocking it and went for a higher grade, Wagyu. I was now anticipating this even more after hearing how this is the most tender meat in the world, right above Kobe.  The beef was the first to arrive, on a long neat platter served with garlic chips, cut into small cubes, and lightly sea salted.  Alongside the tray came a small bincho-tan fed ceramic grill.  I'm still trying ti find the name of the grill, so please anyone knowledgeable, fill me in. The bincho-tan being imported from Japan along with the grill itself and the beef just made for an immensly unique experience, at least here in the states. The warmth of the grill and pleasant aroma of the charcoal was just the beginning.  Using our chopsticks, we grill the meat tabletop to perfection.  We were told that we're just the second people to try the new menu item so the staff was watching for reactions.  After being built up to this moment, it was surprising to find that it really was everything they said and more than I was expecting.  The look on my face was all head chef Yasu needed to know to understand how satisfied I was.  Words cannot describe it, but this was the best tasting meat I've ever had, so tender, juicy, melt in your mouth amzing flavor.  Yasu even stepped out from behind the counter, brought a small bowl of lemons and told us to just drip a bit on the cooking meat to flare up the charcoal and get more flavor from the smoke.  Wow!!! Again, even better, I was in heaven.  Our rolls arrived alonside and order of calamari.  Each roll had such unique flavor and distinction from every other place I've been.  You can tell what care has been given into making each item.  The calamari was not rubbery or tough unlike others.  Normally it's just a side, but now it made me stop and revel in it's taste as well.  Just when we thought we couldn't go any further though, Ryan suggested dessert.  Ok, I thought, why not.  Red Bean/Banana spring rolls sounded good, but with their opinion we also tried the new item, green tea cheesecake fondue.  I was glad for the second, a small burner with a combo of white/milk chocolate came paired with skewers of soft green cheesecake for dipping.  Crumbled nuts and bananas on the tray just enhanced the flavor as this truly was a dessert I would not have wanted to miss.I know my words are not those of a food critic, but just trust me, you HAVE to try this place to understand how remarkable and different it is.  By far not just another sushi joint (which I barely got in to but saw other plates go by and wanted them too, nigiri and sashimi).  I cannot wait to return and will accompany anyone who wants to make the trip.Well, hate to join the bandwagon, but this place is the real deal! I went here based on Yelp reviews, which after almost a dozen, averaged 5 stars! But several were from newbies to sushi, so I was skeptical, even with a recent ROTD. Had to try for myself.Yasu's is in the Target/REI mall on the corner of East Cactus and Paradise Valley Parkway West, on the edge of Scottsdale and PV, adjacent the Army Recruiting office! The restaurant is immediately recognizable as Japanese owned, by its tasteful and elegant decor in subdued natural tones of wood and stone colors. Clean, modern, with understated class and attention to detail. It isn't large, with only 10 tables inside, 8 4s, a cozy 2 by the sushi bar, and a 6 in front of it, with a small L shaped stool bar next to the sushi bar which only has 2 benches seating 2 each. Outside are 3 more tables in a fenced patio with Tiki lamps aburning. There is a hostess, a Japanese floor manager, several youthful Eurasian servers, and a mostly Latino kitchen staff. Yasu and Takeshi do all the sushi behind the sushi bar, and pace each diner well. They specialize in a daily special menu. Samples for a Friday night included:- Kampachi (baby yellowtail) $12- Kumamoto Oysters (half shel or Sumibi) $10- Aji (Spanish Mackerel) or Striped Jack sushi or sashimi ($5.5/$12 and $7.5/$16 respectively)- Whole Black Snapper (from the Sumibi Yaki Grill) $20- Saikyo Beef Tongue ($8)- Grilled Pike ($8.5)- Grilled Squid Surume ($13.5)- 5 oz Wagyu ($75)- Cornflake Shrimp w/Tartar Sauce ($8.5)- Karaage Black Snapper ($22)- Sake or Miso Steamed Manila Clams ($8.5/$9)- Foie Gras w/ Japanese Eggplant $13.5 Obviously from other reviews, many of these are standard faire daily. Sushi is moderately priced, with basic Nigiri from $4.5 - $5; Exceptions are sweet shrimp ($8), Crab Leg ($6.5) Uni and Mirugai ($7.5). Sashimi are reasonable from $7.5 - $10. Rolls from $4 (Maki type) up to $12 max (hand styled). I went for a $50 Omakase (I count on you, chef) and Takeshi went to work. 1. Duo Cherrystone Clams on half shell atop its own caligraphy covered ceramic charcoal hotpot, garnished with minced green onions, fresh ginger and a dab of spicy tuna mix, doused with Ponzu sauce, taken to a boil in front of you. OMG! AYKM? ($7.5)2. Crystal white Himame (Fluke) fish garnished with minced green onions, morsels of katsuyaboshi (bonita shavings), ponzu, and shaped and decorated to look like a mini sperm whale with eyes and gills ($5.5)3. Hard to find Striped Jack (Shimajii) red striped white fish au natural ($7.5)4. Saba (Mackerel) served without garnish ($4.5)5. Seki-Saba (special mackerel only bought in 2 places in Japan, just arrived today) $6 (smoothest, melt like butter Mackerel you will find!)6. Sake (Salmon) Yasu Style: Scored, seared on the Sumibi Yaki Grill for a smokey flavor, sprinked with ponzu sauce (don't dip into shoyu/wasabi!). Best tasting salmon I have had! Soft and flavorful! ($4.5)7. 4 inch long narrow hand roll filled with buttery Uni and a hint of spice ($7.5)Total with $6 large Asahi Super Dry: $49.I waited 20 minutes for the sushi bar, and as it happens that I was a single, another single came nearly simultaneously, and we talked, shared sushi, and with Japanese politeness, poured each other's drinks. I shared sushi, and they shared Seared Scallop Carpaccio, which were about 8 small sand dollar sized scallop slices, very tender and white, garnished with minced negi, katsuyoboshi, and ponzu.I complimented Takeshi (Umai, Oishikatta, Subarashii!) and left him a $20 bill because I was so happy! (I tipped the wait staff, too)Anything Asian with "Bistro" in the name makes me a bit nervous that it is some convaluted Fusion Crap joint trying too hard to be Hip and Chic. Not the case here!Yasu's rivals other sushi-ya in LA, SD, SF, LV and Seattle, and costs less than ones of equal quality and creativity. I highly recommend it!I live in what might possibly be one of the finest cities for sushi in the US....yep, Los Angeles (Feel free to argue or debate this point with me and then tell me where to go, cuz I am a sushi ho!). Specifically, I live in Studio City; the home of sushi row, the land of sashimi wonderment and the prime pallate real estate that holds faves like Asanebo, Nozawa and Iroha. So imagine the pressure my co-worker, Gabi K, was under to find a sushi place worthy of my snobby and know-it-all sushi taste buds.She chose Yasu and dammit, she chose well! I thoroughly enjoyed the tasty treats we had here last night and I would definitely come back if I lived here. I really liked the hamachi with jalapeno. It was a little light on the ginger sauce, but still very good. We also tried the tuna carpaccio that mixed walnuts with it. Very different and very good. We also tried one of the featured scallop specials that was good, but a little too heavy on the scallions for my taste. I wanna taste the scallops and they got a little lost in the onion madness. We also tried the shishito peppers, good, but a really small portion and the eggplant. Oh and I can't forget to mention the miso-marinated black cod. Very deelish.Definitely check it out. The atmosphere is nice and charming, the service is attentive and helpful and they serve a nice Pinot Grigio to boot. Good times :)This seriously is one of the best sushi places I've ever been to - and I love me some sushi so have had alot.I went here with your PHX yelper Nadia C. - we were in town visiting for the weekend and she was excited to take me to Yasu since she knows a) I love sushi, and b) I love great food.  I was blown away by how great this place was - and it's in a STRIP MALL!  I would have never picked it out unless i lived in the neighborhood.  We had sooooo much food.  We ordered several apps, oysters, rolls - and were so impressed by the chef that when we wanted to add more, we told the waitress to have him surprise us.  Their special rolls are inventive and unique - the Red Roll was my favorite.  The sashimi was incredibly fresh and high quality.  We were visiting for a long weekend, and loved it so much we ended up going back again 2 nights later.  Had to get my Yasu fix while I could!  I will definitely be going back the next time I'm in Phoenix.They say the middle of the road is a good place to get hit, but that's where I am with this place.   The Bad: 1. We were seated at the smallest table ever to be in a restaurant, I think the Guinness Book sticker was on the side of it. 2. Then we were handed two large "book style" menus, a sushi menu, a drink menu, and a sinner special menu.    Just shuffling all that paper made us a little crazy.  SIMPLIFY PEOPLE!3. One of the items we order was brought to us on a plate that was so large that it hung over the side of the tiny table. Very dumb because there was no reason other than "looking cool" in the kitchen when they made it.4. A little pricey for what you get.The Good:1. The bacon wrapped scallops (only 2 for $8.50) were awesome. The best I've ever had.2. The waiter was very helpful with drink and food suggestions. (Keep in mind that he seemed to see we were having a tough time flipping through all FOUR menus.)3. The Red roll was out of this world.4. The place itself is as nice as your gonna find in any strip mall in AZ.See, 4 good points and 4 not so good points.  This one is up to you to check out and see for yourself.This is my first review on Yelp so here you go...I love Yasu!!  This is by far the best sushi and authentic japanese restaurant in Phoenix.  I have been there numerous times and it never disappoints.  You have to try their Sumibiyaki which are items cooked over Japanese charcoal, last time I was there I had the beef tongue..sounds weird but its so goodNigiri/sashimi are a must.  They always have the best selection and daily special, most important...its always fresh...this is definately important!!  The sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order, you will find the fish is sliced with great execution.  Request fresh chopped wasabi, you will never eat sushi with out it again!  Love this place!!I personally have no clue why the amazing reviews. For one they have 4 menus, its bizarre and unnessasarry. Then they like got one of the menus in off white with like highlighter print and you cant even see the writing. Dinner service is slow as it gets. It took me an hour and a half to get 2 rolls and the last time 2 hrs for like 3. The fish itself is fresh, I had things there that were good and stuff that was not at all good. Whoever cuts the fish has no experience clearly. The slices are thick and cut in odd places. The scallop carrpaccio was realy good and the yellow tail carpaccio was kinda gross and in huge thick chunks. If you can combine all four of your menus hire a few more servers or kitchen help, andtrain the dude who cuts blocks of fish this place has a solid foundation for success its just a few things that keep me un interested. If I was invited here by a friend I might come back but I would not reccomend or elect to come back with out influence. I dont talk like that??Yasu is usually one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of being in. It consistently wows, with inventive dishes and a definitive style that always have me wishing I was walking back in when I'm finally heading out. Yasu himself is charming and helpful and they have one wonderful, awesome waiter- an American with a suspiciously Japanese name who goes out of his way to help. We did not get him. On a Sunday at 7pm myself and 5 friends met for our reservation. We are all repeat customers. HEAVY repeat customers. We ordered drinks and about the time they finally showed up, a cool 25 minutes later, we were informed they were all out of tuna. Wrr? We all sighed and said... ok and ticked off an awful lot of other sushi options which we then turned in.  A few minutes later, our waitress (emphasis on the 'wait') returned and said that the wait was 35 minutes for sushi and would we care to order from the kitchen? We reluctantly said ok and placed a few orders. So imagine our surprise when moments later our sushi began to arrive. Well. Sort of. Our waitress appeared with 3 uni shots instead of 6. All 6 of us eyed them, wondering who we'd have to take out to get one, and I calmly ask the waitress to retrieve our other uni shots "expedited, perhaps"?  Instead our waitress walked around the restaurant puzzedly WITH the uni shots like a nomad until she returned 5 minutes later to say there was no more uni.  A nice bunch, we all surrendered our shots until the three smartest amongst us grabbed them and then crowed about their taste.  The waitress offered us 3 oyster shots instead. They sucked. So it was odd when oysters showed up WITH uni on them (though we should say we did order them with uni) a bit later. 5 of them. For the six of us. It is now an hour into our meal. We have already begun texting sweet republic, begging them to stay open. Or atleast bring us ice cream, because were hungry, damnit. A process is established. Every 30 minutes or so a single dish of sushi or something arrives. We each eat one piece, compliment it, and then spend 30 minutes digesting. Halfway through a waiter or waitress will appear to let us know something we ordered is out. But they have "everything else".  We have stopped being quiet and are now openly hysterical. And hungry.  At some point management approaches and we instruct him to turn around and go away until he has good news. They are out of our sake, but are happy to suggest another that is 3x the price. One of the diners suggests they comp it. He laughs. After three hours, all still a wee bit hungry, but 80$ poorer and without a glimmer of hope for sweet republic, we depart. We've been comped nothing. Not an "I'm sorry". Not a "hey, have some edamame on us". Not a "we've knocked 10% off the bill".  We are a bit hysterical over the comical situation, but also not a little pissed. A 400$ bill for a bunch of regulars with a reservation?  Sigh.OFFENSIVE. Tonight I had the most offensive and unprofessional experience at Yasu; I will never ever go back and I would only recommend it to someone I hate.A group of four of us arrived at Yasu for our 6:30PM reservation and were seated promptly. We chatted for a while as water and other beverages were brought out and we went ahead and ordered the chef's choice menu so we could see the best of the best that Yasu had to offer. I've had great experiences with chef's choice at Yen, Pure, and a number of places in Boston so I expected the same from Yasu.We entertain ourselves for a while until the first course arrives. 8 kumamoto oysters with uni and roe. Great play of textures and flavors. Kudos. Plates are removed and now we are getting excited, sashimi must be coming next and we are ready for it! The special fish selections of the day looked fantastic.About 20 minutes goes by and we get our second course, red snapper carpaccio. it is seared and served at room temperature. One of my pieces had i don't know, tendon or something that made it unyielding to my chopsticks, and frankly, the temp of this dish was iffy. Flavors decent, but this is not the mass quantity of sashimi or nigiri I was anticipating.The restaurant starts filling up. I see a massive plate of rolls come out of the kitchen and I nearly squeal with glee...until I watch it come to rest at another table.  This starts happening at a regular pace, and then I realize it's been a full 30 minutes since we've had anything at our table. A server comes by so I ask when the next dish will arrive. She mumbles something about the chef's choice taking a little longer than other orders and walks away.Another cooked plate. A gross mushroom custard, a single shrimp on a skewer, an 1/8th of a cup of japanese eggplant in red miso sauce, a shard of spanish mackerel with some sort of puree, and two bits of jumbo clam. Everything tastes fine, but we are OVER the cooked plate situation.Yet ANOTHER 30 minutes goes by. No server, nor manager comes to apologize for the delay. We watch literally dozens of delicious looking rolls, nigiri and sashimi fly out of the kitchen to other tables. We also watch 4 other couples come in after us, eat loads of food, and leave before us. We are still hungry.Next course...Clams in miso broth. We are not offered spoons for the broth. We look at each other, thinking, "we ARE at a sushi restaurant, are we not?" but go ahead and eat the clams.  When the server comes by and asks how it is we tell her that we hope the next course will begin the actual SUSHI part of this dinner. She says yes, we are having live scallops.About 25 more minutes pass and I'm starting to vibrate with righteous indignation. We are clearly paying a fucking fortune for this meal and we are receiving terrible treatment. The "live scallops" are boiling in miso broth over a mini-charcoal grill. They are so over-cooked they are RUBBERY. We hurry to get them off the coals and into our mouths before they are completely ruined.Finally we tell the server that we are going to have to INSIST on getting some raw fish on the table. She says that's what's coming next. "Next" meaning ANOTHER 30 minutes later. We wait so long that finally we tell the server we are NOT going to continue with this absurdity and that we want the check. "oh your next course is ready!" "we don't want it. We want to leave" These are the exact words out of our mouths. Instead of bringing the check she brings the plates, telling us that Chef Yasu "wants us to have them." We all resist and the plates are set down anyway and finally our hunger makes us cave and we eat. We have now been at Yasu for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. We've had five courses that were not enough for two people, much less four.Another 15 minutes pass before the check arrives. In that time, the manager has come out, not to rectify the situation, or apologize, but to call us ignorant and classless. He literally looks at us and accuses, "Have you ever had omakase before? It is always slower." We look at him and tell him in all of our sushi eating years we have never had an experience akin to this. We also point out that we were expecting SUSHI, as in RAW FISH. He tells us we told the server we would eat 'anything'. I asked him if the name of his restaurant was Yen SUSHI Bistro and he looks at me, puzzled. Then I see that we have been charged $20 for the last course that we TWICE tried to send back. I speak to the manager who tells me "if Yasu wants to charge you for it, he will charge you for it." I kid you not. All in all each course was mercilessly over-worked, only average and Yasu is on a major ego trip. Don't waste your time and money here.There are few places that I make a decision to NEVER step foot into again. Yasu has earned this dubious distinction from me. First, let me give you my background with sushi since this came into question from the manager himself. I have been eating sushi for about 11 years. Some really bad sushi, some amazing sushi. I have mentioned in previous reviews that I have had sushi fresh off a boat in Hawaii. While I don't claim to have had ALL the sushi in the world, I know what good sushi and what good sushi service is. Second, let me tell you that I have had omakase (chef's menu) in several locales, so I know what it entails. I was with a group of friends on my highly anticipated visit to Yasu Sushi Bistro. We had made a reservation and were seated immediately. We quickly decided to indulge in the omakase menu. We wanted the best that Yasu Sushi Bistro had to offer! I always say "Hit me with your best shot!" Well... if you have nothing to do, and aren't hungry...you should do the omakase menu. It took Thirty Minutes between courses. And please don't think we were given platters full of food. This is more like 2 small oysters per person, A plate of 1 shrimp, a couple slices of King Claim, a dollop of Spanish mackerel tartar on a bone chip.... So think tiny gourmet food. So think how hungry and irritated I was Two HOURS later. In a 3.5 hour visit, we had consumed Four tiny dishes. I really tried to be patient, but this is absurd and unacceptable! I finally asked for the check as we wanted to leave and go eat elsewhere. I expressed my displeasure at the slowness of the meal. Now before you Yasu lovers roll your eyes and shake your fingers at me. Let me put it in perspective. At ANY restaurant, it is unacceptable to be the first table to arrive, watch subsequent tables seated, and fed, and watch them leave and you're still waiting to be fed... you would be ticked off too. Now add to that a condescending manager who comes over to talk to you and asks if you have ever had an omakase experience before and tries to piss in your pocket and tell you that it's raining. Unacceptable. Now, add to that the restaurant sending out another dish after you had already asked for the check and then CHARGING you for that dish even though you said you didn't want the dish. I have nothing against the food, though it wasn't very imaginative on the SUSHI level. What killed the entire visit was the slowness of the courses, the response of the management, and the lack of ethical treatment in regards to the check. I will never visit Yasu Sushi again and I bet my stress level will be all the better for it.A recent trip with my husband to Yasu  last Saturday night began with being ignored, followed by more ignoring, and ended with being ignored as we left. I was not even wearing my cloak of invisibility.We waited at the hostess stand for five minutes before being greeted (even though the hostess made several trips to the podium without any acknowledgement) and were then directed to the bar where we sat another five minutes without being greeted or offered a beverage. We did however, stare at the bartender while he ate something and ignored us.We went to Roka Akor.Yasu, Yasu, Yasu!! You are simply ADORABLE!!! :)The restaurant and the owner!! This place is delicious, ever so fresh and innovative!Plus, the service here is always five stars, the food and ingredients are the freshest ever. Service was great, our waiters have always been super friendly and informative of items and specials. I also love how well this place is decorated, it's dimmed and very private.   Awesome place to go to have a nice quiet dinner. :)
Fuego Bistro=I stumbled upon this place on my way to Dicks Hideaway.. The sign outside, located just off 7th St. and Bethany Home drew me in.. I love Latin food and they do not let you down. I have since been there 3 times and overall my dining experience has been good.The place is hidden and only has about 10 tables inside the restaurant and there are a few patio tables also. The on my first visit I had the tropical shrimp martini for an app, then went with the special - a crab stuffed chili relleno. It was so good I was disappointed the second visit when it was no longer a feature.. I've also tried the tilapia and it was equally good. And their sangria is wonderful, I could drink a gallon, but it is pretty strong so maybe that is not the best idea :)The only drawbacks? On my third visits I sat on the patio, there is a dance studio next door and they play their music very loud while practicing routines. We had to listen to the same chorus line thought the entire meal, I think that song has been permanently engraved in my brain, and it was not a good song. Another disappointing thing was the pernil asado, I am big pork fan but what they served was a big, greasy and fatty mess, I will not try that entree again. Overall the food is pretty delicious and the place has a great ambience (if you are not sitting outside during dance class). You feel so cool discovering such a hidden and quaint spot you want to tell everyone about it.I had high hopes. Obama is our president...the Cardnials are one win away from the super bowl....things are looking good. I would have to say that Fuego didn't live up to the expectations. The prices are a bit high (20$ per plate) for the style of the place (casual) and for the food itself. It was good, but not great. We had the empanadas. Interesting...but try them at Mi Cocina Mi Pais (great!). Fuego's are good...but too much pastry...and a sauce that tasted like a wing sauce (like would be great on hot wings but overwhelmed the empanadas). The drinks were good but again not amazing. Mismatched glasses and plates (I mean that is sort of cute, but not for a nice dinner out).The Ropa and the Pernil were good. The corn was ok (not enough flavor) and the mashed potatoes were overpowered with chipotle flavor (which I usually like)Everyone was nice. Our server was a little too familar...but whatever. There was this really sad folksy music playing. For a cuban/latin place, get some freaking latin cuban music.   The music made the whole vibe a bit odd.  I felt I should go get high afterwards and think about the sadness in this world...:)   But (my wife is making me say this)...the singer was talented. Keep up the good work buddy, maybe at a different venue.Overall, it was ok. Not worth the drive and probably won't be coming back. With so many other great places in PHX, this one needs some fine tunning to be amoung the list.No place does a better job of transporting you from a nondescript commercial corner of central Phoenix to a quaint open air patio of San Juan better then Fuego.  It will utterly surprise you how comfortable that spot is.  It definitely eases you into a singular culinary experience.The menu is relatively small but that's not a problem.  Every dish is percolating with flavor.  The Cuban-southwestern fusion that they've got going on is enough to make Fidel wonder if he should foment a revolution out here....just so he could get closer to these dishes.  The pork dish is on par with the Barrio Cafe Cochinita Pibil in terms of bliss. But the nod goes to Fuego when you consider the incredible sides, namely the jalapeno creamed corn and mashed potatoes.  The tilapia is also an item worth the return visit.  A great restaurant, in my opinion, is a combination of several things namely food, service, and location.  The Fuego excels on all three counts.  Drop by and experience what it is like to escape Phoenix while still being in Phoenix.Fuego Bistro: This is what a bistro should be. Had it not been for a great deal on Groupon, I don't know if Robert M and I would have made it for dinner here. It's not that we hadn't thought about it, it's just that it's oddly located. But that's neither here nor there, because last night we dined--and we dined well. We started our date with sangria--Robert the white and I the red. Initially I thought I'd erred in my decision (the white was fruity and intense while the first taste of the red was merely okay). But then the complexity of the red unfolded, as spices piqued out and enveloped the glass. Either way, both are exceptional. Our first course was the empenadas. In a word: Magnificent! The perfectly flaky crust and the robust filling could be an entire meal of its own. I, however, would do away with the hot sauce served on the side. Just a preference, or if they had a house salsa that would be good. Main course was the Pollo Ajedrea for Robert and the daily special (chile rellenos stuffed with scallops, shrimp and tilapia) for me. Sides were chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes for both of us and black beans for Rob and green beans for myself. After sampling our own entrees, we tried each other's. To be honest, after being blown away by my dish, the chicken was a bit flat, and that by no means indicates it wasn't very good. It's just that I was so amazed by the chile rellenos. It was one of the things of which I dreamt last night. Those mashed potatoes were another thing dancing through my head. :dreamy eyes: It's located in a ballet studio complex, which is enchanting. There is also a lovely patio which some braved the cold last night on which to dine and be entertained by a local musician. Once the weather becomes more tolerable, I'll give it a go. Service was fantastic! Susan was genuinely friendly, as if we were regulars, and cemented the deal that we would be back again and again. Fuego Bistro has an incredible happy hour, from what I understand, that runs from 3-6 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. Yes, boys and girls, I said Saturday. They have about two dozen items from their menu for $5 (including those empenadas) and assorted cocktails. This could turn in to a sordid love affair, if I don't mind myself.My friend and I had such a wonderful happy hour here. After a whole day of driving around the Valley, it was so relaxing to go into the beautiful patio and indulge in made-from-scratch sangria. Our host and our server, who were a pleasure to talk to, guided us through the happy hour menu and we decided to have the ropa sliders, followed by the pernil asado sliders - both excellent.  We capped off the evening with the creamy decadence of their banana burrito, then headed out into the cool January night warmed by our pleasurable experience at this charming place.Consider this 3.5 stars. So here's the deal.  The service is great, the atmosphere is nice inside and out and the food is good.  The prices?  Not so great for good food.The sides were actually better than the main dish which is where they fall from 4 stars, especially considering that entrees are $20-25 bucks.I had a chicken breast that was panko breaded, smothered in tomatillo & cream sauce, topped with bacon, goat cheese, pico de gallo (fresh onion, tomato, cilantro, etc) and crispy tortilla strips.  Frankly I don't think I ever tasted the chicken.  Or the bacon.  Or the goat cheese.  Those are the things I was looking forward to.  That's what sold me on the dish.  But they were lost in the tomatillo, the cream, the salsa, the tortilla strips...this dish tried to do too much and suffered for it. This chicken was a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.The sides-cornbread casserole and spicy mashed potatoes-were very good.The bottom line?  Good but not great and if I'm paying $21 for a chicken breast I should be wowed.I went here tonight with the BF. We thought it was really meh, capital MEH. We had a reservation, but for some reason got sat inside. There were virtually no people eating inside and outside was lively and had a band playing... we couldn't even hear it inside... it was like silent. I would think they would at least open the doors, but nope. So that was a bad start. It took our waitress a long time to even come to our table, and when she came she asked if we wanted drinks and apps (which we didn't given the portion size) and we ordered dinner. The waitress seemed kind of short with us, and it may have been that she was busy or that she was mad we didn't order more items. Anyway, so I ordered the chicken and the bf ordered the pulled pork. Both were pretty lack luster. First off, the food came out really fast... like it was all premade fast... and it wasn't really hot, just kind of warm. Like other people have said, the chicken sounds really good but actually comes out kind of bland. The menu says the chicken is pounded but my chicken was like 2 inches thick, so that was weird. The breading wasn't really crispy and the whole thing just wasn't that good. The bf's pork was also kind of bland, even with the dipping sauce that came with it. The sides were alright (mashed potatoes, corn bread, carrots-these didn't have a ton of flavor). Despite the food being underwhelming, we did decide to order dessert. This is why I gave this restaurant 2 stars. The banana burrito was delicious! I wish I had just eaten this for dinner. So we get our check and I have a 30$ groupon. The bill comes back and only 20$ was taken off. We waited for about 6 minutes for the waitress to come back and she was good about it, she fixed it. It just seemed like a weird mistake. Anyway, for the two of us to get mains and split a dessert (no apps and no drinks) cost me a total of 45$ (would have been 60). This was way too much for what we got. I felt kind of ripped off. Maybe it was just my experience, but it was overall underwhelming.I found the service here attentive and timely, but have to share some sentiments with other unimpressed Yelpers about the mediocrity of the dining experience. I was introduced to Fuego Bistro by my roommate who had purchased a Groupon without knowing anything about the restaurant.It has a charming vibe, it's off the beaten path in a quirky courtyard bordered by a salon and dance studio. But the food was unremarkable... not by any means inedible, but rather forgettable. I felt the restaurant concept was a little confused given the choice of sides which don't necessarily pair well with every entree. I had the seared ahi tuna which was topped with a balsamic reduction and a mango/red pepper/avocado salsa. It was cooked properly but underseasoned except for the balsamic reduction which was nothing but sweet. Perhaps the blandness of this dish could be remedied with chili and lime and salt, but regardless, it did not deliver on taste. I chose to have the chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans as side dishes. The green beans were the best of the two, simple and tender, but the potatoes were lacking in flavor. Chipotle was only hinted at and the cheese was entirely understated. I know there has to be a way to elevate this food, but Fuego has fallen short. My roommate was in agreement that the meal was not a hit. Even the Key Lime Pie for dessert did not make the grade. I see potential in this restaurant, since the staff is friendly and helpful. But ultimately, it's about the food and I can't recommend it. The only saving grace was that we did not pay full price.I heard the summoning of my fellow yelpers confidence in past experiences of pure delight. Exotic pleasures upon my pallet were soon to come. If you simply can't choose for yourself on which meal to dine; their savory beef, flavorful chicken or succulent pork are sure to inspire. I experienced the "Cola and Pineapple Soy Braised Angus Short Rib Roast", "Signature Pernil Asado", and "Pernil BBQ Quesadilla"; all cooked to inspire moments of bliss. The Short Rib Roast; my favorite of the three, leaves no room for disappointed, and that's a personal guarantee ;)April and May are the perfect months to enjoy their outdoor patio, tucked inside the conspicuos hidden courtyard at the corner of 7th street and Palo Verde. As usual with many establishments I visit, snag a great deal by picking up a $25 off 2 entree's certificate from restaurant - com. With certificate in hand, you could walk out the door for close to $30 including tax and tip. During the hours of 3-6 pm (Tuesday - Saturday), try appetizer portions of most popular dishes for $5 - $7 each.Happy dining my friends!07/05/12 Had two Voice Daily Deals ($10 for $30) to use up before the 14th, so I asked my young cousin to meet me for dinner.  I'd never eaten here before, but I know from the reviews that it's popular for happy hour.  Indeed, the HH menu sounds fantastic, and so do the prices.  However, these certificates were only good for dinner, and so here we were.  But first, about the location-- it's tucked away a bit, away from the road, so don't blink, or you might miss it.  There are many parking spaces, so that's not an issue unless you're there for HH.  (If you are, then come early.)  FB has a small patio area that looks promising, if only it was decorated a little better.  I remember seeing two tables, but cousin remembers four.  I don't think there are misters to help keep cool.  Inside, it's even smaller.  I would say about six tables of two- and four-tops, and about five to six seats at the beautiful blue-tiled bar.  Sit here to maximize on atmosphere, have questions about the wines or cocktails, and if you want to be entertained by the staff.My cousin doesn't drink, so she had water, while I tried the guava mojito.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=pCA97HLAPYRN0bJTQUs1Pw#pCA97HLAPYRN0bJTQUs1Pw  It tasted like a regular mojito, but a bit sweeter.  It's alright- nothing fantastic.  Maybe I'll try a regular one, without the added flavorings, during HH one of these days.  After poring through the menu and asking our server Steve (who is also the bartender) about the dinner special (ribeye), I found I could only try ONE item, since everything else had allergens all over the entrees (shellfish, corn, guacamole, bell peppers, dijon reduction, etc.), instead of just added on top, and so I ordered the Natural Farm Chicken Breast, with tomatillo sauce, pico de gallo, goat cheese, and bacon. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=o8X2VwUplwqRZfvuQUunDA#o8X2VwUplwqRZfvuQUunDA  My cousin ordered the ribeye special, with mushrooms and a dijon reduction.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=fMtwu_Aw8ynU-gaOspzWWQ#fMtwu_Aw8ynU-gaOspzWWQ  Entrees come with your choice of two sides from the following choices: green chile cornbread casserole, jalapeno creamed corn, sauteed organic green beans, chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes, and maple-glazed carrots.  Cousin chose the cornbread and creamed corn, and I asked for the green beans and mashed potatoes.Cousin LOVED everything on her plate!  She especially liked the cornbread.  I enjoyed my dish, as well.  I liked how spicy it was, which may turn some people off, but I thought everything worked well together, especially the addition of the goat cheese, which helped to cut the spiciness.  I say add more cheese!  Loved the bacon bits, as well.  The green beans were sauteed to perfection-- nice green color and crisp, and not greasy.  We both thought the mashed potatoes were very tasty!  It's a good thing I liked the dish, since it's the only one I can order, unless they offer something new as a special.  We were too stuffed to order dessert, and it's a good thing, too, since out of the five choices (Ancho chocolate torte, Banana burrito, Kahlua creme brulee, Horchata bread pudding, and Homemade Key Lime pie), I could only have the brulee, and I wasn't feeling like creme brulee that evening.  Prices were too high for me to consider dining here for dinner without a discount.  Now, it's one thing if the menu is all-organic, but it isn't.  Service was attentive and friendly, so that's a plus.  Loved the intimate setting, but only if I can sit at the bar- we sat at a table.07/12/12Came back solo to use up the second certificate.  This time I sat at the lovely blue-tiled bar, even though the seat wasn't too comfortable, especially after leaving a massage session...  It was great fun speaking with bartender Steve and server Kevin.  "T-Bone" was nice, too -- he always made sure to open the door for guests.Had the chicken breast again http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=P_dIQjZufh2dJ6m_rjYmTA#P_dIQjZufh2dJ6m_rjYmTA, with a glass of sauvignon blanc, and the Kahlua creme brulee.  The chicken is as good as I remembered it, but this time there was even less goat cheese!  However, the creme brulee made up for it.  The best part of the dessert were the caramel and chocolate sauces that accompanied it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=tmq5bH42X_to8nG9fuT6yg#tmq5bH42X_to8nG9fuT6yg  Mmm!  I'd like to have these over ice cream, but not the Thrifty ice cream that accompanies many of the dessert plates offered here.  (Sorry, but I cannot have products that use corn syrup.  Besides, I'd rather have ice cream made from high-quality ingredients, and carrageenan and corn syrup, high fructose or otherwise, aren't.)Thanks for honoring the Voice Daily Deals, FB!  I'll be back with family and friends for happy hour, maybe.Had shrimp was really good and burnt but good Burnt like french food :) empanadas were good as well as the mussels. The waiter also gave us a sample potatoes which were different I hear their corn bread is good. I used a groupon so be on the look out for deals like that. Shout out to  Kevin and chewy thank you so much for jumping my dead car battery will be back :) Outdoor seating is nice as well since they have heaters ;) The place is small and intimateLast night my husband I went here for dinner.  We have eaten here before and we liked the food.  So, we thought we would try it again.   I'm kind of sad that our experience was not all that great this time. The waiter that we had was not very good.  Was not very helper and he never came around to see if we liked our food or if we needed anything.    Also the water guy was great, he came around and checked on us, to see if we liked our food or if we needed anything.  I wish we could have tipped him and not our waiter.  Now for the food, it was pretty good.  We ordered the Pineapple short rib roast and it came with mashed potatoes and creamy corn.   It is definitely an enough for two people.    Last and not least, the atmosphere of this restaurant is not all that great either.  It is in the middle of this little shopping center and you could hear the music for the dance studio that was right next to the patio seating. Happy yelping everyone!!!  If you decided to come here the food is not all that bad.  We in joyed it!!!Another Phoenix restaurant getting away w/ poor customer service, sub-par food, high prices and A HORRIBLE HOST.RESERVATIONS--I made reservations for my boyfriends sisters birthday last night (9/24/13). She had a Groupon and we've both been wanting to try out this restaurant for a while. I called to make reservations, no one answered during open hours. I called again, no answer. I went online and found a number to text your reservations. I got a response back very quickly "got it". When we arrived, we were seated at the table nearly in the entrance hallway. Probably the worst table. (People from the dance studio were sweeping the dust and dirt from the dance floor out their back door right next to our table--gross!) No one mentioned the birthday the whole dinner. Clearly a lack of communication w/ the reservation line.The worst part was when I mentioned our disappointment w/ our experience to the XL host at the front, he was not empathetic in the slightest way. I made a comment about having a Groupon and the host used it against me saying "well that's the type of service you get when you use a Groupon".--Oh REALLY? I couldn't believe he said that. Our service was actually good. It was him that was dreadful to communicate with..I mentioned something about the birthday, and he said "we don't do anything special for birthdays". I asked if they knew how to at least say happy birthday, and he snidely said "we'll happy birthday!" - I told him it wasn't my birthday, it was someone else's in our group.A group of people came up and he changed his attention to helping them so I walked away. He then yelled at me to come back that he wasn't done talking I me. I was done talking to him when he changed his focus to the other group--he clearly has no customer service skills.FOOD--the only thing they have right is taste. Total lack of attention to textures. Food comes out of the kitchen sloppy. Overcooked carrots, under-cooked cornbread. Cornbread was sitting in a puddle of juice from the carrots when I got my plate making it extra soggy. Empanadas were fantastic. Pulled pork was good, nothing special. Steak had lots of tendons/cartilage. Topping on the steak was great. Great classic margarita.I will NOT be going back. NOT worth the money.
Brio Tuscan Grille=Service wise: terrible! We made an 8:30 reservation as a back up plan but were able o arrive by 7:00. When we checked in with the host he proceed to give us a rundown of "how restaurant reservations work!" Begrudgingly he sat us 30 mins later. After being seated I asked the waitress what the name of the dessert was at the the table behind us was eating.  When she replied "mini desserts" I tried to clarify if that's what they are called on the menu. She brushed me off and said "I'll bring them out to you when it's time." She also hardly checked in with us and spilled water all over my friend's bread plate. HORRIBLE service!Ambiane: classy. High celings, classy decor, clean.Food: pretty good. The lemon chicken came with orzo and sweet potatoes that were great, and the side of grilled asparagus was delish.The service and they way they treat customers make this a 2 star place. I would not go back and support such a restaurant.For me, I think there's only one way to do Brio: sit at the bar.Why do I say this? Three words: Bar Plates Menu. It's only available during the week. Sorry weekenders. The BPM (why yes, I did decide to shorten it) has plates starting at $3.95, including a beef carpaccio that is delicious and a big size portion. You can't really go wrong with anything on this list for the price. I love the eggplant fries, too.If you don't feel like sitting at the bar, Brio does have a great patio. Like Desiree F said in an earlier review, I don't go here a whole lot. There are just a lot of great places in this area. I've always had good service here. The atmosphere is nice. My last visit I talked to the manager on duty for a long time. She was really sweet. Parking is annoying for me, but that's more because I don't come here a whole lot and all the decks look the same. Brio has a rewards program. You can get a card or download the app. After five visits, you can get $10 off your 6th.
Chuck E. Cheese's=Two stars for the guys hooking it up with coins! LOLConveniently close to home and what kid doesn't like going to Chuck E Cheese!?This location wreaks of gross smells upon walking in..Then soon as you walk in you can already tell how filthy the place is -- coin cups EVERYWHERE, pieces of broken tickets, foods, and random trash all over the floors.Another minus for this location is 60% of their machines were "not in service" or not working properly .. Always eating the coins or not producing the tickets.. Also, there has been the need to chase or wait a long time for an attendant to help you with anything, unacceptable on a slow night.There's not much to expect from a place like Chuck E Cheese but a little cleanliness and working machines would suffice.
Veranda=The Wife and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner in a relaxed environment and she suggested we dine at Verandah.  Located in the Four Seasons @ Mandalay Bay, this restaurant is a great getaway where you don't feel like you're on the Las Vegas Strip.After browsing the menu, we decided to order:SaladCaprese - Beefsteak Tomato, Campania Buffalo Mozzarella, Pestohttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=KdUUseaYZ5I3jPuDCwhiWAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=FacNkTHkUVooJuqELmZs-gAragosta - Lobster, Frisee, Seasonal Vegetables, Truffle Vinaigrettehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=3OCmQkKjb43sK0JY_bC66wEntreesPenne Alla Arrabiata - Smoked Mozzarella, Spicy Roma Tomato Saucehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=aAoVdVRd0bvfZj5BTwEelABranzino - Striped Sea Bass, Citrus Crust, Fennel Saucehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=ccVqY3Qp-e3rdsqZ1GflzwSide DishesBaby Potatoes with Black Trufflehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=YeSoCAR3VCJwQ04tndVcYwMushrooms with Marsalahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=aQOaL6HcE3oGygKjOvxmywFor DessertWarm Italian Donuts, Lemon Curd, Chocolate GanacheI had the Caprese Salad and the Penne Alla Arrabiata.  Both were amazing!  The Penne Alla Arrabiata was made al dente, which is how I love my Pasta and the Arrabiata Sauce had a nice kick to it....just right.  The Caprese Salad was not overdone with Oil, unlike some restaurants.The Wife enjoyed her Lobster Salad and Striped Bass.  She passed on Dessert, but I couldn't resist the Warm Italian Doughnuts, so I went for it.....they were so good, I forgot to take a picture of them and they were gone by the time I remembered....:)The service was impeccable.  The servers were friendly and attentive.  They were also very knowledgable about the menu and had great ideas for dinner.Overall, it was an another awesome experience here.Return Factor - 100%As far as the old system of dining goes, Verandah would probably be considered a "5-star" restaurant. Fancy setting, high prices, impeccable service, etc. However in the new food era, it's not just all about being hoity-toity. To get high stars in my book you need to have good food, and provide some form of value proposition. Based on my breakfast at verandah, I'd have to say that A-OK is proper. From entry to exit here, the service is beyond impeccable. They ask your name at the desk and you're subsequently greeted by name by every server that approaches you. Coffee is kept full, and it's white-glove the whole way. The setting is very pleasant - outdoors next to the Mandalay pool system - very elegant. The food itself, however, leaves a bit to be desired. It's okay, but for the price it could be a lot better. I sampled a plate of huevos rancheros that cost about as much as a dinner entree would cost at a decent restaurant. $5 for drip coffee is beyond the pale. Overall it was up in the mid-$20's for a simple entree+coffee breakfast. I guess I'm not someone who is willing to pay all that extra for exclusivity. Coming from Portland I want the food to be exemplary at that price - especially for breakfast, which is notoriously easy to prepare. If you want a four-seasons experience, this is your place. If your main goal is good food, you may be able to do better.Located inside of the Four Seasons hotel, Verandah is an elegant hide-away from the noisy and crowded Mandalay Bay.  I came here with a few business friends for lunch...took the recommendation from the waiter and had the Seafood Insalate.  Lobster, crab, jumble shrimp, sliced boiled egg, tomatoes, greens.  Healthy, refreshing, Abundant.  I loved it except the price --$26.   Food in Vegas is insanely expensive these days.  For that price we get two entries in LA.  Wait staff is professional and friendly.Interior is stylish and beautiful.I will probably come back to try their signature items.While I love FS Spas, I am not a huge fan of the FS restaurants, ranging from Allium in Chicago, Blue Bar in Hong Kong, to Veranda in Vegas. I feel like a little kid getting all excited and am disappointed every time I dine at a FS restaurant. I decided never come back to Veranda, but why?1) The service was not on par with that of other FS restaurants - While the food at Allium and Blue Bar are mediocre, the waiters are friendly and helpful. On the other hand, the waiter at Veranda confused the orders of my friend and mine. She also forgot our requests for water. 2) The food was mediocre - Although I appreciated the parfait being less sweet, I was not happy that the ratio of the non-fat Greek yogurt and the granola was one to four. I ended up eating dry nuts most of the time. The orange juice that both of us had was not fresh and was slightly bitter. The juice was definitely two levels below that in MOzen at Mandarin Oriental. Although I enjoyed the view of the pool and the palm trees, I was disappointed by the overpriced mediocre food of Verandah. I would rather pay slightly more for the food and drinks at MOzen.Items selected:Lavazza Italian CoffeeRustic Cut Corned Beef and Pastrami Hash, Florentine Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise, ChilaquilesCinnamon Roll, Pain au Chocolate, Blueberry Cream Cheese Coffee Cake, Raspberry Coffee Cake, Bear Claw, Raspberry Tart, Blueberry Muffin, Cinnamon Oatmeal Bran MuffinTiramisu Croissant French Toast - Banana-Apple Compote, Citrus Mascarpone CreamChicken & Waffles - Sweet Basil Fried Chicken, Savory Bacon and Chive Waffles9-Grain Bread with Fresh Ground Peanut Butter and Strawberry Jam, Fresh Fruits, Apricots and Figs, Artisan Cheeses, Farro and Greek Yogurt Parfait with Almonds and Cranberry Compote, Chilled Red Quinoa Cereal - Whipped Almond Milk And Ricotta, Sliced AlmondsPumpkin Orange Ricotta Pancakes with Pure Maple Syrup, Mascarpone Cheese Blintz with Roasted Apple Glaze, Plain and Red Currant Scones with Lemon Curd, Cinnamon Panetonne French Toast with Berry CompoteBreakfast Potatoes with Onion Confit and Crispy Pancetta, Peppered Bacon, Candied Bacon, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Chicken and Apple Sausage, Pork Sausage Links, Breakfast PizzaMaple Pecan Sticky Bun, Fresh Made Donuts, Bread Pudding with Vanilla AnglaiseInvited to enjoy Veranda's weekend brunch by PR Director Erica Johnson-McElroy after requesting clarification of a confusing online menu via E-mail, it was with a friend that I sat down inside the newly renovated space at Four Seasons and with a collection of dishes served amidst refined environs paired to service that warrants Michelin stars the experience that followed was a nearly flawless celebration of my one year anniversary of dining as a resident of Las Vegas.Certainly more limited in selection than Bacchanal or other Strip-side all-you-can-eats the Veranda Brunch Buffet is offered on weekends only and with menu selections offered to compliment the five stations it was only the flavorless Florentine Benedict that proved less than delicious while at least a half-dozen items trumped most versions elsewhere, buffet or a la carte.  Taking an approach to volley savories and sweets course-for-course it was after a brief tour by the restaurant's GM that dining commenced and with the newly conceptualized hash a truly stunning blend of textures and flavors a plate of pastry soon followed, the moist bran muffin sweetened by honey and creamy blueberry coffee cake standing out ahead of the pack.  At this point opting for two menu-items both the crisply breaded brined bird as well as its accompanying mini-waffles were undoubtedly amongst the best in town but stealing the show was, predictably, the Tiramisu French Toast - a composition of buttered croissants soaked in custard with a golden sear beneath fresh fruit compote and light, tangy cheese.  Slightly underwhelmed by charcuterie selections while the fresh ground peanut butter and a Greek Yogurt Parfait impressed on buffet-plate three the fourth plate was a sinfully sweet quintet with fluffy seasonal pancakes and soft, buttered scones both benefitted by exemplary toppings while the blintzes bested those at Carnegie Deli with lovely autumnal apples and a far less impactful hit to the wallet.  Impressed moreso than usual by breakfast meats, particularly the candied bacon found on the optional  Bloody Mary Bar, it was expectedly in sweets that the meal called it a wrap and while drinking what might as well have been my twentieth cup of coffee the fresh-made mini donuts were indeed a treat, but not nearly as wowing as the exceptional bread pudding - a traditional preparation with a chocolate surprise at its base that was all the bettered by rich Anglaise, both items something I'd held off on until the very end because I knew that to indulge earlier would compromise my ability to pay due diligence to the rest.Having not yet experienced the Sterling Brunch at Bally's, the unlimited champagne feast carrying a tab more than double the price, Veranda is undoubtedly amongst the city's most refined brunch experiences while service never once leaves the diner for want.  Well culled in selection, with items from the menu offered on request, the $40 tab with additional costs for bottomless drinks is a pricey but well justified tally and with strong focus on seasonal ingredients a return visit will undoubtedly take place in the near future - a visit for dinner also on the agenda in order to experience what some have called some of the city's most underrated Italian cuisine.Note:  A friend was invited by the Director of Public Relations to come to brunch and bring a guest.  We were comped for our brunch by the General Manager of the restaurant.That being said, this has to be one of the best brunch options I have had in Las Vegas.  After being given a tour and an explanation of some of thew operations by the GM, we set out.  I got two of their hot mini pans to start.  I found the corned beef and pastrami hash to be outstanding.  Instead of the common mixture of meat and potatoes, this was a totally different take with thin potato sticks being interspersed with the meat.  It was a winner of a dish.  The chilaquiles, something they haven't offered before, was also very good and it had some nice spice to give the dish some character. My second plate consisted of one pumpkin orange ricotta pancake, some peppered bacon, Cinnamon Panetonne French toast, a mascarpone cheese blintz, and a red currant scone with some lemon curd.  The scone and the blintz were winners in this round but there was nothing here that wasn't very good.Next, I got a plate with some of the meats and cheese, a piece of breakfast pizza,  seasonal scrambled eggs. and one chicken and apple sausage.  The meat was the disappointment of the brunch.  There was a small selection and it was difficult the way the meat was folded to get a piece without destroying the way it was placed on the dish.  The cheese was better but the one was so flavorless we couldn't tell what it was.  At this time, I tasted some tiramisu French toast and some chicken from two items my friend ordered from the menu.  The French toast was amazing.  The chicken was moist and the coating was crispy and falling off the meat.No, I wasn't done yet.  I got a Farro and Greek yogurt parfait with almond and cranberry compote and the citrus panna cotta.  The farro was my favorite of these two.Time for some more sweetness in my morning and I got some bread pudding with a small amount of the vanilla Anglaise.  It was outstanding.  I didn't give away the surprise to my friend who learned later when you got to the bottom, there was some chocolate that just added to the whole dish.Finally, we got four mini doughnuts and split the flavors so we each had one each of the two flavors.  They were good.I have to rank this brunch with the best buffets/brunches in town.  Service was exceptional.  Each time we went to the food area, our napkins were folded and placed on the placemat.  Water was constantly being refilled and coffee was always replenished.I was able to get up and walk away from brunch--a feat I wasn't sure I could accomplish and it would turn out to be my only meal of the day!  The room has been completely remodeled and despite the fact that it was almost full when we left, it was a very quiet place--an atmosphere conducive to conversation and enjoying one's food.  A well deserved 5 stars.Review for Sunday Brunch. Had long been on my brunch list, was saving it for a nice time of year so we could sit outside. Upon walking in I immediately noticed a donut station. What! I've been on a donut kick lately and I'm usually not a fan. When we sat, our server went over the menu and told us we had the option of buffet or a la carte. I couldn't decide at first, there was a lemon ricotta pancake that had caught my eye on the a la carte menu, but the donut station sealed the deal for me.I was impressed with the different buffet station, lots of different parfaits and yogurts, an omelet station, and they had all small plates so you could sample a little bit of everything. They also had a pastry station with a spot to make your own homemade peanut butter. Everything we had was really good. I would bump this up to 5 stars if they offered a bottomless mimosa on the menu. They had a bloody mary bar, but not all of are fans. This brunch buffet was way better than the Country Club at the Wynn, almost half the price. I totally recommend.
Half Moon Sports Grill=Does the New Times have a better opinion than me?  That was the question I tried to answer when I went here to try out the wings.  The New Times Best of Phoenix declared this restaurant as having the best wings, so I had to check it out.*Side note* I used to regularly hang out at the Half Moon on Bell when I lived up in that big box/corporate chain infused section of town.  We went almost every weekend to partake in their real long island iced teas for $2.50 and enjoyed it despite it being a sports bar (we are not sports fans).  The food was pretty good and the booze even better.Back to the review - It's a nice sports bar that manages to accomodate a plethora of sports fans with an insane number of TVs.  The hostess even asks which team you are trying to watch so that she can seat you accordingly.  Because we were there for the food, and not the sports, we were seated immediately and without hassle.  Luckily, we happened to sit near the TVs playing the Bills, so we payed a little bit of attention.You can order the wings by poundage - 1/2, 1, or 2 - not by number of wings, which was a little confusing for us.  We're used to ordering a dozen per person if it's the meal, half for an appetizer.  Because neither of us were overly hungry ,we ordered 1 pound medium with a side of hot.  What we got was 9 wings without sauce and a side of "hot sauce" for $9. That's right, $1 per wing.  I already felt hosed, but I was willing to forgive the price for the allegedly best wings in Phoenix.No sauce on the wings.  They were cooked crispy as we asked them to be, and they were somewhat meaty.  The side of "hot sauce" was a small container of gelatinous chili sauce, like the stuff they give to you at Asian restaurants. No flavor, just hot.Luckily, the Long Island Iced Tea was just as tasty as I remember, otherwise I would have left very unhappy.  I wouldn't make a point of going here for wings.  They aren't even as adequate as the "good" wings I've found in Phoenix.  But for all of you non-purists, they do have BBQ, Thai Peanut and other flavors.Oh yeah, I forgot about the statement on the menu that claims that separate checks "MASSIVELY" slows down the service. Really? Seriously?  This isn't a problem at many restaurants at which I have attended with a large group.  This isn't really conducive to a sports bar, as far as I'm concerned.  Wouldn't it be wonderful to meet a bunch of friends to watch your favorite team and not have to worry about separate checks "MASSIVELY" slowing down your service?  Don't try it here, they warn you against it before you even order food.This place confuses me.  You walk in, and think that this is a pretty decent sports bar.  Then you get up to go the bathroom, and see all the hidden rooms and lounge areas.  I don't understand it, is it for the people who get bucket of beer service?  Why do you need to section it off?  Is it a club later at night?Food was pricier than it should have been for a half-assed sports bar.  And there was no creativity in the menu, which there should be for the prices!  This place gets a pass.How I write Yelp reviews, by Andrew K. Fromaz. (this IS my real name. my real nom de plume)I start out by identifying an establishment I vaguely want to try, and finding an occasion or reason to go there.  In this case, a fellow Yelper Christina P set up a special Happy Hour event on a Friday at Half Moon Sports Grill on Highland.  I'd been to Half Moon before, and it was not exactly on my list of places to hurry back to and try again, for reasons which will gradually become evident...I get to the restaurant, and go in, briefly (if at all) taking note of the decor, the attitude of the staff I encounter along the way, the crowd, the music playing, occasionally the lighting... anything that jars or that i happen to notice that i like.  This is how I (and anyone else fortunate enough to have full use of their five senses) determine the "vibe" of a place.  Half Moon seems like a typical upper-tier sports bar, pleasant hostess, apparently clean, lots of big TVs, small booths...  Nothing not to like, honestly.  The "vibe" is that this is a pretty nice place.  I sit down and look over the menu, searching for anything that particularly catches my interest.  I'm not a picky eater, so usually I have a hard time narrowing it down to one thing.  The first time I was here, I was pretty hungry, so the blue cheese burger caught my eye.  On a more recent visit, appetizers were on Happy Hour so I tried a few of those.  Here's the bottom line.  None of it was very good.  Like, I would actively avoid eating any of the food again.  The pretzel, which was recommended, was dry inside and oily outside - like it had been coated with some form of fake butter.  The burger was only ok.  The boneless wings were the only thing that I would order again (I think we got medium?)Anyway, over the course of the visit I put together all of these impressions and write a review, usually deciding whether or not I'll return.  Sorry, Half Moon, I want to love you, but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.We came to Half Moon Sports Grill to watch the UFC Fight. It's a nice big place, yet we had to get there early since it filled up quick. The place is fun, the girls wear short skirts and knee socks. They have a full list of local beers in bottles and on draft. They boast a monthly special, which July's is a burger for 1/2 price if you buy a drink. That's almost $4.50 for a giant burger with fries. Unfortunately I was full from lunch and did some light snacking with my beer drinking. First up, I wanted the Watermelon Wheat - Perfect for any hot Arizona day (which is most of them) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#MrdXI7O_NSKVvqgGTcIYOAThen, the Dirty Guera Blonde Ale, because I love blonde ales and cute names. It was great and encouraged us to visit Nimbus the next day! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#5nzmTTMOmGj_sVIxkTM51QIn between, we ordered a couple appetizers, a gigantic pretzel that was served with both queso and mustard. I love to dipp! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#lMQuuVAuKQAL-RKfEYkPWg And my guy ordered the Prime Rib Sliders (4) served with carmalized onions, french dip sauce and horseradish. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#seP7cR-l6f3xjnJtzFQIxA That was a meal in itself, really. For Dessert, I ordered the White Chocolate Ale which was by far the most dessert tasting beers I have ever tried. It was so much like a sweet white chcolate, you really need to savor every sip. If you see this anywhere, order it and thank me later. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#1jzaMBgdEa9YyVasa8rukQAfter all that, I needed a couple sugar free Red Bulls to snap myself back in action. We had a fight to watch and I was not going to be the first to TAP OUT.This review is a 2.5 rounded up to a 3 now.I've been to this location a hand full of times.  This review is heavily weighted on my most recent experience.  I came here last Friday for a Yelper UYE to watch the Kitchen Nightmares Finale.   I hate to complain because I wasn't the organizer of the event, but a reservation was made for a group of folks to come out and watch the season finale of a TV show.  One would think that the room that was reserved would have a door, that could be closed, to quiet the noise of the restaurant so that the group could do what it came to do to, watch AND LISTEN to the TV program.  Unfortunately, our group could barely here the television because the "room" (actually a 3-sided space) we were in was separated from the rest of the restaurant by a partition that didn't close off the entire walkway into the cubby-hole-like space.  I don't think any of the fellow Yelpers at that table were happy with the space.  I ordered the calamari and it was a downer for me, a never repeat again'er.  I was so hungry after not eating all day that  I ate that calamari and the entire time, I wondered why did I order THAT dish! the only upside and bright spot was my cocktail.  I think it was called a dirty blue martini.  That  thing was delicious.Would I go back here, only if someone else is organizing something at this location and I had no say or influence in moving the venue.UPDATE: Their management told me that in the future they will no longer reserve that space for people interested in watching and hearing a TV program.  It might be ok for a sports show though, but not for what we were there for.  They have a different space that is quieter and more appropriate for watching a TV program.  That room was booked before the UYE was booked.  Hats of to their management for reaching out to me.If you like sports and Chicago grub then this is your place, period. Upon walking in, I immediately noticed the plentiful flat screens everywhere I turned. I must have counted 40 flat screen TVs. There are several sections of Half Moon Sports Grill, including a back room with a stage that would make for a good private event. I truly is the perfect location for a sports game. Besides the massive amounts of TVs and plenty of seating, Half Moon Sports Grill also has good food! Owned by Chicago natives, this is your one-stop-shop for Windy City eats. I've enjoyed their pizza, Italian Beefs and sausages, all of which are flavorful and filling. It's perfect food to enjoy while watching a sporting event and enjoying a beer or three. They have a spacious bar and sit-down seating, so you could either come with your family or come with friends.
The Fat Greek=I just love Greek food and the Fat Greek has my favorite item - the Gryo Plate.  Theirs come with a good amount of meat and we chose rice and salad.  Unlike another spot we have been too Fat Greek gives you a hearty amount of rice and salad each packed in their own container.      We also got sides of Gyro meat and the ever popular Athena Fries.  The fries were a delight and were devoured quickly.  The combination of spices and the two cheeses was so good.  The rice was very tasty and the salad was really good.  Fresh Romaine lettuce tomatoes, cucumbers and lots of feta.     I have eaten in and now taken out.  I think I prefer take out.  The dining room is basic and although clean has a tired look about it.  The lady who has taken our order isn't very friendly and lacks in her customer service skills.  I didn't take it personally and think it is just her demeanor.     So far Fat Greek is the best Greek place for Gyro's that i have found in Vegas.  In comparison to Sharma Plus you get near twice as much food for the same cost.  One thing that also stands out is the Tzatziki sauce is very good and plentiful.  A great price for a plentiful Gryo Plate.  I will definitely be back for my next Gyro fix!
OHYA Sushi Korean Kitchen & Bar=Oh, how I missed the tofu soup and bulgogi combo in this cold weather.  The best combo deal you will find in a Korean Restaurant.  They have excellent dishes that will warm your body and your tummy.   My other favorites are bibmbap in the hot stone pot,  Korean BBQ, Chap Chae,  Sul Lung Tang, Mandoo Gook, Katsu plate (huge), and seafood pancake ( it should be an entree instead of an appetizer).  They offer excellent lunch specials for less than $6.00.This place was great!! As soon as you step in through the door you get indulged by all the wonderful BBQ smells and you also hear how others' in their table are cooking up their own meats and veggies!! What a great little spot it is!! I highly recommend it to all those BBQ lovers and Panda express fans!! This is much better and healthier too!! It was a good full that we got after consuming all our food and not a fatty full!!This restaurant is somewhat hidden in a strip mall across the street from ASU West. In the daytime it is hard to tell if it is open or closed, because the heavy tinting of the glass in front makes it hard to see what's inside. Inside, it is a cozy dining place with quaint chairs with backrests of polished diagonal sections of tree trunks. The service is friendly, the food items priced par for the course for Korean food (moderate, not inexpensive), and the food quality is good. I really enjoy their kalbi and bulgogi, especially when made into ssam (lettuce wraps). The banchan is adequate and flavorful, though the kimchi is quite mild - perhaps the heat is toned down for American tastes. And their lunch specials are a good and relatively inexpensive way to get  fast food, Korean style.This restaurant continues to be my go to spot for Korean BBQ since my review a couple of years ago. Every time we go, the restaurant is steadily full with a wide variety of patrons. You can choose to cook at the table or have them cook for you. Usually we opt to cook at the table but a few nights ago, we decided to have them cook it for us. Same price. Usually, we opt for the $30 combo that has the daegi bulgogi, dalk gui, and the Kalbi. If I said it right, it is the spicy pork, chicken, and short ribs. That is more than plenty for the 3 of us...leftovers are the best! This last time, we each ordered a spicy pork plate at $13 each (my favorite and I don't really eat spicy food). I felt like we looked like gluttons when the food came out. Very good portions. I also love the panckak (sp?) they bring out with various items to enjoy with your meal. My 5 year old demolished the white radishes and I had to fight her over the bean sprouts. So good. As always the service is friendly and attentive. I have been to other Korean BBQs where if you aren't in the same culture, you aren't treated the same. Not so with CGJ. I always enjoy my meal here. Inexpensive and delicious food.Love this place. We've dined in several times for lunch/dinner and have also ordered takeout many, many times. Great selection of hot dishes (our go to is always the daeji bulgogi) appetizers and a wide variety of sushi offerings. Our faves include the sonoran roll, mango pop and the gangster. They have a decent sake (hot and cold) and beer selection. They also have happy hour specials that run all day during the week.If you dine in during lunch, take advantage of their amazing lunch specials. Two people can easily share a combo (choice of meat with sides and a 6 piece roll) and walk away happy. Also, the majority of tables have a grill in the center so you have the option of grilling your own meat if you'd like. Always fun for a date night or with a group of friends! They have a full bar (about 10 stools) and a sushi bar (both with televisions) and can accommodate large parties. Staff has always been friendly and helpful in explaining the menu (much of which is in korean).Best thing about this place is they are open late. Real late. 1 am M-Th 2am Fri and Sat and 11 pm on Sunday. Need a late night fix? This is the spot. And again, get the daeji bulgogi. You will not be disappointed.
Bayside Buffet at Mandalay Bay=When someone says brunch, I'm expecting a combination of breakfast and lunch items.  No such luck here.  I found no breakfast items awaiting me.  The only redeeming factor...prime rib.  You don't have to wait til 4pm when the dinner crowd start to wander in.  You can have it early.  And you can have it the way you want it...rare, medium, thick, thin, etc.  Pair this with the spicy fresh horseradish and you've got a clear brunch winner.  Or have it with a side of bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and a grilled lamb steak...I did, along with a plate of peeled shrimp.Now jumping back to Las Vegas!  City of Sin!  (FOOD! FOOD! FOOD!)  Sometimes I do feel very guilty for eating all that food while I'm in town.... hmmmm....ok.. I'm over my guilt!  What's next?The next up is the Bayside Buffet in Mandalay bay!I'm sort of surprised by some of the so so reviews for this place because every time I've been here whether it's just 2 people or a party of 6+, we've always had great meals.  Although I can understand that buffets starts to look all the same after a while but still, you can taste if the food is done right or not and that should be the main focus of the reviews.  So here is what we've had... (it's a party of 5 this time around for lunch!)Salad:  Little disappointed this time around because they had the bomb spinach salad... it's now nowhere to be found but just make your own salad.  Oh well, that shouldn't be my main focus anyway.Pizza:  Decided to try the BBQ chicken.  Very comparable to CPK's BBQ except it doesn't have all the onions and other little veggie groups like CPK, but still it was tasty.  Hot meat section:  Unlike other buffets where eat stations are named differently, I don't recall there was a name to each of the areas but just simply a wrapped around line of food, so I'll call it the "hot meat section!"  Osso Buco was extremely tender and the flank steak was actually moist and soft!  No dry at all!  Then they had this thick piece of beef (can't recall what it was now) but it literally was so soft that by using you fork you can make it flake off from the entire piece of meat!  Everyone in the group was very much raving about this.  (I think it was part of the shank which is why it's so juicy and soft!)  Then the typical prime rib, ham, etc...Custom pasta station:  A chef is behind 4 stoves with all the toppings you would want on your pasta served with I believe 3 different sauces (Alfredo, Marinara, and olive oil)  Very fresh and delicious looking, but I passed on the carbs to move to bigger and better things... Hot Seafood Section:  Some typical Salmon, fried shrimp, steam halibut, etc.  Everything was decent and tasty, but nothing to get too crazy about except for the battered shrimp.  It was fried to perfection and each of them are XXL sized shrimp!  So you really get to have the shrimp instead of having the breading just like many other places.Ethnic food section:  For some reason wasn't too into this today.... so passed on the Chinese/Mexican/Japanese fare with the exception of having couple pieces of sushi (California roll actually tasted good with fresh rice because some of the sushi in Vegas had Costco-like rice which is really nasty.. so it's refreshing to see at least this buffet is having good rice even though it's not a sushi restaurant)Dessert section:  My only gripe about this dessert is that it didn't offer much of a ice cream selection.  However, they did have this trio of sugar-free purees (tiramisu, Hazelnut, Pastachio)  All were absolutely wonderful tasting with right amount of creaminess and right amount of aroma infused into them.... since they were small so I had like 6 of them!  LOL!  But dessert could be little better than others on the strip for a hotel such as Mandalay bay hosting this buffet.Final Verdict:  Everyone still enjoyed this buffet and again I had no complaints.  I did however had less than usual because I took many small samples of it all and wasn't too hungry at that moment..  (I'm sure you all probably thinks I'm crazy now!  LOL!  Like.. what's up with this guy?  Does he have an endless stomach talkin' about that's not much food?  LOL!)  But Bayside Buffet is still one of the more enjoyable buffets on the strip if you ask me!  (Also, while you are at the casino, make sure you take a nice deep breath of coconut air!  Just stay away from the more smoky part of the casino.  It's actually pretty refreshing!)WATCH YOUR RECEIPT!!!Be wary about the receipt you leave at the table before getting your food as someone might take it and use it for themselves!This just happened to us this morning. 10AM 12-24-11 Table at the end of buffet line.After being seated, my wife and I went to get food and left our server copy receipt on the table. When we returned, we found another couple sitting at our table. I was polite and told them we were sitting there and we had spread the tablecloth and silverware out to make it look occupied. I had assumed the waiter took the receipt for our drinks and assumed a couple was sat at our table in error.Since I couldn't find the waiter, I had to find another waitress that someone was sitting in our seat and was told by said waitress that she needed to see my receipt. I told them I thought the waiter took it, was trying to find him, and that some couple was seated our table.While complaining to that waitress, my wife approaches our original table and is wondering why some other couple is sitting at our table. While trying to call me, she sees the lady at the table ripping up our receipt. My wife grabs it from her and the lady glares at her. I went back to try and take a picture of the couple, but they had already been asked to leave. Luckily, we got our receipt with our name and room number back. My wife and I assume that this is probably not the first time this couple has done this and that there are probably more that know about this and do it also. Next time we figured one of us would have to stay at the table, while the other got food. We thought the food was ok, but the ambiance was sucked. Food was definitely not worth having to quarrel and hassle over. In Vegas, it's just one of those hard luck stories. It's just that who woulda thought it would be at the buffet and not on the casino floor?Mehhhhhhhh is all I have to say about this place.I'm here on a Saturday brunch time and the place is kinda full but the food? I can say 95% of the food was bad. And the other 5% was DECENT. My goodness. I even went for foods that I normally don't eat in hopes that they would taste a little BETTER than the rest. Nope. Bad decision.I tried to give them another chance and went for the dessert section. I am a MAJOR dessert person, and there is no way that you can mess up COOKIES. yup. They did. Never stepping foot into here again. Even if it was a comped meal.I hate the word buffet and I really hate the concept of a buffet but sometime I get roped into attending one of the feeding frenzies, but it's never my first choice. I will admit this isn't you're typical buffet but there's still the possibility that you will over eat if you don't show a little restraint. So what exactly does $32.95 get you, for one it gives you a choice to choose wisely or just be plain stupid. I usually like to do a tour before making my selections, the first thing I noticed was that all the serving dishes are small this is an added measure taken to protect the interest of The Bayside Buffet's owners but also protects you from yourself. I always go for the carving stations and this buffet not only had plenty of those options but the quality was pretty good as well. My first plate held my prime rib, sliced turkey and a fried chicken breast and to be honest I loved every bite and could have stopped there but the trays of food were calling my name even though I chose to sit at a table as far away from the mounts of food as possible. My second plate was for the sushi and a few steamed dumplings and a few pieces of cheese. The most satisfying part of attending this buffet was the fact that I was able to avoid the cakes, pies, and cookies and even walked away from the donuts.FOOD: A-ok food. Ox tail was good. Chicken noodle soup had no chicken and no noodles! Broth was good I admit but only had celery and carrots. Mashed potatoes tasted weird I would pass on that. Corn on Cobb tasted very watery overcooked. DESSERTS: Desserts we're ok they have some sugar free options and soft serve frozen yogurt machine.PAYMENT: Best part was when you walk in you can pay with credit card at a self serve kiosk! What a great idea to help make the line move faster. We were there it had no line so I'm sure the kiosks helped with that. You can choose to add tip when you pay or choose to leave tip at the table. STAFF: Staff come by and clear away your plates in a timely manner so your table stays clean for the most part.
Pekara Bakery and Bistro=Pekara's got a hippie sort of charm that I'm down for, and some DELICIOUS sandwiches.  Yes, the caps are necessary.  The best part?  They serve coffee in a series of mismatched store-owned mugs.  That makes me very happy, and it's far less wasteful than say a Starbucks which would just make a thousand disposable goods.I did get elbowed aside by a pushy older Caucasian gentleman who then glared at me for half of my coffee experience, but his class privilege is not the fault of Pekara (or is it....!?), so no stars lost there.I like you Pekara, and I see you and I having a delicious sandwichy future.Pekara has recently become my go-to spot if I want to spend a few hours sitting downtown. The coffee is good, the service is friendly, and there's a great selection of food whether you are looking for a snack, a meal, or something sweet.The crepes and the omelets here are outstanding! Especially the vegetarian options. And all the pastries and baked-good I've had are delicious.There are a few tables out front and a patio in the back if you want to sit outside. In the back, they have a couch and an armchair and a taller table that works well for small groups.The only weird thing is that they don't bring cutlery out when you order the food so unless you think ahead, you have to walk back over to the counter. Not a big deal, but it would be a nice thing for them to do.
Cafe Wasabi=Around the corner and down the road from my new place is the bestest sushi place!! Very mom and pop... if mom and pop were into lime green and sleek contemporary decor. Very clean and kinda ackwardly set up, Cafe Wasabi reminds me of Subway... except this is really fresh! I've had the Hawaiian Roll and the Rainbow Roll - both were really good as was the Orange shrimp roll. The nigiri is good - but then again, nigiri is always good. :) Along the counter's sneeze guard are pictures and descriptions of the various rolls available. Some look too exotic to try and others are regular standbys. I can see first timers getting squeemish when they see them on display. One cool touch is the maaaany empty sake bottles that are decorated by the lucky souls that drank them. I have yet to try one myself - but the bottles on the shelves and counter sure look cute.The sushi is good, I never had any stomach problems after eating there and I always leave there happy I came and promising myself that next time I'll try the green tea ice cream... i would - but I'm always too full!!
Sensi=3.5 starsI thought I'd treat my man to Sensi because we're both represented on the menu. They've got a little bit of Italian, a little bit of Asian, and a little bit of American. Oh, and they've got seafood too, which we both love.While everything on the menu sounded amazing, we decided to go for the pan roasted halibut and Sensi's braised beef short ribs. Presentation was beautiful, but I wasn't completely blown away. For $$$$, I was expecting to have the best foodgasm ever, but I didn't even have one. Service was top notch, and everything else about this place was exquisite. And what a gorgeous place! The open kitchen is the center of attention here. We were seated near the lobster tank, but thankfully, I didn't see or hear any lobsters being cooked. If I come back again, I'll give their prix-fixe menu a try. Seems that would be the best way to go here.This pertains to the Restaurant Week 2010 menu.The Skinny: great fusion asian cuisine and lovin' the bread service (4) service: efficient, prompt and friendly - I want to take the naan guy home!(4.5) value: for 50.10, it's not bad for a fine dining experience but the ethnic food is likely cheaper somewhere else(3).We've been wanting to try Sensi ever since we had their tasting at Taste of the Nation. My hubby was hesitant - he's not that into East Indian, Vietnamese and Thai flavours (except Pad see-uw... excuse the spelling).We love the dining room here. The view of the kitchens accompanied by flowing water everywhere, the design is truly lovely.Anyway, we ordered fried shrimp with citrus, market mixed green salad, butter chicken, skirtsteak with green papaya salad.But first, let's start out with bread service. Bread service consists of papadums and handmade naan out of a two real clay ovens installed in the kitchens. Although it didn't have quite the same elasticity and crispiness of the best naan I've ever had, it was still pretty darn good. Adding the tomato chutney, I just wanted to take the lovely East Indian naan-making gentleman home with me. (He's really nice - when we made hand signals of how much we like his naan - he sent out another fresh basket for us!)The fried shrimp was satisfyingly crisp and well seasoned. The market salad was equally pleasurable with the hint of bitterness of the lettuces and acidity from the citrus. Very well balanced dishes.I thoroughly enjoyed the grilled marinated skirtsteak (right amount of char) and nicely spiced accompanying green papaya salad. The green papaya was shaved so delicately, it looked like glass noodles. Wonderful flavour and textures. The butter chicken was nice along with the rice but it wasn't extraordinary.Dessert was okay but not exceptional. The chocolate temptation dessert was overly sweet while the caramel ice cream had a very heavy burnt sugar flavouring to it. The tapioca pudding was rather flavourless when paired with that wonderful mango lassi and coconut ice cream.Value wise, you can likely find each individual components for less else where (I'm sure you can get a decent butter chicken or green papaya salad for less than $50/person). However the service is wonderful and the ambience is amazing.I would say normally, this place would deserve a 3.5 star. However in light of the exceptional bread service, I'm bumping it up to a 4 star review.The Better Half and I decided to give this joint a try.  We'd heard about it and saw the favorable reviews on Yelp.  Unfortunately, the experience didn't match our expectations.  Here's why:- The waiter took forever to take our drink order....we seriously could have drank a glass of Wine in the amount of time it took him to come by.  One thing I hate is having to wait for my Wine!- He screwed up our order and forgot my side order of Bacon Fried Rice.  I was looking forward to trying it because it sounded sooo good.  But when it didn't come out with the entrees, I didn't want to have to eat it by itself.- The serving of the Salad was mistimed and the entrees came out before we were finished with our Salad and Appetizers.....we felt rushed.We ordered:SONOMA FOIE GRASCHERRY PRESERVE, $25http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bK_eTLw_uEuEyMzdZlKN6A?select=2VpoayF-8SBISGf7cIwHpwPECORINO GNOCCHISACRAMENTO DELTA ASPARAGUS.

I enjoyed the Gnocchi very much and the Filet was juicy and cooked just right.  I tried a bit of TBH's Pad Thai, and it was pretty good.Overall, the food was great, but the service sucked.  We watched other tables and noticed slow service as well with the other servers.  This place has a long way to go.Return Factor - 50%We had an amazing one year anniversary dinner here!  I made reservations a few months in advance, since the Virtuoso Conference was taking place at Bellagio this week, and the restaurant closes for renovations next week.  Sporting my new necklace, aptly named the Showstopper, Eric R. escorted me to the beautiful Sensi restaurant.  We had Chef Ellamar's food before at a Project Dinner Table a few years ago, but had never been in the restaurant.  I also knew before ever entering that this is one of the most beautiful restaurants in terms of design.  We were seated in a beautiful room at a table facing the glass kitchen - what a great view!Immediately, Sanae, the Head Sommelier, brought us Gruet champagne as a celebratory gesture for our anniversary.  We almost had visited Gruet winery in Albuquerque on Monday, but ran out of time!  I decided to go with the tasting menu, and Eric R. decided to go a la carte.  He ordered the Roll Call appetizer, with a sample of each sushi roll (trout, salmon, tuna, and lobster), and the halibut with corn risotto and charred tomato vinaigrette.  My selections on the tasting menu included the kusshi oyster with ponzu and sriracha, roasted octopus, the Thai diver scallop with jasmine rice and bok choy, kalbi marinated kobe flat iron steak with bone marrow and kimchi with mashed potato, and strawberry shortcake with basil.Our server (I believe his name is Lawrence) was great.  He promised to alternate my courses with Eric's so we could have food at all times and sample each other's.  First, we received the famous bread basket with naan, papadums, cucumber raita, and tomato chutney.  As I anticipated from Misti Y.'s and Bobby Y.'s reviews, we were addicted to the tomato chutney...and refilled the chutney and the basket!  Then, the chef generously sent out oysters for each of us though only I was supposed to get one.  The kusshi are small and flavorful and the sauce was perfect!  Who doesn't love ponzu?  So fresh!  Sanae helped us choose a wine for the meal.  We split a glass of white from Santorini Greece that she recommended, and it was flavorful and easy to drink.Then Eric received his roll call.  He let me try a bite of one with ikura but I wanted him to enjoy his appetizer, which he definitely did.  He loved the tuna roll.  Next, I received my roasted octopus, adorned with fried capers, roasted red pepper, roasted potatoes, and strands of radicchio.  I love grilled octopus and roasted did not disappoint.  The restaurant generously provided potstickers also, which Eric enjoyed.  Then I received my scallop, which had a chile paste flavor (which I love), delicious charred haricort vert, and bok choy with radish sprouts.  The scallop was HUGE and perfectly cooked.  Then, Eric received his halbut (perfectly cooked also) and it was delicious and moist.Next I got my steak which was presented beautifully and secretly pre-sliced which made my life easier!  It was very tasty.  We were so full so we got what was left to go, knowing dessert was next.  Besides my shortcake, the restaurant gave us three other treats: donuts, raspberry-rhubarb mousse, and a chocolate caramel dessert.  Wow!  We were so full.  Then our server gave us chocolates and told us the meal was taken care of already by someone else!  It turns out my parents arranged with Sensi to surprise us!  It was such a shock - we were so surprised.  What a delicious and special experience to cap off a year of wedded bliss!  Thanks to Sensi, especially the manager, sommelier Sanae, our server Lawrence, and Chef Ellamar...and my parents!The best dining experience during my last trip to Las Vegas was here at Sensi.  Everything from the food, service, and ambiance was just simply awesome!Sensi is a little hard to spot inside Bellagio.  You don't really notice any signage for it on the casino floor and I even asked one waitress where it was and she had no idea!  Just keep walking past the Conservatory of Flowers and Jean Phillippe Patisserie and you'll find it!The layout of the restaurant is pretty cool in that all of the kitchen stations are visible in the middle of the dining room showing all diners all the action behind the kitchen.http://bit.ly/11E6B4CI've done some research before my trip and already knew what I was getting, which were the Roll Call, which is a sampler of all their Sensi Rolls, and their Famous Wok LobsterRoll Call - Sensi Roll Sampler -- http://bit.ly/ZgsTuzTataki Roll - seared spicy tuna roll, tuna tartare, miso ponzuTLC Roll - tempura lobster & crab, whipped avocado, chili aioliIda Roll - smoked idaho trout, horseradish white soyGreen Roll - jumbo asparagus, roasted shiitakes.I totally enjoyed each roll but I'd have to say my fave was definitely the Tataki Roll.  It was so creamy and delicate and had a nice solid flavor with the tuna and ponzu.  This made for a great appetizer and is a great offering if you can't decide which Sensi Roll to get.  Each piece is a pretty substantial size.Famous Wok Lobster --  http://bit.ly/11dulIcChili & licorice glaze, baby bok choy, fried shallots.OMG!!  It was exactly like the how the pictures were with the interesting plating of the lobster.  This was amazing and the lobster was cooked perfectly.I wasn't too sure if I was going to order dessert but after seeing their dessert menu on their iPad, I was definitely tempted and settled with their Signature Tapioca Puddinghttp://bit.ly/14RPb2dSignature Tapioca Pudding with Mango Lassi and Coconut Sorbet -- http://bit.ly/11duonkThis was a pretty heavy dessert with a lot going on.  And everything was delicious!  Probably the best part though was the Coconut Sorbet.  It was so good!  This was a good dessert to finish off my meal since it had right amount of sweetness to counter the savory lobster taste.After an awesome experience like this, I'm definitely going to consider coming back here again.  It certainly lives up to the high standards of Bellagio's restaurant collection.CELEBRATINGFor the past three birthday celebrations, it has been at Sensi with Executive Royden Ellamar ( Hilo). I normally let him do his thing. This time it's his tasting menu with the following:- Oyster with ponzu sauce (extraordinary)- Heirloom Tomato,heirloom melon, burrata cheese with balsamic vinegar- Shrimp two ways (sorry bad photo)- Chimichurri with ponzu sauce (afterwards nothing but a clean plate)- Octopus salad with aioli (sexy and delicious)- Ricotta cheese ravioli with bacon and peas sauce with butter (delightful)- Halibut with shellfish risotto (moist and perfection)- Miso based salmon with vegetables (PNW connection)- Goat with Polenta (slow cooked and viciously eaten)- Lamp Chop with vegetables (lamb lover's dream)Dessert (no dessert tree this time)- Ice Bubble filled with Lemon, Coconut and Mango - Peaches and Creams- Coffee Mousses and Donuts (Malasadas)Congratulations to Chef Ellamar who is not only one LAS top ten best chef but also achieved national acclaim by winning top chef award on food network's "Chopped" February 2013. Didn't realize that Sensi traditionally closes for vacation for fourteen days during the latter half of August plus the last week of November into the first week of December. It so happens that our dinner is during the first day back from vacation.  Unfortunately, Yu-go chauffeur's BD is on a day they'll be closed during the first part of December.I was thinking this review needed a title, but I couldn't decide on just one.  Instead, pick your favorite of the following two:"My Evening at Sensi"    --- or ---"Attack of the Insane Drunk Ladies"Now that I have that squared away, onto the review!  I had reservations for 1 on Saturday night at Sensi at the Bellagio.  Since I was flying solo, I decided to sit at the bar, which was stylish and contemporary, with lots of granite and dark woods and a waterfall.  Unfortunately, in contrast to the other high-end restaurants in the Bellagio, Sensi doesn't have any walls or doors or other barriers separating the interior of the restaurant from the foot traffic and general pandemonium happening in the common areas -- so my hopes for a serene dinner were dashed before I even started eating.After ordering a Sauvignon blanc (excellent!) and noshing on the complementary breadbasket of naan and curry-flavored chips, I decided dinner would be the "Taste of Sensi" tasting menu.  Here's the rundown:AMUSE BOUCHESalmon cracker with nori crisps, kaffir smoked salmon, and wasabi avocado.  Lovely presentation, but far too salty/briny for my taste.  Not enjoyable.COURSE #1Roasted octopus with chorizo, fingerling potatoes, arugula salad, egg yolk, and squid ink aioli.  Similar to the amuse bouche, this dish was beautiful to look at, but all I could taste was salt.  I picked it at, but didn't finish it.COURSE #2Alaskan halibut with fennel, sweet corn, broken rice, asparagus, and peas.  Hands down my favorite dish of the night.  The halibut was cooked to perfection, and I loved the texture of the intermingled broken rice, corn, and peas.COURSE #3"Tongue & Cheek" -- braised veal cheeks, smoked Wagyu beef tongue, potato puree, and red wine reduction.  Great flavors and beautifully cooked meats, but I was a bit blind-sided by the enormous portion of very rich ingredients, which seemed out of place in a tasting menu sequence.  I guess I can't complain about too much of a good thing, right?DESSERTGreek yogurt panna cotta with honey gelee and blackberry coulis.  SIlky smooth but overwhelmingly sweet.  A few bites and the sugar rush became too much to handle.While the food was a mixed bag, the real "highlight" of the evening (if you can call it that) was being accosted by a pair of insane drunk ladies** (IDLs) who stumbled in from the casino, sat down next to me, GRABBED MY UTENSILS OUT OF MY HANDS, and helped themselves to my food.  Jeeeeeezus H. Christ!I begged and pleaded with the bartender to do something about the IDLs, but he shrugged and did a whole lot of nothing.  Eventually the IDLs got bored of me and moved on to greener pastures...but my appetite was mostly ruined at that point.  I was hoping the bartender could comp at least part of my meal that had been rendered inedible by the IDLs' creeper-germs, but he refused.  Instead, he poured me a free glass of Sauvignon blanc in a to-go cup, which was a nice gesture, but nowhere near enough to make up for a spoiled dinner.  Needless to say, I quickly paid my check and got the hell out of there.And thus ends my tale of Sensi -- possibly the strangest and randomest experience I've ever had as a solo diner in Vegas (or anywhere else).  -----**Footnote: I didn't call them ladies at the time.  I used a much less family-friendly term... You can probably guess what it was.We recently celebrated our anniversary and spur of the moment picked Sensi as our dining destination of the night. I've had this establishment bookmarked for quite some time, and it appears there was a time during which this place was missing the mark. I am glad that it wasn't the case in this instance. We had a reservation for 9:15pm, arrived a bit early and sat at the bar while waiting for our table. As far as Vegas fine dining goes, I was not overly impressed by the design or the decor of this place. I like simplistic, but this was overly so and it looked like the furniture needed some updating. We were seated at 9pm and had a great view of the open kitchen. It reminded me of a fish tank.We opted for the chef's tasting menu ($85 per person) which is is very reasonable, especially for the quality of the food. Our server was great... he was like Beetlejuice -- appeared when we needed him, left us alone otherwise. We started off with a bread basket and two dipping sauces, one being of spicier variety to go with the naan bread that was served. It was a bit confusing to me and I wasn't sure how naan was tied into the whole theme of the menu, but I digress.My husband and I each ordered different things off the chef's tasting menu so that we can sample everything on it. In addition, we ordered half a dozen oysters and also Octopus Crostini which for me was by far the most underwhelming part of the meal. I thoroughly enjoyed the cauliflower soup, the scallop was cooked to PERFECTION and to me scallops are the ultimate test of one's culinary prowess, Tongue & Cheek was packed with flavor and the Hanger Steak was juicy and cooked to perfection.My only complaint is that toward the end of the evening, the meal spacing became way too long and I was starting to feel too full to enjoy my dessert (Greek Yogurt panna cotta). I think we were getting antsy to get dinner over with and continue on with our night.The bill was reasonable and the food as well as the service both hit the mark. I would highly recommend the chef's tasting menu.
Lahaina Grill=What happened Lahaina?Lahaina definitely took a step down since the last time I've been here.  I use to think Lahaina had some of the best food with decent prices.  The prices have since changed.  This place use to sport a 50% all day Happy Hour.  Now, it's only 10%.  I had their Yellow Tail Nigiri, Salmon Nigiri, Tempura Shrimp Roll, and Spicy Tuna Hand Roll.  I didn't think the food was that great.  Both nigiris were small and the fish didn't taste as fresh as other sushi joints out here.  The Tempura Shrimp Roll was actually ordered on accident.  I didn't realize that this was a deep fried roll.  I thought it had too much tempura, which took over the taste of the actual roll.  As for their hand roll, this was the only thing that was fairly sized, but the tuna had a paste type texture.  Taste wasn't that great either.  If there was anything good about the food, it's probably just the price.  Even though Lahaina no longer has the 50% Happy Hour, the prices for everything is still pretty cheap. One hand roll, two sushi rolls, and four nigiris cost about $30.  This is not bad at all.It's the ambiance of the place that takes the biggest plunge.  After 11 PM, this place becomes a 21 and over hang out.  I thought everyone looked and acted even younger to the point that Lahaina reminded me of a teen club.  The music is dialed up so loud that I could barely hear the conversation that I was having with my friend. Because of all this, Lahaina now attracts a bunch of the young cats that were up to no good.  While outside, I was even approached at least three times and asked if I was a cop.  I guess I have that look, but it's more paranoia from this kids if you ask me.  Overall, I can no longer suggest this place to friends or family.  In the past, this is where I shipped them.  Now with all the other options in Las Vegas, Lahaina sits at the bottom.  The one thing going for Lahaina is their bar and hours.  Other than that, I think I will pass on Lahaina.Went here for all-you-can-eat sushi, and the food was alright (but nothing to write home about). The service, however, was not up to par. The waitress was messy, spilling water on our sushi rolls and the sauce from the sushi onto me/my clothes and NOT apologizing after. She also forgot a majority of my orders (even though there was no one in the dining area) and really didn't do anything to make sure I got them.If I were you, I'd go to a different sushi bar or Hawaiian food place to get slightly better food and better service. It's a shame because the establishment looks pretty decent inside...
Bistro Buffet=We wanted to stop somewhere close to the freeway to eat as we were about to leave Las Vegas on our way home to Los Angeles, We decided to head to the Palms assuming that they would have a good buffet to eat at. We discovered the Bistro Buffet, and decided to give it a try. The restaurant has a very nice look to it. It is modern in appearance, and has an upscale cafeteria feel about it. It is one of the smallest buffets that I have been to in Las Vegas, but getting seated was not an issue. The food was not very good. Most of it was cold, and tasted as though it had been sitting around for hours. Condiments were very hard to find, and the whole setup in general seemed disorganized. The one highlight from the food selection was the crab legs. They were fairly big and pre-cut to make them easier to peel open and eat. The other highlight of eating here was that the service was excellent. Our waiter kept our cups filled and cleared our dishes whenever we finished a plate. He was very accommodating and was able to help us with whatever we needed. The service made up a little bit for the food being sub par. Overall, the Bistro Buffet was a disappointment. The food just wasn't good. With so many other options in Vegas, I can't see any reason for me to eat here again.Let me tell you I am a huge fan of crab legs and like it a certain way.  I know there is a lot of lazy people out there that want to enjoy food with very little effort needed.  So let me just get this off my chest, I HATE WHEN BUFFETS CUT THE LEGS IN HALF.  Not only is the meat cold by the time you get back to the table but they are dried up.  The only way to eat crab legs is keeping them whole and cracking them yourself.  I know what people are thinking......"I hate cold crab legs and that is the only time they are whole".  WRONG.  AT the bistro buffet you get the whole cold crab legs and hand them to the cook.  He then will steam them for about 1 minute and the result.....perfect hot crab legs that I miss so much.  Well done bistro buffet. In addition to the crab legs all the other food is amazing and cooked perfect.  The selection is huge and I would highly recommend this buffet before some of the other expensive ones.On a side note, always be aware of your surroundings for dangerous crab leg crackers.  Its very easy to get shot in the face by some crab meat.  Its happened to me many times.  My girlfriend has gotten the best distance I've ever seen.  She cracked a leg and meat shot sideways over this guys head about 5 feet and he had no idea this happened.  I spit my wine out of my mouth because it was so funny.  SEE it can be so much fun eating food :)Per Mandi L.'s suggestion we purchased a Travel Zoo voucher good for 2 people for $35 for any night of the week at the Bistro Buffet.. She had raved about the crab legs so we made sure to come hungry! No wait on a Saturday at 6pm so in we went to join her table... The buffet is small and so the selections are few compared to other buffets but man I was impressed with the seafood selection.. They have shrimp, oysters and cold crab legs in the salad section.. The line may look long but it moves pretty fast.. While waiting in line the chefs offer the option of hot crab legs.. I definitely recommend this because they do not skimp on the amount of yummy crab legs they fill your plate with and it saves you the time of having to sort through the cold crab legs. They also have crawfish, mussels, salmon and many other seafood options.. AYCD beer and wine are also included with your meal and we definitely took advantage of the white wine!Con: Dessert section is limited.. HOT TIP: Fridays and Saturdays are their seafood nightsYou like to drink? How about unlimited mimosas and crab legs? Cheap food for a cheap price, this is exactly what is advertised. At $21.99, you get what you pay : unlimited mimosas, crab legs and omelettes made to order. The rest of the food was ok, but some of it was really bland. The desserts were so pretty, but again, they didn't taste great. The buffet's Chinese food was good and cauliflower cheese bake was delicious! Service was superb because they were very nice, and they kept the drinks rolling. They were happy to take photos for us and do it with making us smile. If you want high-quality food you came to the wrong buffet. Those buffets are usually $40-$50 and can be found at places like Bellagio or Caesars Palace. However, this was perfect for us because the price was cheap and they provided exactly what we wanted, basic buffet food and some sweet drinks. If this buffet was priced any higher, it wouldn't have been worth it.
Kobe Sushi Bistro=I came for happy hour and I love their happy hour menu! Certain menu items and sushi is 50% and 30% off. And on Sundays the happy hour goes on from open until closing. They also have buy 2 get 1 free sake or beer.The decor is pretty cute,  and I really think the service is ok. It's a hit or miss sometimes here (I just don't think talking politics to your customers is professional.)I love most of their specialty rolls here are good. They're not as fresh as some of the other restaurants I've been to. Here are my suggestions for sushi choices:RAINBOW ROLLHAPPY ENDING ROLLWET DREAM ROLLJALAPENO ROLL007 ROLLTIGER ROLL**most of these are offered during HH. Also, don't forget to have an order of muscles while you're there! As far as AYCE sushi though, I'd pass on it. I'd prefer to spend my AYCE time on a more extensive menu (and a bigger dessert menu).
Joe's Real BBQ=5 plus stars for decor ..I am a sucker for that whole post modern retro  vintage look...  Love it. I  love the John Deer Tractor in the dining room and the old wood everywhere , I love that it still looks like a store front and has a rich red paint on the inside .I love the cafeteria style serving with the old fashioned look to it. I even adore the old retro sodas in a tin. But I have to say 3 stars for food . The ribs did not have the flavor that I crave  with ribs. I  see  and smell the smokiness,but there was almost too much sweetness with the overbearing sauce, it was nice but not delicious.  The coleslaw tasted like they ran down to Smart and Final and bought the big bag of coleslaw mix and the jar of coleslaw dressing ..boring and bland.  The mac and cheese however was super  yummo. Baked with a cheesy crunchy top that made it  comfort food. I also really like the cornbread, not too sweet not too bland  and honey butter very delish. We also had an interesting dessert Sweet potato crunch that I am still pondering  a mash of sweet potato with a creamy texture with a bit of nuts and brown sugar. Ice Cream cut the richness . I want to adore Joes ,I want to say it's an all around winner . i want to sit in the restaurant and enjoy the decor, but maybe I 'll go for the cornbread. Hey Parents--The kids menu is a rib sandwich ...which wouldn't have been a hit with my kiddo....I really wanted BBQ last night, and wanted to try something new and different. Came on Yelp and found this place.  Its in a cute little part of Gilbert, and around several other resturants in a nice part of town. Parked my car and went inside.  I loved the decor!!  OMG!  HUGE, spacious, very open and pleasantly decorated.  Plenty of seating!  Menu is front and center, and very easy to read and make sense of.  You have several options and dishes to chose from...I went for the small selection of the Beef Brisket in sauce, with 2 sides.  I did the beans and corn.  They also have a little station in the middle with BBQ sauce, onions, peppers and such.  The line itself kind of has a boston market feel to it.  You grab a tray, and place your order with the gal behind the glass.  She scoops your food for you, and passes it underneath the glass.  Take your food to the end of the line, pay, and there you are.  They have 3 different seating areas.  In the resturant they have seating, with booths and benches.  The second seating area is picnic tables in an air conditioned garage type area.  You actually have to go through a set of doors and sort of leave the resturant to get to this part.  The third seating area is picnic tables competely outside....no covering, no AC.  yea.  Not for me.  I like eating indoors!I would return to this place, but my only true complaint is the drink station.  In order to refill your drink, you must cut back into the line to get to the drink station.  BAD IDEA!  I can see people getting fussy and annoyed and think your taking cuts when your really just trying to get more Dr. Pepper.   They need to have a second station somewhere so people can refill their beverages and NOT cut back into the food line to do so!  Big pain in the butt, and I docked them a full star for it.  This place is plenty big enough to throw a second beverage station somewhere in the layout of the store.I will return here for eating again, as I did enjoy my experience.
IHOP=Stopped here for breakfast this morning and was totally satisfied.  I got the Colorado omelet and raspberry pancakes and service was good.  Good for a family breakfast.
Pugzie's=I dunno if I have horrible taste or if everyone else is wrong, but the decor in this place is RIGHT UP MY ALLEY!  It's a cross between trips to grandma's house for some cookies, and... well... a trip to my OTHER grandma's house for some cookies. Except, you see, they don't ONLY have cookies. Oh No! They have sammiches!  Mass varieties of them. Types of sammiches your granny wouldn't dare to build for you on a sunday afternoon.My buddy, Groovy P, and myself have been here on two separate occasions, and I also took my wife here once! I know, I know... I spoil her sometimes. Let me tell you, if you want to taste some of the BEST pasta salad on this good brown earth, order the seafood pasta salad.  You won't be sorry.  That is, of course, unless you are allergic to seafood.The roast beef sammich is sometimes on special here, so that is what I usually get.  Watch out! If you underestimate this one you WILL be sorry. A single bite into this unearthly delight and I lose all control of myself.Pair these two items with a drink and a pickle and you will be going back to work a pleasure ravaged ball of contentment. Hey! Grammy never gave me a pickle with my sammich! What was I missing!P.S. They have drive thru!After driving by Pugzies numerous times over the past few years, and hearing about their tuna salad from Sarah G, I finally made my way inside this family-owned institution for lunch with friends earlier this week...I checked it out online first and learned that Pugzie's has been in business since 1981 - they must be doing something right!  Pretty impressive...When I arrived, I debated on what to get... I ended up doing a lunch combo with a half turkey sandwich on 12grain bread - (it's prepared to order but comes with provolone cheese, mayonnaise, tomatoes, lettuce, sprouts and I added avocado for an extra 50 cents) and a cup of tomato soup.  It came with a pickle as well.  With a bottle of water, my total bill was around $9 - not bad.The staff at Pugzie's were friendly and quick.  It's cafeteria style but their food is fresh and much more appealing than an actual cafeteria... I'll have to go back to try some of their other menu items and perhaps keep them in mind for catering in the future as well.It may not be much on atmosphere, but go to Pugzie's for a quality, affordable lunch and support this long time local business!Time for an update...I must've been in a generous mood when I wrote my original Pugzie's review.  I've been back a couple of times, and I'm still a fan - it's "A-OK" or worthy of 3 stars in Yelp terms.All 3 of those stars are for the food... the ambiance, bathrooms, service, etc... are just eh.This is not a gourmet eatery... it's more the place you would go to when in a hurry or just need some nourishment of sorts and don't care much about atmosphere.  I'm sure I'll be back, but it's for sure not making my top ten favorite lunch place list anytime soon!  But kudos to Pugzie's for their history (they've been in business since 1981) - and as I said, I'll for sure return on occasion - it just won't be a regular in my lunchtime rotation!I don't like sandwiches.  It's not that I don't want the carbs from the bread.  I mean, if you do this thing called exercise, a sandwich once a month isn't going to kill you.Anyway, they get a star simply by having a vegetarian option.  It's made with feta, which added another star.  It's nothing spectacular, though.  Lettuce, tomato and chopped mushrooms with a light ranch dressing.  Meh.  The other star was for having 12-grain bread.  Hard to come by.It's pretty expensive for a freaking sandwich.  With tax, I paid $6.73.  For a sandwich.  No chips, no drink.  Just a sandwich.It's so close to work that I'll be back, just not often and not because I really crave Pugzie's.  It just beats Subway or Chompie's or Blimpie's is all.I feel sad to say this...because I know it is locally owned by a small family...but yucko!  I went there to lunch hesitantly, but my friend wanted to go there.  The place felt old and dirty, too big for too few people and too quiet.I had the egg salad sandwich.  It was bland and boring and served between two slices of stale white bread.My friend got a chicken salad and I could tell it was disgusting...she barely made her way through it.The ice tea was ok....but it was really disappointing and I fear it is on it's last leg unless some changes are made:(
Rocco's NY Pizzeria=I remember when they first opened years ago and I liked this place. They've expanded and remodeled the place. Along with that was a decline in the quality of their food. My friend and I shared a medium half everything, half pepperoni pizza and rainbow cookies. Pizza:What the heck happened to their crust? It was like eating a cracker - pale and flavorless. What the heck happened to the pizza? It's just not as good as the last time I've been here. I had to fix it by dousing it with hot sauce. 2/5Rainbow Cookies:When I think of rainbows, I think happy thoughts. I tried their rainbow cookies and I was hoping my trip to New York was soon enough so I can get the real deal. This brought me great disappointment. It was dry and tasted so artificial. Never again will I try rainbow cookies from this town if it's not from Bagel Cafe. 1/5I know all of the Rocco's around town get confused by other people thinking they are all the same restaurant and owners. They aren't. Please don't confuse this Rocco's with the one on Buffalo near Charleston because they don't have anything to do with each other. Walking in I noticed they have 2 sides. The right of the restaurant is for customers that are dining inside (they have an all you can eat buffet all day for $8.49 plus tax) and the left side is for placing and picking up to-go orders. The people working were very friendly. The lady who helped me went over the specials and told me what was most popular. I ordered the 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink special and waited for my order. The guy making pizzas took some slices and put them in the oven for reheating. He asked me how I was and was courteous. After he boxed up my slices I was on my way. 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink ($6.49) - The price threw me off a bit at first. It's kind of high compared to the average $4.99 - $5.99 cost for this type of common special at other pizza joints around town. Then I saw how big the pizza slices were and figured the price was actually on point so long as the pizza tasted good. Too bad the pizza didn't taste good. Yes, the slices are huge and I was impressed  by that, but just because the slices are huge doesn't mean the pizza is going to taste good. There was a good amount of cheese however it tasted rubbery and when I took the second bite all of the cheese came right off the top. The pizza lacked flavor and I didn't even eat the second slice. I gave this place a try and while the people working inside are very friendly, I have definitely experienced better pizza elsewhere.
Dick's Hideaway=Dick's has that special something - the allure of the secret spot, your proximity to food coaxed by open flame, the forced intimacy, the darkness on the edge of visibility... and booze.It's the food of Richardson's within a speakeasy atmosphere. Quirky rustic  ambiance served with a meaty, habanero kick. Great for an adventurous early date where you want to see if the other person "gets it", and to "get some" later if they do get it. And of course, an old reliable that you suddenly perk up and remember when you think you've run out of options for a great casual meal.Also, the private room/wine cellar is a great option for smallish family gatherings, company events and holiday parties. The reservation fee completely applies to the tab and the enivronment itself keeps the conversation moving.Don't ever change Dick's! (does that need a comma somewhere?)It's dark in there!Honestly, I walked in last Saturday and it was like trying to see where you are going right after you turn out the bathroom light at 2:00 am:)The last time I was at one of the Burning Embers/Richarsdson's Family of Restaurant offerings (Richardson's, Rokerij and Dick's Hideaway, as I understand it), I told myself I wouldn't be returning...I had listened to the boss (the owner?) screaming at an employee, over some error, for a solid 3-4 minutes as the Beautiful Carin and I tried to eat a nice dinner at Richardson's:(It was like watching Hell's Kitchen, up close and personal.And not what I expect in a dinner house, quasi fine dining establishment.However, I got roped into a post squash tournament group brunch/retox with my buddies from the Village.They all wanted to go to Dick's, so I was outvoted...I could have gone home, but that would have been impolite and no fun:)As I stumbled over the threshold trying to adjust my eyes from the arc welder intensity of the Phoenix noon hour, to the eerie dark wood, leather and no light world that is the Hideway, I told myself "well, I didn't darken their door again...the door was already darkened":)Would I have gone back on my own...even to score a coveted review for Yelp? I'm going to have to say "No"...Much as I love the spicy food and the New Mexican style of cooking, I was pretty sure that I would rather drive to Santa Fe for New Mexican style food than have dinner disturbed by a Gordon Ramsey wanna be again:(But you know something...I am not one to hold a grudge or to be "Donnie Downer" so let's start with some positives from the brunch the other day:* There was no screaming, whatsoever:)* The service was outstanding...no really, our server was excellent  and friendly, as well as knowledgeable and competent:)* They know how to make a pretty good vodka martini:)* They sure know where to find the peppers in the kitchen:)* The menu is reasonably creative:)On the other hand (oh, you knew it was coming...two stars...it couldn't be that everything was great)* The Carne Adovada and Eggs (the "signature" dish, as I understand it) was mediocre...the pork was pretty dry, the potatoes were a bit undercooked and I was frankly glad for the eggs and beans to put a little moisture back in the dish...the flavors were good, though and if the pork hadn't been dry and if the potatoes were done, I could see this dish being a solid choice:)* $25 for two vodka martini's on a Saturday afternoon...really? I don't like to complain about prices, generally, but this seems to be a stretch...these things were  1/2 the size of the marti's at oh, say AZ88, yet they cost more. That doesn't make me happy:(I just haven't had the best of luck with places named "Dick's" anything...Dickey's BBQ is just a pit and Dickie's Dog's apparently fed the wrong person a crappy hot dog one too many times and got fire bombs thrown through their front window for their trouble.The Richardson's Family of Restaurants has already had enough trouble along the fire front, so I certainly wish them the best with their restaurant activities.But I probably won't be back until the next time one of my buddies wants to drag me here again...or if I miss an episode of Hell's Kitchen and want to catch up:)Make whatever jokes you want about the name as if you're a homophobic 7th grade boy, but Dick's Hideaway has really got a great menu of American food.  Might not be a burger, fry, and shake diner, but New Mexican cuisine is American all the way, and as a matter of fact, among their many southwestern tinged dishes, they've got a superb thick, juicy burger, grilled up on an open flame right in front of you as you sit at the bar, with some great fries AND a nice full plate of dark green salad for somewhere around 11 bucks-ish (last I was aware).Probably my favorite breakfast spot. Depending on my mood, this is how it's done, eggs are either over easy or poached:Shrimp enchiladas -- red and green chileHuevos Rancheros  -- red and green chileCarne Adovada  -- red only Lately, it's been a lot of enchilada, though I feel the huevos rancheros starting a resurgence!Breakfast entrees are about $10 -12 and worth every penny.This review will reveal itself in...5....4....3...2...1...Consider finding this review the equivalent of finding the front door to Dick's Hideaway. This restaurant definitely lives up to its name. Everything about it is hidden! The front door? Don't look for a sign. The true regulars know what door leads them to Dick's. The back entrance? Don't expect direction. Those who need to know where the back entrance do, and those who don't will walk around aimlessly until they find the front door. How about the bathroom lock? Don't worry, you won't have to go with an unlocked door, but it will take you time to find it...hint: it looks like a metal rod that's a part of the door. One thing Dick's doesn't hide from you is the quality of their food. Completely delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. The enchiladas melt in your mouth, the chips and guac are good (ask for the flour chips-- thanks Aileen!) I went for the New Mexico Platter and all I can say is how! I was given a rellenao, chicken burro and tamale to try. Yes, it all kind of blended together but only because every bite was just as delicious as the next. It's spicy, it's cheesy, it's creamy, it's sassy (yes, I said sassy!)...it's just delicious. I tried my hardest to finish the meal but I only got maybe half way through (maybe less). It's a LOT of food and you could easily share. Now be warned before you visit, this is a hideaway and that means, it's not big. Originally, there used to be maybe room for 15 people total. But now they have a room that fits about 30 more and it's perfect for a large group, but be sure to make a reservation!So hidden that they don't even have a sign.  You either know this place by word or your bestest friend Yelp.  Tehee. :-DTex-mex is the name of the game at Dick's.  Don't expect authentic Mexican but come with an open mind that you will indulge in good tasting dishes.  Aside the main entree, what stood out to me were their rice and beans.  They were cooked al dente and full of flavor.  The grains were firm but not hard.On my last visit with Fia R and Daniel L (first timers), I ordered their red tamales.  It wasn't the best I had but it was on a decent level.  I came here once for a CMYE and I had one of the enchilada dishes and it was melty good.  The cheese was like molting lava all over the dish which screamed: "eat me now."All their dishes come on these cool, silvery industrial looking iron plates ensuring your dishes will remain hot while you get down and dirty.  The only caveat would be that its a compact place--you have the main bar and the couple of tables by it (seats 4).  To that, there's a more spacious dining room for larger parties, but probably needs a reservation.You will find the decor appealing due to its dimly, dark setting like you went into hiding.  The lighting and furnishing were all high-end looking, no less.If you are craving some Tex-Mex in the central PHX area, this is the spot to get some.  They purposely try to be a "hidden gem." :-pBreakfast at Dick's Hideaway is an experience you'll never forget. Well, OK when you're 90 and sitting in a rocking chair telling your life story to your great grandchildren it might not come up, but it is something you will tell your friends and coworkers about - but only if you do it right.Dick's offers some standard breakfast dishes like eggs, pancakes and french toast. But you can get those dishes at just about any place that's open at 7am.  You really want to give their New Mexican dishes a try.  A personal favorite is the carne adovada and eggs but I don't think you can wrong with any of the dishes. Go on, be adventurous.Bear in mind, this isn't a big restaurant and seating is limited - it's worth the wait.Wow, I can't believe I haven't been here in years.  I should keep this place in my rotation more often, it is really awesome, however be aware it is really small.  They have pretty good wines on their list, but their margaritas are amazing.  The food is really spicy, my husband was in heaven.  I had the carne adovada sliders, so delicious and my husband had the pork, shrimp and beef enchiladas.  I had a taste of each of them, they were so yummy.  They also have a room for private parties, you can reserve it with $500, that will towards the bill that night, so it is a pretty good deal if you have a large group and you want to enjoy their food and drinks. Hmmm, my birthday is coming up pretty soon!It is refreshing to come to a venue that offers something different. Not only it si secluded and somewhat exclusive, when one has managed to get a seat in a small booth-like table with no space - but I like it. It makes me feel like I am in a place that is not a franchise (if it is, I don't want to know). This establishment is austere without being uncouth in any way, like a diamond in the rough that you do not want to polish. The servers are amazing. Personable and friendly. On top of their shit, and not too busy to squeeze in a joke here and there. The beer list is not extensive, but it works. The food menu is nice. Overall this is my kind of place. I would come here often if I didn't have a decent drive associated with it. The bathroom is one coed bathroom located in the kitchen. This is good and bad, it feels odd walking into the kitchen - but I like that you can walk into the kitchen. A feel of transparency to see what is going on in here. What I bring home from my visit is the service, and the feel of the place. Both are top notch. Yes, there are things that I could suggest that would improve my experience - but i'd rather not. I want to leave this place as I found it and hope that they do not change.Dick's Hideaway... it was an adventure here!So technically we made two stops in here on Friday night.  When we first walked in, it was crowded!  So we made our way across the street for a drink before popping back in because after having a great Bloody Mary with dinner and seeing how this place boasts about having a "top rated Bloody Mary in the valley," I couldn't stop thinking about Dick's!  Plus the Persian with us wanted a crème brûlée so we came back.  The bartender even recognized us!While we awkwardly stood around waiting for some chairs or a table to free up, the bartender came by and asked us what we wanted.  A Bloody Mary and a crème brûlée was ordered and I was soon handed my lovely drink along with a small glass of Hair of the Dog beer on the house.  Sweet!  After being bullied into chugging this tasty and smooth brew, I was buzzed.  Even though I might have been a little intoxicated, I still found myself underwhelmed by this "top rated" Bloody Mary.  Whaaat!?  I had a much better Bloody Mary like one review ago.  Get on their level!Kazi H. and I were soon to be escorted to two stools at the bar while the gentlemen we were with still stood awkwardly by the door.  What were they talking about?  My love and I cracked into a nicely caramelized shell and dug into a creamy custard.  While not the best crème brûlée ever, I still found myself stealing more and more bites of her abandoned brûlée.  More for me, yay!  And then some more stools freed up and our crew came to sit with us.So the adventure?  Kazi and I stumbled into the private, dark, adjoining dining room to use the restroom.  Let's just say that two girls entered a bathroom with a shower included.  Much shenanigans.  As we made our way back to the bar with her iPhone lighting thew way, we were told that there was another bathroom.  Oops.  Thinking about Dick's makes me smile.  :)Ok. I'll be the first to say that the food is good and in the Summer, it's nice, dark and cool inside. However, here is what the 1star rating is about. I have eaten in there and ordered food to go a number of times!! I'm done. They (Rokrij, Dick's Hideaway and Richardson's) are a Phoenix institution and they know it. The staff really couldn't care less that you are there because they feel entitled to business. They give off the attitude that THEY are doing YOU a favor!The final straw was that a person in our party really didn't like their meal and asked nicely for a replacement. (The description on the menu wasn't enough and granted, she could have asked questions, but the waiter/'bartender' wasn't attentive, and would have been annoyed.) SO at ANY OTHER ESTABLISHMENT they would have taken the meal and gladly replaced it. Not Dick's! (Aptly named!) They groaned, made a new dish and charged her for BOTH!!! Also, I had ordered a cocktail off of THEIR cocktail menu. The waiter/'bartender' had no idea how to make it and just winged it! 11.00 or so for a 1st try, reading ingredients off the menu cocktail?! Not exceptable. Please see my review of Richardson's for yet another crazy example of their entitlement mentality! In a city of literally thousands of good restaurants, and more opening every week; why would you subject yourself to this?
U.S. Egg=US Egg is a place I can count on for Sunday brunch near home when I don't feel like waiting at Breakfast Joynt or dealing with the crowds / tough parking at LGO... and I don't want anything fancy - just good 'ol breakfast food!I've never had to wait at US Egg, and they always deliver exactly what I'm in the mood for whether it be oatmeal, protein pancakes, fruit, or an omelette.  I went today with Sarah P (all the way from MSP) in between running errands to get ready for the OYE.  I had an egg white omelette with cheese, spinach and mushrooms, an english muffin, and sliced tomato.  Sarah had what US Egg calls "the border." It's an open faced omelette with spicy chorizo, onions, Monterey jack and cheddar cheese topped with salsa, and sour cream.  Served with warm tortilla and potatoes.  We were both happy with our orders.Service was attentive and fast - just what I was looking for.When you're looking for a no-nonsense breakfast, head over to US Egg.  They serve lunch too, but I recommend going for breakfast - no matter what time of day!Wow... time flies when you're having fun.  I just realized I haven't updated my review for U.S. Egg in over two years, so the below is long overdue.  And just because I'm feeling creative today, here's a little something I wrote in honor of U.S. Egg:U - ultimate place to go for a delicious breakfastS - super friendly staffE - eggs, pancakes, waffles, and so much more!G - giant portionsG - grateful... that's how I feel about having this place so close to home!I was reminded of how much I enjoy this place after our delightful breakfast this morning.  There was a less than five minute wait to sit down, but the hostess brought me an OJ while I waited which made me very happy!  Once seated, our waitress came over to help us navigate the menu... it had been awhile since our last visit.  Per her recommendation, I went with a half order of the blueberry whole wheat pancakes and a side of egg whites.  A half order is plenty for one person fyi - it comes with a pancake as big as your plate!  It was delicious! J had coffee and a 2 egg breakfast with english muffin and hashbrowns. I love that they leave a pitcher of water and a carafe of coffee at your table... and fyi this place has plenty of lunch options as well.  If you're looking for a casual place that is consistently good, head over to U.S. Egg... I have to remember to do so more often!Holy Pancakes!!! What a meal we had. We were in the area and decided we needed a BIG breakfast. I looked through the pictures on YELP and couldn't decide what looked more satisfying. We get there around 1130, NO WAIT at all. Perfect for me because I was getting pretty "Hangry". Looking through this delicious menu I wanted everything, but this waitress wasn't going to wait forever, as patient as she was. I'm down to try new things but I know what I like and the ITALY OMELETTE was calling my name. Mushrooms, sausage, mozzarella cheese, marinara and pepperoni on top. What omelette can beat that? Yeah I couldn't think of one either haha. But why stop there? I'm a girl with a sweet tooth so I ordered powered sugar french toast off of the kids menu (pretty filling) and added bananas on top. A little extra charge but who cares when you're hungry right? Just go bananas you'll thank yourself later!!! I also had the pleasure of eating off of my boyfriends plate. He kept it simple & light and ordered a sirloin steak with broccoli. I rather indulge in the good, "yet not so good for you" food, but then again that's just me! He splurged a little and got their famous protein pancake. Good for you carb and calorie counters. It was massive, filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and almonds. Simply delicious. Now that I have your mouth watering I think it's time you come in and taste for yourself. Remember: Go Bananas!
Smith & Wollensky=Spring Restaurant Week 2013 review.This place was a nightmare to get into, not one person crossing the driveway would let me through, so when I finally got through I was happy they had valet. This was my first time eating here, so I had no expectations, only thing I knew about this place was the Beef Wellington they're known for. When we were seated the first thing I noticed was the wainscoting had old food particles all over it. Disgusting. It appeared no one has wiped down the area in years. I had to scoot away because I didn't want someone else's food from last year on my arm. For dinner, I started out with the Wollensky Salad, this was soaked in salad dressing, there was a pile of it at the bottom of the dish, I love a good salad and this was nothing special. I tried the Deconstructed Beef Wellington, I ordered it medium well and it came out tartare, it was bright red in the middle, all the way through. I have a huge fear of returning food, so I tried my best to eat this but just could not get it down. It was smothered in foie gras & mushrooms. So overwhelming. Ended it with the coconut cake, I took 2 bites and was done. It tasted old like it had been made days before. This was by far the most disappointing Restaurant Week meal I had. I would never return.So, today, my parents were going to a wine tasting that was being held here. This restaurant has a 'valet', but because I wasn't valeting, I went around the parked car, to go into the lot to drop off my parents.One of the valet guys started running after my car, and screaming..... Yes, screaming at us.I rolled down my window and asked if there was a problem... He very rudely stated that I needed to valet my car and demanded that we do so. My mom and I then explained to him that I was just dropping off my parents. He then told us that he was just "doing his job".Hire a more classy valet. Who runs and screams after a car.... ? I wasn't even going that fast.Zero stars for the valet, and his attitude.Buy my parents said they had a lot of fun at the event.I was more excited to try this place than Delmonico's! I've been wanting to come here for decades & when Restaurant Week featured this restaurant as one of their participants.. I smiled & jumped on the opportunity to finally dine here. The valet attendant was prompt in taking my car in & directed us to the entrance. As my Father & I walked in, we were greeted instantly by two friendly hostesses & sat us right away to a nice booth as requested.Now here is where things went downhill. Our server, an older Caucasian male seem to be taking care of the back section of the room, came over & handed us our menus. We ordered a Acqua Panna bottle & when he came back with it.. I asked him about the baked potato side dish if it was served for one or two guests.. he told me that's only for one person. I told him we're here for Restaurant Week & we're ready to order. At that exact moment of saying those words, we became nonexistence to him. Service went from 100 to zero in a split second. He acted like he didn't know what I was talking about & then said.. Oh the Restaurant Week menu.. I'll go get that.. I guess you won't be needing these & took the regular menus with him. When he came back with the RW menus, he took off when I was half way letting him know we were ready to order. WOW really?! He passed by not once, but eight times without even acknowledging us. I finally waved my hand as he was passing by & said we're ready to order & he puts his index finger in the air, noting to me to wait. We watched this rude server walk back & forth taking his time to other tables, probably not participating in RW, giving them the kind of service we never received. My blood began to boil, because this wasn't an ordinary outing. My only day off & I took my Father here to celebrate a belated Father's Day. I would think I chose a great place to make him feel special in this nice steakhouse that's been here forever, but I was completely wrong. WE felt like nobodys after I said we're here for Restaurant Week. If you're a participant for this wonderful program of giving back to our community that needs it more than anything, why are you not wanting to share it with your guests or even supporting a great cause?! In return, we were treated like a peasant for wanting to give back & share a good meal together. At that very moment, I had enough. As soon as I saw the next staff member, I told him I want to talk to your manager right now. The rude server that was in the next room probably heard me, since he came over after I said that & acted all nonchalant with.. so you ready to order? My look at his face.. I wish someone was there to take a picture. I told him.. Actually no, I'm going to talk to your manager first. And look who's behind him.. the manager. I explained to the manager what happened and told him straightforwardly.. I want a different server immediately. As soon as those words came out of my mouth, the manager unhesitatingly took care of this matter and like a shot.. here came Jinho. There's the one star comeback. His service was 100x better. Like night and day compared to the rude server we had. So welcoming & attentive.. he read our minds with what we wanted to ask for without even having to ask! Now that's the kind of service every restaurant should provide, especially being a well known steakhouse here in Las Vegas. When he asked if we would like any side dishes, I mentioned the baked potato and on the double he goes.. that's a good choice.. it's a big portion that both of you can share. Rude, greedy server of "no that's only for one person" to this server letting me know we can share it. It was more of a self serve kind of place, poured my Father some more water as well as myself. Or maybe that's just for RW guests.Appetizer of Tomato Carpaccio with Burrata was decent. Nothing spectacular. Food runner dropped off a few Ribeyes and sides that were for the table in front of us. I told the runner, this isn't our order. He looked at it, then looked at the table in front of us and flat-out took everything back to the cariton. The table in front of us saw what happened and we, both shared a laugh. Then a few seconds later our food came out and the runner goes.. let's try this again, it's like a deja vu. My filet mignon on one side was completely burnt to a black crisp. I had to cut it off and discard it. The baked potato was simply what it was, but good toppings of butter, sour cream, bacon bits, and cheddar cheese. NY Cheesecake was light and soft. The star of the night.. Chocolate Cake was DELICIOUS! We took it home. My Mother ate a few bites and said.. this is the best tasting cake I ever had. I have to agree.. I couldn't stop eating it!!!One star for the valet that had my car parked and ready for me when I came out, another star for the prompt action of the manager in getting me another server, and our server, Jinho for making up for the lack of another. Minus two stars for the rude server that treated us cold as winter.
Guido's Bar & Grill=Absolutely unimpressed.The frat boys yelling and carrying on Saturday nights when I'm walking past don't make for good advertisements, guys, especially when one shouts, "Look at the fool with the fro" and points.  ugh.Still, I decided to give Guido's a shot.  I went for dinner after studying one night with some friends.The waitress was polite but chronically forgetful, and had to be asked multiple times for anything from water to silverware to condiments.  The burger was...okay.  The fries were disappointing.  The crab cakes were dry and icky.I'm not coming back.  And I'm certainly having my headphones in each time I pass the ever scintillating crowd on the weekends.This place seemed to be the fun college hang out bar. The place where the frat boys come to hang out and scan the ladies up and down. I, am not a frat boy. I did not come here to hit on ladies. I felt old here. Though the bartender was nice and offered some suggestions to my friend on where he could meet some ladies to hook up with. Mercifully, I got to go back to the hotel and get myself to bed.guidos has really good french fries. REALLY REALLY GOOD. like sneak them off your husband's plate when he's in the bathroom even though you already have your own good......but remember all those people you hated in high-school? the ones you figured would join a fraternity or sorority to try and legitimize the fact that they are drunk, mentally disturbed, and semi-literate? remember how you thought they'd all still be acting like jack-asses in their thirties? well, you were right, and i promise you, they are hanging out at guidos right now with five hundred of their best friends.
Pita Jungle=Since I'm a regular at this location of the Jungle lately, I only feel it fair to review this one too... (I reviewed the Indian School location back in January).This Jungle is still one of our regular restaurants on the rotation - it's cheap, healthy, casual, and huge portions.  Still consistent and I've never had a bad meal at any of the jungles.  I pretty much order the macro platter every visit, but on occasion I'll mix it up with a salad, wrap, or pizza.  Most recently, I really mixed it up since I was feeling adventurous.  I ordered us an appetizer of 1/2 hummus and 1/2 garlic dip.  I really liked it!    The texture was smooth and it went well with both the pita and cucumbers we requested.  Call me crazy, but I mixed it up even more and ordered the spinach pasta salad and added tofu to it for my entree - and again, delicious!  As a matter of fact, so good that I didn't even add my normal squeeze of sracha sauce!If you haven't been to Pita Jungle, go soon - don't expect a fancy schmancy place; just go in with moderate expectations for good food that comes in big portions.  Speaking of big portions, I'm off to eat my leftovers... :)I'm moved to write a limerick instead of a haiku...this time:)        We stopped at the Jungle at lunchtime,     The Hummus and Schwarma were both fine,     The food is all scrumptious,     The service is bumptious,     All in all, though, we had a good time:)I just noticed that I wrote an entire limerick without a single reference to Nantucket...a first for me:)A solid 4 stars:)
Guy Savoy=I ate at Guy Savoy in Oct 2006. The overall feeling is modern and spare; furniture is plain and functional. This is the kind of style I tend to like, but somehow I didn't find it attractive.    Service was friendly and efficient.  The restaurant is managed by Guy Savoy's son Frank.  He seemed to be everywhere, introducing himself to guests and always making sure that things were running smoothly.  There was always someone nearby to take care of my every need.Before the meal, there were a number of items.  First, an amuse bouche: a fingernail sized sandwich of thin slices of toast and foie gras, meltingly rich.  Excellent!Sometime around this point, I ordered dinner - the 10 course Menu Prestige, with bread pairings for each course.  While I was digesting all of this information, some additional amuses bouche (if that's how you make it plural) arrived: a potato cake, a piece of quail breast, and a third item I forgot to write down.  All were very good.A little while later, yet another amuse bouche arrived:  a tiny cup of carrot and pumpkin soup, with fennel, bacon, and popped wild rice.  It was very good, and came with a surprise.  The cup was actually two cups, fused together.  One cup held the soup, the other cup was upside down.  When I was finished with the soup, I lifted the two cup combo off the plate, and under the upside down cup was a little pumpkin risotto.  It was even better than the soup.I'd been eating for at least a half hour, but now the meal officially began.  The courses were:    * Oyster in Ice Gelee.  Good briny flavor. Paired with seaweed bread.    * Tomato Tartar, Young Vegetables and "Seaweed-Lemon" Granite.  In addition to chopped tomato, there were bits of micro green beans, egg white and yolk, yellow tomato puree, gelee, and other ingredients. Surprisingly good.    * Colors of Caviar.  Layers of: vinaigrette of caviar; cream of caviar; string bean puree; Iranian golden Osetra caviar; warm Saboyan. Each contributed strong flavor, although they masked the caviar just a bit.  Still, very good.    * Slow Cooked Wild King Salmon.  A nice piece of fish, with fennel, anise, and vegetables.  I should have taken more notes, as it was my favorite of the first four courses - very simple, but very tasty.    * Sauteed Baby Chanterelles, Prosciutto, Crisp Potato Galette and Snow Peas.  Paired with excellent bacon bread.  This was another complex dish, with a number of items in addition to those mentioned. Excellent; my favorite course.    * Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup, Toasted Mushroom Brioche with Black Truffle Butter.  The soup was creamy, with a pronounced artichoke flavor.  Four slices of truffle floated on top, along with equally sized slices of parmesan cheese.  Almost as good as the previous course.    * Degustation of Veal.  There were four different veal preparations; overall, very good.    * Selection de Fromages Affines.  I don't much care for fancy cheeses, and in any case wouldn't know what to order.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The cheese steward described the general categories (strong vs mild, cow vs sheep, etc).  He asked me my preferences, and made recommendations.  The entire experience was very relaxed and a lot of fun. Some that I tried:          o Aged Muenster. Aged to the point where it was soft and strongly flavored.  Very good!          o Goat Blue Cheese.  The cheese steward recommended this variety. Made from goat's milk, it was very unusual and very special; my favorite.          o Salers.  A firm cheese, not so strong.  Pretty good.    * palate cleanser.    * The Peach.  A peach half, with baked or fried shredded phyllo dough, and lavender ice cream.  The peach was flavorful, soft and chewy - an odd but pleasing combination.  The entire dessert sounds a bit strange, but was very good - one of my favorite non-chocolate desserts in recent memory.    * Chocolate Fondant, Crunchy Praline, Chicory Cream.  Layers of gianduja-like paste and chocolate ganache; very, very thick/dense. Cut a little piece of the dessert, and dip it in the chicory cream.  I'm having trouble giving a good description, but it was excellent!Still to come were mignardises - a few extra sweets to end the meal.  There was also some incredible lemon sage sorbet.  It tasted like solid lemon juice - overwhelmingly sour; I love this kind of stuff.This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas, second only to that at Joel Robuchon.  The food was excellent, the service was excellent, and just as importantly it was a lot of fun.  Given the prices, I'm not likely to return any time soon, but I'll remember my meal for a long time to come.The bill: the menu prestige is $290.  A small, quicker (90 minute) tasting menu is $190.  A three course la carte meal will run between $150 and $250.  To these prices, add drinks, tax and tip.  One nice touch: bottled water is free.I ate at this establishment on November 10th, 2007.  I know about Chef Guy Savoy (Pronounced Gee- Sa-Vuah).  I know about his restaurants in Paris, France and all the accolades he has received.  Including having received three Michelin Stars.  This restaurant in Las Vegas is his first restaurant here in the U.S.A. It is located on the second floor of the Augustus Tower at the Caesar's Palace Hotel and Casino.With all this in mind, I decided what the heck, let's see if this guy, Guy Savoy, is all he is cracked up to be.  When I arrived, all I saw was two gigantic doors leading into the restaurant.  As I neared the door, a beautiful young woman opened the door and greeted my friend and I.  They ushered us into the cocktail lounge and asked if we wanted to have a cocktail while we waited.  Since I had planned on having the Chef's tasting menu with the wine pairings, I opted to wait for my table.  The decor was very simple yet elegant.After a few minutes of waiting, our table was ready.  They asked if we wanted to have some wine or a cocktail.  I informed them that we were going to enjoy the Chef's Tasting Menu-which is called, "Menu Prestige" with the wine pairings.  It almost seemed like the waiter, some guy with a french accent, got a smirk on his face.  He then asked if we had any time constraints.  Time constraints?--are you kidding me.  "Uh, no.  We don't have any time constraints.  We are here to enjoy this dining experience to the fullest."  He said, "Excellent, then we shall begin."It was at this point when our three (3) hour dining experience began.   Okay, let's move on to the good stuff---the food.  They started the meal with a tiny little skewer with bread and Foie Gras, their AmuseBouche. First of all, if you go here.  When they walk the little bread cart to your table you will be overwhelmed with the different varieties of bread you can get.  Ignore all of it and just ask for the Bacon Bread.  It is to die for.  The only other place I have ever had bacon bread was at Joel Robuchon at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino here in Las Vegas as well--that's another review.Here is what we ate:Oysters in Ice Gele-- (A good way to start the meal.  It was very flavorful a nice little bite)   Hamachi Carpaccio, Golden Oscetra Caviar, Cauliflower, Caviar Sabayon-- (The Hamachi was awesome and the flavors interacted with each other nicely, it wasn't over the top)Maine Lobster, Carrots, Orange and Star Anis-- (they served this and added some sauce on our plate as they were explaining what it was-It truly was something else.  I can't say I have ever had anything like this.  The flavors melded perfectly)  John Dory with a Crust of Walnut and Chive, Watercress and Salsify, Roasted Jus-- (This is a fish that is not commonly found on menus. Not very easy to get.  Nonetheless, we had it here and it was beautifully prepared.  I am not a big fan of Watercress but it worked well with this dish--truly impressed)Roasted Foie Gras "en Cocotte", Cardamom Infused Duck Bouillon, Glazed Chestnuts and Galette Grand Caraque--(Foie Gras--I am getting hungry just writing about it--In one word, Awesome)Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup, Toasted Mushroom Brioche, and Black Truffle Butter ( I did not expect the soup to taste as good as it did.  The presentation was good with Black Truffle and Parmessan Cheese Shavings on the top)Poussin   la Broche , Black Truffle, Fingerling Potatoes and Chanterelles--(This was a roasted chicken. They brought out the entire chicken for us to see, presentation was nice. The taste was simple, as simple as you can get with Black Truffle, but so good) Slection de Fromages Affins-- (We got to choose from a variety of different cheeses.  In the end, we had a little bit of every single cheese. You could truly taste the quality of the cheeses)Pear--( This was a dessert of items made out of Pear. Pear Sorbet and Roasted Pear. It wasn't too sweet. It was just right and the pear wasn't overly cooked it was still crisp)Chocolate Fondant, Crunchy Praline, Chicory Cream--(Speaks for itself) After this, they brought out a cart with some Petit Fours and different kinds of sweets. I enjoyed a rasberry lollipop made in house. I had to ask for another one it was that good.The food was truly exceptional. The service was just as good. I noticed that Franck Savoy, the Chef's son, who happens to run the place was actively participating in serving and making us feel at home. I have to admit, I was a little surprised to see, "the Boss", working and not just pointing his finger and bossing his people around. This told me a lot about the philosophy of this particular restaurant. Did I mention, they were just awarded two (2) Michelin Stars for this restaurant this month. A very huge accomplishment--they are one of only three restaurants with two stars in Las Vegas. I have pictures of the plates and a copy of the menu. Email me if interested. Very Expensive but worth it!I'm not sure why I've hesitated writing this.  I just adore Franck Savoy, Guy's darling son.  He runs the restaurant with his wife, but I've not had the opportunity to meet her yet.  One of the culinary highlights of our life in Vegas was dinner here -- sadly, it wasn't with my husband but with my Mother (who adored every sip, every taste) -- but I look forward to returning with my husband just the two of us.  We went one night after a show, in hopes of simply enjoying a perfect glass of champagne in the bar since it was so late -- but instead, we were treated to -- yep - a fully comped tasting menu with seemingly bottomless glasses of champagne.  Such a surprise -- and such a delight -- every bite.  The evening's only ? was having to deal with Paris Hilton and Cris Angel who wouldn't stop smoking in the bar -- they were attending Elton's birthday party in the PDR but for some reason thought leaving the party was appropriate...oh well. The original Maitre d' at Spago Hollywood, Bernard Erpicum originally officiated over the champagne bar -- the tales he can tell -- and he's known my husband for years, so we were well cared for.  Since then, however, Bernard has moved on and is now at Aureole, if memory serves.  I've been a fan of Monsieur Savoy's since my first trip to Paris twenty years ago.  So having him come to Vegas now so regularly, and having the opportunity to visit (damn, I wish my French was better) with him, instead of simply being another mouth to feed, is a dream come true.  He should be so proud of Franck, who's such a talent, such a lovely host.  But mostly I love how good he is to my husband and that he regularly dines at my husband's restaurant so that the two of them can visit.  We wish them all the best -- and look forward to many meals with them for years to come.The evening of May 7th, 2009 will be one I will remember forever! It was the night of the Master's Series Dinner at Restaurant Guy Savoy. One of the kick off events of Vegas Uncorked. The evening started with Champagne and some of those little Foie Burgers I loved so much my first visit. I was soon escorted to my table and introduced to my tablemates; Angelo and fellow yelper, Mary Ellen. I am so used to dining solo that I had almost forgotten how enjoyable intelligent and humorous conversation can be. Thanks guys! Now on to the food. 1st Course Asparagus Soup with Fried Asparagus. Just a nice small treat to begin the evening. 2nd Course Lobster Raw "Cooked" in Cold Steam. Sweet Carpaccio of Lobster was served on a vented plate that hid some dry ice. When a Soy based sauce was poured over the Lobster, "steam" rose through the vents. Quite a show! Served with Veuve Ciiquot Rose Champagne. 3rd Course Turbot with Black Pepper Sabayon and Young Leeks. Mild, delicate fish, with a nicely spiced, peppery sauce and sweet grilled leeks. Paired with a 2007 Chateau La Nerthe Blanc. 4th Course Cannons of Vegetables Stuffed with Escargots, Mushrooms, Herbs, Mushroom Emulsion. This dish looked beautiful. The Vegetables were wonderfully cooked and sweet. The Mushroom emulsion was deep earthy and full of Mushroom flavor, but the stuffing didn't really excite me. The Escargots should have been the star, but really got lost in the other components of the stuffing. Served with a 2006 Newton Unfiltered Chardonnay. 5th Course Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup. This is a classic Savoy dish and was just as good as I remembered! Served with a 2006 Domaine Chandon Pinot Noir. This was my favorite pairing of the evening. 6th Course Truffle Loin of Veal, Black Truffle Potato Puree, Spring Vegetables. Perfectly cooked, decadently studded with Truffles. The potatoes were so good they reminded me of Robuchons. Served with a 2005 Ceretto, Bricco Asili, Barbaresco. 7th Course White Sphere A white chocolate sphere that, when a sauce was poured over revealed a hidden raspberry mousse. Quite an impressive show. Paired with a 2004 Domaine de Coyeux, Muscat de Beaumes de Venise. 8th Course The Famous Dessert Cart! One of the high points of the night was the opportunity to meet Chef Guy Savoy himself! This was an amazing evening of food, wine and friendship.After 3 times in this Gastronomic Temple Finally I get the top PRESTIGE MENU (($290) sounds a lot of money but believe it's worth it! this was a Solo Experience my table was ready and this is the story of Sunday October 4 8:30 pm when the amazing doors opened I saw Franck Savoy with his charm and elegance then in my table the amuse bouche was a little burger and a foie gras sandwich AMAZING, the champagne cart just arrived so I started with Rosé ($22) when the menu was shown I decided for the prestige with has the most famous signature dishes of Master Chef Guy Savoy So what to do? go for it!!!! Alain Alpe was my server very efficient and pro! the Prestige began! 1) Oyster in Ice Gelee fantastic fresh oyster perfect with the rosé 2) Lobster Salad I loved it! fantastic fine delicious raw cooked 3)Crispy Sea Bass for me this was the star of the night the flavour of vanilla balanced with the spices makes a superb experience 4) Foie-gras en papillote very good but I prefer terrine foie 5) Artichoke and black truffle soup I tried it many times but this one was the best and the brioche I take a little piece of it and dunk it in the soup WOW amazing!!! At this point I asked for a glass of Bordeaux Margaux was fantastic ($35) 6)Roasted Veal Chop I like it the black truffle potato purée adds a lot to the veal they presented before being carved very nice touch! 7)Fromages AH!!!! if you love french food you love french fromages so the server Adrian made a fantastic selection of firm cheese including Beaufort Comte I enjoyed it a lot. 8) Coconut in six ways it was nice but I love chocolate so the next one was the star 9)Chocolate fondant same as in Paris fine exquisite delicate balanced simply quite PERFECT!!! ONE OF THE BEST EXPERIENCES IN MY LIFE AFTER ALL $510 WORTH IT I Drank 3 glasses of Rosé and the BordeauxFull review in Blog.  Some highlights below.Arriving approximately 15 minutes early at The Palace I made my way to the Augustus Tower and took some pictures before entering the restaurant - doors held open for me by a pair of young ladies and greeted - literally - by Mr. Savoy, a bright smile, and a "Doctor U. I presume?"  Somewhat taken aback by such a warm greeting I confirmed my name and shook the managers hand before being escorted to my table in the main dining room.With my menu presented and myself settled in for a great experience the meal began with a pair of Canapes - both signature trademarks of Guy Savoy's restaurant both here and overseas.  The first dish, entitled "French club" consisted of alternating layers of duck foie gras, truffles, and brioche - now that is how you start a meal.  No bigger than the distal part of my thumb the dish was excellent with the buttery bread and earthy truffle providing the first flavor and fragrance but later giving way to the intensely creamy foie gras that lingered on the palate it its signature manner.  Without trying to sound too gluttonous I could've (and would've) eaten at least 50 of these given the chance.  Kicking off the official portion of the tasting menu I was brought a dish entitled Mosaic of Milk Fed Poularde, Foie Gras, Artichoke with Black Truffle Jus (Bread pairing Toasted Country Bread.)  Featuring layers of pounded and roasted chicken that was on par with the version at The French Laundy interspersed with creamy and unctuous moularde duck foie gras and a pureed artichoke the dish was one of the best mixed terrines I've ever tasted with the creamy foie, savory chicken, and smooth artichoke each standing separate yet also blending effortlessly to form a uniform taste that somewhat resembled mushroom - all of this was of course brought to an even more potent effect by the addition of a salty and earthy jus that tasted like the very essence of a black truffle and clung to the palate.  Pairing well with the warmed bread I spread each bite thin and savored this dish a great deal.Extremely happy with the meal thus far I was next greeted by one of Monsieur Savoy's most famous dishes - the Colors of Caviar (Bread pairing Plain Ciabatta.)  A multilayered "parfait" of sorts this dish was described at length but essentially consisted of multiple layers of caviar - a chilled caviar creme, a hot egg caviar sabayon, a caviar gelee, a smooth and salty green bean puree,  and a thick layer of cool Ossetra egg - eaten with a mother of pearl spoon.  Instructed to eat bites of each layer all at once I dug into the dish slowly and let the amalgam dissolve slowly in my mouth; unreal.  While I cannot say what the exact overarching flavor of the dish was, the feel of the dish was tremendous with a progression of flavors, textures, temperatures, and densities - a true "study" of the food.  Interestingly because of its presentation each bite actually offered a different sensation and progression due to the way the concoction came out on the spoon.  At $90 (off menu price) this is the most expensive single dish I've ever tasted and had it not been on the menu I'd likely not have indulged - but I'm certainly glad I did.  The bread served with this dish was clearly meant to do nothing but allow the caviar to shine - a plain and boring ciabatta that I tasted and discarded the rest of.Diverting from the classics to something I love the next dish was Radis-Foie, or Foie-Gras "en Papillote" and Radish Bouillon (Bread pairing Caramelized Onion Ciabatta.)  Having had my first truly amazing cooked Foie a few weeks earlier at Blackbird (a roasted prep) and L2O (first seared then roasted and served in a cotton candy shell) I was very intrigued by this dish and its novel method of preparation - first seared and then cooked not-exactly "en Papillote" or parchment, but rather steamed in sherry vinegar with pink and white radishes in a plastic bag which is presented tableside before being opened up and returned to the kitchen for plating.  Shying away from traditional accoutrements like fruit and nuts the kitchen at Guy Savoy instead chooses to temper their foie with bitter as opposed to sweet utilizing the bitter radish leafs and mild yet spicy radishes to further balance the foie's characteristic unctuous and buttery body.  While I personally love the majority of sweet Foie Gras preparations I've experienced I have to say this prep was an eye opener for me and a true showing of Guy's brilliance.  Speaking later with the Chef du cuisine during my tour of the kitchen it was actually this dish that garnered the majority of our discussion - apparently the use of bitters and spices to temper the liver is much more commonplace in France and Italy than in the United States due to their larger consumption of the dish and "American's have a sweet tooth."  While I'll not argue with my love of sweets I will say that this dish is one of the best Foie Gras preps I've had.As good as it gets. You may have heard of this place, but it's the only location in the US outside of France. It's run by Guy Savoy's son Franck at the Vegas location. The decor is simple, warm and inviting. But all the effort goes into the food. Sat in the bubble bar area near the fireplace. It's very casual here. The chairs are so small and delicate, I kept slipping off. Maybe it was the wine. In any case, tasted a few of the appetizers and it's divine. The restaurant does feature a really cool dining area inside the kitchen. It's glass encased, so you can see the chef and the cooks at work. There's also a Krug Champagne room. Back to the menu: It's all about tastings, small plates enough for one bite. From the signature artichoke and black truffle soup to spiced crispy sea bass the flavors are well balanced and textured. I felt like a judge on Iron Chef. There is a 10 course Menu Prestige which is probably going to cost you what some people pay in rent. You can take a different route though and choose items from the a la carte menu. There is also a dessert cart that comes after you're done eating. It's all in little portions including the much talked about pudding in a jar. Bon Appetit listed this place one the country's hottest restaurants.***First of all: This was the best meal of our lives.*** I would give it six stars, if allowed to. It was also one of the most expensive (by quite a bit).My wife and I had eaten at Guy Savoy's original restaurant in Paris and thoroughly enjoyed it, so we had high hopes for the Las Vegas location. This location is in Caesar's Palace and is supervised by Guy's charming son. It is located in a quiet part of the place with an understated dining room from which a perfect view of the "Eiffel Tower" at Paris, Paris may be seen. It is oddly transporting in that bizarre Vegas sort of way. The seating density is VERY low, which is great. When loud talkers wearing gold chains and other bling chat, you really cannot hear them. The clientele is a mixture of gauche high rollers, foodies, and special occasion sorts.Quality and service here are impeccable. The meal starts with the champagne cart which has a dozen offerings by the glass. Where we live, you are lucky to find a basic champagne by the glass, much less an assortment of top tier houses. The bread cart has a dozen and half kinds of bread from walnut bread to a seaweed bread. There are two kinds of butter from Normandy: a salted and unsalted version.The menu is organized as a tasting menu or one may order ala carte. We chose ala cart and ordered three course, which included Guy's famous black truffle and artichoke soup. Everything was without flaw AND filled with passion.All well and good, but the service was the best part. Guy Savoy has the most gracious staff ever. If I had asked "what is chicken?", they would have immediately described it with no hint of talking down to the guest. Everyone was immensely kind and helpful, while staying professional. They also were invisible when they should be invisible and somehow present when they should be present. Half empty butter holders disappeared and were replenished without any disturbance in our conversation. All together impressively seamless. Guy's son watches over the well trained staff and visits each table with warm and genuine care.We were quite full after our three courses and decided to just have an espresso, passing on dessert. Our espresso was accompanied by three more gratis courses of sweets, including a cart of candies, pastries, ice creams, etc., then petit fours. This was the continuation of a pattern of several gratis mini-courses during the meal.As we departed, we were presented a beautifully packaged box of house-made chocolates. The bill was huge, BUT it was worth every penny. The value was there. If a person is planning on seeing a show in Vegas and getting great seats, you would pay about as much. Why not try a world-class restaurant for a few hours. You'll be amazed.I dislike this place and will never recommend it to anyone. Fine dining to me involves 1) Unique wonderful food 2) Immaculate service - this is why you pay so much more, which is why it's called fine dining.If you look, I usually like to only review places I LIKE. So people will go there. Why waste time to help advertise places I do not like. This is an exception.Here is the gist, my friend had left because she was hung over. She had ordered bread from the cart, prior to leaving. I did not. So she got her food in a box and left, while myself and 4 other friends stayed for the rest of the dinner. While we were enjoying our entrees I was eating HER bread. The bread was wheat bread, and I admit, was delicious. So the waiter (whom french accent sounded super unauthentic) seeing that she left, comes over to clean up and remove her place setting - which is normal. He reaches over and grabs the plate with the bread on it, which was next to me. I tell him "No no leave the bread, I am eating it". Now, what is the common sense  thing to do, if you were the waiter?Think about it... Common sense?!?!Answer: You put the plate down!!! walk away and let the customer enjoy the bread! Right????You do not even need to say anything, but of course, instead of doing this, he spoke back in condescending tone "But monsieur, that is the ladies bread" as if I broke some sort of natural law- Is it really unacceptable for me to eat someone else bread?If the same situation occurs at any other restaurant, I can *almost* guarantee you they will put the plate down and would probably even be glad to do so. So he grabs the plate (with my hand on the plate as well!) and said "I will bring you another bread". I totally recall thinking... Why is he arguing with me? So he takes off with the plate and this was when I was not too happy. He did come back with bread, but it was NOT the same type!! Obviously, I am not going to make call him out because it is not the same kind of bread but this added to my fury!!!!Alright, because this happen with bread, you may say "it's only bread" Well, lets substitute this situation with say.. soup. Your friend leaves so you are enjoying their clam chowder which was ordered. The waiter comes over to deny you of it, even though you ask to leave it there. He brings you a new bowl of soup, however when it arrives, its some cream of broccoli. I know most of you would say something about the soup!Anyways the food.. I ordered the Kobe Beef. I had six ounces of it, its sold by the ounce. It was not good. The above incident occurred during the main course, so I stopped eating. Left a couple ounces on the plate and did not allow anyone to touch it. Another one of my friend saw I was upset and so she said something to the manager (or owner, not sure) and he provided complementary glass of wine to everyone. I made sure nobody drank the wine they gave me. I do not need this crap and you do not either, hundred of places in Vegas to have a great dining experience. I walked out upset. it maybe a funny story with my friends and I now but at the moment, I was Pissssssed.Never again!Breakdown: 1-star for the manger who did something. 0 star of everything else.Guy Savoy was impressive, very impressive.  I have not even eaten here, but it does not really matter.  Guy Savoy is hospitality personified.  I came here for one reason, Krug.  I had called to see if a reservation was required to have some bubbly at the Bubble Bar (where they poured Krug by the glass) and was told that it was not necessary and that they look forward to having us.  When we arrived, we were told that the Bubble Bar was sold out for the evening.  The hostess was quite gracious and apologetic when I told her about the phone conversation I had regarding reservations.  She suggested we talk to the manager and then guided us to the restaurant.  I approached the manager who was at the front desk, informed him of the situation and without hesitation, he led us to their private patio. It was beautiful and romantic. The manager served us personally. He brought us two glasses of Krug and surprised us with three canapes.  They were delicious.  This is the mark of a great restaurant.  We were in Vegas, we wanted an experience at Guy Savoy, and without hesitation or pretense, they gave me exactly what I wanted and more. I will be back in a month or so to have dinner, I cannot wait.This restaurant is not like the other...Guy Savoy in Paris is an experience!  Unfortunately Guy Savoy in Las Vegas is just a meal, and an expensive one to boot.The ungracious experience begins as you walk through the doors and are barked at by the host and hostess who do not have the courtesy to allow guests to fully enter the doors before immediately questioning you about reservations.  The gate guards may not let you through without them. The entry is inviting as is the bar and lounge where a lovely fireplace glows.  Unfortunately, the dining room is severe and leaves much to be desired. The environment is not only cold, but is also quite stark with the feel of a dingy New York loft apartment on a gloomy day.  The high ceilings give the room a cavernous, mine shaft effect and the restaurant has no music whatsoever.  The lack of ambiance and music leave nothing but the waiters and food as your stage for enjoyment.  Unfortunately, the stress of the service afflicts and burdens the staff which, in turn, creates a stressful meal for the patrons.  I have enjoyed two splendid meals at Guy Savoy in Paris and was truly excited to experience this restaurant, without having to take an international flight.  While the recipe's remain authentic, the experience is not one I never ever wish to repeat.  Our dinner for 2, all in including tip was over $800. This was without an expensive bottle of wine but with wine pairings, by the glass, poorly executed and selected by our "deer in headlights" sommelier.Dear Mr. Guy Savoy, I am heartily disappointed.  Perhaps it is time to take a greater hand in your US representation.  The meal, the experience, the dining room and ESPECIALLY the service were a complete miss - I should have NEVER gone here and should have gone right to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel to dine in Twist by Pierre Gagnaire.  My two reviews of the Paris Guy Savoy depict a truly wonderful experience that was totally worth every penny spent. This was not.An award winning dining experience that will leave you sated and infinitely satisfied!As soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the restaurant manager who proceeded to lead us to our seats by the window. Located inside the newly erected Augustus tower of Caesar's Palace, the restaurant embraced a contemporary elegance that was refined yet simple and unfussy.  With warm tones from the rich wood panels, ceilings that soared high up, and large glass paneled windows with a peek a boo view of the Bellagio fountains, the ambiance was nothing less than magnificent!  The sommelier was helpful and knowledgeable as he started us with some bubbly and as soon as I saw a bottle of vintage Krug, I knew I was in for a treat!The server was equally friendly and suggested The Chef's Signature Tasting Menu, which showcased the restaurant's acclaimed dishes.  Frankly, It goes without saying I went with the chef's signature tasting menu.  When in Rome, right folks?Amuse BouchesFoie gras with black truffleCrisp toastettes pierced together with creamy smooth foie gras and irresistible black truffle was a decadent play of flavors and textures in the mouth. Parmesan waffleLight fragrant and perfectly crisp and a delightful start to a sumptuous meal.Cold zuchini soup with diced Radish & celery seed powder - very refreshing with a pleasant bite from the diced radishesFingerling potatoes with cream cheese and ham and topped with watercress. A charming little surprise that came with the cold zucchini soup.  This accompaniment rounded out our amuse plates wonderfully but something was telling me it probably wasn't the last surprise of the evening!First CourseHeirloom tomatoes wedges with watermelon and tomato gelee - refreshing and vibrant! the addition of the frozen tomato added just enough saltiness to the sweet heirloom tomatoes and the addition of the crisp basil was surprisingly delightful!Surprise #2 A tomato tartar topped with a pomegranate gelee and  basil drops was lightly flavorful and beautifully plated.2nd dishColors of caviar - elegant and perfectly composed with layers of complex flavors and rich textures that paired beautifully with the champagne and meant to be savored slowly3rd dishFish with ratatouille - Perfectly cooked, and the fish was imported from the southeast of France...Si Bon! Presented with its natural jus foam, the flesh was supple and soft to the touch with my fork. The ratatouille added the perfect amount of rustic flavor to this light yet incredibly flavorful fish4th dishFoie Gras - Considering its recent ban in California, I have found my new mecca for foie gras...Vegas baby! Served with a side of duck jus in a shot glass steeped in chopped fresh beets, green tea with crispy rice, the foie gras was absolute perfection. It was decadently rich and the orange zest cleansed the palate perfectly! Without a doubt, one of my favorite dishes of the evening!5thBlack Truffle Soup - served with a warm buttery brioche that tasted like a flaky pastry. We were encouraged to dip the brioche into the velvety smooth soup. Infused with an incredibly rich depth of flavor imparted from the black truffle shavings and Parmesan flakes, this well composed soup was absolutely sublime and left my taste buds dancing long after i finished it!6th dishFilet mignon tenderloin with bone marrow was simply exquisite. The filet was insanely tender and very flavorful. The bone marrow that topped the filet was buttery soft and paired nicely with the filet. The shoulder cut of beef wrapped in delicate ribbons of carrot exhibited a briny flavor that added an earthy element to the dish, as well.DessertsDessert Amuse Bouche - Apricot sorbet and with diced apricot. Tart, refreshing, and an excellent palate cleanserCoconut 6 ways - An splendid little dessert with an interesting mix of textures that made it a sheer joy to eat!Chocolate ganache with praline cream. Divine & a chocolate lover's dream come true!Everything ended with a citrusy sorbet with creme fraiche as a final palate cleanser...But our sweet journey didn't end there!  A large dessert cart was then rolled out for us to choose to our heart's content. We went with a variety of the server's tempting suggestions and then came the cheese cart! Seriously, the dinner lasted over 3 hours, but i hardly felt the time pass because i was enjoying myself so much!At the end of the meal, we were greeted by the chef and left with complementary muffins to enjoy the following morning.In short, the wait staff was kind courteous and very informative. Food was brought out at a very good pace and we never felt rushed or felt like we waited forever between dishes.I would highly recommend Guy Savoy for any special occasion. It will leave you with an unforgettable experience that you will cherish for years to come.Happy Eats!We had an exchange student from France at our high school whose favorite top compliment was "formidable!"  You'd have to hear her say this with her delightful accent.  For my meal at Guy Savoy, I often thought of Christelle and silently said "formidable!"I got the Signature Menu, a multi-course meal of wonderfully prepared and plated food.  Dinner started with what could be called 3 amuse-bouches although only one was called the amuse-bouche.  Shortly after getting comfortable, a server brings you a metal skewer of foie-gras with black truffle.  In a bit, you're brought another morsel, a 2 piece waffle with parmesan cheese.  Then the "official" amuse-bouche arrives.  It's a small cup of zucchini soup with some pine nuts.  You brush the nuts into the soup.  My server, Kriste, suggested I check under the cup when I was done for something else.  Sure enough, there was a small piece of pork belly to enjoy when the main part was finished.The first course was the chestnut course.  There was chestnut purée, small whole chestnuts, sliced mushrooms, and chestnut soup.  It was marvelous.  I haven't eaten chestnuts since I was a teen.  The second course was called the Colors of Caviar--layers of caviar in different forms topped by a layer of caviar sabayon.  A server suggested inserting the flat spoon all the way down and getting some of each layer.  Very nice!During this time, I had one piece of lemon bread from the bread cart.  You're automatically brought two pieces of bread after being seated and I didn't want to fill up on bread.  I have to go again and try the sea weed bread.  They had a very nice selection.Course three was whole stuffed red mullet.  The head of the fish was discretely covered by a leaf of cooked spinach. The fish was stuffed with very thinly sliced mushrooms and spinach.  It was extraordinary!Course four was Foie-gras with a bitter infusion.  They bring a glass tea pot with a candle to your table.  In the tea pot, green tea is placed and consomée is added.  The foie-gras is prepared in the kitchen as the infusion heats.  Then the foie-gras arrives and the infusion is poured around the dish.  You're all given a small glass of the infusion to enjoy after each bite.  The foie-gras was perfectly seared on top.Course five was artichoke and black truffle soup served with a toasted mushroom brioche with black truffle butter.  The soup is completely water based--no cream or stock.  It's amazing how much flavor comes from the ingredients with just water!Course six was beef tenderloin (with bone marrow on top)--done according to your wishes when you order your meal--with a carrot paleron cannelloni.  The beef was so tender and flavorful. The carrot cannelloni was quite tasty and a very clever concept.Course seven was the cheese course.  There were many options on the cheese cart.  The cheeses were described very thoroughly.  I chose roquefort, a milder cheese from the Savoie region of France, and a more liquid, more full flavored cheese from the Loire Valley.  The plating is done in a way that the cheeses go from mildest to strongest or the other way around depending on where you start.  There's more bread here.  I got two slices, one of a fruit bread and one a nut bread.Then came a palate cleanser of chopped blackberry with fresh apple pieces and a small spoon of cinnamon crumb cubes.Course eight was the first dessert--Coconut six ways.  I can't remember all the ways but there was coconut soup, coconut granité, coconut soup, coconut tapioca, fresh coconut slices and one I don't remember.  Delightful!Course nine was the second dessert--chocolate fondant, crunchy praline, and a chicory cream.  Rich chocolate, a tasty cream to dip your fondant in, and the crunchy praline was superb!  A great ending--almost.Then the mignardises trolley was wheeled to the table.  There was such a large selection.  I made five choices, a stuffed grape, some jasmine marshmallow, a wonderful petit cheesecake, caramelized banana, and one other I don't remember.  I was on a food high!Service was extraordinary!  Kriste, the main server, was always attentive and there were two others.  Between the three, there was always an eye on my table to make sure I had anything I needed.  Near the end of the meal, Chef Chartron stopped by my table and introduced himself and asked about how the meal was.  This is always a nice touch.  Prior to dinner, Kriste gave me a tour of the restaurant including the Krug Room, one of only five in the world.  After dinner, she took me to the kitchen to speak with Chef Chartron and see the kitchen area.  Chef Chartron was working on a new menu and his chef's table had his papers on which he was writing his plans.  I found out there was a sub-kitchen two floors below and this is the finishing kitchen.  In summary, this was the most enjoyable meal I've had in Las Vegas.  Everything was exceptional--food, service, and surroundings!  This really deserves all five stars!***There are some great things about Guy Savoy like the lobster with beets in cold steam, the great service, and the nice dining room, but like other Las Vegas restaurants, it is very overpriced***Guy Savoy definitely reminds me of Joel Robuchon.  They both feature formal fine dining French cuisine from esteemed chefs and very expensive tasting menus and a la carte items as well as lavish bread carts and dessert trolleys.  The restaurants are quite different though.  Savoy has a minimalist and modern decor.  It feels much more elegant, comfortable and less distracting than the over-the-top and all over the place elegant decor at Robuchon.  Savoy also features much more personable service that is still professional and polite.In terms of the food, it is hard for me to compare Savoy to Robuchon because I had a few a la carte items at Savoy while I had a tasting menu with many, many courses at Robuchon.  In terms of bread, Robuchon is better.  Both feature a wide variety of bread, but I felt Robuchon's bread had better textures as well as much more distinct flavors (Robuchon's bread was warmer and felt fresher too).Robuchon's dessert trolley is significantly better than the one at Savoy.  Robuchon's lavish dessert trolley is an extravagant and over-the-top movable feast of sweets while Savoy is more of a small selection sweets on a nice tableside cart.  Variety is not the only reason why Robuchon is better.  The sweet treats at Robuchon have much better (and more interesting) flavors.In terms of the food, I had really good things at Robuchon and Savoy but nothing as good as what I have had at Bay Area fine dining spots like The French Laundry, Cyrus or Manresa.There were bright spots.  I really liked the lobster and jumbo lump crab with beets and cold steam from seaweed water.  There were great beet cups filled with creamy beet mousse and soft, fresh and moist crab.  There was also lobster carpaccio that was topped with minced golden beets; the beets had a great sweet flavor that was reminiscent of fruit.  There was also warm and nicely cooked lobster meat--fresh, moist and soft.There was even puff pastry topped with beet ribbons.  The finishing touch was great seaweed aroma from the cold steam that enveloped the food (cool effect and great fragrance).I also liked the mushroom brioche topped with black truffle butter.  The brioche was warm, buttery, crispy, and flaky (and the black truffle flavor was very prominent).  The accompanying black truffle and artichoke soup was just okay.The amuse of foie gras with brioche was good--rich, creamy and a great foie gras flavor.  The pumpkin soup amuse was good though surprisingly thin.Other courses were not as good.  The crab tart was just soggy and boring and I probably should have ordered the veal three ways as my entree.  They present the veal chop before they slice it and it was very nicely cooked--a great golden brown sear.My entree was a variety of game birds cooked in a pot.  The cooking in the pot yielded tender and moist meat, but there were no contrasts in textures so the meats were a little uninteresting.  I thought the pheasant was good.  I thought the squab was good too, but I prefer it when they achieve a crispy skin on squab.I was not a fan of the Mallard duck.  Like the squab, there was no crispy skin.  The flavor of the duck was very strong--interesting but not my favorite flavor.  The texture was off-putting.  The texture of the duck meat was squishy and a tad rubbery; it ended up being similar to the unique texture of squab.The garnishes were good though a tad rustic for such a fine dining spot.  There was some good sweet and sour cabbage and wild mushrooms.  There was also a nicely cooked, buttery and smooth foie gras.While the savory courses were a mix of good and average, I was not a fan of Savoy's desserts.  I ordered the coconut six ways and while I really liked the light and crispy coconut flakes and tapioca, I did not like the rest of the dish.  It was like various bland ingredients in water.The mignardises from the trolley were okay; the pate de fruit was kind of hard and overly sugared.  The dark chocolate ice cream was rich and good though and I liked the flavor of the earl grey sorbet with English cream and black pepper. As mentioned, service was good; prices were too high, but that is often the case with high-end Vegas restaurants.I did not love Robuchon, but I preferred it to Savoy.  There were some nice things about Savoy, but the food is just too expensive for just so many okay dishes.  I think your money would be much better spent on a dinner at an upscale Bay Area spot like Manresa.  If you do want a nice dinner in Vegas, I recommend the much more price friendly Picasso or L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (seasonal tasting menu).Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both free valet and self parking.Restaurant Guy Savoy serves French Cuisine & has 2 Michelin Stars. My love & I like French food, so we had to give it a try! "Restaurant Guy Savoy has been listed as one of the country's hottest restaurants by Bon Appetit, given a 3  1/2 (out of 4) star rating by Los Angeles Times food critic S. Irene Virbilla, called "the best restaurant in Las Vegas and one of the finest anywhere" by Newsweek and was a finalist for the James Beard Foundation's Best New Restaurant award." The ambience at Restaurant Guy Savoy was very intimate and romantic. The service was great, the staff was so pleasant, and the overall experience was very much enjoyable. We left all smiles and very satisfied, we even got a private tour of the Kitchen, and met with Guy Savoy's son. Splendid, Beautifully arranged Bread Carts for you to choose your freshly baked breads from.  Choice of unsalted or salted butter provided for you at the table. Amuse Bouche IFoie Gras  & Black Truffle Brioche Amuse II Parmesan Crusted WaffleAmuse III Soup w. a "surprise" underneath/ on the flip side. Special intricate attention was paid to everything they sent out. I thought the table set glasswares etc. were absolutely adorable! I'd like a set for myself! The colors were so subtle and elegant, and I loved the colored reflections off the glass. Pumpkin Soup Winter Flavor was delightful Steam Cod & Licorice Flavor- I must add that I am typically not fond of licorice, but found this dish quite nice. My love ordered a beautifully presented veal shank w. seasonal vegetables & potato puree that the server brought out to showcase to us prior to serving it. Dessert was Coconut served Six Ways --- so very pleasant & left me wanting more.  Posh Dessert/ Pastry Trolleys for us to choose from at the end of our meal served w. Coffee or Tea was very nice & tasteful! Overall, we had a great experience here, and plan to come here again. *On a side note, we receive Christmas/Happy New Year Cards from Restaurant Guy Savoy every year!This review is for my dining experience in January 2011Had the most amazing dining experience at Guy Savoy on a recent trip to Las Vegas. Not only is the food incredible, but the staff is attentive and they go out of there way to accommodate their guests. Don't feel like you have to order one of the tasting menus. You can get away with a selection of a la cart dishes, and be just fine. Some helpful hints if you're going to be splurging on a meal like this, that is of course assuming you're not accustomed to spending $400 per person on dinner). Oh, and if you want to see photos of everything we ate, so you know what you expect, you can see everything on my food website here: http://eatsporkjew.com/restaurants/guy-savoy-the-lost-art-of-storytelling/1.) don't plan on ordering dessert, and make sure you save room for it. As a "thank you" for dining at Guy Savoy, they roll out an entire dessert cart which has everything from cakes, to puddings, to mousses, to cookies, to ice cream, to candies, etc. And it's all complimentary and you can have as much as you'd like. 2.) Try to make a reservation on the earlier side of the evening. The reason for this is that you want to have access to all of their delicious fresh baked breads. They have a bread cart with a lot of different bread types, and apparently, their bacon bread is the most amazing carb-tastic bite you'll ever have. But they only make about 36 rolls a day, and they're not used to say "no" to their guests. By the time we got the bread cart for a 7:45pm reservation, all the bacon bread was gone. I wasn't too upset about this, but it's just something to think about. Believe me, you'll get plenty of delicious food to eat. 3.) If you're lucky, and I think you just need to ask, you can visit the kitchen and see the private dining table in the back. It was cool to do this. 4.) if you're a dinner party of two, order a la cart, and ask them to split each dish for serving. And this is a testament to how amazing the service is at a restaurant like this, but when they split the dishes, they actually serve you a little more of each one. A lesser restaurant would literally just split a single dish, and both people would miss out on the effect of a full plate with the fantastic presentation. Not at Guy Savoy!Michelin Stars #38-39Oh Vegas, such a perfect town for indulgence and gluttony. Guy Savoy (not pronounced how you'd think) was chosen as a nice special dinner for my wife and myself, for no reason other than to live it up. Being an old married couple and knowing dinner could be 3+ hours, we took the earliest reservation at 6pm. The space was grand and empty upon arrival and we were seated with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains to the south. The mostly white decor was only interrupted but the occasional ultra-bright piece of "art," all of which I loved. After a quick glance at the menu, the only option worth considering was the full Innovation menu with a shared wine pairing. And now on to the show!1. Foie and Toast Amuse: What's not to love about foie anything, truffles, and some crisp bread to add some texture. A perfect way to say hello while having your ear licked with taste.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#q-5nZctMRztBoHuzI-9IiA2. Waffle and Parmesan Amuse: Kind of a weird one but god damn if that wasn't one of the best bites of waffle I've ever had. Another wow bite. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#k-HfOiDwUHjQDk2yS_A-Ug3. The Bread Cart: Dude, they make this every single morning. I guess it's less impressive when you consider the small army of people in the bowels of these hotels that are there 24/7 doing everything. But somewhere down there is someone making over a dozen different types of artisanal bread just for Guy Savoy. We tried over half the selection over the course of dinner and they were all amazing and better.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#CeIpoN0mqYabwMCCuRhM2A4. Tomato Amuse:And the "ooos" and "aaahhs" just kept coming from us with this one. They must have made five or six different types of intricate tomato preparations just to combine into something that took two bites. Every area of tomato flavor was highlighted, from the sweet to the vinegar, and it was masterfully finished with a nibble of a tomato chip.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#kgqj-Czz4DtXuRe4HMI7wg5. "Concassé" of Oysters:Concasse is the French culinary word for crushed or ground up. Here it was a dish of oyster pieces topped with seaweed and an amazing lemon granite. Bite after bite was amazing, we couldn't get over how perfectly well the chopped oysters worked with the crunchy lemon ice. It was everything you could ever want from an oyster dish. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#gVFhIUDM1qU2dkxH3XxtsA6. Langoustine in Cold Steam:At this point we were sure they couldn't keep up with this level of amazing food, but they did and did so with one of the more over the top presentations I've seen;Click play - http://instagram.com/p/dsw_tpTRCa/Basically what you have here are two preparations of langoustine on a perforated plate, over a bowl of dry ice, that then has a nori broth poured into it creating the "steam" effect. What it really did do was to add a lovely and visible aroma to the place of amazingly delicate langoustine sashimi. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#HVKWHN7wRaciqzmZzUiHFw7.  Asparagus, Caviar and "Fresh" Cheese:The title of the dish pretty much gives it away. Though again, the presentation was beautiful, the flavors all wowed, and the cheese foam was closer to a meringue in texture. But hot damn, that was some damn fine caviar. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#5ubR8rXxh6w0WRwNHKzo2Q8. Salmon Iceberg:This is the first time I've ever had a chef "cook" something tableside on a block of dry ice;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#71j9M9W4E8w5KRyMX73O9wServed by head chef Mathieu Chartron, he graciously rattled off the thinking behind this unique preparation as he plated our ice cold salmon and proceeded to top it off with a very hot broth. The resulting hot/cold mixture was divine. Hard to say for certain if the dry ice treatment really did much, but it was very fun and ended in more oooos and aaahhs from us. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#wGN_mNDWyRB53ISlRUzaqg9. Lobster:I really need the before pic to show how this one played out. Basically a nice piece of lobster was presented with a few cylinder shaped veggies on the parameter. Then the servers went on to unwarp each of the veggie rolls and layer them atop the lobster, then topped it all with a wonderful smoked butter sabayon sauce. The result wasn't as pretty as the start, but the flavor combination worked its magic once again on us.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#3FQkZzS66MKZzfEnssoHkg***Second half of review is somewhere above or below this****REVIEW #400.Vegas' penultimate restaurant.  Hailing from Michelin three star pedigree, Restaurant Guy Savoy Paris, earning two on it's own before the Guide abandoned the city, is an experience to savor.  Dishes are innovative but prepared in a classic style (no molecular gastronomy or modernist cuisine) showing classic French refinement and restraint.  The progression of courses near perfect with the memory of a flavor from the previous dish enhancing or contrasting playfully with the next.  Beautiful plating with every ingredient contributing to the dish.  The ambiance, contemporary elegant.  The service, flawless but not stuffy.  A true Michelin star experience.Tip:  Opt for a multi course menu. The Innovation - Inspiration Menu ($348) is incredible.  Multiple amuses, ten innovative courses, and multiple desserts in a near perfect progression.  It features many of the signature dishes of the Paris restaurant including the incredible artichoke and black truffle soup.  Velvety smooth, rich from a touch of cream, brooding sweet vegetal flavor of artichokes perfumed by the unmistakable scent of shaved black truffle accented by shaved, aged parmesan.  A mushroom brioche spread with black truffle butter accompanies the soup.  Sensory overload.  Something more innovative?  Caviar with frozen celery root mousse.   A bite, the caviar flavor shines then a bite of the mousse, a hint of vegetal flavor then as the mousse thaws, an explosion of celery flavor that cleans the palette for the next bite.  Think drinking a frozen vodka shot.Dishes and menus are seasonal.  Be on the lookout for the "prestige" menus.  The current black truffle prestige ($420), outstanding.  A truffle prepared in many variations that it never gets boring.  From being the featured ingredient of an acidic winter marche salad to a background note in a duck consommé, sublime.Massive wine list with emphasis on France.  Very good vintage depth.  Very high Vegas resort pricing.  A cognac lounge features some of the rarest pours to be found including the 140 year aged Hardy Perfection and the ultra limited edition, Hennessy Ellipse.Only pet peeve, the restaurant should prohibit the use of mobiles and the taking of photos.  There is nothing more irritating than flashes going off in the dining room as guest take photos of their plate.A true foodie or balling out of control?  This place is for you.  Then again, if you consider a multi course menu in the Paris restaurant cost between €360 - €490 and the airfare another $6,500 ($1,000 supplement for Hawaii yeeps), you're getting 95 percent off.  What a bargain!!!This is one of the world's great restaurants. Yes it's expensive. If you have to choose between Guy Savoy and your rent, please pay your rent.  Also, don't let this be your first fine dining experience.  You'll never be able to calibrate dinner out again.  It would be much like flying premier or first class on your inaugural international flight. It becomes the standard you expect from all restaurants. We enjoyed the Innovation Tasting Menu and wine parings. Course after course of exquisite food. There were some things not to my liking such as the smoked quail. Using mesquite it's quite easy to over smoke the food even for the most skilled chef.  My palate was dented even though the course was paired with a stand out Cote Rotie.  However, the pan roasted quail was wonderful.You can view the Innovation Menu online.  Each course was meticulously prepared.  The food was outstanding.  I experienced flavor combinations that I could have never imagined.  Artichoke and black truffle.  Foie Gras and Quinoa with Bellota Ham infusion.  Sea Urchin and poached potato with lime and chili. Caviar with frozen pea mousse.  A5 Wagyu with some sort of savory sponge cake. Lobster with smoked butter sabayon.  The bread cart. Seaweed loaf. The simple baguette. Two butters were on the table along with flur de sel and cracked pepper. The cheese course was a treat. We were provided an accommodation of a little touch of Epoisses along with our ricotta herb menu item. I simply mentioned it and poof it happened. Desserts were fabulous. You can read about them elsewhere.  There is no other grade to give this restaurant other than a five.  It is fine dining. Service was attentive and professional. Not the typical French brigade. It was both formal and appropriately causal, pointedly professional but elegant and human. Staff was there to help and assist you enjoy the meal. Sommelier was knowledgeable and helpful.  Service was genuine not faux. If you are a foodie, prepare to become giddy.  Be sure your rent is paid in advance.Had the tasting menu here and enjoyed the presentation and taste of all the dishes. I found the cheese and dessert carts phenomenal! It was what I loved most about this restaurant as they had such a vast variety to choose from. However, I'm not sure if the masses can justify that it was "worth the money." Though I still constantly dream of the cheese cart and its superb selection of sweet accompaniments to enjoy with it.My husband and I came here for our anniversary a few weeks ago.  To be honest, I didn't think I'd be that stuffed at the end our meal due to some of the photos I saw on Yelp.  I was so so wrong.  We did the course menu that fit in best with our time.  We had a show to catch by 10 and our dinner was at 6.  What's great is that they ask you immediately if there are any time constraints you are under and let you know which course meals you should avoid.  The food was amazing.  Really.  Everything that came out was exceptional.  What made it even better was the service.  Everyone from the sommelier, the hostess and servers were top notch.  I'd love to return, and plan on coming back for another special night.Wowed by a first visit to Guy Savoy at Caesars Palace when Franck Savoy was still the man in charge, the reasons for a delayed return to the Augustus Tower temple of gastronomy are largely related to too little time and too much travel, but invited last minute to sit down for a few a la carte items after a particularly trying two-months and past 24 hours the timing proved perfect, nearly every bite absolutely superlative under the toque of Chef Mathieu Chartron.Still one of the most serene rooms in the city, the minimalistic art and white walls a strange departure from the more elaborate decorations found at the Paris namesake though the divided rooms and well adorned lounge reminisce of the space along the Seine, it was with Champagne and three signature canapes that the experience started, the bread cart soon parked tableside with no less than a dozen options from which to choose.Gilding supple loaves with smooth Echire butter that makes one regretful of times they have ever had to settle for less, it was with choices navigated that the night's amuse arrived - the newly hatched item straight from Innovation-Inspiration Menu thrilling with a creamy croquette of octopus and quinoa served atop a glass dome as the flavors of eggplant, capers, tomatoes, and peppers each came across full and robust alongside a plancha-finished tentacle clearly benefited by a previous slow poach and showy 'cold steam.'Progressing to starters there was clearly a differing focus between mine and the whims of my tablemate, yet as delicious as the seared slice of foie gras that I received was in a verbena broth reined in by the flavors of red cabbage it was my friend's salad that truly wowed both of us - the sizable bites of crustacean every bit as fresh as expected while the textural variations of vegetables and tapioca stabilized dressing were entirely enthralling, each bite offering something entirely different with the slightest bit of heat left to linger on each bite.Having debated the Dover Sole, but opining for other things in assuming the whole fish a bit much for two, a surprise visit from Chef Chartron saw us gifted two tasting-sized portions of the delicately roasted flesh and taking a path infrequently traveled by presenting the fish with pickled vegetables plus the bold taste of balsamic an entirely different side of a classic was seen, the light buttery notes  accentuated by the acid with just enough sweetness to offset a dusting of earthy mixed spice.Finding service a bit more serious than one might have preferred, particularly as we were seated in a side room separated from the majority of those present in the main dining area, entrees arrived paired to a second round of bread and with portions quite substantial it was here that my selection proved superior to that of my dining partner, the tender quails losing some of their definition amidst sabayon served straight from an eggshell and mushroom stuffed vegetables that trended a touch too bitter while rosy duck breast was succulence studded in peanuts, the crispy confit and stack of beets with cheese no less divine,Turning attention next to the cheese trolly, a somewhat limited selection that thankfully saw each option aged nicely along with honeycomb, blueberry confiture, and two additional varieties of bread it was with slow indulgence that a feature so rarely seen in Las Vegas was enjoyed and progressing to dessert with a long-lingering splash of Sauternes a second trolly was presented along with a pure-black plate entitled Noir, the dark chocolate fondant and sorbet dancing with a tinge of peppercorn while each of fifteen smaller sweets were as memorable as those from my first visit, the rice pudding perhaps the best in the city while the Vanilla Ice Cream rivals the best tasted to date.With world class ingredients and a Chef that continues to up the ante on top of a menu of classics that those unfamiliar are encouraged to experience if it is at all within their means, Guy Savoy remains one of Las Vegas' top tables for those serious about fine dining, though overly serious service at times fails to replicate the 'joie de vivre' seen at the flagship overseas.
Osteria Papavero=How have I not written a review about my favorite Italian place in Madison?  Probably didn't want to get the word out but looking at the reviews, it is definitely out.  Small, rustic, no pretense but serving great food and drinks.  While the items on the menu are solid (pappardelle with wild boar is always a fave), I really think the restaurant shines through their specials.  My last visit was during lunch and I had an incredible gnocchi with braised lamb leg.  The housemade potato gnocchi was soft and pillowy and paired well with the rich and hearty lamb. I love that the restaurant serves as a blank canvas to the food and diners that come eat here.  It is just as comfortable for a business lunch as it is for a romantic dinner.My new favorite!For those of you that are keeping score, Papavero stole the number one spot from my former fave, Nostrano.Every dish. Every single appetizer, entree, cocktail, and dessert that I have tasted here has been spectacular. There are roughly 12 daily changing specials written on the chalkboard. Many of those specials are fresh seafood - hard to come by in Madison. I would tell you to stick to the specials because they're so fun and different, but lately I've been grateful that the braised boar papardelle was on the menu so I could come back for more of it.One tip:Ask for an Amaro as a digestif after your dinner! Your server can explain what it is if you've never heard of it.Putting in to words how much I adore Papavero is about as hard as I imagine it is for a server there to remember the countless specials they rattle off (which rotate) nightly.But ya know what, they seem to get through it, and so will I. The primary reason I'm at Osteria Papavero several times a month is the fact that the place is consistent beginning, middle to end. Despite the resto being obscenely busy when I've tried to snag a table, someone is able to greet me and give me an anticipated wait time within moments of walking in the door. It's that level of attentiveness that starts the experience off on the right note. From there, it just gets better. Whether you have to sit at the bar and imbibe and snack before a table is ready, or if you're lucky enough to snag seats right away, the cocktail menu is a must before you even consider savories and wine to sip. Im pretty partial to the Bugado Bianco (Koval Levant spelt whiskey, Cinzano Bianco,Bitter Cube cherry bark vanilla bitters), crisp, clean and absolutely perfect any time of year. Their barrel aged Boulevardier is also stellar if you're looking for something a bit more spirit food. When it comes to food, don't even open your menu until your server describes the specials in chalkboard. The level of detail they go into as they cover each is so rich, you'll want to order them as a thank you for summarizing them so well. Because I don't dig lactose, I can't say whether or not the cream based dishes or cheese filled pastas are good, but if it's on the chalkboard and if it's mostly dairy free, I've eaten it and I've loved it! Inside the menu the Zuppa di Funghi is unreal, it puts all other mushroom soups you've eaten to shame. Wild mushrooms (I can count at least 4 varietals), tomato and wine; that's it! It's a pricey way to start your meal coming in at $9, but the grilled bread served alongside it is worth at least $10. And you know what, I've tried to recreate the dish at home and it failed miserably, so I'm ok paying a premium for something stellar that I can't repeat. Antipasto di Mare (seafood) and Antipasto Misto di Verdure (veggie) are always spot on, and about the latter, Papavero knows how to turn veggie loathers into veggie lovers. These starters typically feature a variety of four smaller bites to share with the table or devour on your own. When talk turns to entrees, there's like more that needs to be said about the wild board papardelle than ORDER IT! And if you don't crave carbs or aren't wild about wild boar (but seriously, get this) the selection of grilled meats is magic. It's certainly not for those looking for something lighter, but if you're intrigued by the offerings (which rotate) the night you're there, split that meat! Turn the menu over if you dig dessert, there's usually about 6 different options. And while I know people go bananas for the budino, it's their honey and pine nut tart that tops a bowl of budino (which is still insanely awesome). The tart is nutty, not to sweet and the perfect size, a sliver of heaven, making me feel like I'm not indulging too much. And because it's packed with pine nuts, I've decided it's actually not dessert at all, but an after dinner savory. And while we're talking after dinner, sip (or shoot!) some Amaro, the Italian way, nay, the ONLY way to end an awesome meal. They have a plentiful collection and information about them all, so hit bartenders up for info and learn a little while you digest. Two other quickies I want to gush about:-Those that note the small space and feel it's not a stellar spot for groups, listen up! I was there one night when they brought tables together for 20 so it can be done! It was towards the end of dinner service, so if you're looking to dine in a large group, consider the time, and you may want to give a call and ask if there's space. While they don't take reservations they'll be able to tell you if they can accommodate your large party.-As I mentioned earlier, lactose and I aren't friends, so I ask for the Zuppa di Funghi sans sprinkling of cheese every time I go. Well check this out, last time they were so concerned about dairy and so willing to make accommodate that they brought out some vegan bread! It was unexpected but nothing like that grilled bread :) but I was so grateful for their effort!
City Bakery=Pretty, pretty good.  This place is tucked away behind The Bentley Projects just south of downtown Phoenix.  You can't see it from the street, and there's not really anything around except some empty lots and the gallery; apparently you just need to be in the know ... and you want to be in the know.  Nice outdoor seating, not too crowded, and great food.  It's a lunch place, and the menu was mostly upscale salads and sandwiches (brie, goat cheese, sundried tomatoes, etc.).  I just stuck with the turkey club on focaccia, and it was mmm, good.  It also came with a white bean salad that was really good.  Plus, the dessert and drinks looked/were fantastic.  I really want to try the banana pudding and the frozen hot chocolate (which I tried to order, but I think the waitress said they were out of chocolate, what?).  They had a bunch of crazy-but-amazing-sounding lattes, cute mini-cakes (I had the carrot cake, which was good, but a little too much on the frosting; I could barely taste the cake), and super-good looking cookies (I bought a cute bunny rabbit sugar cookie for my friend, and it was sitting on my desk all afternoon, its little bunny eyes taunting me and daring me to bite off one of its bunny ears).Downsides -- The service was slow, the indoor seating didn't look too great (the music inside was yuck), and it's not exactly cheap (cookies were three dollars, mini-cakes were five, and I think the cheapest sandwich was nine bucks).It's a good thing the bread is so tasty because they sure skimp on the goodies in the middle. My ham sandwich on baguette had the tiniest amount of meat I was sure it was a joke. Perhaps Alan Funt was waiting in back and soon I would hear "Smile. You're on Candid Camera." My friend John's roasted chicken sandwich, while tastier than mine, was also in the "more bread than meat" club. I could hear the late Clara Pelet from the Wendy's commercials saying "Where's the beef?" Thoroughly enjoyed the sparse modern decor and I love how it's tucked away behind the Bentley Projects. You feel cool just finding it. Hours are funky so make sure you call first. I'm sure I'll go back....perhaps for a salad next time!
Fresco=Light!  Refreshing!    We tried Fresco (and bingsoo) for the first time Saturday night.  Did I mention it was light and refreshing?These folks take pride in the product they sell.  Light, refreshing (did I mention that yet) frozen yogurt and carefully sliced fresh fruit on top of finely shaved ice with a drizzle of mango glaze.  Light and refreshing and so much healthier than DQ.  We'll be back for more and to try the boba.
Wichcraft=3.5 starsI guess you can say I have a little bit of chef-crush on Tom Colicchio.  I mean, he's not the only one.  I guess another one is Hubert Keller.  But I digress.Creeping in the shadows of his Las Vegas fine dining eatery, Craftsteak, is it's more laid back, little brother, 'Wichcraft.  Nice play on words, Tom, nice play.The layout and decor is pretty laid back and simple, which obviously is the point of a casual eatery.They have a decent variety of cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, paninis, salads, and a couple of soups, as well as a couple of sweet items.  I eventually decided on a panini that had roasted pork, coppa, pepper relish, and fontina cheese on country bread.  It came simply wrapped in parchment paper but did not include a side, no chips or anything.  Oh well, whatever.I opened up the paper and it appeared somewhat simple and smelled pretty good.  Upon first bite, the pork was pretty good and not dry and the fontina cheese was good.  The bread was not too crunchy, thus the top of my mouth was saved from being ripped to shreds.While it wasn't the best panini I've ever had, it was still pretty good and I hear the breakfast sandwiches/paninis are pretty good, so next time I'm in Vegas and find myself at the MGM, I would probably stop by again.Were my expectations high coming in here? Sure. But it's not like I was looking for Colicchio to get his shiny head all sweaty making me a sammy in the back. I simply thought they'd have an interesting menu of overpriced, but delicious 'wich's. Wrong. The menu is boring, the sammies are small and, as expected, the prices are high (peep the pic of my slow-roasted pork pressed 'wich). Bleh. I wouldn't be proud of that sammich if I made it in my own kitchen. Stumbling out of Wet Republic? You'll do just fine here. For everyone else, look elsewhere for good eats.
Taqueria Mi Casita=I love this place.  I have had only a couple poor experiences with food here. One was a veggie burrito, What the hell was I thinking?  It blew.  Everything else I have had here has been amazing.  My personal favorite is the Chicken Quesadilla it is a taste de force.  The tacos are all the bomb diggity.  They are exactly like street tacos you would get in Mexico or from a taco stand on the streets in Phoenix.Another good thing about this place, unlike other taco stand type places I have patronized, this one has never turned my GI tract into a Wal-Mart the day after thanksgiving. You know, lot's of traffic and little to show for it when the day is done.Another Yelper said that a "good looking family" owns Mi Casita.  I will translate this for you.  He really meant to say "The family that owns this place has a  smoking hot daughter."  I have stared into her eyes many time trying to remember what in the world I came in for.  She has eyes like the lady in the famous National Geographic cover photo.Go to this place.Mmm.... I am starving.
Japonais=Great bar located in atrium area of the Mirage Hotel and Casino. This bar has an indoor/outdoor feel to it because of the skylight and slightly elevated space just above the casino floor. The vibe is contemporary Japanese, with an elegant aesthetic and very uncomfortable seating. :)The signature drinks that we girls ordered were pretty disappointing (sake sangria and some cucumber martini), however the drinks the guys had were red bull vodkas and were mixed well. Japonaise serves food late, however I didn't bother to look at the menu because of the mind blowing dinner at Sushisamba (review to follow) we had beforehand. The bar is open until 2am and they have a few TV screens in the bar area and are viewable pretty much anywhere you sit.Restaurant Week has arrived in Vegas and what better opportunity to check out a few restaurants while helping a worthy cause?Japonais was among the many restaurants listed, but their menu was the most diverse with quite a few selections to choose from as well.Arriving for an early dinner on this Labor Day Monday, we were seated along the back after requesting a side by side seating.  We were both surprised with the interior of this restaurant and the sushi bar.For $50.08 per person, we had a three course dinner ahead of us.To start, appetizers to choose from included Crab Cakes, Lobster Spring Rolls, Hawaiian Hamachi, Ahi Tuna Ceviche, Spicy Tuna Maki, etc.  We both chose the "Kobe Carpaccio with soy, ginger, pearl onions and tempura shallots."  What a divine appetizer to start with!  Delicately sliced and presented on a rectangular plate, the crunchiness from the shallots and sweetness from the onions provided a perfect balance.  The Big F was in complete heaven!Entree choices ranged from Seafood Toban Yaki, Ahi Tuna Steak, Salmon Japonais, Chestnut Chicken, and Le Quack Japonais.  We both decided on the "Petite Filet Mignon with truffle potato puree, grilled asparagus and uni butter."  The 4 oz. filet was cooked perfectly rare with a very good flavor.  The uni butter was a nice touch, but the potato puree and thick syrupy sauce made the meal so decadent and rich.  Instead of the grilled asparagus, we substituted with grilled broccolini.  It provided a nice crunch and contrast to the silky smooth potato puree.Dessert was a "Trio of Chef's Specialties" that included their Kabocha Cheesecake "Japanese pumpkin cheesecake with an almond cookie crust", their "Chocolate Ginger Mousse Cake" with gold flecks, and vanilla bean ice cream.  A generous dessert after such a rich meal.  The mousse cake was light, but also quite dense with flavor and richness.  The cheesecake had a more unique flavor, especially with the nice crust.  And a scoop of good vanilla ice cream and fresh berries always complements a dessert well, and provides a nice finish.Service was great.  Our water was always refilled before it ever reached the half mark, and our waitress was thorough and friendly.  She came by often to check on us and let us know the status of our order.  Overall, we had a fabulous experience with great food and good service.  It's a bit pricey for their sushi since they sell their nigiri by the piece!  But the Big F enjoyed the meal so much that he'd be willing to go back again this week just to enjoy it again!Side notes:* Industry night: 50% off industry menu every Wednesday in their lounge.* Late Night Dining: Late night menu every Thursday, Friday, & Saturday until 1 am.(Pics of our dinner are posted!)Japonais was actually on my "to try" list....but in New York. I remember passing by it near Union Square and wondering if the fusion would be too coy for my taste...or maybe too koi? OK, I thought that was funny. Anyway, I don't have to waste a meal on my next trip to Manhattan since the owners opened an outpost here in the Mirage in Vegas. I can well imagine this place has the same, coolish vibe as its sister eateries in New York and Chicago. But you have to bear the ongoing hum of the casino and the unending stream of foot traffic passing by. The verdict on the food? Pretty good but kinda spartan on the portions. Jamie W. and I were at the Mirage to see the Cirque de Soleil show, this one an elaborate Beatles tribute called "Love" just right across the floor. The hotel concierge was pressing Japonais on us as a dining option, and our apathy made us cave. They offer a Lounge Dinner for Two for $45 - which allows you and a companion to eat at the bar and have two appetizers and then share an entree and a dessert. That's not really a terrible deal - but the meal did leave us hungry after the show. We tried the Lobster Spring Rolls and the Sweet and Sour Calamari for starters (see my photos). The three rolls were good and crunchy, though I honestly couldn't tell if they did contained lobster in them. However, the mango relish and blood orange vinaigrette were nice tropical accents. The calamari had nice texture and came clumped together in a sweet sauce undercut by a wasabi vinaigrette. Against all odds, it worked especially with the black sesame seeds sprinkled on top. For our entree, Jamie and I split the Chestnut Chicken which was nicely marinated in a lemon ginger sauce. It came with a shiitake rice casserole with corn and peas and some sauteed brocollini (see my photo). Tasty though hardly what I would call fusion. Just wish I got more than half a breast. For dessert, it was the Chocolate Indulgence, a little mousse cake heavy on chocolate and ginger (see my photo). We were probably out of the place in less than forty minutes, and I have to say the service was perfectly adequate. You could do a lot worse in Vegas. After all, what you eat in Vegas stays in Vegas, at least in their city sewage system. FOOD - 4 stars...pretty good for a lounge menu, but I would have paid more to be truly satisfied AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...coolish, trendy with lots of loud tourists around the bar SERVICE - 4 stars...never felt ignored, that's for sure TOTAL - 4 stars...still seems pricey for what you get, and splitting dishes in Vegas just seems so wrongAfter seeing the Beatles' show LOVE, we discovered Japonais in the Mirage. I LOVE Vegas food and this our meal at Japonais was one of the best I've ever had in Vegas. Now, if only I knew how to pronounce the name so I could recommend it more often without embarrassment... I think we ordered about everything on the menu. We wanted to try it all! We each chose a glass of yummy wine and then dove into the delicious food. We asked for the dishes to be delivered as they were ready. It seemed that with each new dish, the food got even better! Our server who brought out each dish was a sweet older lady too and so polite and thoughtful!The sushi rolls particularly stood out as so-incredibly-fresh (had this with periods before for affect but Yelp thought it was a URL!)! Every single sauce that accompanied a dish was incredible too. The food was all melt-in-your-mouth delicious!When I raved about Japonais, one of my friends told me she thinks there is one in NYC too. I wonder if it could possibly be as good as the Japonais at the Mirage?!Trying to decide where to dine in Vegas is like trying to decide what one item of clothing to take from the Vogue fashion closet.  Seriously.  On our first night in Vegas for convention we decided to stay at the hotel (Mirage) since we were pretty tired.  Japonais had a promising menu so we made reservations.Service was friendly and efficient.  I ordered two sushi rolls which were good.  The tempura app was also tasty.  I would have liked to have had time to sit in the lounge area pre- dinner, but I was a little busy engaging in some retail therapy.  ;)  All in all, Japonais is a nice place to grab a bite to eat.After leaving Sushisamba (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushisamba-las-vegas#hrid:1dxUEuHDmW5jPCEoH82cCA) hungry and disappointed, I decided to try my luck at Japonais. I sat at the bar close to the grill where the chef was prepping all the Robata (various foods skewered and grilled on Japanese charcoal bincho tan). The bartender promptly gave me a menu and was happy to explain the menu items that I had questions about. I ordered their Sake Martini (sake and shochu shaken with fresh cucumber) and sipped that deliciously refreshing cocktail while perusing my food options. For starters I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tartare topped with quail egg and caviar (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA?select=o2MJ5pijZGP0tMLBPgDSEg#EzU5HRGJcy15ctY6qinvMg). The presentation of the dish was beautiful and I loved that the chive sprigs on top had their ends wrapped in gold leaves. Nothing makes a woman feel more luxurious than some gold in her food! The thin cucumber slices added a nice crunch to the well seasoned, fresh tuna. I had never had Robata before, so I opted for the Shitake Mushrooms that were dashi marinated with some sea salt and the Red Snapper Kama - fish cheeks with sea salt and ponzu sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA?select=o2MJ5pijZGP0tMLBPgDSEg#o2MJ5pijZGP0tMLBPgDSEg). The mushrooms were juicy and had great texture. The fish cheeks were absolutely phenomenal. The amount of salt was perfect and the meat right off the cheek bone was simply divine. I don't recall ever having such tender, succulent grilled fish. The grill added some nice crunchy char marks on the outside. Although I was already full, I couldn't resist the Kabocha Cheesecake - Japanese pumpkin cheesecake served with five-spiced pineapple mousse and almond cookie crust. Heaven ensued. The pumpkin was not very apparent (just as the bartender had informed me), the spiced pineapple had the perfect sweet & spicy combo going on and all the ingredients just paired so well together.A lovely quick dinner experience at the bar - would definitely come back for the snapper cheeks and soem more sake martinis!!!Before seeing Al Pacino in the Terry Fator Showroom, I came to Japonais for something different.  I had studied the menu online and knew what I was getting before I even sat down.My server came quickly and took my drink order--some iced green tea.  We then talked about appetizers that wouldn't be too large.  I didn't want to order something meant for sharing.  I asked about the ahi tuna ceviche and he said that would be good for a single diner.  I ordered that and the Le Quack Japonais for my main course.I was brought the ahi ceviche as it was excellent.  The yuzu and white soy marinade was very good!  It was a 3 ounce serving and just perfect for a starter.Then same Le Quack.  The duck was fantastic!  It came with condiments for putting on the duck in the mushu wraps.  There were four items--a mango chutney with some red pepper, Japanese cabbage shreds, green onion ends also shredded and some spicy plum sauce. I was surprised that I ate all the wraps but one with my meal.  The toppings were so good and great accompaniments to the very good duck!Next up, dessert.  I asked my server about different desserts.  I opted for the most popular one, the Kabocha cheesecake.  It's a cheesecake with a crust made from crushed almond cookies, with a layer of Japanese pumpkin cheesecake, topped by a layer of five spice  pineapple mousse.  The cheesecake is not as creamy as some we're used to because of the circular pot in which it's baked.  But, take the spoon and go down through the pineapple mousse and grab some of the pumpkin and the combination is outstanding!  A real winner.Service throughout the evening was first rate!  It turned out that my server, David, was the captain.  He was polite, helpful, and friendly!  He gave me his business card with a small gift for the next time I'm at Japonais and I got the 20% locals discount MGM Resorts is offering Nevada residents at many of their restaurants for a limited time.  This dinner was a great way to start off a super evening at the Mirage.  Al Pacino was excellent!
16th Street Sports Bar & Grill=These folks pour a DRINK for $3 on Saturdays! They have daily specials and the Saturday special is $3 SoCo or Three Olives. Saturdays also offer a turkey cheeseburger and fries for $5, but I didn't try it. You can see all their specials by hovering your cursor over the day of the week on their home page (http://www.16th.st/index.html)It was NOT crowded when we cruised in for the Sun Devil game this past weekend. We were greeted by a guest who asked if we had a reservation and then hollered to the waitress who said there may be a wait. At least they have a sense of humor!The advantage for us was we got to take our pick of the TV we wanted to view the game. There were two Texas Hold 'Em poker tables going (not my thing so I don't know specifics) and I saw pool tables in a separate area -- photos on the website make it look like there's shuffleboard too.Definitely looking forward to going back. It was a great place to watch a game. I'll have to try the food next time and maybe they'll get a bump to 4 stars (although, I observed their nachos are real cheese nachos, and I'm a fake cheese nacho girl so I'm gonna have to pick another game day food!)I can't understand why so many people give this place terrible reviews. Its a sports bar for shitsake, what do you expect? I don't care what anyone else says, this place makes the cut for any sports fan in need of a venue with massive TV's, greasy bar food and plenty of beer. Cheap beer I may add. They also have cheap drinks. $3 for a bloody Mary whose mix is comparable to my beloved Zing Zang.. I think YES. There is a covered outdoor patio, so even the smoker sports fans of America can fully enjoy themselves, without even being rained on should some fluke freaky ass storm miraculously make its way into the valley of the sun.. unlikely, but hey, im just throwing it out there.Their wings are delicious and meaty. Their nachos are nachos.. cant really eff that up. Their fried party platter thing is a heart attack on a plate, and nothing fancy, but goddamn delicious. The sandwiches are standard as well as the salads.. but come on people, this is where we go to get shnockered and watch some football, not to indulge in a gourmet meal. 16th St. Bar is A-O-Fn-K with me.. And one of the best parts is that there is a Sports Authority right down the street so when you get that urge to purchase a new baseball glove or junior size football because your hands are too small for the official size, you can go during halftime.Ka Pow!Great sports bar.  Lots of nice big TVs, yummy wings, good drink specials (w/ a great range of beers on draft, though the two don't typically intersect so I was drinking $3 Mirror Pond Ale from a bottle poured into an icy pint glass), enthusiastic if somewhat homer crowd (I guess I just insulted myself.  Well, at least I didn't loudly protest very obvious calls against the Cards like the table next to us).  Anyway don't expect great service, though I won't complain too loud - I guess under certain circumstances I can actually be patient.  Bathrooms - at least the men's room is pretty disgusting, but I survived.  Otherwise the place is pretty nice inside - our waitress gave everyone coasters.  One minor niggle: there were a couple kids there when we first got there.  The family left around halftime and the little babies were asleep most of the time, (and mercifully quiet the entire time) but this sort of thing is simply not appropriate.  Put up a sign.  "No firearms or children allowed."Went there yesterday to watch a postseason game with other Yelpers.  As far as watching TVs went, there wasn't a bad seat in the house.  For those that hate smoke there is a non smoking entrance in the back to the bar side but if you want to play pool or use the Men's room you still have to run the gauntlet of the smoking patio.  Speaking of the Men's room, I have seen worse but this one wasn't really kept up that well and it could use a mopping as my feet stuck to the floor by the urinal. They had plenty of good choices for beer on tap.  I was intending on a burger but table quantities of other stuff arrived.  The nachos were ok.  I don't normally care for hot wings because they are, well, hot.  These were grilled and while they left a slight after burn for me were really quite good.  I also had an onion ring, a potato skin and a cheese stick.  Good solid bar food without being Wow.  Service bounced between really good and "where did she go?".  They were out of stuff like iced tea, some brownies and some of the beers.  As a table we were buying enough drinks that those that mixed in glasses of water were not questioned.All in all a good solid neighborhood bar.
Zodie's=Good ol' Zodie's. When the smoking ban went into effect, this bar ditched their kitchen and mounted a GIANT sign with bold, red print, exclaiming, "SMOKERS WELCOME." I admit, the ban is probably a good idea. I will cover that statement with, "To each his own," everyone's opinion counts, etc. etc. etc. But I do admire the zeal with which they stood to their cause. Now, the decor in Zodie's didn't click in my gourd until very recently. Why? I don't know, because now that I get it, it's just so apparent. The place is scattered with zodiac symbols, sun catchers, and wind chimes. The lighting changes, too, depending on who's on shift. If it's Jim or Pete, the lights are at their fullest level. But if Charla is working, she'll turn the lights completely off, fill the joint with candle light, and talk to you about where your sun is and which planet is in your ... I can't ever follow, but it sure sounds nice. Everyone likes a scapegoat when their luck has run dry, yeah? I've also heard several accounts of the haunt who hangs out at Zodie's, which just adds to the place's appeal. For goofs like me, anyway. I guess he wears a white T shirt, and likes to play with the TVs and radio. I've never witnessed this, but I keep hoping.The drinks are good 'n strong. The prices are definitely affordable. I did, however, cringe a little when I selected the "Night Life" category, because every time we've been to Zodie's, the only other people at the bar are other employees. They do have a Golden Tee machine, and if you take a chance to get to know the bartenders, their stories can certainly be entertaining.It may not be for everyone, but this is one of my favorite places to go for a cocktail.
Phoenicia Cafe=There's no shortage of options if you want Middle Eastern food in Tempe, especially around ASU. Luckily there's no confusion about which one is THE BEST.Not only is this the best Middle Eastern retaurant in The Valley, it's also MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN ALL OF TEMPE. The chicken Shwarma is delicious, and the hummus is the best in the state. For a cheap meal, try the "hommus deluxe" with chicken or lamb. It eats like a meal. Tack on a delightful staff, and a comfortable atmosphere, and what you have is probably the most underrated restaurant in Arizona."Best hummus", "best Middle Eastern food", "best restaurant in Tempe", "most underrated"...I know, that's a lot of superlatives - this place deserves each one.One day, as my friend Darius and I were trying to kill some time before going to class we came here for lunch. This was Darius' first time with Mediterranian cuisine and after reading all the glowing reviews for here - I knew this was the place to take him! :)We had some hummus as an appetizer, and oh em gee!! it was so great! I couldn't believe it was so creamy and perfectly garlicly!! Normally hummus is a lil too strong for me but this was great.I had the Gyro plate and it was a LOT of food! I enjoyed it very much, I just wish it came with more pita bread. Gyro meat was plated with some more hummus, basmati rice and fixins for awesome gyros. My friend had this dish with garbanzo beans and lamb. He really enjoyed it and said it the meat was tender. I didn't try it but it sure looked good. :)We closed our meal with some blaklavah - they have different varieties of the mediterranian staple, I had the walnut backlavah and he had the pistashio. I liked it but I've had better and it was WAY too sweet, I couldn't finish it! Over all, this is one of the best places I've discovered since moving to Tempe. I really enjoy it and look forward to finding more places! To my yelpers, I say: GO! The food is yummy, the decor is cute and clean, the service is more than decent and the location is mill but NOT mill.. gotta love it!
Tarbell's="Great place for dining solo!""Incredible food!""Friendly staff!""My go-to restaurant on the Camelback corridor."All of these are things that I've heard about Tarbell's time and time again over the years.  So, of course I had high expectations going in.  So when my friends Jared and Jane B suggested we do a double date at Tarbell's during the recent AZ Restaurant Week, I was totally game.Upon walking into Tarbell's, the hostess was incredibly friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere was warm and inviting while still being casual; my kind of place!  Nathan was our waiter and he was awesome.  He was patient with both my husband and our friend Jared as they went back and forth on what they wanted to order quite a few times.  He suggested a great bottle of wine for us also.I was the only one at the table who didn't order off of the restaurant week menu.  I went with a Caesar salad to start, the Salmon entree, and carrot cake for dessert.  I enjoyed the Caesar salad despite the lack of anchovies (I happen to love anchovies).  The salmon was a huge hit -- I think everyone at the table had order envy over it -- but I did share!  It was grilled to perfection, topped with a local molasses/lime/honey glaze and served on a crispy potato cake.  The carrot cake was good but not amazing.The restaurant week menu that everyone else ordered from had only one starter option: the pulled mozzarella.  However, I guess they ran out of it the night that we were there, so the manager came over and offered to substitute with other salad options.  This was a huge perk for everyone and much appreciated by our group.  Two people at our table had the Bolognese, but they said it was bland.  They were pleased with the other desserts (donuts and chocolate mousse).While I wasn't completely enamored with everything, our overall Tarbell's experience was a good one, and I definitely want to return to try more menu items in the future.  Double date or biz dinner, anyone?  Let me know!*My 200th Review*Tarbell's, you were a dream come true!This is what 5 stars is to me-The very best service. Every staff member was professional, personable, well groomed, prompt, and smiled often!The restaurant itself was simple and elegant. Definitely a place I would recommend for a date or special occasion or anytime you want to be fancy! The crowd was mostly retirees, but I took that as a sign that I was in the right place.  The other diners were very dapper and able bodied and seemed to clearly enjoy the finer things in life. The food. Mmmmmm yes!! I had the scallops, and they were the best I've ever had. It came with a potato cake and seasonal vegetables, each bite equally delicious. The salmon was also excellent and grilled to perfection. Even the grill marks were absolutely perfect, which I admire because I can not do that myself! It was accompanied by mixed greens with an amazing honey glaze dressing, and potatoes another way- similar to shoe string pik nik sticks but much fancier and salty and mouth watering. We shared the caramel cheesecake for dessert, and that was probably the low point of the meal. Kidding!! Omg, I rarely eat dessert and this was worth.every.calorie!! Perfection! Not to sweet, not too dense, not too light, so full of flavor! The caramel sauce! My, my! I really can't wait to go back. I am very curious about the spaghetti and meatballs! And the profiteroles! I want to try the whole menu, each time it changes! Thank you Tarbell's, for making my 30th birthday dinner amazing!Edit: I received a warm phone call from Ty 2 days after dining to inquire how my experience was. I can't say that has ever happened before even at other fine establishments. Very classy. Thanks Ty!
Compass Arizona Grill=Let's get the boring bad  stuff out of the way so I can talk about the fun part.over-pricednot deliciousyou have two people waiting on you, but it's always slowbad water- seriously, not even a lemon can mask the disgusting flavor of their waterit's always coldhonestly, if this restaurant wasn't high up and spinning, i would never go here.i took my nieces ice skating at city scape so i figured this would be a fun place to have an over priced dinner since we were right up the street. When in Rome....or something.I ordered some curry chicken thing and my nieces had grilled cheese off the kids menu.  we also ordered a molten cake for dessert but there was no molten? whatever, no need to to hash it because i knew going in the food sorta sucks. Our bill was $70 but we seriously had a blast. The whole dinner was filled with gasps and excitement and sheer thrill about how fun this restaurant was.After reading some of the rips on the Compass Arizona Grill, I thought we should investigate the badness on our anniversary. We've been several times over the years and it's usually fine. If you've read anything I've written, you know I'm uncouth, ill-educated, lacking taste and manners. Consider also I usually write about remote rural spots serving iceberg lettuce salads, white bread, instant mashed potatoes,brown gravy from cans and chicken fried steak. I called our reservation in four days early, was asked if we'd dined before. We were in the database. I was asked if it was a special event. We couldn't get a 7:30 to 8:30 slot, so took 6:30. I was asked if I wanted anything special. I didn't think to ask for a bottle of Fre champagne or bottle of Navarro Gewürztraminer or Pinot Noir juice. We were greeted promptly, wished happy anniversary, and seated immediately. Nina served the water and appetizers, Jerry served drinks and food. Each course had its own plating and service.  Jerry's served here since the first 360 degree spin in 1976, so has some experience. The menu's southwest.  Subtle chile, cilantro and blue corn in menu items. The appetizer bread was cornbread with corn kernels and green chile added. Regular and honey butter were delivered along with sea salt crystals for dinner seasoning. That's good corn bread.  I had 2.5 tiny servings.  Our wines were Fre rosé and red, both on the Compass Grill list. Of our courses, the black bean soup with diced chile and cilantro sprouts and the rib eye steak were excellent. The crispy brie appetizer and salad were good. Being ill-mannered, House Salad springy field greens and tiny red tomatoes lubricated with house dressing elude my fork and knife. Fortunately, I shot no tomatoes across the room as frequently happens to me. The citrus vinaigrette under the brie was also excellent. I recommend a thorough swishing of cheese, arugula and candied pecan to get the most vinaigrette from the plate. One can get the last sweet-citrus streaks with the tiny tomato halves. I ordered the veggie entree, Seared balsamic glazed oyster mushroom and eggplant on a bed of quinoa and couscous with apricot. Cut the mushroom and eggplant, mix it with the harvest grains, and a good veggie meal's been served. Not as good eaten separately. Coffee and strawberry shortcake for dessert. Coffee much better than some highly touted Phoenix dineries. Strawberry shortcake an appropriately modern, 24th story serving. Along our 90 minute journey, we got 540 degrees of the Phoenix horizon, from daylight to night. The 21st century view is pretty cluttered up with bank towers and the calloused handed, big bicepped Freeport-McMoran corporate HQ. Rather than tall view-blocking bank towers, I'd have been lots happier with shorter ostentation, lower fees and higher interest on my hard-kept savings. Lots less than 75,000 bank-owned homes in Phoenix and more employees would also have been nice. Like I said, I'm uncouth, ill-educated, lacking taste and manners.We may all be in for mixed experiences here.Spinning and eating are not normally things I do together... Nor do I ever want to do it again. The only time I spin is after a heavy night of drinking ... And we all know how fun that is.So the shtick of this place is this: it's a restaurant on a relatively tall building in downtown Phoenix that spins, thus giving you a 360 degree view of the area around the hotel. But it spins just a tad too fast. You can hear and feel the gears of the place going, oftentimes creaking in certain areas. The central wall is painted one boring color of baby-crap brown and there's nothing on it but a hand rail (really?!) that looks like a relic from the 70s.And it was freezing! Uncomfortable so. The food was good. I had the salmon entree and it was delicious. Wonderfully cooked and a large portion. The appetizer was a pain in the ass. It was a pizza with cheese and mushrooms and truffle and so tasty, but the crust was too flimsy to hold the toppings, but cutting it was awkward and the share plates were too small. And there ain't no way I'm dropping oily mushrooms on this dress I'm wearing. I gave it up after the first slice. Overall, a weird experience. The place was practically empty on a Friday night and because the room is curved you can hear mystery voices of people you can't see... Can they hear me?!Even though I liked the dinner... I won't be back. Spinning around twice was enough for me.FYI- one rotation is almost exactly an hour long. And Arizona is damn boring more than once.
Oyster Bar=We discovered this place by accident.  We were walking around the Palace Station and could not ignore the smells coming from this tiny bar.  Customers had heaping bowls of what could only be yummy goodness in front of them, AND there was a line for this place.  We stood by and watched the cooks at work and took a look at the posted menu - pan roasts, gumbos, etouffes, oysters on the half shell, just lots of good stuff.  I had to ask those who were eating and those in line what to get  - and everyone was saying different things - but it all sounded wonderful!  We were sold!The following week, we made our first attempt to chow at the Oyster Bar and you can imagine the defeated look on The Husband's face when it had 'just' closed for the evening.  Darn!The next time we went early and on a weekday.  We didn't want to stand in line and we didn't want to get the stare down!  Haha!With three of us, we figure we could all share.  So this is what we got:* Palace Pan Roast "Served with steamed white rice." ($21.99) - This was my absolute favorite of the bunch.  It had the most flavor and I found myself hogging on this dish.  Customers weren't kidding when they said I had to get the pan roast!* House Gumbo "A tasty Creole chowder made with seafood, gumbo file, okra, and Andouille sausage.  Served with white rice."  ($19.49) - The gumbo was pretty good too, and chunky.  But I just craving the flavors of the pan roast more. * Etouffee " Shrimp, crab, and lobster with seasonings in this classic French Creole stew." ($17.99) - Their etouffe was good as well, but compared to the others, the pan roast and gumbo ranked higher.All in all, it was all good, hearty and fatty goodness!  Yes, they do arrive in large pho bowls (large for Vegas, average size for other places).  I think it's more than generous for one person.  We technically didn't have any leftovers because between the three of us, we picked out all the good bits and stuffed ourselves silly.  Come with an appetite!  Prices may seem steep, but when you see how much you get, it's okay.  And the cool part is watching your meal cooked right in front of you! Service was a bit slower with only two people working.  (They had three the previous weekends we passed by.)  It was okay though because we didn't have to wait and we sat far enough down the bar to not have to acknowledge those in line still.While you wait, they serve up warm sourdough bread and butter. I was starving and gobbled up two pieces before my order arrived.The best seafood jambalaya that I've ever had hands down! I must have died and went to heavan when I ate here! Who would have expected such a great find at the Palace Station? I really hate to give such a place up to the masses but isn't that what Yelp is about?My company ordered a combo pan roast and an oyster gumbo, both were great as well! Especially the pan roast! I would have to say that my seafood jambalaya was best of all of them! It had lobster tail, clams, mussels, oysters, crab, shrimp and other goodies! I had them give me a 7 spicy on a scale of 1-10 and it had quite a kick!I am comimg back for sure!If you didn't get the idea from the 200+ user reviews raving about this place, then yes, the Oyster Bar is delicious. "How delicious," you ask? "Very delicious," I say. When a place has me ogling over a pan roast more than a celebrity crush, it really means something (Actually, that might just mean that I'm a glutton. Never mind that though). Since there are already boatloads of praise from other wonderful Yelpers, I'll try not to be redundant. Thus, I'll leave you with a summation of tips, from one glutton to another:1. First visit? Order a pan roast. It's practically their signature item. Ordering other items could leave you happy, but not as happy as a pan roast would make you. You do like to be happy, don't you?2. Starving? Order a platter of fresh oysters too. They're some of the freshest oysters that I've had in Vegas.3. Pro-tip? Get an extra roll with your pan roast to use as a shoveling tool. Extras are free. You just have to ask for them.4. Pro-pro-tip? Friday and Saturday nights are their peak hours. You could be standing in line for 30 minutes to an hour. I've heard that it's gotten as long as 2.5 hours at the most busy of times. On a early Sunday afternoon, I got seated with a group of 4 instantly.5. Want to go there now? Call me. It's a date.After hearing about how bombdizzle Oyster Bar is from numerous friends, I hauled my ass over the first chance that I got. And whooo wheee, it's FANTASTIC. The chefs prepare everything to order and better yet, they prepare it in front of you so you can watch the magic happen!! For a first timer like me, I went the safe and easy route and ordered a half dozen oysters and the ever popular Combo Pan Roast to share. Oysters - superbly fresh. Comes with all your usual fixings--chunky horseradish, lemons, marinara sauce, and tobasco sauce (upon request). Prepare to your heart's desire and slurp on up!Combo Pan Roast - wow, this stuff is like crack. Even when my stomach was telling me, "No more, I'm stuffed!", my mouth would keep commanding, "More!". The best part of the meal isn't the plethora of seafood (a whole lobster tail, 4 halved crab legs, and a shit ton of shrimp) that crowds the dish, the best part is... wait for it......the broth!! The broth consists of a sweet creamy tomato broth mixed with various savory spices and brandy that will leave your tastebuds feeling a bit perplexed (but in a good way!) from the flavor complexity. My friend and I enjoyed this dish much like you would a curry dish rather than a soup, so we ordered an extra side of rice for it. The dish was large enough to overstuff the both of us. It's a pricey place overall, but well wort the price imo (and the portions are large so many of the dishes can be split between two people).  And here's the kicker.... all this awesomeness is available 24hrs a day!! So if you're wandering around the strip drunk at 5 am, and you want to get your fancy on.... I suggest you stumble on over to Oyster Bar at the Palace Station for their Pan Roast!After a long night in Vegas we headed to Oyster bar to fill up on tasty seafood. Following the cab ride that kept going and going we ultimately made it to Palace Station Hotel & Casino. The area is sketchy to say the least but after tons and tons of suggestions we had to try Oyster bar. Luckily there was no wait and we were seated instantly. We started with a round of Kirin followed by a dozen oysters and clams. I must admit I'm a sucker for oysters on the half shell, but these oysters left something to be desired. The oysters were not shucked properly making them difficult to eat. I was starting to get disappointed until the Pan Roast combo came out. That thing was HUGE and delicious, packed with shrimp, crab and lobster with a side of steam rice. Over all the Pan Roast was finger licking good with just enough spice to accent the seafood. Even though the area was totally sketchy and the hotel is less than nice this Oyster Bar is a diamond in the rough and a must try in Vegas.P.s. If you're coming from the strip its a $25-35 cab ride, depending on trafficI waited in line here with my coworker for an hour, to be behind 3-4 parties ahead of us. During that one hour, only 1 party was seated. This line would not budge, so we left. :*(But, that stirred up my curiosity and decided to come at an off-time (they're open 24 hours) after some Vegas debauchery. Ordered the combo (crab, lobster, shrimp) pan roast with level 7 spiciness (levels 1-10), which was a pretty mild spicy. I was intrigued by the old fashion boilers in front http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/awI4hHMfa7H0Xf0-ChU5hg?select=i6GMotN-jpqlLc9gpmjgEw, as I saw the chef start off by cooking the fresh seafood medley in the boiler, then added the cajun seasoning, the broth, and finally kept adding the cream sauce base/roux. The pan roast had strong flavor, where I think adding extra rice or noodles ($1.99) is essential. I actually think this soup would make a really delicious pasta sauce. And then there were juicy and generous clumps of seafood, very yum. Service was attentive (you're sitting right in front of them) and the chef kept asking when would be the next time he'll be seeing me, and I assured him for breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday. (I wish)I definitely will be back to try the infamous gumbo, clam chowder, and (new york) oysters/shooters.Some people come to Las Vegas to get cheap eats and some come to eat at the all you can eat buffets!  For me I came to LV like a crazed hit man to knock off my Yelp bookmarks one by one. So here I am at The Palace Station Hotel & Casino to try the Oyster Bar. Having been to the Sunset Stations Oyster Bar so I knew that I was in for a treat again and I did not walk away disappointed from Palace Stations Oyster Bar.The dish ordered this time around was the Bouillabaisse Spicy with rice and a glass  of Chardonnay. The spicy soup base and the fresh seafood was everything I expected from a great Bouillabaisse. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oyster-bar-las-vegas-2?select=xr1v005ca9E5vKENRf6GdQ#xr1v005ca9E5vKENRf6GdQI love watch the chef making my dish while sipping one the cool glass of wine. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oyster-bar-las-vegas-2?select=X5MpbSZQf_lO_ywbO9BKkw#X5MpbSZQf_lO_ywbO9BKkwThe Oyster Bar is always one of my must go to places when in town.Friendly Helpful Service.My LV Trip Bookmark #6Who would have thought I'd find myself downtown at a rundown casino like Palace Station, but there I was on a late Sunday night enjoying one of the most satisfying dishes sin city had to offer! Yup, I'm talkin about the Pan Roast at Oyster Bar! Do yourself a huge favor and order the palace version with shrimp chicken andouille sausage and crab. I added lobster too. But either way, It's the bomb, cuz its all about that crazy good sauce! Keep in mind however, to truly enjoy this dish, you've gotta love your spice! Trust, each bite will be a scorching spoonful of fiery goodness! Chunks of meaty sausage, chicken and seafood in every bite and I bet you won't be able to put your spoon down! Well, except to wipe your forehead from the sweat cuz this bad boy is hot hot hot! But oooh soooo hot diggity good! I ordered a level 7 (1-10 being spiciest) and it was just right!We started with 1/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell, and that was an excellent intro to our fantastic meal! The oysters were fresh and went down the hatch nicely with a swig of cold frosty Kirin! We also ordered the shrimp scampi. It came served with loads of succulent tiger shrimp, a heaping serving of fresh chopped garlic and noodles swimming in a pool of buttery glory. Although it was tasty, it simply couldn't hold a candle to the signature pan roast IMO! I'm tellin ya, order the pan roast and enjoy! Your taste buds and tummy will thank you for it!Happy Eats!Someone had a bright idea and it took us completely off the strip. The Oyster Bar was located in Palace station, a hotel casino that pretty much kept it the same since who knows when. This was definitely a place unfamiliar to me and it almost felt did not have your typical Vegas aesthetic.We started with oysters and it was oyster heaven. Every slurp was fresh and decadence. We had oyster at Bacchanal buffet and it was no comparison! Follow it with a gulp of Kirin, I'm a happy guy!The Palace Pan Roast is exceptionally good. I mean after a weekend of decadence at E, Tableau and Bachannal... This dish still stood out. Absolutely Delicious!So... Oyster, Pan Roast, and Beer... That's all you need to know...especially after a night of debauchery.Extremely short short review, but probably the best review from me...Oyster Bar...  Here is what you MUST ORDER!--Combo Pan Roast!--Alaskan Chowder!That's it!!!  I need to say no more.......Small eatery with only about 18 seats... all things are cook to order in front of you... so expect a wait!  However, THE WAIT WILL BE WORTH IT!!!Expensive?  Slightly... was it delicious?  You beyond betcha!Would I come back?  I'm planning my next trip around Oyster Bar!~~~Hotel is old, smelly & ghetto. Restaurant was in an open area; it was weird I was expecting it to be in a normal restaurant setting, but I guess not. Clam chowder was so yummy 10 ptsCombo pan roast is to die for!! 11ptsFYI, if you split the dishes, they charge you an extra $5.The pan roast had me dreaming about it all night and day so I decided to reverse engineer it and I've gone it!! You don't get the experience of sitting at the Oyster Bar but will definitely get you through until your next visit. Or if you're just tired of that line (2 1/2 hours last time but still totally worth it in the end). This recipe is for cooks who know how to follow my not perfectly exact recipe (sorry!).

Stir in bisque mixture, Serrano chili and chili flakes, tiny sprinkle of lemon juice. Bring To boil. Serve with parsley sprinkled on top like they do at the real deal. Makes 2 servings. Serve with jasmine riceThis is one of Vegas' hidden gems! I totally love this place!! Open 24 hours, we came here at 2am and waited in line for about 40mins to get seated. This is a bar inside the casino which could accomodate about 20 people max at a time. There's only two people working here, Chef EZ cooking and Steve serving, so expect to wait for your food to be ready. They have the steam kettles in front of you on the bar so you can watch how your food is prepared. Both these guys are so cool! They engage in conversation with you no matter how busy they are and it really makes for a more personal experience. Food here is AMAZING!! Probably the best oysters I've had, EVER! It's sooooo fresh, chunky, and succulent. I can still taste it in my mouth. Hmmmmmm... For half a dozen, it's normally $11.99 but from 1am-9am, you can get it for $8.99. Score!! PAN ROAST..what can I say? I'm still dreaming about this dish. I'm already planning my next trip to Vegas for more! Got the Combo Pan Roast which comes with lobster, shrimp, and crab. They're all sauteed with brandy, cream, and tomato then served with rice. You can opt to get the noodles for $1.99 extra which I did. I personally think it's a better match but you can taste and decide for yourself because they serve the rice with it on the side no matter what. It's a bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. Serving is big and you'll really see the actual seafood mixed in there. There were about 3 whole lobsters, 7 whole shrimps, and crab meat everywhere on my bowl! I shared this dish and we still had some leftovers. The Alaskan chowder smelled and looked so delicious!! I"ll have to try that on my next visit. Can't wait!!!"Please, please, please, no more fish liver, fish sperm, baby eels, crab innards,  shrimp brains, or live octopus.  I wanna pick where we eat today."  whines my Midwest poker bud to a group of three Asian guys."OK, OK, where we going?"  I ask choking back laughter at his whining."Oyster Bar.  Palace Station." is all he says."Cool".  Leaning towards my buds, "Did we really feed him fish sperm?"  Nodding of heads and an explosion of laughter settles the matter.Very Important:1.  There is always a line.  Expect a wait.2.  Don't go expecting perfectly cooked, diverse selection of the best seafood.  It's about flavorful dishes from the 1970's and 1980's made from everyday stuff.That said, fresh, nondescript oysters on the half shell with cocktail sauce and horseradish.  Overcooked but typical shrimp cocktail with an OK cocktail sauce (dump the horseradish in from the oysters to pump it up).  Chewy, but tasty, overcooked little necks.Mains are straightforward.  Pan roasts (shelled, over cooked lump crab, shrimp and lobster in an old school brandy infused tomato cream sauce) and Gumbos (same over cooked seafood with andouille sausage and okra thickened with a red brick roux) both served with everyday steamed rice are good eats for sure.   Along with the seafood jambalaya, plain ole good comfort food.Unfortunately the bouillabaisse and SF classic, Cioppino really miss the mark.  It's hard to enjoy dishes that have been perfected and widely available elsewhere.  Sorry but the use of previously frozen cod, over cooked clams, mussels, headless shrimp and previously steamed crab doesn't cut it.  The sweet, flavorful juices from the shrimp heads and crab are missing and heck, it's just more fun to pick at and suck seafood out of the shell.Straight forward, simple beer and wine list.  Inexpensive; 2x retail.  Efficient service.The food is only three stars.  A fourth awarded because this IS a Vegas institution (cheers Godzilla X.)Dear Oyster Bar,It's not very often that I fall in love at first bite, as a matter of fact, this was my first time. In Japanese we say "hatsukoi" which means first love. Though technically you aren't my first love, you are now. I must thank fellow Yelper Dave F., for bringing us together. If it wasn't for him suggesting I give you a try, we would've never met. My friends aren't Yelpers and when I told them about you, they weren't exactly thrilled. You see, they don't get the concept of Yelp. Which doesn't quite make much sense to me since they always ask me to jump on my app when they have no idea where to eat at. Of course the girl with the Yelp app to the rescue. After perusing some reviews and reading them out loud to them, they agreed to go. Don't tell but I skipped over the long wait part and only highlighted the good. I knew I had to remain mum about possible waits up to 2 hours. My one & only mission was to just get them there. When we arrived, the counter was full with 2 people in line. I was hopeful. There were 3 of us, we had left the others at the hotel since they were too hungover to join us. Totally well played. The best part was, as soon as we stepped in line, 5 people got up! We didn't have to wait a single minute! The stars, the moon, the universe, everything aligned perfectly. I ordered the Pan Roast Lobster and this is where my love affair began. The friendly waitress suggested the heat level at 6. Since it was busy, we probably waited about 20 mins, maybe a bit longer but it didn't seem long. I was fascinated with the lone cook who was creating dish after dish in front of me. He was like the energizer bunny, zipping around in that small space. When he finally placed the ginormous bowl in front of me, my eyes sparkled. Huge generous amounts of lobster were floating in my bowl. Then I took that first bite. My mouth exploded with flavors. I don't even think I can find the right words to convey how delicious my pan roast was. It was total perfection. From the level 6 heat to the scrumptious lobster to the lobster bisqué sauce even the scoop of white rice that was in my bowl. My eyes were now in the shape of hearts as I gazed at you. My heart fluttered, I was officially in love. My friend ordered the seafood pan roast and another the shrimp scampi (which came with pasta) and though we all tried each others. I can say unequivocally hands down, mine was the best. The portions were so generous that none of us could finish our meal. One friend suggested on our next visit there, we should share. Huh? Huh? What? Did I just hear that correctly? Was he skirting around the issue that Yelp and Dave F., is what brought us there? I must give kudos to your chef and waitress. Both were consistently busy taking orders, clearing off counter space, preparing each order, opening raw oysters or clams with such ease, and refilling drinks. All of this while engaging people in friendly conversation and a smile. I know some patrons complain about lack of counter space with only about 20 seats but I hope you don't expand. I love the ambiance and the intimacy. Even though you're in the casino with no walls separating you from the rest of the world, you wouldn't even know it since one is more focused on the activity in front of them and of course the delish food. When I go back to Vegas, believe me, I will definitely visit my first love. And to you sir Dave F., arigatou, merci beacoup, kamsanmida, gracious, danke. You are the bomb! P.S. I would wait in line a million years to eat here again. Don't let the wait put you off. It's so so worth it.This spot brings back memories. First tried their gumbo at home when my mom brought back leftovers and was obsessed. I would come here with my cousins ID before I turned 21 to be able to have the deliciousness served to me...you see you have to be 21 or over to eat at the oyster bar(they will card you). I actually spent my 21st birthday dinner here at midnight because I love it so much. Of course I celebrated with a beer and some oyster shooters. Crazy I know...The Oyster Bar is now open 24 hours which makes it so easy to try and a great place to go to when I get off of work at 5am. There usually is always a line since there is seating for only 15-18 people...but that doesn't deter people from waiting...their food is THAT GOOD. The chefs are usually always talking to the guests as he's cooking which makes the experience fun.My husband and I have been here before and LOVED the food. One star warranted because 1. The line is ridiculous. Even with 4 people in front of you, be prepared to wait over an hour &2. No one under 21 can eat here! WTF... Okay what? Like WHAT?This trip my husband, 13 year old daughter and I came ALL THE WAY OFF STRIP for this place... WAITED in line for about 40 minutes, which hadn't moved in the 40 minutes we were standing there, when someone came and told us we'd have to leave because you have to be 21 to eat there. YES. You read that correctly. Never going back WITH or WITHOUT my kids. Ever.Where have I been?  Oyster Bar gets a ton of great reviews from Yelp, some of my personal friends, and even my own parents.  Just Google Las Vegas Pan Roast and you get sent here to the Oyster Bar.  There's so many Yelp reviews about this place that my review is going to sound like a broken record.  So, I'll keep this one simple with bulletin points.-Service:  You read it and Yes, there's a wait. This is not because service is lacking.  This is because the Oyster Bar only seats about 15 and the food is as good as it gets.  Service is actually good here.  What takes a long time too is what I call "Linger Eaters".  These are people that take their sweet ol' time to eat.  The gf and I aren't "Linger Eaters" at all. However, if we are going to wait over an hour to eat, then we're going to take our time too.  -Pan Roast:  They're known for their Pan Roast.  My gf got this and allowed me sample it.  My goodness...everything that I read on these reviews were true.  Superb!!-Seafood Jambalaya:  This is what I got.  I haven't had Jambalaya in years and was in that mood, especially since the outside temps were dropping.  Overall...packed with mussels, clams, crab, lobster, shrimp, and rice.  Your taste buds will be confused with what it's tasting, but won't be confused whether it's good or not.  My taste buds just voted...pretty damn good.  -Clam Chowder:  Just about average, but you don't come here for chowder.  -Hours:  All Day, Everyday-Prices:  You get what you pay for.  Most dishes are about or over $20.  Okay, I didn't keep this review too simple.  But it's still bulletin pointed. Oyster Bar is one of those places that you have to try at least once.  Yes, the wait is long.  And Yes, it's in a smokey casino.  But if you're into gumbo, jambalaya, and overall good food, then Oyster Bar is your place. YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (497/500)**Disclaimer: I don't eat seafood so my review is based on the non-seafood items**Prepare to spend a good chunk of your life waiting to be seated here. I didn't mind too much as I had friends waiting in line as I played Wheel of Fortune. This place really is a "bar" so there are only about 20-25 seats, thus the wait. Everything is made to order right in front of you. My personal favorite is the pan roast which is tomato and cream based. You choose the level of spiciness from 1-10. They throw in habanero peppers if you order a 9 or 10. I had a taste of my friend's New England clam chowder (chowder part only) and it was pretty tasty.Aside from the occasional ridiculous wait time, this place is definitely worth trying at least once.The food is outstanding but you have to wait for it. Is it worth it?The Oyster Bar is inside the Palace Station Casino. The bar only has 18 seats. We got here at 8:30 pm on a Monday thinking we could avoid the infamous wait. No such luck, eleven people ahead of us in line. The line did not move for 40 minutes. When it finally moved, it went quick. At the one hour mark, we got seated. Yay. Well not so fast. After you're seated, you're given a sourdough roll and butter. Thank you, thank you thank you. We were starving and that helped a lot. A few minutes go by and they take our order. We waited so long I memorized what we wanted a half an hour ago lol. 40 minutes later our soup comes out. An hour & 15 minutes from being seated we got the oysters. At the two hour mark from being seated we got our entrees. 3 hour 15 minutes from waiting in line to finishing our meal. Was it worth it?Here's the rundown:New England Clam Chowder - Delicious. The bowl was full of clams and the soup was just outstanding. Oyster (a dozen) - was so so good. Cocktail sauce, horseradish and lemon accompanied the oysters. One of the best oysters I've ever had. The chef was having problems with one of the oysters (didn't want to stay in the shell) we were playfully teasing him about it and he was such a sport about it. We all had a good laugh and he put an extra oyster in for us. A bakers dozen, all delicious. Plaza Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausage. It's my first pan roast and it was delicious. The brandy and cream was a good combination. All the proteins were cooked perfectly. I specially liked the andouille sausage, a little hint of spiciness worked well with the broth.  I got a number 7 on the heat scale. It was not spicy for me at all. I could not finish my bowl, it was so rich and I had a lot of oysters. Lol. I will have a good lunch tomorrow for sure. I was also able to taste the following dishes. Combo Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab and lobster. My Mom's choice. Zero on the heat scale. It was as good as mine. Tasted the lobster and that was very good. Good amount of it too. Lol. Bouillabaisse - was so good. My brother's dish. 7 on the heat scale. It was spicy. Ouch. But it was really good. The broth was clean and very flavorful. It had shrimp, crab, lobster, mussels & clams. Great broth. I would get this next time. Service was excellent. The chef was friendly and entertaining. The wait. It didn't bother me at all. It was more entertaining than anything else. I got to talk to other people waiting in line and making fun of the situation we were in. I even got to meet a couple of local Yelpers and she told us about a Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant (Komex). The 3 hours went by really fast. It's an experience I won't soon forget and isn't that why we go to these places and go through all the hoops. LolWas it worth it?I say Yes!!We had great serviceWe had great food. We had great conversationsWe had a memorable night. I'll definitely be backI came. I saw. I conquered. I know I'm a late bloomer, but for some reason I kept hearing about their pan roast! So I had to see what the deal was. Located inside the Palace Station, this Oyster Bar seats only 20 people I think. With raving reviews, you would have to come prepared to wait an hour or so. Don't come starving, because you'll be waiting a while. Trust me. It is well worth the wait.We got the infamous PAN ROAST and we tried to change it up to try multiple dishes and also got the ETOUFFEE. Pan Roast. It's all about the Pan Roast. The chef described it on the dot. It is like a lobster bisque with shrimp, crab, and lobster. They also add some rice with it as well. Mhm, and I love me some lobster bisque. You can also choose your level of spice in both dishes which ranges from 1 to 10. 6 is pretty on the dot if you want a nice kick, but not too spicy. The etouffee was delicious as well, in which I also highly recommend if you don't want the pan roast. However, it's just not strong enough to outshine that pan roast. The etouffee also had the shrimp, crap, and lobster.Pan Roast was $19.99 and Etouffee $17.99.I commend the chef for all his hard work, cooking all those dishes at once, non stop, and still able to keep the quality of the dishes top notch. He's truly a master of his craft. I definitely recommend this to be a place to try at least once, but even just talking about it now makes me crave for some pan roast!Oyster Bar is a no doubt a hidden gem in Las Vegas, from what I heard there's an another location in Harrah's but price is higher and probably more crowded since is in the strip.  One thing I really hate is not the restaurant itself but the location. The casino cigarette smell is very strong and almost unbearable.Our group came here in a weeknight, there is only two group before us but the waiting was over 30 minutes long.  There are maybe around 20 seating at top of that the cooking expect to take another 20 or 30 minutes.  The bar setting is a kitchen like those in a ramen shop except you can see the whole kitchen.  Food was careful prepare and you see they not rushing make your food and really take their time and not to avoid short cuts.Pan Roast and some other dish there is a charge of $5 extra per person if the food is been shared, and you cannot do takeout either.  However, you can take back the food if can't finish it.  They gave you dining roll, which are warm and soft.  We only order two item, one is the full serving of Oyster and the second one is the Combo Pan Roast.The oyster was fresh and mouthwatering, juicy and you can really tasted the flavor.  It was day and night quality compare to the oyster found in Bacchanal Buffet. The Pan Roast was delicious and was well balance in term of the soup; it wasn't heavily tomato flavor, the soup come with lobster, crab, and shrimp.  There was little bit of lobster meat, and decent amount of crab, but the shrimp won me over, it was good quality.  The price is far cheaper than the Harrah location but with more limited selection.  What it matter is the quality of food is not compromise here.  So if you are tired of eating of buffet, this would gave you a totally different taste bud.  Just aware expect a wait and the atmosphere is not as pleasant.Linda S. does not wait in long lines for food...except today. Today was about subjecting my family to driving across town to a long wait inside a smoke filled casino which has surely stunted my daughter's growth...all in the name of PAN ROAST. I would have lived the rest of my life ignorant of such a dish, but I became aware of this PAN ROAST in my quest for clam chowder in Las Vegas. The name itself brought images of a sort of pot roast, and of course this is sooo not even close.I've been to Palace Station for conventions and would not have guessed I would be dragging my family here to eat on a Sunday afternoon. Crazy. I was hoping the line wouldn't be too bad, but we ended up waiting 1.50 hours to get our food. About 45 minutes into waiting, I noticed the 21 & over sign, so we inquired about take out since we had our daughter with us. They do offer take out but we would still have to wait. They only have about 18 seats at the bar. 18 seats plus 13 people ahead of us translated into about an hour to be seated.I was especially curious to see how they prepare the pan roast. They use special steam pans and the food is cooked right in front of you. The chef was very jovial and interacted with patrons. Maybe if he just cooked, it would go faster. But the customers seemed to enjoy it and the servers were very nice.I am terrible with remembering chronological order but here is my account anyway. If I missed anything, please feel free to let me know as I would like to attempt this recipe at home :) First came a scoop of butter, then garlic and chopped veges (looked like onions, celery and red peppers). Then I think he added the fresh seafood, followed by a ladle of clam juice. He let it cook until bubbly. Next came the sprinkle of chili powder to taste (1-10 level) and other seasoning...possibly celery seed. He let it cook some more. Then a splash of brandy and white wine. Finally a healthy ladle of a creamy red stock. Cooks it some more until hot and bubbling. The last step that put a smile on everyone's face was when he tips the pan into the bowl, puts a scoop of white rice and serves it up. The long wait is over :) Nom, nom, nom! Be careful not to burn your mouth as it comes out very hot.PAN ROAST is a delicious and creamy seafood stew full of flavor. The combo pan roast has shrimp, lobster and crabmeat. Not at all fishy and very satisfying. The broth is rich and so flavorful,  you won't believe that you finished the entire thing...I know I didn't.The CLAM CHOWDER  is one of the best I've had. Creamy but not heavy. Tender pieces of clams and small little chunks of potato (not too much). Another winning dish here.I am happy to say that I would venture another trip to the Oyster Bar for the PAN ROAST and Clam Chowder.We've been here twice now for the famous pan roast, and the second time I thought my stomach would literally explode.  Let me explain.  This place is #2 on Yelp's Best of Las Vegas restaurant list.  I never even knew what pan roast was until there was a Yelp Talk thread devoted to it.  Pan roast sounded like some kind of pot roast to me where beef or some meat was roasted in a pan, right?  Wrong.  Pan roast is actually like a giant bowl of lobster bisque with crab, lobster, and shrimp, if you order the combo pan roast, which is what I have gotten both times. And, with that giant bowl comes a giant spoon to eat with. Located inside the Palace Station, the Oyster Bar only seats about 16 people at a time because it is indeed a bar.  People line up patiently for their turn to be seated and served, watching their food being prepared in front of them.  The first time we went, we arrived at 3:00pm on a Friday afternoon and waited for 70 minutes.  Really.  The second time, we got there at 2:00pm on a Friday and waited about 30 minutes.  I've heard stories of people waiting for 2 hours or more.  We talked to a couple in line ahead of us who stay at the Palace Station when they visit just so they can eat at the Oyster Bar.  Service is always friendly and it's fun to speak to your fellow diners; everyone is in a good mood there, maybe because they're finally sitting down and getting their fix while other people wait in line behind them.  The bread and butter is good and so is the New England Clam Chowder.  Those are the only other items I've had there, but that's all you need to know, really.  If you've never had the pan roast, you should try it at least once so you can taste what all the fuss is about.  It's so good that you just keep eating it, even though you're full, hence the stomach-about-to-burst feeling.  Just try to go on a weekday in the mid-afternoon or some other odd time; they're open 24 hours.Summary: My SO and I like to dine at Ritter's Steam Kettle in Costa Mesa, California (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ritters-steam-kettle-cooking-santa-ana) and when we found out Oyster Bar was own by the same company we have to give it a try. The wait was long (1 hour 17 minute to be exact) we were behind 5 couples but it was worth it.Food: We had Cold Seafood Combination, New England Clam Chowder, and Combo Pan Roast. It was exquisite, the food tasted phenomenal. I don't know was it because of the long wait or not but at that moment I think it taste better than Ritter's. Service: The Chef was awesome, just watching him prep the pan roast and constantly making sure his patron were satisfied. Nick, the server/host was a tad unprofessional. So the Chef happen to place our dish at the wrong patron, no need to raise your voice at him. The Chef job is to prep and cook not serve. He was doing you a favor, helping you out and when he place my order to the people beside me, you shouldn't have snap at him. It still amaze me how the Chef just stay mellow and apologize to you. Not to mention when you were behind, he even step outside the counter to bust the table and seat the next group. Show some appreciation man. Overall: I always make it a habit to go to Egg & I (http://www.yelp.com/biz/egg-and-i-las-vegas) for breakfast  every time I visit Vegas and now Oyster Bar is a must also. I'm so glad Oyster Bar isn't located on the strip. Imagine if it was, I'm probably looking at half a day wait time. Then again, it is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So that's not bad.Usually I would question the seafood in Las Vegas because its so far from the ocean...but Oyster Bar never disappoints with its freshness! I must mention I lied when I said Bacchanal was the only place in Vegas I would wait in a line for; Oyster Bar inside Palace Station is the only other place I won't complain waiting in line for. Although, I do wish they'd buy up more space on the floor and put in a couple extra tables.. Everything they offer here is ahhmazing -both for the taste and view ;) As in their name, oysters, here are superb and a definite must order when eating here.  I highly suggest the combo pan roast which consists of shrimp, lobster, and crab. And (not or! lol) the gumbo. Just do it. You will not regret it my loves. They charge an extra $5 if you share entrees but its totally worth it because the portions are very generous. There are no take out orders -which although can be frustrating, I do appreciate it because that means your food is as fresh as possible. And for those of you who like to fill up on soft, buttery bread, they offer that while you wait :)Another thing I really enjoy is that you can watch the whole process of your delicious foods being prepared, cooked, plated/bowled right in front of you! The chefs are all so nice too. Makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable. Last, for those of you who are going with another person who can't quite handle the heat like you, you're always welcomed to adjust the level of spice in your dishes. But I'd suggest nudging the ones who can't handle the spice, to the plate ;P seafood is always more yummy when its spicy!I had no idea this place existed until my last couple of months of me living in Las Vegas. I was only able to experience the Oyster Bar one time- but Oh boy! So delicious. Me and my friend decided to go there after a night at the club. She had raved about this place so many times (she's lived in Las Vegas her whole life) so one night we decided to go. It was a week day, and I think we got there around 4 am. One would think this place wouldn't be busy so late (or so early in the morning) but we waited almost 2 hours to sit down. I kept telling my girlfriend. " this place better be good, to wait 2 hours" and after we sat down, and got our entrees- if was definitely worth the wait and was phenomenal!. We ordered the crab pan roast- and I even had enough left over to take home! This place is fabulous, fresh and a Vegas favorite!WORTH EVERY MINUTE IN LINE..Undoubtedly, this has got to be the Ramen Dojo of oyster bars!  Very limited seating around a semi-circle bar, leaving only 18 seats available to the most oyster driven consumer.  One can be left frustrated, but don't relinquish your place in line, as it will be worth the wait.  Give up immediately if you are under 21, as patrons must be 21 years and over to partake in the festivities.  Some encouraging words from my husband as we stood agonizing in line were, "This is the best Oyster Bar in Vegas.  It's worth the wait."  Okay, with that said, all I could do was smile...The afternoon started off with 14 people ahead of us in line; after an hour and twenty minutes, we were next to be called.  We took our seats on the most comfy bar seats ever to caress my derrière.  For you ladies, look under the counter for purse hooks.Today, there was only one cook and one server.  They were working swiftly and without pause.  I've never seen a two-man show move so quickly and efficiently, holding up the "nautical sails" of this oyster bar so effortlessly.Without hesitation and for the numbing effects of our long wait, I ordered a 23-oz Shock Top on tap.  In the rush of things, our server accidentally poured two 23-oz. Shock Tops.  Immediately upon realizing this, she just pushed both beers our way.  Hoorah!  Cheers and smiles flooded our faces, as well as that of our fellow diners; wishing that it had happened to them, they could only be happy for us in return.The fun is at the bar!  Welcome to the "sensory seat"!  Visualize two people gliding across the kitchen "stage" in perfect unison (no collisions today), food prepping, pots clanging, water running, steam rising, stations warming, ladles scooping, plates gliding, beer sliding...and then you can get a glimpse of this oyster bar chasm, cut from a small section in the Palace Station Hotel and Casino.  My hubby has been visiting this establishment for over 20 years!  Needless to say, I left the ordering to him.  We were famished.Here's our tummy bursting feast.  NOTE:  their potions are fairly large...*Oysters on the half shell ~ These were quite the mouthful.  If you prefer tiny ones, I would suggest not ordering these.  They were sizably squishy and yummy, and accompanied by a cocktail sauce with horseradish.*Combo Pan Roast ~ This is one of the dishes for which they are known.  The Combo includes a generous amount of shrimp, crab and lobster.  First boiled in water, then a special mix of sauces and seasonings are added to the seafood pot.  It only teases and entices as one sees it cooking right before their eyes.  The boiled seafood broth is richly savory.  It is accompanied by white rice.  State whether you would like it on top of your pan roast or on the side; I prefer it on the side.  *New England Clam Chowder ~ smooth and rich with pieces of decadent clams.One more note about the BEER.  The 23 oz. glass is yours to KEEP!  Refills are half price.  Refill it before you leave the bar, as you can carry it with you as you head out to gamble.  Enjoy the feeling of the moment.  In California, we just don't carry out our unfinished drinks.  It just doesn't happen!  Cheers!Hands down on their gumbo. Despite their long lines during lunch, dinner and late night craves, food is great!Here's a tip, don't wait until it's lunch time or dinner time when EVERYONE starts running to get in line, go in between those times so you don't have to wait. I would suggest if you are waiting in line with a group of people? Take turns go grab a drink, have a drink in hand or you better be buzzed at least while waiting in line, because it ain't going to be fun when you are sober, and that is when you will probably start complaining. Better drink up buddies!Ordered the Seafoodbouillabaisse  gumbo (enough to share with two) - wayyy good. Enjoyed watching them make it. Fresh seafood, cooked well and seasoned well. They will ask for how spicy you will like your food, so adjust your taste buds. Recommend oyster shooters and raw oysters! Always ask what kind they have, because it's always different. Don't forget to grab a beer while at it. You cannot eat seafood without a glass of your favorite beer. Don't recommend group since it's just a small bar area to eat, may have to wait longer. Do recommend coming here in the middle of the night, their late night specials are awesome! Clubbing late and crave for food and more drinks? This be the place, but beware of long lines. Cannot wait to come back to try the late happy hour.Omg this friggen place lol. So frustrating and yet... I couldn't get myself to lower the rating. Geezus, I have never waited so long for some food.So ya this place is open 24/7 which means that you have plenty of time to go...... but it doesn't matter cos apparently there's a line 24/7 lol. I didn't have a choice but to wait, I mean.. I'm not a Vegas native, I live in Cali, I would probably only be in Vegas on the weekends.... so YA no matter how I do this, I would have to wait in line. So I did. For 3 hours... and more waiting for food after we ordered lol.I went with my bf so he gambled a bit while I waited in line. He won like $550 sooooo I guess technically dinner was on the hotel! YAY!We ordered a pan roast EACH, and I suppose due to our frustration from waiting, we just decided we should order a f*ckload because we're not gonna be doing this very often. So 2 pan roasts, 1 Alaskan chowder, and 1 gumbo. For 2 people. That's right.So obviously I F**KING LOVED everything, or else I wouldn't have given it 5 stars. The pan roast was AMAZING. I ordered the combo (shrimp, crab, lobster) and an 8 on the spicy scale, which was deliciously spicy. I could've gone with a 9 or 10 probably and it would've been bomb also. It was perfect with the rice. Damn, it was seriously so good........... I dunno how else to explain. Now I get why people wait so damn long for this.The Alaskan chowder...... wow. No lie, it was probably the best chowder I've had lol. It's filled with not just clams, but SHRIMP, LOBSTER, and CRAB?! I mean come on, give the other chowders a chance! But no seriously, it will blow them all out of the water (pun alert). So tasty and seriously loaded with seafood. The gumbo was also ridiculously tasty. I personally LOVE gumbo, and this one might just be my new favorite. We ordered a 5 on the spicy scale so it wasn't as spicy as I'd like, but sooooooooo goood. You definitely need that rice with it also, cos it can get VERY... flavorful? lol. It's also filled with so much seafood - lobster, crab, etc. and sausages!The best part about these dishes is they don't skimp on the seafood. I was a little overwhelmed by how many FAT lobster pieces I found! Totally worth what they're charging.So obviously we had plenty of leftovers, and I was eating them for like... the next 4 days I think LOL. And dude, they were STILL extremely tasty. I thought I would be sick of it but I was truly sad when I had no more left.......... :(Wow I waited in line for like 1.5 hours, and I can't wait to come back for more. Am I out of my mind? Yes, yes I am. Because I actually went back and waited 2.5 hours for a second time. Usually I feel like waiting in line for such a long time is stupid, but the excruciating wait makes the pan roast taste just that much better when you get it. Like the feeling you get when hard work pays off. A boat load of spices and a mountain of seafood is doused in the tomato cream sauce to make the seafood pan roast. Loaded with big chunks of crab and lobster. This is one entree you MUST NOT divert from. You've already waited for such a long time, don't be a fool and not order the pan roast! It's the best pan roast I've ever had thus far.Heard there wouldn't be as long of a wait if you come during odd hours; This statement is false. You can always potentially hit a rush of some sort of rush and wait 2 hours due to limited seating.  Last time I was here at 3 am. and there was a family that came before us, ended up waiting nearly 2.5 hours. Here's a tip, give yourself ample time to wait in line, wait for your food too cook, time to eat the food, and time to get the check. It's usually just a 3 people crew, and they gotta do everything. So don't come here in a rush. You can thank me later.uno de mis restaurantes preferidos cuando quiefo comer Ostras o see food. Producto fresco, bien preparado y una atencion espectacular.Si vas porque pasabas por alli y a ver que tal, posiblemente te aburras esperando, pero si te puede la tentacion y te vas a echar unos dolares a las maquinas... ahh se sienteee que fue a sevilla perdio las ostras jejeje asi que si pueses trata de reservar o hazte amigo el simpatico cheff..Being drunk and hungry, boyfriend and I needed food asap. It's nice that this place is 24/7. From the morning we checked out, there was already a line forming so we thought we'd skip and wait until midnight-ish. After drinking and gambling, we come back at midnight to check on the line. HOLY POO! There's still a line forming. Whatever, I'll wait if it's this good. I think there was a line partly because there's only like 12 seats around the bar/kitchen. With 1 server and 1 cook. So picture it. I think we waited for almost 1 1/2 hour until we finally got seated. For this wait, heck yeah we are gonna indulge ourselves! Given its name, "Oyster Bar" we just had to have oysters. And then their infamous Pan Roast. He also ordered the cioppino, too. Oysters: Below average. Didn't seem fresh and very fishy taste. Good thing we only ordered half a dozen. Pan Roast: Solid 4 stars. I've only had Pan Roast at another place back at the Anaheim Packing District and that was bomb. This one was excellent, too. But the overpowering sauce made it very hard to eat the whole thing. They give you one scoop of rice, but please do get more rice because you'll need it! Cioppino: Average. Nothing really stood out. It was pretty spicy, so watch out you non-spicy eaters. Both the Pan Roast and Cioppino came with lots of seafood. Worth your buck. Cool concept and pretty nice experience as you get to sit and watch your food be prepared in front of you. Price is normal and not overpriced. Be patient because there WILL be a wait at anytime of the day. Tip: Come here and just get the Pan Roast, skip everything else :)Oyster Bar is more of a pilgrimage than a destination, and I finally managed to sit at the altar early this morning.After a fun, lengthy night catching up with friends, we decided to replenish our reserves at the vaunted Oyster Bar at Palace Station. I thought that I was "foodie" in our group not to have tried Oyster Bar yet. Fortunately, I was able to share my embarrassment with one other person..The wait in line was ~90 minutes starting at around 2 a.m. I was a little surprised because it was on the tail end of "Sunday" night, which isn't generally as busy as Friday or Saturday evening. We miraculously got our group of six seated simultaneously in six consecutive seats. Hooray! Service was a little bit on the slow side, but I got the impression that they just work at a particular pace (maybe impaired by the hour of the day, who knows) and pump out their product, and as long as the food is good, people will find other lapses acceptable.Some of us started with oysters (half dozen for $10 from 1-9 a.m., but a full dozen is always $19.99). Some were plumper (and therefore more delicious) than others, but they were at minimum pretty good. Definitely add some of the cocktail sauce / horseradish mixture and squeeze some lemon to complement the natural flavor.We each ordered the almost-synonymous product, pan roast. My particular choice was the combo pan roast ($23.99), which comes with shrimp, crab, and lobster. I was surprised that they ask for a 1-10 spicy level, and I picked my usual 3. I may have actually been able to handle a 4 this time. The thick, creamy soup had mainly savory and spicy flavors, not so much anything sweet or sour. Each protein was well-represented, and there was a reasonable amount of rice that I ended up stirring evenly into the bowl. The portion was large enough to take home some leftovers.I don't really have a point of comparison, so this could technically be the best pan roast that I've ever had. However, my general impression is that it was great... but it was less than mindblowing. I expected it to hit all the right notes, so it's hard to say objectively that the flavor components that I tasted add up to a 5-star combination. I will add that the leftovers seemed to taste a little better the next day, so maybe I was just out of it last night.It was certainly worth that first try, and I will gladly return with friends if the fancy strikes them.This place is pretty amazing. A 10-12 seat dining bar opened 24 hours. 5 of us were here at 5am and there was a line. Craziness!They have Moonlight Specials from 1am-9am. Half dozen oysters for $10? Yes please!Also the pan roast is a must-get. The Palace pan roast comes with shrimp, crab, chicken and sausage. The cook makes it in these customized pans right in front of your eyes. So cool! The portion is huge!Waiting to be seated takes a while. So does the food since it's made fresh. But all worth it.I'm very impatient and wait times could be as long as an hour or LONGER! It is insanely irritable.. BUT the food definitely makes up for it all!Service is a hit or miss. The times we've gone are usually between 1am to 3am the latest.. There's always ONE waiter, ONE cook, 5-6 kettles, and seating only about 12 people at a time! A couple of my favorites :*My go-to CRAB PAN ROAST - creamy, tomatoey, chunks of crab goodness served with steamed rice.*ALASKAN CHOWDER - New England Style with shrimp, crab and lobster.*OYSTERS are about $20 a dozen.This place is definitely a must try at least once in your life! And if you like it.. You'll be like me.. Finding yourself craving this type of seafood comfort food all the time!The high Yelp rating and the Cajun theme was good enough for me to want to try.  Then there was a line.  Only about 20 folks in it.  Didn't seem like a bad thing, until you realize there is only 20 seats.  No tables, just a bar.  We were warned that our wait would be over an hour.  That was enough for me to change my mind.  But the folks in front of us told us that it was worth the wait.  So we waited.  And we waited.  The line really didn't seem to move at all.  After a god long time, we finally got the front position and still had to wait another 15 minutes.  This place better be good.  OMG, it was.  Wait.  I'm not kidding, Wait.  It was super amazing  I have eaten in a lot of great places in Vegas.  A lot.  This may be on the top of my list.  I was truly blown out by the flavors.  We all ordered different dishes, so it gave me the ability to sample most of them.  They all were equally great.  I can't wait to return, even if I have to wait and hour and half again.I have no idea what the hype is about this place. They only have 18 seats around the counter. The wait time is horrendous. We waited for an hour and a half to be seated. Then, we waited for another half an hour for the food to come out after ordering. As I was waiting in line to be seated, I saw that they do takeout. I went up to the counter to order takeout, and was told that I still needed to wait in the same line as the seating line to do takeout. If that's the case, what's the sense in doing takeout, you're waiting the same amount of time.Almost everyone I know loves their pan roast. It was mediocre at best for me. I ordered the Lobster Pan Roast.  You get to pick the spiciness level from 1 to 10. I chose level four and it wasn't spicy at all. It came in a creamy tomato broth, which was really tasty. However, the seafood is not fresh as stated. I could tell from the texture of the lobster that it was frozen before being prepared. On top of that, I only got a few pieces of lobster, not worth the $21.99 I paid for it. It was interesting to see them prepare the food in front of you. They have these metal pots that they cook the food in. First, they cook the seafood. Then, they pour in the cooking wine. Last, they put in the sauce.My husband doesn't like seafood, so he ordered the Caesar salad. It was a large plate and the greens were fresh. I really liked the salad. The workers here were really nice. They didn't have a sense of urgency, though. They knew the line was long, and took their sweet time bussing the dishes and seating the people. They didn't really care if people left.5pm, 4am, 6am, 12pm,.. No matter what time you go there will be a wait. Extremely limited seating. First time I had it, it honestly was not that great. However the next couple of times, I'm definitely hooked on the pan roast. Another dish I recommend is the linguine with clams. It's light yet flavorful. Portions are pretty large so you can share among a few people.
VinciTorio's=My friends and I decided to come here for dinner. I ordered the Meatless Veggie Hoagie which contained grilled spinach, tomatoes, cheese, fried onions and mushrooms. I noticed that the chips tasted homemade which were quite tasty and crunchy fresh. My friends had meat items, so I didn't get to try their dishes. They did say that they enjoyed their meal, so no complaints there. Our server was very attentive and kept our glasses full and the entertainer was fabulous. There was an older gentleman that played the accordion the entire time we were there. My friends paid for everything which I am grateful for, so I didn't even see the bill.  Isn't that sweet? So I can't comment on how much it cost.01/19/11Didn't realize it's been a couple of years since my last visit to Vincitorio's until I decided to have dinner here this afternoon.  Arrived around 530p, and there were maybe one or two tables occupied.  I was seated at the first two-top near the front door, which put me right next to a young woman, and her acoustic guitar, who was to provide the live entertainment that would eventually start at 6p.  Her original work was pretty good, and she took special requests, as well.  (She later told me that she was going to be playing there again the next week.  I hope she's a recurring performer there, bec. I wouldn't mind hearing her voice and her guitar-playing again!)Tonight's dinner composed of great complimentary buttered garlic bread, a glass of Alois Lageder Riff pinot grigio 2008, and Roasted butternut squash ravioli, which came w/ choice of soup or salad (I chose the latter, w/ blue cheese crumbles and a side of house-made blue cheese dressing).  The salad was very fresh and crisp, and I loved it w/ just the blue cheese crumbles- no need for the dressing!  I enjoyed the bread and salad too much, I think-- I ate almost the whole salad and had to order a second batch of garlic bread!  The roasted butternut squash is one of eight handmade pasta entrees on their dinner menu and comes w/ an addicting four-cheese cream sauce composed of parmigiano, fontina, pecorino, and gorgonzola, which are among my top favorite cheeses!  Now, I will admit that this dish did not make a great visual first impression w/ me (check out the photos), but I knew better than to judge a book by its cover. Yes, it didn't look as appetizing as it could have, but I assure you, the aroma that emanated from this dish was intoxicating, and the butternut squash inside the oh-so-tender ravioli was cooked to perfection!  Its roasted sweetness and the lovely four-cheese cream sauce made a matchless pair!  It was difficult to curb my desire to eat all four pieces...  Mmm... I was in heaven!  As dinner rolled on, the restaurant started to get quite packed w/ what seemed to be regulars, and it's very easy to see why-- I hadn't finished w/ my meal yet, and I was already looking forward to returning the next week!  (Alas, I am forever in search for other great venues to try, so I postponed my next trip back- Valentine's Day, as it turned out!)Thank you, Vincitorio's, for a fantastic evening!3.5 stars with room to improve!Recently had a lovely dinner at VinciTorio's with Yelp pals Jim and Audrey W.  Although there was a problem with our reservation not being carried over from one notebook to another (huh?), it was easily corrected with a short (well maybe not so short) wait.  While waiting, I caught a glimpse of their patio which looks very promising for a future visit.Once seated, we were soon greeted with tasty garlic bread.  I'm sure at some point, they considered charging us for the bread given our repeated requests for refills!  Our server was not only knowledgeable about the menu, but very familiar with the wine list as well.  When I asked for a description of my chosen Verdicchio, his description was spot-on and I was not disappointed.I was somewhat disappointed with my entree, Salmon & Shrimp Vincitorio's.  Described as "Fresh Atlantic salmon filets and jumbo shrimp, sauteed with mushrooms, leeks, in our light cream sauce with a touch of tomato, served over fettuccine," I was a little surprised to find more than a touch of tomato.  It was more of a tomato cream sauce, although still light and very good.  The fettuccine was delicious even though I don't believe this particular pasta is hand-made.  My complaint is with the seafood. The salmon filets were actually pieces of filet which would have been okay had they not been so dry.  The jumbo shrimp consisted of 3 shrimp which were also slightly overdone.  At $19.95, this may have been the priciest item on the menu, but probably was not the best.Dessert was definitely the star of the show.  The tiramisu was not only a generous portion, it was fantastic.  The panna cotta was smooth and creamy, with no gelatinous texture.  The gelato covered in a chocolate shell was liked a gourmet version of a DQ dip cone.  This was probably my favorite.  I would return to VinciTorio's for the desserts alone!@AudreyRLWyatt and I ( @canyonjunkie ) met good @YelpPhx friends Heather C and Ryan C for dinner some time ago.  I really am remiss in catching up my reviews.I will try to do better in the future and as penance I will UFC several orange heads.Anyway, I'll cut to the chase and break down Vinci Torio's thus:Dessert         5 starsDinner           3 starsService          4 starsAtmosphere   4 starsThat makes a total of 16.  Maybe someday I'll put together some sort of restaurant scoring matrix with weighted category rankings...Great desserts, very good service and ambiance, the dinner entrees were good but did not wow me.I was in the mood for pizza--not crappy, junk pizza, but a nice pie that I could sit down with and eat with a knife and fork if I wanted to.  After dropping off my wife and daughter at the movies (it was a mommy-daughter movie night), I began searching. . . VinciTorio's, right here next to the movie theatre.  Okay, let's try this.Good service, checkOutdoor seating with those big gas heater thingies on chilly nights, checkNice ambiance, checkGood pizza, checkKeep in mind that's just a check, and not a star for the pizza.  There was little or no sauce on this pizza, which kept me from enjoying it as much as I would have liked to.  Not a bad taste, and maybe you will like it better than I did, but I like saucy pizzas, and they don't have them here, I guess, unless you ask for them.Everything was fresh and the pizza was well-made, with a nice crust.  No issues there.  The three stars is from the pizza snob in me who wants that burst of spiced tomato taste along with the pepperoni and sausage.  Nonetheless, I ate until I was stuffed.  I'll come back some time to see how the pasta is.I came here on Valentine's day. Unfortunately, the atmosphere was less than romantic. We were elbow to elbow with another couple. They crammed in as many two tops as possible, and doubled the prices on their menu, in honor of this day of love. It was obvious their only concern was gaining as much revenue as possible, at the expense of their guests. The food was awful. I feel bad saying that, but it is the best description. I had the veal. It tasted like a microwave dinner. The noodles were over cooked and mushy. How does that happen at an Italian restaurant? As a cook, I expect better, especially when I'm paying through the nose. I didn't come out on Valentine's day to rub elbows with somebody that I don't know. Horrible experience, will never visit again.I have been putting this review off, so time to do it. I am a little behind. But, this is a place that I would go back to any time, and a place I really liked.It is close in the area to us. It is a clean place that smells really good when you walk in. The smell of Italian food cooking fresh is always good.I got the Italian Wedding soup on my last visit. Along with Garlic knots and the Steak Salad. Wow, what a filling meal.It was really good! I am not usally that into the soup when I go out to dinner, but this is worth it. Very good.The salad had a lot of dark lettuce in it. Which is something that we all like.The wine is reasonably priced. Service was great, and the owner even comes to greet you.I like it ,it is a nice place ,and decorated very nice as well.It is good for groups if you call in advance and lots of parking as it is in a shopping center.I hate to say it because I am a huge fan of Philly's Famous in Chandler; but, VinciTorio's Cheesesteak Hoagie is better!Typically I would never order a Cheesesteak Sandwich at a nice Italian Restaurant, but boy am I glad I did today.  I wasn't in the mood for pasta (which they have an "all you can eat" buffet that looked delicious!), so I defaulted to a sandwich.Now, I'm not saying definitely order the Cheesesteak; but, if you really like them and you are not in the mood for one of their many other fantastic entrees, then give it a try!  Trust me when I tell you, you won't be disappointed.
Panera Bread=Went on Sunday 10-25-15 around 4PM.  This Panera Bread is located in front of the Galleria Mall in Henderson.  I've loved Panera Bread since high school and I come to this location probably once a month.  Having said that, this is undeniably the shittiest Panera Bread location I've ever seen.  It is just so filthy!!!  The sidewalk outside is littered with food, pigeon poo, and cigarette butts.  The windows and doors look like they have never been cleaned.  The furniture is all beat up and the floors are icky.  I have never been in the bathroom there because I'm afraid.  I always get my food to-go from this location. $16.40 got me a meal for me and my boy.  I got the "you-pick-two" with a Power Kale Chicken Caesar salad and an asiago steak sandwich, and I got the boy buttered noodles with a yogurt.  My favorite part of my meal was the warm piece of baguette that comes with it.  That thing is heaven with about 10 packets of their real  butter slathered on it.  I got my food and went over to the drink area to grab twenty, er, I mean, a couple of butter packets and there was an employee there refilling the tea.  I know she saw me walk up, but she moved a giant container of tea right in front of the butter.  So I had to stand there and awkwardly wait for her to finish.  Three stars because they got my order right, the food was delicious, and I didn't get sick.  Step up your game, Panera.  You gotta clean!
Bobby Q=If it's your fist visit, try a combo platter. Such as the beef brisket, sliced pork and St. Louis ribs. The brisket is especially tender, juicy and flavorful. The ribs are also very good. The sides at Bobby Q are also good-sized and tasty. The beans and mac 'n cheese are especially good. One final note: after you pay your bill, you're presented with a "Thank-Q" brown bag with fresh-baked cake donuts. Nice touch!Best, BBQ, ever.It made the 12-hour drive worth it.  Between three people, we had the Hog Heaven: chicken, St. Louis ribs, babyback ribs, and brisket.The sides were awesome too!  All of them!  The service was also excellent.  Manager came by and asked if everything was alright and the place was packed.Afterwards, we went to the lounge that's connected to the restaurant called Q-Lounge.  There were a lot of fat chicks.Apparently the owners traveled all across America and sampled different types of BBQ and thereafter, created Bobby-Q.Wow, the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had. I had the coleslaw as my side which was better than any other I can remember.     I've heard that the ribs and brisket are very good too.   Reasonable prices during happy hour.They have a lounge/bar/dance club attached to the dining room and it was much nicer than I expected.  Our server said Tuesdays are their busiest nights in the lounge/dance club area, (Tuesdays nights WTF?)    Interesting mix of people when I was there on a Wed. night.   Not the Tempe crowd, or Scottsdale crowd, or even the downtown hipster crowd.  It's the METROCENTER crowd which is just a mix of regular city folk.Wow , what a lovely surprise .  On  New Years Night  my husband suddenly  decides we are going out to eat, super. But low and behold everywhere we want to go to are closed for New Years Day. Bummer  .( how can you enjoy Glendale Glitters without food?)   So at the last minute I  remember Bobby Q's  hmm wonder if they are open .. yes and and thank you ! We begin smelling wonderful things in the parking lot. We are quickly seated and have the sweetest server. Meal starts with our cornbread which was moist , sweet and tasty, served in a flat style not a muffin not a loaf...hmmm. But good. Our daughter ends up with chicken strips ( very plentiful ) and macaroni and cheese--which my husband finished off and adored. Her meal was only 4.99  a steal! Hubby and I shared a three meat combo meal with awesome ribs, brisket and pulled pork . We opted for the spicy BBQ sauce which we both liked.   Our sides were a yummy coleslaw with pecans and roasted corn that they shave off the cob and saute after roasting wow. Between the food , excellent service ( thanks Cassie?, Charise?  aaww  I  can't remember )  and peaceful ambiance , we really enjoyed our meal. We will be back.Still delicious , even better service..I swear we had a waiter and two servers working our table..love it! Right now Bobby-q's has a special offer / prix fixe menu .. choice of appetizer , 2 dinners, and  a choice of 1 desert ( it's big)    27.99  not bad ...Once again I love my meat smoked ... yea I said it.  Brisket was falling  off the bone tender, ribs good , love the coleslaw which is chopped into tiny pieces. lightly season and not greasy . The Q roll appetizers were a tasty start and kept us happy. Of course the complimentary cornbread is really good.. maybe my favorite in the valley.  BTW Ladies bathroom is cool  in a stainless sink overkill kinda way...Came here on a whim, and fell in love with the place.Our server Raymond was super friendly and commented repeatedly on how they Love Yelp here.  Hey Gabi, this would be a great place for an official Elite Event, and they have an attached nightclub!On to the food.  Ray suggested the Q-Rolls appetizer, and it didn't disappoint.  They're like flautas made with brisket, accompanied by two dipping sauces.  Simply Amazing!Ray also recommended the whole hog entree with brisket, pulled-pork and baby backs.  It was large enough for my wife and I to share.  Delicious and filling.  My daughter ordered the half chicken plate, and their fries are superb.We finished it off with a peach cobbler, and to our surprise, we were presented with a bag of Thank-Q's (accompanying our check), which were freshly made dough balls coated in cinnamon & sugar.  Very good!If we lived closer, we'd be a fixture in this place.O M F GI just had a killer burger... Try the Smokehouse. It is a 9oz hand pattied burger grilled as you wish with cheddar, fried onion strings, killer bacon and a thousand island type dressing. It also had some BBQ sauce on there too.  It was so juicy and freaking good.... Who cares that the service was great, or that the mac n cheese was good, who cares about the kids chicken strips and the free corn bread and doughnuts... uggghh man that was good.Steak and Crab? Yes, please.For 15 bucks? Whhhhaaaaa? Hell yes! These are questions my friend asked, when she wondered if I wanted to go to Bobby Qs the other night. Honestly, I did not get my hopes up, and prepared myself for a rough ride home. Yes, in case you are wondering, I have had some bad experiences with Seafood.We decided to sit on the patio and were promptly attended to. I ordered a bloody mary, the rest beers. The bloody mary was freaking tasty. Spicy and tasty. We all ended up ordering the Steak and Crab special. I ordered a Caesar to start with. The Caesar was good. Nothing amazing, but solid.Then there came the Crab. Half a snow crab, with an 8oz Steak and a side of roasted corn. As I started drooling, my stomach did a backflip from excitement. The crab was awesome! Not chewy or fishy tasting. The steak was great as well, and the corn was nice and smokey.The only negative...the server was a bit forgetful at times. Honestly, once the crab and I had our moment...I no longer cared.."You smell like smoke."  That's the greeting I received when coming home from a terrific UYE organized by BBQ lovin' Deb L.  And at that point, if my stuffed self didn't already know it, I knew I had just eaten some damn good food.Upon arriving, I had a deja vu moment of being there before...a long time ago, sipping a virgin strawberry daiquiri (I told you it was a long time ago), and thinking I was all that.  Yes, it was Bobby McGee's at one time!  So flash forward 25 years, and I'm having a strawberry lemonade "adult" beverage, which was quite tasty btw, in the company of 20 fabulous Yelpers!We were given corn bread pretty quickly, and it was devoured pretty quickly.  A little on the crumbly side, but delicious nonetheless.  Because my husband could not join us, I went with the 2-meat combo (brisket and pulled pork) so there would be some left to take him.  Yeah, that's my story.  I was a happy eater to find I could order my meats sauce free!  The brisket was good, but a little too fatty.  The pork was really good, however; adequately seasoned and smokey.  I tried the spicy sauce on the table, and found it to be just right, just a little kick to it.  For sides, the mac and cheese was creamy and not lacking in sauce.  Yum.  The roasted corn was really really good.  If corn always tasted that good, I would move to Iowa.Our service was great and they were accommodating for our request for separate checks with a 20% gratuity.  Our service was actually good enough, especially given a party that size, that I tipped extra.  And I did refrain from eating all of my meal, so that I could have a nice lunch the next day when my husband refused my offer of the leftovers.  Only problem was he didn't refuse.  And I went hungry the next day, wishing I had eaten all of my meal when I had the chance.Complimentary cornbread and donuts.Nuff said. OK. There's more! Like the Ronco commercial..."But wait, there's MORE!"We had trouble finding the front door. Looks it's sweltering hot and our brains were in meltdown. We entered the To Go door which is a very tiny room for take out service only. The lovely employee upon hearing our door troubles said we could come behind the counter and enter the dining room. What? We don't have to go outside again? Love her. She led us right to a perfect table and provided us with menus. Great service! Make it happen!I was surprised and impressed by the upscale decor. Kind of reminded me of the House of Blues in West Hollywood...made to look like a shack from the outside but quite luxurious inside. Nice. Our server Kellee was Killer!!! I wanted to snatch her away. Oops, I said snatch. Anyway, the pulled pork sandwich with mac n cheese was Bobby Q perfection as was Rickie's brisket sandwich with shoestring fries...the fries...so so yummy! Sweet tea, actually, well, how do you say...should be called super, really, alotta, sweet tea. Sweeter than Paula Deen's pie. Wait. That didn't sound right. Bobby Q. I wuv you! P.S. Did I detect a little Velveeta in the mac n cheese? Me thinks so and ME LIKEY!That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome. 5 stars. The smoked corn was a little Meh... it was oily like not butter oily... not a huge fan of the texture either. I like corn crunchy and it was not. Service was great. I did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing, but bugs have to eat too right? (still 5 stars lol)Here in Cali, we call it barbecue, or BBQ!In Arizona, they call it Bobby Q.Well, maybe not all Arizonians call it that, but a good number of them do. When I reached out to some AZ Yelpers to find out where I can find some serious BBQ in Phoenix, almost every person mentioned Bobby's name. Bobby Q is a huge place that looks more like an upscale steakhouse rather than a BBQ joint. The inside is dimly lit and has a fancy, upscale decor. They also have two big bars and a banquet room. Right when our party of four was seated we received some delicious house made cornbread with sweet butter. After devouring the yummy cornbread we ordered two appetizers, their Q-Rolls and their Fire Pie Pizza topped with beef brisket. The Q-Rolls were similar to those pigs in a blanket everyone loves as a child.  Instead of mini hot dogs, Bobby stuffs the little flaky pastries with juicy beef brisket. The Q-Rolls were incredible alone but when dipped in the chipotle sauce that comes with the app, it gave the rolls an even more fabulous taste.  The beef brisket pizza was good but not great. They put lots of cheese on the pizza but not enough Bobby Q sauce or beef brisket. For dinner I ordered their three meat combo with pulled pork, beef brisket and St. Louis spare ribs. My fiancé ordered the Prime Rib with Chimichuri shrimp dinner. My dinner was big enough to feed at least two people. Every meat was phenomenal. The pulled pork and beef brisket were both juicy, tender and incredibly flavorful. The St. Louis spare ribs were falling-off- the-bone tender and had a nice smoky flavor. My girls Prime Rib was also really good but her shrimp were burnt, rubbery, and had almost no Chimichuri sauce on them, which upset her a little bit. Once your dinners are brought to your table, they also bring out two big containers filled with warm sweet Bobby Q sauce and spicy Bobby Q sauce. Both of these Bobby Q sauces were great but since I'm a huge fan of spicy I preferred the spicy sauce over the sweet one. My dinner came with three sides while my girls came with two. These are the sides we got.Mac and cheese (we both got this) Pecan ColeslawLoaded Baked PotatoRoasted CornAll of these sides were great but my favorite of the bunch was the Mac and Cheese. I don't remember what my other dinner companions ordered but I do remember they all said they loved what they had.To wash down all this great Bobby Q, we all had huge glasses of their house made sweet tea, which was super sweet and delicious.Even though everyone was full, we all decided to share a slice of their Sub Zero Banana Cream Pie for dessert. This pie was served ice cold and was more like a piece of banana cheese cake than a regular banana cream pie. This pie had an amazing banana flavor and was topped with lots of caramel sauce. To our surprise, after we finished the pie, our server brought us some home made complimentary cinnamon sugar donuts. These little things were wonderful, I just wish I would have been a little less full so I could have enjoyed them more. The service and prices here were both great. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. Since it was our first time there he really helped us out by making suggestions and telling us what their most popular dishes are. The prices were very reasonable seeing that you get so much food.  If your a fan of BBQ then I guarantee you will be a fan of Bobby Q. If you ever visit Phoenix you have to check this place out.Why oh why have I waited so long to come here on a Friday night? You get a a fabulous little mini buffet that has tri tip, nachos, shrimp, cheese, and its free? Oh and the drink prices? Two very strong drinks, $4.50 each? What? Are you kidding me? Tons of people which makes for great people watching, great food, good happy hour prices? Again why did I wait so long? Oh I will be back. That is for certain.My waistline theories go like this: if it's free, the calories don't count. This goes for items like free bread, butter, candies at the end of the meal and especially the free donuts they give me before I leave Bobby Qs. Those definitely do not count towards my waistline. Bobby Qs is a your run of the mill BBQ restaurant with fun (and slightly cheesy) decor, fatty yet satisfying and tasty food and overall a fun time. This restaurant is hidden off of random side streets but the catch is that you can see it from the 17. Like I said, the food here is fatty but pretty good. Expect BBQ food with a chain-like feel. The atmosphere is the same. In summary, if you're in the area and get hungry, this is a great option. I think it would also be fun for a low key group dinner. Plus, they serve those donuts. Yum.Went out on a date Friday night, again he picked the place, and it was a non-chain place, which scored him some points, but Bobby Q's gives the feeling a chain place, I have never been and I never knew about the Bobby McGee's that used to be there, I'm not from Arizona, and wasn't around during that time.   After I went to Bobby Q's I actually looked at some the reviews from fellow yelpers and man I am sorry I missed out on the roasted corn, I am going to have to try that next time I go!  Our server's Melissa was a good, but she got tractable, like we made bets to see how long it would take before she came back to our table to check on us, it was about every 10 mins. Now don't get me wrong I love good service, but there is a difference between being pushy and good.Like I have said before, Im a visual person and when I saw on the drink menu that yummy looking drink called Strawberry Qlada, I knew I had to get that, when it came to the table, it was just as beautiful in person, pinks, red, white, pineapple & cherry garish, it was a delish drink!The round corn breads were a sweet surprise! I love me some cornbread! And with the whipped butter, what could be better, other than drowning them in hot bowl of chili! I ordered the 8oz center cut top sirloin with mac & cheese, ranch beans & mushrooms & onions for my steak!   I had asked Melissa if she liked the mac & cheese and she is it was the bestselling item on the menu, oh that's good, but that didn't answer my question lol but I wound up ordering them anyways, and they were good, but it wasn't great! Yes it's made with 5 different cheese, its creamy and it's like eating velveeta mac n cheese, not my fav but if that's your thing, then it's up your alley! The ranch beans were good, it was little peppery and sweet, which is a great combo for me!  The steak was the perfect amount for me! It was cooked to perfection, it was tender and tasty! The mushrooms and onions were sautéed just right, not too soft not to hard!   Had I read reviews I would have known at the end of the meal they give us some sweet donuts! How cool is that! Any places that offers sweet little donuts is alright with me!I don't usually like to give a review after only having been to a place once but... I have never felt so welcome, so well treated, and so satisfyingly full after one visit!I have definitely found my new favorite carnivorous dining place. My friend Don S. checked in here one day and I asked him if he was clubbing because I had been to the lounge with my cousins before but didn't know much about the restaurant since it had changed from Bobby McGee's back in the day. He laughed! Told me they have an amazing burger! Say what? Bobby Q is a five minute drive from my house! How did I not know this? I went last night with my son and let me tell you, one of the most pleasant dining experiences of my life! I ordered the smokehouse burger. It is 50 cents more than the regular burger and probably a hundred times better because it has bacon! Haha. I love my meat still pink in the middle and when I ask for something m.rare I would like it m.rare and preferably closer to the rare side. The chef hooked up my patty perfect! One of the best burger I have ever had! My little boy ordered the mac off the kids menu (love kids menus), and he loved it so much he ordered up a second helping! Sean our waiter was so kind and helpful and playful with the boy. It's so much more enjoyable when the staff is good with kids. Laura, who must have been management, came out to check on us mid meal and was also super sweet. She brought me out a sample of the brisket. Melty and delicious and bursting to the brim with flavor. She also told my son that if he tried the brisket she would bring him desert on the house! How cool is that?!? Of course he tried it, but more importantly he loved it! Then came.... Death by Chocolate! Its like an ice cream sandwich with brownie book ends! And so large that I only let Buddha tackle one part of it. I cannot wait to come back and try more off the menu! Oh did I mention that they give you free donuts at the end of your meal? I mean who can eat donuts after this kind of meal! But they are just as tasty the next morning! YUM!So impressed!A good friend of mine -who's opinion on Q I highly respect- was in town a few months ago and stopped into Bobby Q's (BQ), and he couldn't stop raving about it. I've been jonesing all week to come check it out, but I figured I'd wait until my wife got into town. Well, I finally got my chance and I was giddy as a school girl. I was actually able to make a reservation through OpenTable on the Yelp app, and I'm sure glad we did. Upon our arrival at 5:30 the place was already packed, but by thetime we left at 7 there was a hoard of people flooding out into the street--and for good reason! Enough jibber-jabber--on to the food! I ordered the Three Meat Combo and that comes with two sides and some of BQ's Cornbread.Sides:Mac and Cheese- This might easily be the creamiest, most decadent Mac & Cheese I've ever had. They use something similar to Velveeta Cheese to coat it, and I'm not slamming Velveeta. It's so rich I couldn't finish it. 3.75*Pecan Coleslaw- I'm very picky about my slaw; I don't want it too creamy, sweet, or bitter and this was absolutely perfect! I also loved the crunch you get from the little pieces of toasted Pecan they add to the top--I'm definitely adding that to my slaw the next time I make it. 5*Cornbread- Excellent mix of a Northern/Southern cornbread--it has the cakiness and slight sweetness if Northern, and the crust and stone-ground corn like a Southern; I could eat these everyday. 5* Meat:St. Louis Ribs- These might be the best St. Louis Pork Ribs (other than mine) that I've ever had! The meat had a nice "tug" to it, but was still so tender, smokey and delicious! 5*Beef Brisket- Juicy and flavorful this brisket was quite good--my only gripe is I wish it had a bit more smokiness to it. 4*Pulled Pork- Another excellent job by BQ! Juicy, smoky and porky (just like me!) Everything you could want in Pulled Pork and then some. I piggled (sic) the whole lot of it! 5*Dessert:Sugar-Cinnamon Donuts- They give everyone at the table these tiny little donuts that they make fresh up front and they're fabulous; they had me at "Cinnamon". I guess you can just walk in and order a dozen for $3 if that's all your craving, too. 5*Service & Ambiance- Good service from our server, Jessica. She was on top of things without being annoying. BQ is located in a building that looks like something you'd find in the middle of nowhere. The interior is mostly brick and wood causing the noise level in there to be deafening by the end of the night. They also keep it a bit too dark for my liking, but the decor is swell. 4*-service/3.5*-AmbianceValue- The meals here are not a bad value, as my Three Meat Combo cost $22, but it's more than enough food for 2 people. Even my piggy self couldn't finish it--but guess what's for breakfast?! Snooch to the Nooch! 4*I'm about to make a bold proclamation: I think BQ has *the* best BBQ I've ever had. I don't make that statement lightly either--after all, I have a reputation to uphold. I think this was easily the best meal I've had here in AZ, and that's saying something. I can't wait for my next visit to the Valley of the Sun so I can visit BQ again. If you ever find yourself in Phoenix, I highly, highly recommend making your way here--just make sure to make a reservation!This amazing place has been here what 30 35 years, maybe even longer. They are still great, if not better than ever.I have always liked the food here. I just never seem to make it out to this part of town anymore.  If you are at Metro center or on the I17 headed south this is a great place to stop for Lunch or Dinner.The meat here is wonderful! I mean really good. I love the Ribs, and the BBQ sauce is mighty fine. It is always busy here, is it any wonder. they are still serving up great food and great service. I know that they have a lot of other things on the menu, but I always  get BBQ.When you like it, don't change. Full service bar and lots of parking.Please do not drink and drive though.Years ago the staff used to dress up in Costume, too bad they do not do that anymore.Short version: The food is delicious and the service is wonderful! 5 stars.Long version: Ambiance: i was impressed with this restaurant as soon as we stepped in. It reminds me of the Lucille's BBQ chain in decor and ambiance - classy yet family friendly, with southern comfort and hospitality. Their menu even has a truck on the cover.Service: Excellent. All of the waitstaff was attentive and courteous. Our waitress explained the history of the restaurant to us since we told her we were first time visitors. When our party of three told her we were planning on splitting a whole rack of baby back ribs, we assumed we would get a large plate of whole ribs and then three plates. Instead, we got three separate plates portioned with 3 equal parts of ribs and the sides distributed evenly as well. Such an unexpected and very much appreciated gesture, considering that ribs are messy enough as it is!Food: AMAZING! Sweet Tea ($2): Refreshing and sweet, but not in excess.Corn Bread (free): The only thing served that I didn't enjoy. If you like dense, oily cornbread "patties", this might be your thing.Cajun Shrimp ($11): The shrimp is marinated in cajun seasonings and beer and it is accompanied by garlic bread. The slightly alcoholic flavor paired well with the shrimp and cajun spices and the garlic bread was buttery, crispy, and not overwhelmingly flavored.Baby Back Ribs ($26): The best bbq I've ever had in my life! To be fair, I'm not a huge bbq connoisseur, but the ribs are succulent, tender, flavorful and the bbq sauce adds a tangy flavor. The meat falls clean off the bone.Shoestring fries (comes with ribs): They are extra skinny and salted to perfection - my favorite type of fries. Scrumptious.Mac & cheese (comes with ribs): Creamy, cheddary with a delicious consistency. The BEST kind of mac and cheese to accompany a rack of ribs.Thank Q Donuts: When you leave, they give you fresh, warm cinnamon donuts - and a lot too! They gave us 6 for our party of 3. An awesome touch.This will be my new go-to bbq joint from now on :)Tip: If you check in with yelp or foursquare and tell your waitress, they will give you 10% off your entire check. Be sure to tell the waiter before you ask for the check!This might be my longest review ever. You don't have to read it, but you probably should. How this place has over 700 reviews to begin with is beyond me. Not even Amy's Baking Company has that many reviews and, as you might know, was heavily trolled after it aired on Kitchen Nightmares. They must be handing out money to folks for writing this shit. Or they're planted reviews. What's even more baffling is that it has a solid 4 stars. Methinks something is not quite right, but whatevs. Let's move on, shall we?This place is truly bizarre. I've been here maybe a total of 3-4 times since it first opened many years ago. It's a BBQ restaurant / club-lounge thingy. And as I learned for the first time at happy hour yesterday, it's apparently two different restaurants. At least, that's how everyone acted. My boss had made reservations for us in the Q Lounge for their Friday happy hour. Apparently you can just walk in (provided you're 21) and eat a buffet spread for free. But not until you get past the LAUNDRY LIST of dress code rules. Yes, a restaurant that serves BBQ, near Ghettrocenter, has a fucking idiotic dress code. Seriously some of the dumbest shit I have ever seen. I thought I was in metro Phoenix at a BBQ restaurant, not a Scottsdale nightclub. The list includes asinine things such as: No white t-shirts, no hats, no sunglasses, no sandals, and must be a cougar. I wanted to be like, mo' fucker, do you know this is PHOENIX? We wear sunglasses upon walking up. We wear hats to shade our faces from the blazing sun. We wear sandals, often times fashionable ones, so our feet don't get all sweaty. And white t-shirts? Now you're just acting foolish. Of course, my boyfriend whom I invited, was wearing a white t-shirt, with a nice button-up collared dress shirt (it was unbuttoned), a hat (a nice one, like derby style), and sunglasses because um, to shield your eyes? He was asked to button up his shirt, remove his sunglasses (no shit Sherlock, don't we all once we get inside?), and remove his hat. Mind you, he's a nice dresser, not some hobo with tattered clothes (usually). Had I not been invited by my boss to this happy hour, I would've bounced right then and there. It all just seemed like some giant, corny joke.Time for a paragraph break. It helps your eyeballs if you break things up. I'd like to point out that the actual restaurant portion does not honor said happy hour. That's right, you must go to the 21+ side with the fun dress code rules to have happy hour, even though it gets insanely crowded with nowhere to sit. Oh wait, you CAN order a happy hour beverage, but you have to get up from the table and walk your ass to the bar. If you order a beverage at your table, it'll be full price.I will now talk about the redeeming qualities which merited that killer 2-star review. The food is very good. The mac and cheese is the cheesiest, and all of the meat is incredibly tender. A wee bit overpriced, but not awful. They also give you free freshly-made donuts when you leave instead of a damn dinner mint. That's pretty dope. The staff is very kind. Our sever, Alicia (sp?), was very sweet and accommodating. Kudos to her.Lastly, it's confusing as shit to get into this place. The parking lot is weird, and if you've never been, you'll have no idea where to enter. The Q Lounge vs the restaurant portion. Two different places, remember. Even though...it's...not.Note: Just don't dress like you live in Phoenix. You might not get inside to the dopest dance club in all of metro Phoenix.Honestly, at times when a review is stated such as my first and initial one, its worth giving it another try. Well that was the case here. At bobby Q I had the pleasure to of course dine-in at this joint. I have to admit the BBQ sauce, taste, and services once again is amazing. Truth must be told, and in my case I had to re-anaylize my taste buzz and give it another try. I ordered the ribs, few beers, and of course can't miss out on the two amazing starters, Corn bread and the Q rolls. Omg those Q rolls I can live on it and Am officially going to change my "last meal before I die" to Q rolls. Its official, Congrats Bobby Q u identified my true last meal "if I had to choose" it would be yours Sir. Okay, Bobby Q restaurant is legit meaning if you happen to visit this place at night (which I strongly recommend) as its a Night place to dine-in at it'll show you the vision am illustrating for you here. The cool xmas white lights, wood chairs outside, and welcome'n type of style will make u feel like your in Texas but really in AZ... Give it a try, I can assure you that this is maybe the only BBQ joint you'll have the chance to get some ribs if your from AZ or just happen to visit it. Cheers. oh and again their customer services honestly by far the best.Let me start by saying I wish I could give it zero stars. Owners/managers are racist, racist, racist!!  It is blatantly obvious that their "dress code" in the lounge is not dependent on what you're wearing but what color your skin is. If you are African American take your money and patronage elsewhere and save yourself the frustration and harassment. We have been here dozens of times over the years and have spent thousands of dollars but we're done!!  Their practice is unacceptable. Shame on them!The restaurant was packed and even though there was a wait list we got seated right away.  However, we had to wait at our table a really long time and I think they forgot about us but the waiter apologized and gave us a free appetizer.  In terms of the food - appetizer 4, baby backs 5, spare ribs 5, chicken 4, sausage 3, mac and cheese 4, roasted corn 5, corn bread 4, potato salad 4, cinnamon sugar donuts 4.  Overall, really excellent barbecue.First time in Phoenix and saw this place on Yelp.  Didn't really think AZ was known for bbq but decided to give this place a whirl. The bbq was surprisingly yummy.  I had the baby backs and spicy sausage. The bbq wasn't drenched in sauce which is how I like it. Huge portions and very reasonable prices. Their cinnamon sugar donuts at the end of the meal are so addicting!  Friendly staff as well with lots of seating.I'll go 4.5/5 for this one.  I've eaten BBQ all over the country, and I can't say Bobby Q is "as good as it gets", but they are pretty darn good.  Almost 3 weeks ago Mr. M and I met up with Tim S. and his family to give this place a try.  Right away I was impressed with the friendly service, and the hostess was helpful when we needed to add a high chair to the table.  Our server was Kanisha and she did a great job and was on point with taking our orders, making sure our drinks weren't empty, and bringing us togo boxes and the check when we were ready.  We wanted to be able to try a wide variety of items so we started with the Q-rolls ($10.50), which are absolutely delicious.  Brisket wrapped up like an egg roll?  Heck yeah!  Those disappeared quickly.  We also started with their house beer, which if memory serves is an amber ale and that was a nice, easy to drink beer.  Really enjoyed that as well.  The smaller one is $4.95 and the larger one is $6.00, so the moral of that story is, go for the big one!I ordered the BBQ chicken/prime rib combo ($34) which came with 3 sides.  I chose the loaded baked potato, mac & cheese, and the ranch beans.  Mr. M ordered the 3 meat combo ($25) with pulled pork, brisket, and some ribs.  I thought I would waddle out of the joint stuffed to the gills, but we actually had so much fun talking that I didn't eat nearly as much as I thought I would.  Here's what I thought of the food:  Prime rib, chicken, and ribs:  Excellent!  Brisket: very good.  Pulled pork and ranch beans: really nothing going on there.  Very little flavor in the pork, and the beans tasted syrupy and had no BBQ flavor.  The other sides we had were very good.  I could OD on the mac & cheese.  Nicely done.Lunch was pricey if you look at the receipt total of $93.63 after tax, before tip, but we had a lot of leftovers.  Overall we had a great experience and I would go back any time.
Paradise Café=Popped in for some lunch with old friends.  After browsing the menu, I decided to go for the Trio of Sliders, which are 3 Sliders (BBQ Bacon, Mushrooms, and Regular).  It comes with a small side order of Fries.  Since I wasn't paying for lunch, I forgot to get the price.....I think it's around $9.The food came out after a short wait.  The Sliders were OK.  My favorite was the BBQ Bacon Slider.  The other two weren't that great.  The Fries were just OK.Overall, it was a nice lunch with friends.Return Factor - 60%Having relatives with a time share at the Grand Hiltons, you're bound to end up having a meal at a Paradise Cafe.This one being at the Convention Center Hilton, they remind me of a tropical style Coco's. Got myself a breakfast plate that came with toast, two eggs, hash browns and bacon. Filling and decent, although the eggs were pretty over cooked. Got overcharged on my bill, so double check it!!!
Tradiciones=Holy Ricky Martin! Me gusto this restaurante! Seriously mis amigos y amigas. Entering Tradiciones is an elevating experiencia. Like entering Disneyland. Es imposible not to be muy feliz.. You get me papi? Waitresses in frilly dresses with big smiles on their caras bonitas. A dining room lleno de color, energia and muy clean. Like spotless. You get mi papi? Carnitas was tender and served with homemade tortillas...Dios Mio! Homemade. Thicker than the ones us gringos are used to. And mucho mejor. You get  mi papi? Fajitas, margaritas, watermelon juice, salsa and service all first rate. So, two thumbs up from this gringo and his novio latino. We we're both treated as las reinas that we are. I hope Tradiciones becomes a tradition of ours. You get mi papi?Okay WHY hasn't anyone told me about this place before?!I think I just found my new favorite Mexican place in the city!! and that says a LOT - I loves mah Mexican food!!Earlier today my mom and I were on our way to visit a relative when we decided to go have dinner somewhere, I wanted Biaz Market, but she didn't want to try somewhere new. So I suggested Ranch Market and she agreed, as we parked I saw the sign that said resturant, and I thought this location didn't have a deli like the one on the South side does - and we were confused. We chose to just give it a try. And we stepped one foot beyond the large corridors and it was so COLORFUL!This is what I mean by the 'hood being colorful, but here - you could actually SEE all the colors and it was beautiful. We wandered around and saw the cool stuff they have outside in a lil shopping area. But it was empty! We were worried that they were closed but trugged on ahead. waay in the back was the entrance of the actual resturant. We were warmly greeted and seated right away because, at 4:30PM on a Tuesday - they were very empty... there were only 3 tables occupied in their very nicely decorated dining room which was very clean and even boasted a mural. Loves it! :) our waiter brought us some chips and salsa but the salsa lacked a kick, it's never hot enought me (that sounded dirty didn't it?!) haha! So I asked for something spicer - he gave me a look of concern and said they had habenero sauce... BRING IT! I was excited... the H-Sauce was KILLER!! But oh - so - freakin - good!! I loved it! i started mixing sauces and dubbed myself the Salsa Alchemist! :D After an entire bowl of chips, our food was ready. I had the Sampler Appetizer and it was very good. My mom had the combination with a Red Tamale, cheese enchilada with rice and beans. My sampler appetizer was sooooo good! The Flautas were nice and crispy and the seasoned chicken was awesome and went better with the mild sauce. The mini beef chimi was the BEST damned chimi I ever ever had! I wanted to pack the rest of my meal to go and order a chimichanga and eat that! lol! I had to have my mom sample it and she loved it too! The Sopricitos were AMAZING! I never had anything like that before. The waiter explained that they were a very thick Corn tortilla topped with seasoned chicken, lettuce, tomato, queso fresco & tomitillo sauce. I will definatly go back just for this dish alone! And as if that wasn't enough - the chicken enchiladas were very good, but the sauce was very deep... it had a very dark flavor. Almost too dark, I would have liked for it to have been a lil lighter in flavor. But it was still good.My mom enjoyed her tamale but felt it was a tad too dry, she wanted red sauce but chose not too ask for it because she felt the enchilada sauce was way too strong for the tamale. She didn't really like her chese enchilada and didn't finish it. But she liked the beans and rice. and really enjoyed the automosphere as well as the chips and salsa. Inspite those small faux pas, I'm still giving it the full 5 stars because the service was SO amazing. It's been a while since I've had exceptionally great service. Everything was spot on... To my fellow yelpers: you MUST go and enjoy yourself! However, they have crazy-funky hours so look out for the signs that indicate whether or not they're open. I hope more people give this place a go - with the economy the way it is, I'd hate for this place to close because no one's going! And don't be afraid to ask for the Habenero sauce, yes it's melt your tounge atomically hot, but ask for an empty salsa bowl and start mixing the sauces and get your salsa alchimist on!!Awesome and Authentic! ~I Loved this place just upon entering, beautiful fountain and courtyard, a row of souvenir vendors. You definitely feel like you've left Phoenix, which can be a good thing!I didn't realize how huge this place was! ~Once we got inside, we were greeted and seated. Service was great. ~Fabulous chips and Yummy Salsa! I ordered the Gringo Loco Enchiladas(see pics), which were stuffed with chicken,corn , black beans and cheddar cheese and smothered with your choice of red or green chile colorado..................I chose red.........Lucky for me I was served green by mistake, I didn't want to say anything I just figured I'd eat it, and let me tell you I'm so glad I did......That was some of the best green Chile pork I've had and it was sooooo much better than the red sauce the Mr. had on his cheese enchiladas (my preference of course he loved his too) Everything was perfect, unfortunately I didn't have time to check out the market side but I have a feeling I'll be back very soon!I think I'm in love. For any of you who have spent time in East LA, Tradiciones is very reminiscent of that scene. I arrived to have dinner with Julia and Amy. I was exhausted and hungry. We were greeted and led into a HUGE dining room. I knew I was going to fall in love. Did I like the dumb dresses the ladies have to wear? No, but it makes the tourists and non-hispanic people feel comfortable. I usually set my bar on the quality of food based on the chips and salsa. We were served a fresh basket of chips and each given a personal bowl of salsa! Hooray for double dipping! The manager was walking around and he stopped by to say hello and then brought us a complimentary bowl of guacamole With three lovely ladies each with a fab pair...of.... I mean each with great personalities, what do you expect? So far so good! I had a margarita that was served in a martini glass full of ice... hmmm is that weird to anyone else? Oh well. The marg was good! For my entree I chose the enchiladas suizas with chicken. What I was served was definitely YUMMY! The tortillas were fresh and they were soft fried. Fabulous, authentic touch! The suizas sauce was slightly tangy. The tanginess was offset by the cotija cheese that was generously sprinkled on top. The word that came to mind every time I took a bite was "creamy". It was a very well made enchilada. The beans and rice were pretty good too. Here's my thing about re-fried beans. I like them when they're made with manteca (LARD) *GASP* and these were more than likely made with them. The re fried beans were flavorful. The rice was eh.. ok. It was rice. I sort of wished for a bit more spice in the rice, but again, it makes the tourists feel safe. An added bonus were the roaming musicians that they had. I was relieved to see that they were not in Mariachi suits but rather nice slacks and blazers and they were SINGING it. I wish I had more energy because I would have been whistling and doing a good ol Grita Mexicano along with the guys at the bar that were enjoying the entertainment! I look forward to enjoying Tradiciones again!So I figured out why this place has 5 from one and 1 from another.... It is owned ny our friends up North. Yep The super nice yet bland group we call Canadians. They have created a tourist trap that appeals to tourist and lovers of SW crap. LOLHere is a copy of the business plan. Lets create a super nice place that attracts people to it, eah? (cuz they end the sentence with a question)But we do know anything about Mexican food?Lets make it so neat just to be in the place that we will get by on our looks? Eah?OKAAY... make sure the drinks are good.
McDonald's=How do you say retarded in Spanish?We ordered fish filet meal and cheese burger happy meal (ketchup and onions only)We got the kids meal and a fish sandwich with ketchup and onion...WTF who does that? On the fish? Come on...
The Cheesecake Factory=This Cheesecake Factory is like all of the others. Consistent.  That is actually what made McDonalds famous- consistency.  It's very crowded, quite loud, and if you are lucky enough to get a patio seat you will be treated to the Poseidon show complete with smoke, water and flames. My husband went with a chicken pasta dish, and I opted for the chicken tostada salad.  Both were good as usual.  The service was excellent, as it should be in a big hospitality based town.   Is it flash, fancy or different-no, but if you are looking for a quick meal without breaking the bank, then here's your place.
Zoes Kitchen=I came here for lunch after driving by this place a few times and was happy with what I had.The decor here is really cute.  Simple, clean and bright.  I went with the Greek Chicken Pita, and it came with a bag of chips, a side of pasta salad and a pop.   Total bill was $9.02.  Not bad!  The chicken was tasty, pasta salad was okay at best.  I took home my extras and had them as a light dinner. Food here is fresh, healthy and light.  Servings are healthy in size and would gladly return in the future.Lets just set the record straight here. Zoe's serves Mediterranean just like Qdoba serves Mexican.When I say just like the Q, I mean the entire experience. Walking into the shop gives more of a cookie cutter national chain feel; which is probably because they are in fact a chain of restaurants. Zoe's food was average and unimpressive. I did like the hummus though. Their prices similar to independent and family operated Mediterranean around the valley; in some cases more. I would prefer to visit Cypress Grill, just up the street from this location, they're my favorite Medi in CenPho so far. The staff here was friendly, they took our order promptly and served the food within a few minutes. Don't get me wrong, the food was in no way "bad", per se. I just can't shake the feeling of "I've had better" when thinking about my experience.If you're looking to fill your belly with food just because it's time to eat, this might just be the place for you. If you're interested in a great Mediterranean meal, I implore you to please try something new. I likely won't be returning, we do live in the city of a million restaurants, go out and choose one! (but don't take me at my word on that just made up fact).Happy Yelping Phoenix, now where's my hummus?Tried Zoe's Kitchen for dinner one night, it was mid-week and after 7pm so the place wasn't too crowed. After checking out the menu I went with the chicken kabobs and put in my order to go.The meal had chicken kabobs with grilled peppers, onions and tomatoes on a bed of rice pilaf, and came with a pita bread cut into 4 and a Greek salad.  The Greek salad was fresh and great tasting, even without the dressing. The chicken kabobs were tender and moist, I took everything off the kabobs and just mixed it in with the rice pilaf and it made a great meal.  Perfect for a simi fast dinner.
deseo=Looking for a place to eat, we stumbled across this joint.  What a great surprise!The restaurant is located on the sublevel floor of the hotel, below the lobby.  It's kind of hidden and difficult to find if you're unfamiliar with the place....but worth looking for.  The stairwell is lit with candles...I wonder how long it takes to light all of those every day?  Ha!They serve you this Bread that must come from Heaven because it's so awesome!  The only bad part is that the Butter comes out cold and hard....why do restaurants do that?!  It's such a pain to spread it on the Bread.....it was awesome nevertheless.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=2eQrsJcdON3yV2NWBPJq5w#2eQrsJcdON3yV2NWBPJq5whttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=nhgW17m3ur1K6_t2ewSXRQ#nhgW17m3ur1K6_t2ewSXRQFor appetizers, we had the Kobe Beef Tenderloin Flatbread, $12.  It was very good and raw.....the server didn't tell us it was raw and neither did the menu (see pics below).  Good thing we didn't mind, but consider yourself warned.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=0hM9bfms7OIUO2zP98tL1w#0hM9bfms7OIUO2zP98tL1whttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=4bqUF6UcLnJTWSHAIVRFpQ#4bqUF6UcLnJTWSHAIVRFpQThe Better Half had the Lump Crab, $14 and I had the Annatto Pollo Asado (Jidori Chicken), $27.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=Zp0dRqvTPsRo-B1FmjLXvQ#Zp0dRqvTPsRo-B1FmjLXvQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=0tOnd6OKDEW3P7U6Osq8Ew#0tOnd6OKDEW3P7U6Osq8EwFor a side dish, we both split a Calabzitas Con Queso (Squash & Oaxaca Cheese), $6.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=0o4t4YI1Gd10sO4wnhCerA#0o4t4YI1Gd10sO4wnhCerAThe Jidori Chicken is full of flavor and comes with some Pasta, so it's very filling.  The Squash & Cheese was good, but I thought was a little runny.  Very different flavors for your palette here.The service was outstanding and the room is very elegant and romantic.  We washed it down with a bottle of Cabernet of course....yum!I'm glad we found this place, can't wait to return.Return Factor - 99%
Sushi Tachi=Every time my sister comes to visit, we hit up a AYCE sushi joint. Last monday, this was the spot. It was $26.95 which comes w/bud light and the house sake for 60 mins. Here is what we had:3 buds and 2 large sakesspicy tuna hand roll w/masago and a quail egg (me only)2 orders of ahi poke1 order of raw tofu2 orders of salmon and 2 orders hamachi2 orders of amaebi w/deep fried heads1/2 of a roll that i forget the name1 sake shooter (me only)2 baked scallops1 salmon collar1 order of the cajun albacore and 1 order of tako1/2 roll of new york girl in vegas1 green tea ice cream1 pink colored ice cream which i forget the flavorThe food was very good. The fish was fresh. Our sushi chef was the older japanese man. He was great. The waitresses were nice. The place was clean. I'll probably come by myself next time I'm craving sushi when my sister isn't in town. We came here for an early dinner so I was disappointed that I wasn't able to eat more. Great AYCE spot hidden in North Las Vegas.My sister's one complaint was that the bar stools were too low. Yeah they were a little low.Not sure why they have 5 stars. Not sure why they have 2 business listings with 2 different addresses when there's only 1 Tachi. I've been coming to Tachi for years since this place is close to home. The quality has declined over the years. We would normally do AYCE but they also have a regular menu to order from.Miso Soup:This is not the version that's made with love.  The soup is pre-made and the tofu pieces are so tiny. 1/5Sushi/Sashimi:Sashimi isn't included in AYCE. AYCE is about $24-26/person. Or you can get sushi/sashimi combo starting at $10. The quality of fish is inconsistent. Sometimes the fish looks like it was cut using a butter knife. Sometimes the fish is ice-cold. 2.5/5Shumai:You can get these balls fried or steamed. Shumai is meant to be dipped in soy/ponzu sauce but they don't give you sauce here. 3/5Donburi:Katsudon, raw egg on top of rice with hot broth. The hot broth cooks the raw egg so mix it all up as soon as the bowl touches your table. This is a good dish, however, when my sister ordered this the last time, it lacked flavor. They were not busy at all the last time we went so there's no excuse. Another inconsistency? 3/5Since the location is convenient and sometimes we just don't want to drive 10 miles to get good AYCE, I guess we will continue to come here and keep hoping we catch them on a good day.We were in the area and starving for lunch. We decided against AYCE and instead ordered some lunch specials and a couple of appetizers to share.We ordered the shumai and gyoza to start. These were decent, but nothing amazing. Two of my dining companions complained about the shumai tasting overly fishy. I ordered the sushi lunch for my entree. It included five pieces of sushi and a California roll. The sushi and roll were not good. The fish was not fresh and the California roll had an unpleasant texture. The service was really friendly and they accommodated all the specific requests our table had, but I don't think I would come back even if I was in the area again.
Flo's Shanghai Cafe=I disagree with the previous punters! They're from Berkeley and SF, and comparing an Airport quickie meal to authentic Chinese in the Bay Area? Get real! Compare this to your other choices at Sky Harbor for asian food!For airport quick food, I think Flo's Shanghai Cafe is a good choice, considering it is about the only Asian flavors in PHX. Yes, it isn't up to Flo's in North Scottsdale, which is a great and better choice than Panda and even PF Chang's! Number one, at least this is made (well, somewhat) to order, unlike the buffet at Panda's. There are no fancy food pictures, just a lot of red lanterns and a sign listing the menu options: Noodles and Rice (chow meins and fried rice dishes $6.95 to $7.95), Appetizers ( Pot stickers, Spring Rolls, Crab Puffs, Fried Wontons, Lettuce Cups, Chicken salad, soups, and Shanghai Bao, which are pork balls batter covered and deep fried (you get 4). All of these are $3.25 - $7.95. Then there are Rice bowls, i.e. Broccoli Beef, Mongolian Beef, Teriyaki, Cashew, Sweet and Sour, Orange, Kung Pow, Garlic (all chickens) fro $7.95 to $8.95.I ordered the Shanghai Baos and Mongolian Beef . The beef was real steak slices, not that overcooked brittle things of Panda's 'Beijing Beef", and it was covered in sauce and green onions over rice. They have soy and red chili on the tables, not only in packets that you have to beg for at P.E. They also have Arizona Ice Teas and Yeo's Soymilk, try finding that at P.E.! I do wish that they had Asian bottled Green and Oolong teas, but this is Phoenix, who is going to drink that?Of course this is meant to be an airport restaurant for quicker meals, so don't expect Hong Kong quality! Hell, there are only a handful of authentic asian restaurants (of any cuisine) in the Valley of the Sun, where there are maybe 5 Million people living, and less that 1% Asian?Get a grip. I support Flo's because I really liked her Scottsdale location (the old one before she moved across the street) because beside better than PF Changs food and prices and her smiling attentiveness, she had real Serigraphs of Chinese Yunan (now Beverly Hills retired) artist Jiang (which made me like the place immediately, as I like him and own a Serigraph myself of his..."Running Horses"). PS - the help are Mandarin speaking Chinese, too! Try finding two of those in any PF Changs!PPS - Flo's is located in Terminal 4 (Southwest, US AIr) in the shopping mall upstairs, closer to the B and C gates, across from Oaxaca.
Essence Bakery Café=I awake, wild eyed in a cold sweat, visions of caramel creme macaroons soliciting me like high class tricks in a whorehouse, Croque Monsieurs their swanky pimps, demanding payment for service. Essence strikes again. The only way to vanquish these dreams is to lunch here on a regular basis. I've been here twice in the past week alone and I think I'm addicted. The atmosphere, product, service, and baked goods have seduced me with their simple elegance. The only gripe I possibly have about this place is the fact that the parking lot is the size of a matchbox, and with Sacks, Cafe Lalibella and Starbucks all occupying the same plaza, finding a place to park during the busy lunch rush is like simultaneously playing Tetris and Frogger.The atmosphere at Essence is understated in its sophistication. Windows line the majority of the dining room, creating an inviting, open air feeling and the attached patio is charming. Strong earth toned colors and cute little origami flower bouquets grace the tables. Despite the small size of the establishment there are a variety of seating options for single patrons or small groups, and I've never seen people waiting for a table, even during their busiest Friday lunch rush.A broad array of patrons frequent Essence including hipsters, young professionals, older adults in their power suits, and even a few elders. I haven't seen very many college kids, which may because the food isn't cheap and it's probably "weirder" than options on Mill's strip. But I dig the "weird" French inspired cuisine. It's decadent and I feel naughty eating it.Everything I've eaten during lunch has been exceptional. The croque moniseur is far and away the best thing I've tried so far. A grilled sandwich with an egg washed top layer, thin sliced ham, creamy gruyere cheese and jalapenos. It's heavenly crunchy, just as the name suggests. The open face steak sandwich is tender delicious and smothered in buttery sauteed mushrooms with a sprinkle of bleu cheese crumbles as a savory accent. The layers of phyllo dough used in the spanakopita demonstrates some serious painstaking dedication to producing a good product, and the chopped Greek salad was phenomenal. Crispy cucumbers, bell peppers, kalmata olives, feta cheese and tomatoes that tasted like, well, actual tomatoes, for once. Something that you don't often find and an indication that Essence uses amazingly fresh organic product whenever possible. Even the side of potato salad with whole grain mustard was exceptional.The offerings at their bakery are just as phenomenal as their lunch entrees. The caramel creme macaroon is seriously the most amazing sandwich cookie I've ever tasted, a perfect harmony between savory creme filling and sweet chewy wafers. The strawberry shortcake is amazingly fresh and light, if not a little hard to eat. And their white chocolate raspberry layer cake is the classiest Little Debbie-esque snack cake I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. One day I vow to pick up a box of "Tasty little treats" just so I can sample a cupcake and about three cookies without having to choose among all the desserts on display!I highly recommend this place. Just don't be surprised if you develop an insatiable desire to consume Essence on a daily basis.This is easily my favorite cafe in all of Tempe - and perhaps the Valley - for lunch and baked goods.  The atmosphere is charming and understated from the way you order to the friendly service you wouldn't expect from a counter service kind of place.I'm always torn on whether to order the croque monseiur or the warm open faced steak sandwich.  Both of the sandwiches are superbly prepared and presented.  You can't go wrong with either.  I always opt for the dijon potato side salad garnished with mustard seed.The warm open faced steak sandwich is tastefully done with tender grilled ribeye with a cabernet butter and sauteed mushrooms and bleu cheese.  Rich, sinful and bad but in a good way, kind of like sex with an old ex.  Similarly the croque monseiur has me hooked, but their use of de-seeded jalapenos adds a distinctive Arizona touch that I just love.While waiting for my lunch I can never resist their outstanding macarons (I prefer the chocolate, but both are delicious), cakes and cookies (go for the chocolate truffle) displayed so innocently behind the glass case where you order.Since I am friends with someone who works here, she doesn't serve us (company policy), so service is usually by the manager, and once we even got the chef, which was a nice surprise because I was able to ask her details on the sandwiches.And finally, because they use organic and locally grown ingredients you can leave feeling like not-so much of an asshat.Five stars. If there were more stars at my disposal, I'd give them all to Essence.Here's what you need to know:Awesome for breakfast and lunch. As many ingredients as possible are organic and local. And if "local" and "organic" is not your thing, come here anyway. Do it. Do it just because the food is outstanding and the people are nice.But know that they close at 3pm. I went through a period in my life during which I was mad at Essence because they weren't open later. But my therapist now has me believing this is a good thing; otherwise I'd be eating here three times a day and would NEVER go home.  If you're vegetarian, plenty of goods for you here. I'm carnivorous myself, and favor the Roasted Chicken Club. How can chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo taste so abundant? It makes no sense. And the potato salad?! Dude ... I don't even like potato salad (a bad picnic experience from my youth turned me off the stuff for the better part of two decades), but this is the goods! Perhaps it's the mustard. Perhaps this is what food from the earth is SUPPOSED to taste like (another shameless plug for organic).And don't even get me started on their sweets. Chocolate truffle cookies: check. White chocolate macadamia nut cookies: check. Macarons: okay, hold up. The macarons are to die for! I went through another period of time where I harbored resentment for Essence because their macarons taste so good. I'm still kinda' in that space. (My therapist and I are working on it as I write). My contention is that Essence is going to become so popular - on the basis of their macarons alone - that Chef Eugenia ends up closing shop and having her own show on the Food Network. Go there. Have one. You'll understand.But go soon, my friends. Because once Eugenia makes her first appearance on Oprah ... it's all over but the crying.I hate to do this, but after today's experience, I am at a loss...I don't even know where to start.  I love going here, but something has to change.  I always look forward to Essence...but today I just shake my head.I went to the counter to order my Hamburger with Cheese (and extra .85 cents)  which is a new item on the menu which I have had before.  I loved it the first time.  I was not in the mood for a salad and I asked what I could do for a substitute and they said I could add potato chips for an extra dollar.  I let that one slide and then I asked for an Iced Tea and if it could be in a to go cup and they said that they would have to charge me an extra .50 cents.  I asked why and the girl at the counter said it has to do with refills.  "But I get refills in my Glass, correct?" "Yes, but that is the way the owner has it."Now I am a little annoyed, but I try to get over it.  My lovely luncheon date, the wonderful Sarah G thought I was in a bad mood, and then I explained my issues with the counter.  I get my food...put my mayonaise all over it and then I cut into the meat...completely raw.  (Please remember that I did not put the top part of the bun and lettuce on my sandwich yet)  I cut into it in the middle just to make sure...and yep!  Red raw meat....I went to the counter and explained my finding and she said that she will put it back on to cook a little longer.  I explained to her that I cut into it and I had put the mayonaise on it...but she said she will take care of it.So I get it back...with the bun on top of my hamburger.  I look underneath, and there is my cut up hamburger.  I take the bun off and noticed that the bottom half of the bunch is extremely soggy.  I also bite into it and it scorched my mouth.  I don't know that they did, but it was completely unacceptable.  On top of it, which didn't surprise me, the hamburger was COMPLETELY DRY.  Sarah and I both noticed that the staff did not come by at all to ask how our food turned out.  I went back up to the counter and told her that I couldn't even it my lunch.  The girl said that the cook ASSURED her that it wouldn't get dry....and I told her that she was assured incorrectly. They did end up refunding my money...after the fact I noticed that I didn't get reimbursed for my cheese.  (LOL)My Parfait was awesome...that was a plus...their desserts are always so yummy.Please Please Please Essence...I want to be able to come back next time and give you back at least 2 extra starts....And by the way....I am still hungryI have a crush and I'm not afraid to admit it -- so here it goes. Dear Essence Bakery, I think you and I make a great team and we should never be apart. Please check yes or no if you feel the same way. As you can tell, I have a soft spot for Essence Bakery and it stems back to a random drive-by encounter during my days of working in that area and searching for a local delicious dining experience. I tried their lunch menu, I fell in love and I've been stalking them ever since. Just today, I had the perfect excuse to visit Essence for breakfast. While I've enjoyed their lunch items many times, I'd never tried breakfast and man, I had no idea what I was missing. I started my eating binge with an Iced Mocha. Do you like chocolate? I do. And I liked this iced coffee. It was like a chocolate milkshake meets a quick hit of caffeine to my brain all while overflowing with coffee awesomeness. Then, it was time to order breakfast. After asking our the wonderful staffer, John, what to order...he said the croissants were heaven in your mouth and comparable to the Parisian delicacy itself, so I obviously had to see if it lived up to the hype. I ordered the egg sandwich on a croissant (ps my waistline hates me after this meal). Verdict? I don't even have words to describe the deliciousness. The croissant melted in my mouth and after I finished, I wish I could start all over again. So just when you think my calorie binge is over, I was told I had to leave with a box of the macaroon sample pack. Have you ever had a macaroon? If not, let me explain...it's two cookies with a creme like mixture in the middle. It is soft and chewy and yummy. These were some of the best macaroons I had which is bad news because now I want them every day. They have macaroons of every shape and size...aka mini and big. I suggest the big macaroon because it's just that good! So when you can't find me, look for me at Essence Bakery because I'll be that girl waiting by the door begging them to open early or stay late.essence /sns/ Show Spelled[es-uhns] -noun1. the basic, real, and invariable nature of a thing or its significant individual feature or features: Freedom is the very essence of our democracy.There are actually five additional dictionary results, but the above is exactly what the word 'essence' in Essence Bakery & Cafe means to me... After hearing about Essence Bakery & Cafe for years, I finally made it in for breakfast a few weeks ago.  And I broke the diet completely by going with the Egg Sandwich on a croissant.  No egg whites here, folks!  I went for the real deal!I devoured my sandwich which included a fried egg with melted Dubliner cheese and tomato.   I washed it down with their Vanilla Iced Coffee.  And I topped it off (a few hours later) with a just sweet enough, delicious pumpkin macaroon!Friendly staff, laid back casual environment, moderate prices, environmental responsibility, and fabulous food; this place is the essence of a local bakery and cafe.  (Did I use 'essence' correctly in that sentence? I hope so!)-Parking was semi-convenient (lot was almost full during peak lunch hour).-Outside and inside seating. -Inside seating was LOUD from all the various conversations within the small restaurant.-Place your order at the counter, they give you a number table tent, and bring your food to you.-Sandwich was REALLY good! Side salad of mixed greens was the BEST I have ever had! Justified the price ($8.25).-Order took maybe 20 minutes to receive (not good if you have a certain amount of time for lunch).-Chocolate Macaron was delicious! I would had ordered more to-go, but at $2.95 each, this could get expensive. -Clean restroom.-I would eat here again!Just the smell of the bakery when you walk in makes your mouth water and aim for the counters.   I have passed by too many times and finally had stopped in after the Tempe Heart Walk.  The restaurant was packed with lunch-goers.  I am glad that they actually have a to-go line.  The menu offers breakfast, lunch, and pastries, but it's the pastries I'm after today.  I went straight for their famous macarons.   The vanilla bean macaron was so delightful.  The texture was light and creamy. The macaron wasn't enough so I had ordered the Small Box of Treats (mini macaron, strawberry tart, key lime tart, and a cookie), almond croissant, and a brioche roll.  After opening the boxes and bags, I completely forgot to take any photos.  Who can blame me?  I will need to return to try their crepes and other desserts.Essence does have an amazing menu but the last two times I've tried to enjoy myself there it just hasn't happened. Twice in the last two weeks I've had experiences where I now will never go there again unless a group of friends decide that's absolutely the only place they want to go to brunch. 1st experience: About two weeks ago today. I had a busy day ahead of me but I had enough time to grab a coffee and some food somewhere before going about my day. I was craving their hot breakfast cereal with fruit and knowing how busy they can get I thought I should probably just call in a to-go order and even if I have to wait a little while when I get there, that's fine because I can take it with me. The first time I called a girl answered the phone and instantly asked me if I could hold without even asking how she could help me, I said "of course". I stayed on hold for 15 minutes. I walked into my coffee shop, stood in line, ordered my coffee and when my coffee was done, I decided to hang up and redial Essence. I call again and sure enough "can you hold please?". I'm thinking "really?" but I say "of course" again. I'm on hold for about 5 minutes (which is a long time when you're already a little frustrated waiting for 15 min the first time). I decide to hang up when I pull into their parking lot and no one has picked up the phone. I walk inside and to my surprise it wasn't as busy as I thought it might be which would justify the ignorance on the phone. I walked up to the counter and stated "I need to place a to-go order". The look on the girls face was like "crap, this might be the girl from the phone". Still, I am a patient person and I thought "its OK, I'm here now and I can just order". As I was ordering one of the gals who works there was showing a girl how to use the register. It ALL made sense! This girl was new and they were trying to train her which was causing everything to be a little more backed up than usual. OK, now I'm not as mad.After placing my order I told the girls I would wait out on the patio. The girl retorted with a condescending tone saying "Just place your number on the edge of the table and we'll find you". Although, I've been to Essence MANY times and knew how their process worked, with their already awesome lack of service I felt I needed to verbally state where I was going to be. OK, sitting on the patio waiting for my food for how long now? I realize that there are other people who may have ordered  before myself but waiting 25ish minutes for hot oatmeal is just ridiculous. It gets better, after I the whole "I'll be on the patio" fiasco. I see a girl pacing the shop inside holding a to-go box looking desperately for whomever it could possibly belong to. At this point I'm thinking to myself "you've got to be kidding me". I just sat there and watched her walk around for a good five minutes if not longer. She finally went back to the counter and did an "I don't know" gesture. I decided to finally mosey on inside. The girl training her saw me frustrated, standing up and walking in so she grabbed the box and some silverware and handed it to me as i was approaching her. I was kind despite my annoyance and thanked her but come on meow. REALLY?A week and a half or so goes by and I think to myself, ya know what? I'm going to give Essence another shot. With their ridiculous hours I wasn't sure when they stopped serving breakfast so I tried to get their as soon as possible. I arrived at  10:45am and they stop serving breakfast at 10:30am (which I will never understand from a business stand point especially given their awesome location. They are totally limiting themselves.) I wasn't annoyed or bothered or frustrated because I could have easily looked up their menu hours and chosen somewhere else to go knowing I would miss the breakfast menu. (Same two gals working by the way) I was pleasant and ordered an iced coffee and a simple SIDE SALAD. Somehow my total came to around $9 after a tip. I'm thinking "that's fine because I know they use fresh/organic ingredients and I'm happy with that". And then I also waited forever for my salad and once it got there the sad pile of green on my plate was enough to erk the evil Steph monster out of me. I was pissed. I downed my salad in maybe five minutes because I HAD to get out of there. I ate my salad so fast I didn't finish my iced coffee. I walked up to the counter to ask for a to-go cup so I could take my remaining coffee with me. She told me I had to pay extra if I wanted to take it to-go!! ARE YOU SERIOUS????? "For a refill its more" me: "but I don't want a refill. I simply want to take the coffee which I've already paid for with me". "Its still more if you want to take it to-go". She knew I was upset. I sat my iced coffee on the counter and left. I promise, I waited a LONG time and thought about all of this over in my head a few times before writing this review. I'll miss their breakfast but OH WELL.Way to go Essence. After a few awful experiences here you'd think we would learn right? Remember how I said I would never go back to eat here ever again? Well this morning I did. And I regret it.Long story short. We stood in line, ordered, paid $30 for two breakfast items and two iced soy lattes, found a table, and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. As soon as I noticed a table of four who had come in significantly later than us being delivered food and enjoying their meal I was furious. Our drinks were gone and we had been sitting there for almost 40 minutes. My boyfriend went to the counter to ask them what was going on. They didn't have our order. Surprised? I shouldn't have been. Essence and I just weren't meant to be. IT GETS BETTER!  We asked for the food to go since we live 2 minutes away and we were sick of sitting there. They brought out the food super fast which was a little concerning since our food hadn't been made yet, right? They were kind enough to load us up with some goodies but it didn't even matter because after our super short drive home we immediately opened our food from being super hungry and its was COLD. Holy shit. Give me a break.The food here at Essence is really good.  It really is.  BUT, they're not only not open on Sundays (they serve breakfast for the love of god!) but the service is consistently just the worst goddamn thing in the world.Each time I go there, I say it's my last time and this time I think it really is.  I don't know.  Fuckin' place always draws me back in because Tempe only has like three places to get breakfast, it's silly.  Anyway, I got the "big" breakfast, which cost as much as any normal thing called a big breakfast would, but the portions given to the namesake were a total joke.  Lil' potato cake thing, lil' pieces o' bread, lil' thingy of mushrooms.  It's cute.  It wants so badly to be big.  Anyway, I didn't get the vegetarian version and I noticed that it was missing sausage.  I brought it up and the food server was like oh man, sorry about that, it'll be right out.I ended up eating my entire breakfast while waiting for my sausage.  I waited and waited before I finally went inside to inquire and before I even said one word, before my dumb mouth even opened to speak, everyone working behind the counter, three people, frantically said, "It's coming right OUT, sir!"  Like I'm being fucking unreasonable.  Sure.  How demeaning is that, to be treated like I'm some cheapskate fatfuck for wanting something I already paid for?The sausage came like ten minutes, literally, after that.  I wanted to hit the road.  But, it was super delicious.  There was a dude sitting next to us outside and the chick food server he had was treating him like total shit.  He didn't seem to mind, but I overheard her really patronizing him when he asked if he could have a thing of toast, "Uh, well sir, if you wanted toast that's something you would've ordered beforehand.  It's NOT free."  She said it so shitty, like responding to a pervert who asked her if she shaved her privates.  He said he'd pay for it, no big deal.  Dude, that guy ordered a lot of food and probably racked up a decent bill.  Bring him some toast, you cheap bastards.Essence is always packed, hot, loud and stupid.You know I love Essence, but because I am a regular who sometimes visits twice in the same day (like today), I have to say that I am sick of their bad customer service. No, I am sick of their crappy attitude! The people at the front end of the house are either incompetent or rude ... with one exception, the lady with glasses and short dark hair. She has always been helpful and nice. I don't want her lumped into this review, she is the only good front end employee left in this place. At least, she is the only one from the old crew I've seen on my last several visits. The rest of this younger, new bunch have such an awful disposition and way of saying things that I am no longer going to be an Essence regular.   Here is how today's lunch visit went:-They were out of the lunch special -They subbed an item in my back-up order without notifying me -They were out of the caesar dressing on my co-worker's caesar salad and it took 40 minutes of waiting to realize this-It took 40 minutes before the food was ready and we even called ahead.-No one apologized for this-While we waited, we watched one of the chefs literally toss food onto the counter in annoyance whenever she had completed someone's order-the bread was so hard I couldn't eat it and the knife they gave me couldn't cut through it either-the man helping us was physically annoyed by the lunch rush and couldn't be bothered to treat customers like they mattered On top of that, no one greeted us with a smile. Everyone had an attitude and made sure to say things in the bitchiest way possible. What the hell is going on? Are the employees treated terribly? I feel like it's so bad that it must be an internal problem and not exactly indicative of the personal nature of the employees themselves. It almost feels like a product of the environment: unhappy employees=they don't give a shit about your business. Just saying.  It's been real Essence. We've had some great memories, but it's over ... and it's definitely not me, it's you! Hopefully, one day we can be friends again. I will certainly mourn the loss of my beloved macaron.*Update: I was sent a very sincere note from the management. I will say that they definitely reached out to make everything right. Hopefully, the customer service issues will improve, because I love everything else! I think 2 stars was a little harsh, so I'm giving them a 3 for being so gracious after reading my review.  Ok, Essence, we might have to give it another go. I just can't quit you!!!
Feeney's Restaurant and Bar=Definitely a fan! It's so not what you would expect from just driving by... Heck, they have beef wellington on the menu!!So far, I have only been for happy hour (twice) but it's a good one! The drink prices are great. As far as food, I've had the potato skins, fried zucchini (each $4 during happy hour) and the tenderloin toasts and spanikopita. The spanikopita was delicious! 5 small triangles packed with spinach, but what was most notable was the freakishly buttery taste to to the phyllo! And, by "freakishly buttery" I mean... AWESOME! The tenderloin toasts were great too. The bread was sliced thin enough that it didn't cut up the top of your mouth despite being crisp yet was sturdy enough not to crumble into pieces when you took a bite. The meat was tender and still pink. Packed with flavor! Talk about a neighborhood place. Went by today around 3:15 but they don't open until 4. Thought it was weird no one was behind the bar when I walked in, and it took a while for someone to come from the kitchen. The customer service was spectacular! First, he asked what he could get me, then he explained they weren't open for another hour so he'd be back in the kitchen getting stuff ready and invited me to just holler if I needed anything. And, still, he kept coming out to check on us offering to take a food order as soon as the kitchen was ready. Yay, Frank! You took great care of us. Thank you so much!! I'd totally recommend Feeney's!I used to come for the booze (I actually still do!) but I wound up bringing my family in for dinner while they were visiting from out of town. Being the zealous consumer of lamb that he is, my father ordered the Greek-style lamb chops. Needless to say that every time he's in town, he HAS to go to Feeney's and have the lamb. He has since tried the pork chops (also Greek-style) and is just as much of a fan of those. I've brought in other family since who are also nuts about the lamb. So bottom line, if you're into lamb, come here and take it Greek-style!Not a lamb eater myself, I usually get the filet mignon. There is just something about the way the filet is prepared, old-school style and not a lot of bells and whistles. Bells and whistles are not needed because it's just so damned good: tender and flavorful. What else is delicious? The calamari is AWESOME-probably one of my favorite in any restaurant anywhere.The service here is above and beyond. Maria and George and the rest of the servers treat all of their customers like family which is why they have so much repeat business. In addition, you will never have an empty glass in front of you, whether is beer, wine cocktails, soda, coffee, even your glass of water is always refilled.Sure there are other places in The Valley that are fancier where the food comes to your table almost too pretty to eat, but that comes with a price tag and often a nice appearance is used to mask inferior quality. Not the case here, you always enjoy a good, down-home, no-nonsense meal with great service and all at a VERY reasonable cost.Old school yo!We're talking salad bar with beets, sunflower seeds and cottage cheese yo!We're talking prime rib of Flintstonian proportions! I met a group of good friends here recently. We were seated in a back (non window) room and my claustrophobia almost got the best of me. It was a pretty tiny room. Soon I decided it wasn't tiny. It was cozy. And soon the Coronas were a- comin' and the conversation was flowing.Our server, a delightful woman, was efficient and friendly. And a shout out to her just for handling a group of a dozen or so yelpers! Can you imagine waiting on us lol!?!?My prime rib and baked potato were pure perfection. The salad bar was fresh and fully loaded. Much like myself towards the end of the evening.The decor is all muraled-out if memory serves me. So there's a lot going on! So Feeney's you got a new fan! Great place to take my folks, out of towners or anyone I think is worthy of the Feeney charm!!!Yo!Confession - I am remiss in writing this review.Feeney's great meal and service was an excellent compliment to a great evening with friends!  You see, this raucous bunch took the place over on a Saturday night and while we were by far the loudest table they didn't mind a bit.  From @AZvern to @audreyrlwyatt to @TheDottsyZ to @ThomasWSmith to @lupnacca to @chrissyP71 to @cutepup8191 we all had a great time and enjoyed the old school food and service very much.I went here last weekend with the BF's parents to see if we would like to have our rehearsal dinner here. When we first walked in, I wasn't 100% convinced because this place is old school....like what I remember a sizzler or something looking like in the 90's. The place is dark and it has an old school salad bar.... need I say more? But this place really surprised me with their excellent service and food. We started with apps (which is totally unnecessary because the portions here are out of control). We had the spinach dip and the potato skins....it was good, but typical bar food. I also had a couple mimosas because they were on special for 1$....heck yes! We then got our soup/salad bar. I had the soup and it was good, nothing terribly special, but not bad. Then the (humongous) entrees....I had the lamb chops and they were delicious! They were perfectly cooked and seasoned....super juicy, they reminded me of eating lamb chops at home as a kid....definitely delicious. The BF had the new york strip which was equally good. He got it medium well, and they managed to keep it moist and juicy....awesome! We all got twice baked potatoes with our meals, which were very good (how can potato and cheese and bacon and whatnot be bad?). We finished with mud pie, which was ok, but nothing special. Anyway, at the end of the meal (while I was sitting there dying of stuffedosity) the owner came over and spent the time to chat with us about how our party was going to be set up and what the room would look like. I liked how friendly and accommodating the owner was. We are planning to have our rehearsal dinner, so I will update after that! Definitely check this hidden treasure out!
Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill=I hate this bar and grill.  Seriously.We had some friends in town that had enjoyed Toby Keith's a few years ago and wanted to go back.  So we made the stop at Harrah's on a late Sunday afternoon.  On the way to the casino, I called ahead to make reservations.  You can't.  So I asked how busy they were, expecting the girl on the other end of the phone to tell me there would be a wait.  Instead, I was told "We are the opposite of busy."  Things weren't looking good already.We were immediately seated and I enjoyed the feel of the place.  I'm not into country music but I don't mind it playing in the background.  It's pretty much an Applebee's or TGI Fridays feel, except with a country theme.  But you can only enjoy the scenery for so long....We waited, and waited, and waited.  It took at least 15 minutes before our server even came over to greet us and get our drink orders.  Someone in my group wanted one of the specialty mixed drinks that are listed on the back of the menu (the ones that come in mason jars - 19 flipping dollars).  When my friend asked how much a 16-ounce version of the drink would be, she was told it was $12 but it would only come with a half a shot in it.  What??  I'm going to just say that we misheard or she misspoke, because that can't be right at all.  And the bad signs kept on coming....I would say a good half hour went by before we got our meals.  I ordered the quesadillas with veggies and they were awful.  DRIPPING in grease- I had to blot them with napkins just so I didn't get grease on my clothes.  It was served with some sad shredded iceberg, mushy chopped tomatoes, and a super boring poblano salsa.  I managed to eat half and then called it a day.  $13, but worth $0.My husband ordered the Ranch House Salad.  It claims to come with iceberg AND romaine, but there was only iceberg in that bowl.  Unless you're talking about a wedge salad, iceberg lettuce just screams cheap ingredients and that little thought went into making the salad.  He also got a couple of slices of tomato, a little bit of cheese and croutons, and about a tablespoon of corn.  On the side were two enormous containers of ranch dressing- you know, in case you want to eat 1200 calories in salad dressing during your meal.   $12, but worth about $6.We also got a side of fries for $5.  They were actually really good (especially with all the leftover ranch from my husband's salad) and the portion was pretty generous.My friends ordered the She's a Hottie Wrap and the Steak Sandwich.  I didn't hear anything good or bad about their food or the mason jar drink.We then proceeded to wait again for the check and for it to be brought back to sign once we paid.  Our drinks were refilled once the entire time we were there.When it was all said and done, my friend said that a few years ago it was a fun place to be.  Now there's just terrible service despite the fact that the place had zero customers.  There are typical overpriced menu items like you'll find all over the Strip and ridiculous price differences for Harrah's players card members vs. non-card customers.  Do yourself a favor and go next door to the Venetian and eat at Grand Luxe- similar food and price but better quality and service with a larger menu.  Toby Keith's will do if you are starving and have a broken leg and you can't hop any farther before you pass out from hunger.Oh, and there's a $6 charge if you want to split a meal with someone.  There should be crimes against stupid pricing like this.Firstly, everyone should know that Toby Keith has nothing to do with this location at Harrah's. He did sell his likeness to the group that does own this location. If you are looking for cheaper prices and a true Toby feel you should try the locations he does own in Oklahoma.I was told it would be about a 10 minute wait and they have some tables and chairs to sit and have a drink or just hang out while you wait to be seated. I ordered the "Fried Chicken Salad" and it was fantastic. It is so huge you can eat off it for 5 days! The ranch dressing was thick and delicious.I loved the country music playing and how other customers all sang along with the music together. When "Red Solo Cup" played everybody was singing and having a great time. They have many drink specials and for beer lovers they have special sizes just for you! With a players card I was able to get a discount off of my bill. If you want a good time this place is a must try!Met some friends here for drinks and to hang out for a bit.  The joint is tucked away on the 2nd floor of Harrah's in the back near the entrance to the Monorail.  It's too small to be a club.....about 1/2 the size of Gilley's.  The food here is OK bar food.  Our friends ordered some Wings and I sampled a few....they weren't bad, just OK.  Same goes for the Fries.  Since I didn't pay, I didn't catch the price.The waitresses are supposed to be cute/hot....but only 1/2 of them were.  The others looked a little "sloppy".  I hate saying that, but if you're going to put your staff in sexy outfits, I'd make sure they are able to meet high standards....especially in Vegas.Overall, the food/experience was just OK.  The best part is the music.  The joint feels very 'touristy'.  I'd give it another chance under the right circumstances.Return Factor - 50%If you have a choice DON'T DINE HERE. Toby Keith I HATE YOUR BAR & GRILL. I would rather stay home and get a third degree burn in my mouth from a Lean Pocket than ever dine at this type of place, but sometimes it's not about what I want. It was my sister's birthday and her and my mother love country music and Toby Keith in particular. My mom had mentioned she wanted to take my sister here so I took the bull by the horns and made it happen. Big mistake.We all know there are outstanding restaurants on the strip that are worth every over priced dime that you spend. Not this one. This falls into the other category. The Over Priced Food That Just Sucks Themed Restaurants.Still, I can get past the price just to make people I love happy, but not this time. In a nutshell.The food wasn't terrible. My sister ordered meatloaf potato skins with gravy for our appetizer. This was creative, yet under seasoned, but still I was thinking this would be cool to recreate at home for one of my dinner parties. Maybe with sweet potatoes.Next we each had a sandwich which does not include fries and my sister added fries. My sandwich was a grilled BBQ chicken sandwich which wasn't terrible at all. I could only eat half and brought the rest of the chicken home to my dog. One Coke, two well drinks and $95 LATER!!!!!!! Fuck me.Like I said, I can get over the price, but the waitress broke my number one rule. IT WAS A BIRTHDAY AND SHE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR MY SISTER. Not that we expected a lap dance or Toby Keith to serenade us in tight jeans, but something! I made it a point to tip the busser and have her tell the waitress about the birthday (let me say those girls are the ones hustling in this joint) . The waitresses merely take your order and then hand you your check at the end. Other than that they do shit. It's all about the bussers. Our busser  was on point and I know she told the waitress. Well Sue or Suzie our blonde waitress brought me the bill and I mentioned it to her and she just looked at my sister and said, "Happy Birthday". I wanted to rip her Lee Press-On nails right off. Well, I tipped her accordingly and then tipped the busser again.If mediocre, overpriced, under seasoned bar food and country music is your thang than you will be in hog heaven with the trailer park beauties servin' it up. If you are looking to spoil someone you love on their birthday with a simple scoop of vanilla ice-cream and a feckin' candle than do not come here.Let me premise this review with "I like Toby Keith's and his music", so this review is in no way impacted by my personal taste in music or the artist. Now with that said, I do NOT like his restaurant and food.  My review is not based on a single visit, but the last of 3 separate occasions with similar if not exact circumstances.  All of my visits were on a weekend evening and for dinner.The 1st thing which I found odd when arriving (2 of the 3 times) was no music playing.  It wasn't that it wasn't Toby Keith's songs, or even country music...but NO Music at all. The TVs were tuned to various channels ranging from the World Cup (the vast majority) to baseball, ESPN and even a cooking channel, however no sound.  When I inquired if they would be playing any music or at least have Keith's videos playing I was told "No, the bartender and managers are watching the world cup."Now I could see if the place was busy and everyone was interested in the game, but the place wasn't even half full and NO ONE was even paying attention to the game other than the staff.  However, they were intently watching the game to the point it took us almost 5 minutes to be acknowledged and 15 minutes to be seated.  I had similar experience on both times prior as well.Once seated the service did pick up, however our poor server was covering the vast majority of the restaurant as the others were focused on the game or their phones.  She took our drink orders right away, but stopped by a few times to apologize as it was taken longer than normal to prepare our drinks. We didn't order anything other than a beer and one of their signature cocktails.We placed our dinner order once the drinks arrived.  Very shortly afterwards ONE of the entrees arrived (Fried Bologna Sandwich) burnt yet cold.  The server was shocked when she saw it and was present when my entrée arrived.  Mine was cold as well and she took them both back right away.  She returned about 10 minutes later saying the 2nd sandwich was also way over cooked so she had them doing it yet again.  Needless to say after all of this our server apologized over and over, but yet management never once came over, or stopped watching the TV either.  I don't knock the server, as she was working hard to try and keep up, but the food and rest of the service staff was horrible.  I hate giving 1 Star reviews, but I also hate horrible experiences and would prefer to warn others.I came here with my friend William, he hug out here while in town for work. We got lucky and got a place at the Bar the bartender was cool, cute and on point with the drinks and had a cool spin the beer bottle, open-the-beer-flick-the-cap-and-side-kick-it -spin the opener back into the holster gig going onneet!the food was OK, Bill got the TK Nachos tri color chips with cheese and beans, peppers queso sour cream and guac looked pretty good.I had the cowboy cheeseburger The bun was buttery and soft and had a fat wet spot from the pickles. It was not Med well and it was meh over all.I do like that active duty military eat for free.A group of friends and I decided to visit Toby Keith's I Love This bar & Grill for dinner.  We got in without reservations with only a minimal wait at 6:00 on a weeknight in July.  It was a little tricky to find as it was upstairs and around a corner inside of a casino (Harrah's Las Vegas), but after wandering around for a while we finally figured it out.  The decor is very cutesy country, fitting since the bar's namesake, Toby Keith, is a famous country singer.  The atmosphere alone is worth part of the cost of the meal.  We pushed together a couple of tables and ordered a few drinks.  Now, I should probably warn you, as I WISH someone had warned me, that their drinks are HUGE and come in large mason jars.  Even the adult beverages come in these same jars, and they don't make them weak an watered down, either.  You'll be feeling your liquor by the end of your first one, and I had more than one.  I was drinking one of their signature cocktails called The Patriot. The Patriot consists of Jim Beam Kentucky Bourbon, Southern Comfort, dry vermouth, and sour mix with just a splash of sierra mist on top.   Let me tell you, they go down smooth.  I had a sip of my friend's Georgia Peach (vodka, peach schnapps, and sierra mist, and it wasn't too shabby either.When it came time to order the entree I decided to go with the BBQ'D rotisserie chicken as it looked like one of the healthiest items on the menu.  For about $18 I got a half chicken slow cooked on a rotisserie to a tender and moist perfection and brushed with a generous helping of barbecue sauce.  It came with a choice of two sides; I chose mixed vegetables and a baked potato.  I asked them to put just cheese and bacon on the potato and put the butter and sour cream on the side. Everything was tasty and while I felt stuffed by the end of the meal, at least I didn't feel like I'd clogged my arteries with grease.  One of my friends even mentioned how tasty my plate looked.I'd definitely come back again the next time I'm in Vegas
Red Onion Lounge & Restaurant=Known as "The Onion" by regulars, this is an awesome dive bar with some of the best burgers in the valley.  I used to live near it - and went FAR too often.  My friend told me he went there the other day - can you say Jealousy?   The bar rocks.  The service is out of this freaking world.  Go there 3 times in a month and they'll most likely remember what you ordered.  Alcoholic drinks are served stiff, and sodas are served LARGE so the designated driver doesn't have to keep asking for a refill.  (I hate that!)  Menu is limited - as bar food should be - but everything here is awesome.  There is no "kitchen" in the back - you can watch everything they are doing right to the side of the bar.  Where did those french fries come from?  Oh yea, they put a potato on that metal device, pulled a handle and presto - fry shapes.  As for the tomato and lettuce?  It's in a Tupperware container in the fridge.  Other than that it's burgers, chicken, fries and onion rings.  Even if there is just one person behind the bar, they will come out to see what they can get ya - drinks or otherwise.  And they'll bring it to your table.  Sure, there are big screen tv's, pool tables and a pretty decent juke box for a spot like this.  But the real attraction is watching the regulars come and go while you enjoy your awesome burger goodness.I sent out a yelp for a new place to eat and was told to check out R.O. I am glad I did. The place is located South of Greenway (both of them) and right before the AL's Rayco, on the West Side. It is a simple looking place with nothing extraordinary to draw you in. BUTOnce you get inside it is a very comfortable bar. The place holds a bunch of people, has several pool tables and a full bar to sit at. There is a little "outside type patio for you lung killers". Several video games, bar top machines etc. Since I was ther for lunch, I did not have the Captain and Coke but verified they do have it. ( happy face here)I had the cheeseburger, (fresh sirloin) with a toasted bun, lettuce, tomato, and pickle. IT WAS FAN-TASTIC. It might have something to do with the pat of butter melted on the top as she was cooking it. I also had the hand cut french frys. They were really good. The next trip will be for the Braut. The only bad thing I can say is, although worth it, the burger, frys and coke came to $11.75. I would have preferred a lunch special with it as a combo instead of the ala-carte. The place was clean, the owners are fun and do not mind a little chit chat while they cook and run around. They have the football package for the sports fans. They are a Packers Bar but don't let that stop you. Check it out if you haven't before.
Brooklyn NYC Pizza=This Pizza is LAME.  I should have gone with my instinct that a downtown "pizza by the slice" pizza joint shouldn't be completely empty at 11:30am on a weekday and gone somewhere else, but I didn't.  The place was completely empty and it still took them 12 minutes to get me my two slices (which were huge).  I hate to say it, but the pizza completely sucked.  The crust was so rubbery that I couldn't pick up the slice without it flopping over.  For two slices and a coke I paid nearly $8 but I wouldn't have paid $2 for that "food".  I forced myself to eat one slice and then threw out the other.Yuck
Cravings Buffet at Mirage=I have to eat at Cravings whenever I'm in town.  I don't care how hung over I am, or how much money I've lost, I will eat prime-rib, eggplant parm, sugar-free hazelnut gelato, sushi, sugar-free cheesecake, crab legs, fried shrimp, fried chicken, sausage, ham, bacon, smoked salmon, meat n' cheese, and salad.  If you think that's gross, you should catch me when I'm not on my diet.The last time I was here, my friend Cynthia and I never actually dined together.  It was more of a tag-team (not the Whoomp! There it is! kind).  Somehow, whenever one was eating, the other was going up for more food.  Next time, I'll be the 2 plates-at-a-time kind of girl.I'm broke.  No, not just gambling broke (which I was).  Much worse.  Stripper broke.  The worst feeling.  I spent all that money only resulting in.........zipper chaffing.  Get that mental picture?  gross..yeh imagine how I feel.Waking up dejected and just enough money to buy 4 happy meals...we were hesitant.  Hesitant to go to Sterling buffet (ironic that we'll drop hundreds on lap dances but not $75 on caviar huh?), the cocoa-butter-smellin-asses opted over to the Cravings buffet in Mirage.  What makes the Food Slut smile in such gloomy conditions?  23.99 AYCE and AYCD champagne.  WHAT?  Say WHAT?!?!  Yes, AYCE crab legs, ribs, prime rib.................and CHAMPAGNE!Quality?  Well...it's a buffet.  You only go to gorge yourself on cheap meats and booze...mmmm..just like how I like my women.  Low maintenance....er..but not cheap.This is one of the few buffets that my classmates and I have not tried so we came and visited it one day after class.  It was around 12pm and we were starving! The line to pay wasn't long, but we waited about 5-10 minutes to get seated.  I was pretty impressed with the selection at this place.  I hated the lunch buffet at Green Valley, Mandalay Bay, and Planet Hollywood, so I expected this buffet to be completely disappointing.  I'm glad they proved me wrong!!Their sushi spread wasn't that great.  They had two platters full of tiny little sushi rolls.  But they had a bunch of stations that I seriously couldn't even get to because I was so full!! They served crab legs and oysters in one end, and BBQ tri tip and filet slices on the other.  Their pasta station wasn't that great though, all they had that day was spaghetti with meatballs. Their dessert station was okay.  Their sugar free stuff did not taste very good but their gelatos, chocolate pastries, and cookies were yummy!  It was still a good experience. Another buffet to check off my list.  I only have two more months left here in Vegas, and I have 2-3 more casino buffets to hit up before leaving!My typical experiences at a buffet. 1. I get my moneys worth no matter what the price is, I repeat, no matter what the price is. 2. I eat to the point of almost puking. 3. Not 28 bucks w/ gratuity. What on Earth went wrong at Cravings?! Please consider renaming to Loss of Appetite. Nothing I repeat, nothing looked tempting enough to reach my plate. I ate a couple slices of prime rib, guacamole and chips, some steak, fruits, done. Everything else tasted old.The gf went irate because I was not eating. Am I sick?Came here on a Sunday for the champagne brunch. It was about $28 which is a lot cheaper than the nicer Vegas buffets. And you don't have to wait in a super long 1-hour line which is a plus!I was actually pleasantly surprised by this buffet! I really didn't expect much because it's in the Mirage hotel and I'd never really heard of it but they actually have a huge variety. Quality isn't all there for some of the food items, but there is a HUGE variety of eclectic food. And I love how every section is neatly labeled (ex. "chinese", "sushi", "mexican", "desserts", "salad", etc) so you can go for exactly what you want. Some food highlights:1. The prime rib was surprisingly really good! Red, soft, and juicy. My friend asked if they had cranberry sauce, and they went to the back and brought a huge bowl out for us. So nice of them!2. They have fried plantains!! Yessss!3. Crab legs were cracked open in half already like at Bellagio buffet so it's easier to eat but I didn't like the way they tasted. It was pretty much frozen cold and was too salty/fishy for my taste. 4. The eggs benedict looks really nice, but it was a little too bland in my opinion. 5. They have sriracha sauce if you need that with your chinese food like I do!6. They have a gelato bar hidden in the corner next to the desserts! Note: it's NOT self serve. So don't try to go back there by yourself and scoop your own.  Just wait patiently and someone will come to help you. ;)Oh I really enjoy this buffet....In the past I never really enjoyed the buffet at Mirage, but ever since Cravings buffet was established I've became a fan of this place...The decor is sophisticated at it's best.. all the nice LCD TVs along the entry way showing a slow motion of an egg being dropped into a pile of flour.... awesome way to start a buffet!  (lots of other food related video clips for your enjoyment!)Here are the typical review section for a buffet...Pizza:  Pretty good.. probably about as on par as CPKs... so pizza lovers will enjoy.Carving station:  Prime Rib and Ham.... decent prime rib as it was more red than how I've liked it, but the server was nice enough to carve the other side for me and was very attentive!  Definitely a plus!Mexican food section:  Had some breakfast burrito but didn't taste that great.. pretty dry in preparation so decided to past on this section for the rest of the time there.Cold seafood:  Had snow crab legs and shrimp cocktail for brunch!  Cool!  I didn't really eat too much of this because it seemed too early for me for crab legs but others were diggin this!Hot seafood:  Had some paella, pesto cream mussels, and some salmon... they were all fair tasting.Special metal room for fresh Chinese noodles!  This was my favorite!  A chef is inside this steel room cooking fresh noodles with the options of wonton soup or beef stew soup.... had some gyoza and also few dim sum servings (little shrimp wrapped in rice paper), all very tasty!  The best part was hot roast duck and BBQ pork to go along with the noodle soup!  YUM!!!  Definitely my favorite!Chinese food section:  Not a big fan... bored of all the orange chicken that everyone is serving and beef with broccoli, I think I will past for sure..... (But the egg drop duck soup was very delicious!  Not salty yet sweet tasting!  Add some scallions and cilantros and you are definitely good to go here!)Crepe station:  Fresh peach / peach cream crepe.... wow!  One of the best  crepes I've had in a while as the cream reminded me of Beard Papa's except is a little bit tarty..... but not overly sweet and just right...  Crepes were made to perfection so it turned out awesome!  Had to share it with everyone though.. couldn't finish this large chunk of heaven!Salad station:  Skipped this because I was getting really full, but noticed that they had fresh made Paninis if requested.... so for those of you who like to take a little snack out of the buffet for later.. this option would be great as those sandwiches looked healthy and wonderful!  I'll give it a try next time!Dessert station:  By this time I'm ready to faint..... but had to pull myself to take a look.... took a sugar free cheesecake and that's about it... not bad.....  Had to end the meal with ice cream though... so grapefruit gelato was on my menu to clean up my palate.....Cravings...... I can't crave you anymore for today.... maybe another time.....Definitely not craving this place again....Staying at the mirage and on a time schedule, this seemed to be our closest option for our breakfast choice this early Saturday morning.The place is aesthetically pleasing and appeared to be clean and well kept. Arrangement of food was organized to aesthetically pleasing visual as well, making the majority of the food items appear quite appetizing, except for a few beat up egg benedicts.Unfortunalty looks can be deceiving, which apparently it was for the most case with most of the breakfast Items I tried.I made my first and last round starting at the omelet station. The guy behind the counter took some time to make the omelet, did it a little carelessly however; it ended up being the only decent tasting item I tried.Most of the sausage links and patties I tried tasted as if it was picked from the bottom of the barrel. I tried some cheesy potatoes like casserole thing that looked better than it tasted.The dessert items did not look appealing enough to try though,I had a bowl of some oatmeal, fruity dish with milk that was semi sweet and extremely tasty.The service was nice and the place appeared to be well kept however the food has not enticed me enough to want to give them another shot.One thing I love about Vegas is trying out all the different Buffets. Do not get me wrong I am very meticulous about the ones I go to. We were getting hungry and so were our friends. We all decided to come here for dinner. Make sure you have your "M life" card, as it does help points wise.For dinner its $26.99 per person, yes I know it is a little steep but its Vegas plus you are getting a lot of food. When we arrived, the line was pretty long at 8:00pm on a Tuesday night but the lone cashier kept the line moving. While standing in line we were laughing at the LCD TV's they have up. At random times they will have different foods flashing up but in slow motion (kind of like food sex) not going to explain anymore, you will just have to go yourself to see it!The host who sat us was not too friendly but we were seated pretty fast, our table was close to the action so we didn't have to walk to far to get to everything. Only thing I totally hated was the bathrooms which were not located inside the buffet, you had to walk out hang a left, and there they were! Our waiter was nice but it seemed like her mind was somewhere else. She took our drink orders and said we could start eating whenever we would like. All four of us made a mad dash in different directions!  FOOOODDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This buffet has:-Pho (it is freshly made at some point, but sits out)-Wontons-Crab legs (I was impressed that these legs had a lot of meat)-Jumbo Shrimp-Prime Rib-Turkey-Lemon herb chicken-Various pre-made sushi and sashimi's (eeps do not touch)-Various deli meats and slices of cheese-Pasta-Veggies-Potatoes (Both mashed and wedges)-Woodfire Pizza-Mexican slow-roasted pork-Greek Salad-Chips and salsa-CornbreadDessert:-Mango or Pistachio pudding-Chocolate Mousse-Various cheesecakes (sugar free option too)-Chocolate logs-Large selection of sugar free stuff-Macaroons (no I did not miss-spell it, it is not the French kind)-Fruit-Whipped topping-Ice Cream-Mini Pies-CookiesAnd oh so much more!After about four plates, I was tapping out... I had to sit for about 20mins before I could start on the dessert end. The food was not bad unlike some of the reviews I have read. I put it this way some days are better than others, it happens everywhere you go! You just have to look and know before you decide on what you are going to grab and eat. Our waiter took our plates away pretty fast and our drinks were filled with a smile. We left in food comas and wanting our beds!! Good job cravings for stuffing us silly!!Located in The Mirage..Cravings is about 26 a person. Pretty big, and they have their dessert bar, salad section, Greek section, Chinese section, sushi, noodles, raw food, Latin, Breakfast, Italian, and the omelet man. I like how majority of the sections have somebody that can make it for you. Noodle section had a lady who can make you your noodles. Salad bar area had a lady who tossed it for me...........no dirty-ness. The Chinese food was not good at all. Got the fried rice, bok choy, noodles, and egg roll...did not like any of it. They had a good variety for the Latin section most definitely.My fella and I came here during a weekday for dinner. We had purchased the Travelzoo deal for two buffets with unlimited beer and wine. The place was really dead. We came at a very off hour hoping to avoid crowds and we successfully did this. The staff was attentive and friendly and we never had to remind them for refills or to clear our plates. The line is kept very clean, which is a must when I visit buffets. They don't have a lot of selection and it's kind of difficult to find some things since everything is spread our so far apart. They take minimalist design to the max. They only have 4 or five dishes to choose from for each type of food, which is a little bit of a letdown. Buffets should be all about selection and they don't have a lot of choices. The food was standard. Nothing amazing, but there were a few standouts. I did enjoy the salad bar. They allow you to pick all the ingredients you want and they mix them for you. That was probably my favorite part of the meal. The desserts were limited as well. I ended up with macaroons. They were very good. Warm and chewy, definitely another highlight of the evening.I have to note that our beers were overly carbonated and both my fella and I couldn't even finish half of our glasses. It was Bud Light, which was expected, but it was so bubbly it tasted awful. For the price, we didn't feel ripped off, but we definitely won't be going out of our way to return. Overall, we had a pleasant experience, but it's not one of the better buffets on the strip by any stretch of the imagination. The food is really two star, but the service bumped it up to three star for me.I've been to the buffet at Wynn and I've been to Wicked Spoon. While both are spectacular choices, I think one of the biggest drawbacks of both of them is that the wait is pretty long. It can be anywhere between 40 minutes to 1.5 hours.You'll never had such a wait at cravings. Since we didn't want to wait that long and we needed some sort of sustenance to soak up all the excess alcohol we drank the night before, we decided to be efficient and go to the buffet downstairs from the Mirage, where we stayed this weekend.We arrived there around 10:30a and zipped pass the cashier since there was no line! For $28, which is $10 less than Wynn and Wicked,  we got not only entry into the buffet, but unlimited mimosas.While I wouldn't say the choice selection here is that big of a range, they did have all I wanted from a buffet. Smoked salmon, check. King crab legs, check. Prime rib, check! But one of the greatest things I discovered at this buffet was that they had Bouillabaisse!! The soup was prepared pretty well, while it doesn't compare to what I had in Marseilles in 2010, it sure hit the spot in my stomach and evoked many great memories from my time in Europe!Overall, Cravings is an underrated buffet you should consider if you don't want to wait at Wynn or Wicked. 4 stars and definitely returning again!I came here on a Saturday evening, and we got 2 buffets for $42 (We used a casino BOGO, $37.82 with tax). The meal also came with unlimited wine and beer. - We came around 8pm, which was a great time for us because we didn't have to wait in line for a while. There was just 1 couple ahead of us. I thought that was pretty good for a Saturday night. It took less than 10min for us to be seated at our table. - I suggest starting off with the shrimp cocktails and crab legs. The line can get pretty long, but if you time it right, your meal will start off great. The shrimp cocktails are pretty big too compared to Feast Buffet. Crab legs not as meaty as Bellagio. - Their wanton soup was pretty good but not as good as the Rio Carnival World. - Prime rib was average like any other buffet like Feast, but there is no grill if you wanted it Med-well or well done like Sam's Town. - I did enjoy their seafood stew. It had a lot of scallop and clams in it, less small shell bits, few corn. - Avoid the steamed cod. It was a bit tough and flavorless. - Do mack on the BBQ spare ribs! It was tender and so saucy! I loved it. It was especially tasty with the creamed corn. I love corn! :D nom nom- The sushi was filler for me so after a few, I didn't bother getting more- Their dim sum was pretty good. I suggest that you should at least grab one of each. Don't get the Ramen though. The noodle tasted like Maruchan. meehhhhh! But I did really like the egg! - I don't care much for the desserts, but my girlfriend thought it was worth trying. Don't expect to find macarons here though!- Although I did not drink the wine, I did get the beer. The choice was between a Bud Light or a pale ale. Each time I got a drink, there were at least 2 or 3 people ahead of me. I suggest double fisting to reduce the wait time. Haha. - Friendly service. Clean and fine dining.The Cravings Buffet at The Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas offers eleven international food stations serving dishes on an all-you-can-eat basis with unlimited wine and beer. It's  the only buffet with an enhanced self service beverage station with 150 plus coca cola flavors, all for $31 per person for dinner.The set up of each International food station is very identifiable and they are laid out in an orderly fashion.I particularly enjoyed the crab legs at the seafood station, since the legs were already cut in half and very easy to eat. I enjoyed it together with the mixed fried rice.The selection of Sushi and Sashimi are good but I was not particularly blown away (I had tried a better Japanese buffet off the strip.)All in all, with its rich selection of dishes, best value and great customer service, Cravings at The Mirage is highly recommended. I will definitely come back!I got a free lunch buffet at Cravings thanks to playing Facebook slots on MyVegas.com. Out of the Vegas buffets I've had the pleasure of gorging out at, this was the least quality out of them all. They had a good selection of foods, sorted by the type. Asian, American, Italian, fish, etc. The food seemed to be fresh, but they had obviously cut some corners on the food. The eggs Benedict was served on a roll, not the typical kind I'm used to. The shrimp was, well shrimpy. There was a long line to wait for the carving station. When I got the roast beef back to the table, it was rather fatty- a low quality of beef. The desserts seemed to be leaning heavily towards the sugar free side, which blows my mind. If you're going to a Vegas buffet, I'm sure you're not terribly concerned about your waist line. There was a lady that came by and picked up the used plates, but there was no other service available. You had to get your own drinks like some sort of shlub. I was pleased to see that there were about four different types of sushi, which seemed fresh. But they were lacking many things that I have come to expect on a Vegas buffet. They had no crab legs. The pizza was a shade better than Little Caesar's Pizza. Yes, the food was plentiful, but not the high grade that I have come to expect from the Mirage on everything else.The drinks were impressive. Free beer. But they only have Anheiser Busch products. Boo. They had one of those magical Coca-Cola machines where you can get over a hundred varieties of soda.  I was disappointed in the quality of food, but I didn't get food poisoning or anything. It was OK, but I don't think I'll be back.
Copper=My husband and I have been wanting to try Copper for quite a while.  I have to admit we were divided on our overall rating... if I could give 3 1/2 stars, I would.  I cook a lot and, as a rule, my husband and I never want to eat somewhere that serves food we could eat at home.  Strangely enough, I cook traditional Indian food quite a bit.  From the start, the menu did not wow me.  I usually struggle over what to order but tonight there were really only two main course items that interested me - my husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and I ordered the Lamb Rhogan Curry.  We also ordered samosas (my favorite part of the meal), garlic naan, and a mango lassie (delish - I always have to order a mango lassie!).  The samosas were absolutely amazing and I loved the spicy sauce drizzled underneath them on the plate.  I was not so impressed with the three side sauces served with the two pieces of naan that accompanied our appetizer order.  Our water glasses remained filled - right up until the point we actually got our meals - and then while eating my slightly spicy lamb, I was forced to chew on a few ice cubes because there was no server or busboy to be seen.  Our main course dishes were not stellar - the quality of the meat was quite good but the overall flavoring was somewhat lackluster.  My husband's tikka masala almost seemed a little too "tomatoey" for my taste - he was not impressed at all, he said mine is better.  (Aww, so sweet...)  My lamb had a bit of a kick to it but the sauce was not "lick the bowl clean" kind of good - far from it, to be truthful.  To me, Copper is not the place to go if you are simply looking for a tasty, authentic, Indian meal.  Copper is the place to go for a nice dinner, a date perhaps, if you are in the mood for a  trendy, modern take on Indian cuisine.Indian food is almost always expensive, so I won't even bother to complain about that.  But the food here is good and they accomodated a special request, so for that Copper gets high marks.  The SAMOSAs are as expected.  Potato and pea wrapped in a nice fried crunchy dough. The chutneys are tasty.  Nothing out of the ordinary or that you couldn't get anywhere else (or make at home).CHICKEN CHETTINADU is not for the faint of heart (or palette).  My colleague was warned that the base was spicy, but she scoffed and said she loved spicy food.  Fast forward 20 minutes and there was sweat dripping from her forehead and her eyes and nose were watering.  I tasted the gravy, and thought it was great, but I didn't try to eat a bowl full of it.  All entrees are served family style, with rice added to the table.  We also got a bit of naan free but ordered extra with the meal.  No salt or pepper on the table, but they're happy to bring it if you ask.The ZESTY VEGETABLE BHAJI side was interesting.  Long julienned pieces of mixed vegetables, including beets, all mixed with a dry spice rub.  The traditional vegetarian menu offers PANEER MAKHAWALA, which is a red gravy similar to tikka masala or butter gravy.  Very rich and flavorful but not too spicy. I asked to substitue cauliflower / gobi for the paneer, and the chef nicely complied.  Overall this was a very tasty and well balanced dish.  The service was great, and the interior of the restaurant (located in a very old rehabbed house) is unique.  For people looking for more Indian options, try the University area.  It's full of great Indian hole-in-the-walls.  My personal faves: Persis (everything is good, but the Gobi 65 is amazing), Tulips (varied weekend buffet and good a la carte ordering) and Passage to India (great gobi manchurian and weekend/lunch buffet).
Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar=It's no secret that I'm not a huge steak fan, but since my parents like it and they were treating for dinner, I was powerless in the negotiation of venue and we went to Fleming's, an upscale steakhouse serving dead animals graded USDA Prime. Mmm.Despite the mall location, the restaurant is dark and intimate and the bar looked inviting. My affinity for plastic is relatively low, and with the exception of the Scottsdale equivalent of a gangbanger (an adult frat boy bearing a backwards-turned cap indoors) and his Barbie doll/date, the only people who were in desperate need of recycling were the hostesses which was a pleasant surprise given the environs.On the recommendations from a sweet but not saccharine waitress, we sampled:[NB: Prices are approximate, since Fleming's avoids website sticker shock.]- Starter platter (Gratis): Brie, olive tapenade and some crostini, celery and radish - a light start and a substantial improvement over the standard bread offering (which is also optionally served at entree time upon request)- Crab Cakes (~$15): Great crabmeat to breading ratio but not superlative as advertised- Sweet Chili Calamari (~$12): Expertly lightly fried, breaded and sweetened- Petite Filet (~$30): Dry, which is unfortunate in the most tender of steaks- Bone-in Ribeye (~$30): Very juicy and flavorful, significantly superior to the former- Beef Flemington (~$28): Filet Mignon in a light pastry shell and a Madiera sauce, juicy unlike the vanilla offering - a solid A- Dessert Sampler ($13):  - Creme Brulee: Divine vanilla goodness, I'd order it again and I'm not a general fan  - Cheesecake: Thoroughly unremarkable  - Chocolate Lava Cake: Overly sugary molten chocolate in a thin souffle-ish cake shell  - Peach Cobbler a La Mode: Proving the exception of the "less filler" trend, heavy on the cobbler but light on the fruitOutside of parental benevolence, an expense account or a serious apology to a significant other from the heartland, I wouldn't be looking for a dining experience like this, but I'd come back if the time was right. Unlike other local high end steakhouses, Fleming's does it with more tender delicious substance than heavy oily pretension.While I have been to a few Fleming's locations for dinner, up until last week I had never experienced Happy Hour.  What was I thinking!?  Fleming's HH by the numbers:  3 categories (mixed drinks, wine & appetizers) featuring 5 items for $6 each, 7 nights a week until 7pm.  A great way to take in the refined and inviting Fleming's atmosphere and eat/drink very well.On this particular evening, my friend and I enjoyed some HH offerings, and a couple items from the "regular" menu:Starting off with wine, we chose the Belle Glos "Meiomi" Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir.  While the HH wines are very good (on a previous visit I had the Pillar Box Shiraz - yum!) it was well worth departing from the HH list for this one.  Hey, it's Thursday... *Tenderloin Carpaccio.  In a word, magnificent.  Beautiful thin slices of beef topped with just the right amount of aioli and capers.  Perfect when topped with freshly-squeezed lemon juice and enjoyed on small slices of parmesan-topped toasted bread.  Oh!Chipotle Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese.  This is a side item from the dinner menu.  While "not a mac n cheese person" my friend humors my addiction to this cheesy treat.  This one was special - easily one of the best I have tasted.  The cheese had a slightly smoky flavor, with a hint of spiciness that wasn't overpowering.  It was just right - I didn't even want to add my usual Tabasco...  and that says a lot.Wicked Cajun Barbecue Shrimp.  While this was very, very tasty, the allure for me wasn't really the shrimp, but the SAUCE!  A captivating blend of hot chili spice, garlic, more garlic, butter and a few other magical ingredients I couldn't identify.  No vampires were coming near us after this!  We dipped our bread in it.  I could have eaten it with a spoon.  Seriously.When do you go to HH at the same place twice in one week?  When it is Amazingly Good!!  There are still items I need to try - seared ahi, I am coming back for you...* Two things You Should Know:  1) In the event (gasp!) you don't finish a bottle of wine at the restaurant, they can "re-cork" it so it can be legally taken home to enjoy later.  Nice if you don't want to purchase by the glass.  2) Get there early - the cozy booths in the bar area go fast!  Actually, wait...  Don't get there early.  Otherwise, I won't get a good seat.  :)I cannot think of enough terrible things to say about their reservation system at this location.  I was a huge fan of Flemings and a very loyal customer, until now.  The complete lack of customer service and obvious practice of over booking reservations is beyond disappointing.  Looking forward to a nice dinner?  Bring your patience (and a snack).Fleming's knows service, food and ambiance and they excel in all three. I have been to other Fleming's before, but just recently dined at this location. It's a perfect option in the DC Ranch option for a nice dinner out. From the outside, it looks like they don't have a patio, but they actually do and it's a good one because it's covered so it's not as hot in the summer. However, we dined inside during this visit and enjoyed the cozy atmosphere. The service at this Fleming's was excellent and the server paid very close attention to our requests, especially my pregnant request for very well done salmon. I enjoyed a Cesar salad followed by the BBQ salmon and thoroughly enjoyed both, especially the BBQ salmon. I highly recommend ordering it if you feel like something other than steak. However, the steaks are also delicious and I stole a bite of the Filet which was delicious as well. For dessert, I highly recommend the carrot cake. It is fresh and amazing! The frosting is delicious and the cake is perfectly moist. This was a nice dining experience and I definitely look forward to returning and especially taking advantage of their happy hour specials.I wasn't aware Fleming's had an A/V room, replete with screen and ceiling projector.Do you know what else this room has?A light switch with no dimmer.For those of you lucky enough to be seated in the main dining area, if you look toward the right rear of the room and see a very bright light, (sans the tunnel) that's the place.When first ushered into the room, I asked if this was the steerage section.They didn't laugh.Turns out, it WAS the third class section, only they were too nice to not inform us how we'd be eating our meal while being interrogated by a team of international spies, under an intensely bright light. To make it more fun, we were seated in the center of the room.These guys are real pranksters.After a while, others were ushered into the room, all of whom looked like they'd fucked-up in the lobby while waiting on a table and were now being punsihed; a mom with a small whiny child, an old couple - both with walkers, and a couple so obese, I think they sat them in there so if the chairs collapsed, no one would see.Fleming's - you made us feel like we didn't belong - as though we weren't good enough to sit in your half-empty dining area at 5:30 on a Saturday night.The next time I hope to see a light this bright, it's going to be after trudging through a long-ass tunnel, looking for an old white haired guy in a robe with a big 'G' on his pocket.Other than the bright light, dining with 'Goonies', and the extremely slow service, it was a real fucking hoot at 170 bucks.If your hostess marches you toward this room, don't go in there. Fake a seizure of something.Just don't go in there.You've been warned.The WaunaQueen and I dropped by Fleming's on a Sunday evening for a glass of wine, a couple of appetizers and a great view of the sunset over the west side of Madison with a couple of former co-workers.  As mentioned in other reviews, there is a subset of items from the drink and appetizer menu available for $6 between 5pm and 7pm.We ordered a couple glasses of the Vinedos Terranoble Sauvignon Blanc, the baked brie and the French onion soup just before the end of happy hour.  The wine came recommended by a wine blog I follow and it was the right choice for the setting and a decent value at $6 a glass.  The baked brie was a disappointment - just brie baked in a less- than-crispy puff pastry shell.  The cheese lacked that earthy flavor and needed a boost, whether from a sauce or some added herbs.  The gala apples served with the dish started to brown by the time we received our plate.The French onion soup ($12) also disappointed.  This dish is good test for a restaurant.  It takes time and skill to coax the natural sweetness out of the onion.  Rush the dish and it is bland, cook the onions with too much heat and they become bitter.  Cook the onions slowly at low heat and you are rewarded with a wonderful caramelization that provides deep, rich flavor.  The Fleming's version of this soup was on the bland side of the spectrum with its thin broth.  The baked gruyère and parmesan cheese topping was well executed and added a much needed punch of flavor.Our group enjoyed the patio setting at Flemings.  Despite sitting near the bustling intersection of University and Midvale, there was very little traffic noise to interrupt our conversation.  Our server was efficient, but less than enthusiastic.  At happy hour prices, it fit the A-OK definition of a three star rating primarily due to the setting and the wine list.  Outside of happy hour, I probably will go elsewhere to find more satisfying food options.UPDATE: After posting this review, I did get a message from the restaurant manager, apologizing that my happy hour experience with them fell short.  Her message was sincere,  appreciating that I took the time to provide feedback.  I then spoke with the manager on the phone and because of that positive interaction, I do plan on returning to Flemings.  It's a favorable sign when a restaurant uses feedback from their patrons to improve.Exchanged some of my Amex points for a $100 gift card here.  What a great dinner it was.  As a whole meal from beginning to end...it certainly is better than either Morton's or Ruth's Chris.  I like aspects of both those restaurants but certain things still lack for a complete meal.  For ex...we only order steak at Ruth's Chris.  No sides, apps or desserts...cuz they all suck.  But not this place. Fleming's was surprisingly awesome.  The place was also super packed for a random Tuesday night.  The bread for example doesn't come with just butter.  You get a feta cheese butter and a sun dried tomato butter.  I got the ribeye and the wife got the usual rare filet which were both fantastic.  Tons of sides to choose from and went with creamed spinach and mac and cheese. Had some special dessert not on the menu which was basically a super version of a Mcdonald's apple pie w/ cranberries and vanilla ice cream.  Fn great.  They also have a killer happy hour from 5-7.I am a regular fan of Fleming's, but had never before tried its Las Vegas location.  A Filet & Lobster Special for $34.95 drew Diane and me in with another couple.  After our meal was completed, we were quite glad that we had come.To begin at the beginning, we were presented with excellent chewy Rosemary Sourdough Bread with Chardonnay & Feta Cheese Butter.  Mmmmm!  Delicious!  Sun-Dried Tomato Butter was also offered, but I was not as fond of it.French Onion Soup that came next was good but small, and the cheesy top was not fully capped.  A small Wedge Salad with vibrant Cherry Tomato halves, Blue Cheese Crumbles, and a Blue Cheese Dressing was excellent.  After 2 quickly downed glasses of Iced Tea, my small glass was smartly exchanged by our server for a large globe.  But later, just as she was pouring me a refill from a pitcher, the very attentive waitress was suddenly bumped from behind by a plate deliverer, and I was doused with Iced Tea.  It was no big deal, and not our server's fault.  But the manager came over, gave me her card, and said that the restaurant would pay for any needed drycleaning of my shirt and pants.  I appreciated the gesture, but regular washing by Diane took care of the problem, with no lingering stains.  And, except for the splash, service was otherwise exemplary.My medium-rare Filet was excellent although peppery, and the meaty Lobster Tail was large and sweet, as I had hoped it would be.  Requested Bearnaise Sauce for the steak was somewhat viscous and excellent.  And, Drawn Butter for the  crustacean was tasty until it grew cold.  The busy restaurant was out of warmers, announced our server apologetically.  Sauteed Button Mushrooms yielded a very good side, and so did a platter of thin buttered Green Beans mixed with quite a few slices of mushroom.  But had I known that these greens would come with mushrooms, I probably would not have ordered a side of mushrooms, as well.We finished with Chocolate Lava Cake that came with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chantilly Whipped Cream.  It was a tasty end to a fine meal!My parents rarely take themselves out & I'm grateful to have the chance to treat them to a nice outing whenever I can. I was planning on taking my Father out to dinner at Wicked Spoon for Father's Day, but by the time he got off work that place would be closed. Since I took off work, I thought Fleming's would be the next best thing to try without worrying about the time. I took the last reservation at 9p.m. & we were promptly seated upon arrival. The hostess was welcoming, asked how I'm doing and how my day was, which was a pleasant to hear. She also informed me who's my server & wished us both to have a nice dinner & actually wished my Father.. & Happy Father's Day to you sir. My Father lit up & said.. Thank you thank you. That sure brought a smile on his face and to witness that.. brought a smile to mine. Great job to this hostess!!!It took a few moments for our server, Sarah to greet us & by that time, we were already ready to order. We, both decided to get their Prime Rib Dinner. It comes with a choice of salad, one side, & one dessert. Like Father, like Daughter.. we ordered everything the same... Fleming's Salad - Not spectacular or anything to rave about. There were too much sliced purple onions, which I had to put aside. The dried cranberries, croutons, & tomatoes were just okay. Extremely simple & looked cheap. The candied walnuts were overly covered with rock hard caramel, that I warned my Father to watch out in consuming it. You could literally hear me crack the candied part in my mouth & it wasn't a good feeling against my teeth. The best part... the dressing was tangy & fresh. The presentation itself wasn't appealing at all. Baked Potato (Fully Loaded) - As the side we chose... It was the Best in our entire meal. My Father noted that it was his first time ever seeing such an enormous size potato & all its fixins. It came exactly in this order of toppings on the baked potato.. sour cream, butter, green onions, bacon & cheddar cheese as being a happy surprise in the very end as you dig inside. We enjoyed this Very much & it was one of the most flavorful fully loaded baked potato I ever tasted. Each bite I couldn't believe how delicious it was. Every topping complimented one another & it was like a joy ride of warm gooey goodness in its highest form. I can't tell you enough how much I love this side.. If I can give 5 stars alone to one food item I tasted here... this would definitely be it. Even my Father goes.. this Prime Rib isn't the best, but... this Baked Potato is!Prime Rib - It comes with three sauces on the side, which consists of spicy mustard, horseradish, & au jus. I felt the au jus was too heavy in flavor & one bite with this sauce was overpowering the natural flavors of the meat. I did enjoy mixing the spicy mustard, which wasn't spicy at all, where you get any heat.. with the horseradish sauce, which was also very light like sour cream taste to it. The combination of these two sauces went great with the Prime Rib. I ordered mine Medium & it was cooked perfectly. My favorite part, the dark ends were in depth with flavor & I loved the tenderness of the meat. Overall, I thought this was an excellent entree. I would definitely order this again.Dessert time! You have to order their signature sweet.. Chocolate Lava Cake. We both learned the hard way.. you can easily be completely full & satisfied with one order.. easy. It comes with a thin cookie-like holder with two generous scoops of vanilla ice cream inside & topped with chopped pistachio nuts. Next to it, is the rich chocolate cake with a molten chocolate center of belgian warm chocolate. Baked to order, which takes 20 mins. to make. One of my favorite desserts. It also comes with a side of Chantilly Cream, which is the next best thing to sliced bread! So freshly whipped, light, & tastes like a whipped vanilla bean ice cream. SOOOOO soooooo GOOD! Every bite I took.. I added this cream with my cake. Heavenly!!! I am known to finishing all my meals, but I could only eat half this portion. When the server first presents this dessert to you, you'll just be amazing how much you get. It's like a whole meal... dessert style. Then sugar coma sets in & you have to reevaluate your desire to finish it all or throw in the towel. I... threw in the towel & rested my head back. Waaaaay too much for lil ole me. Even my heart was racing! Three mishaps, wanted to take our leftovers home, but the runner threw away half my dinner... Damn it! I love that Baked Potato!!! Oh well... Next time I want the to-go containers & bag it myself. Second, having to wait for a long time for our entrees to come out. Felt rushed. Third, being charged for both sides ($17) when it's included in the Prime Rib Dinner. I didn't catch it at first, but caught it after tallying 20% tip & giving my signature. You would think if I ordered that special, you would know not to charge the sides right?! Hmm honest mistake?! As another Yelper noted.. no such thing.If you're craving steak and don't want to leave the friendly confines of Summerlin, Fleming's should be near the top of your list. When we stopped in on a Tuesday night it was hopping and there was a 15 minute wait. So, apparently the fine folks in and around this master-planned community are well aware of the good eats here.The atmosphere is just like any other traditional steakhouse. You've got your white linens, dark wood accents, mood lighting, etc. And, just like other steakhouses you'll find the typical steakhouse fare: for example a wedge and caesar salad, French onion soup, some seafood, and a variety of steaks. It's familiar, comforting, and (most importantly) good.The crab cake appetizer ($15.95) consists of two small jumbo lump crab cakes in a lime butter sauce. They're lightly seasoned, allowing the sweetness of the crab meat to shine.Unfortunately, the butternut squash soup ($9.50) was a miss. Thin, watery, and runny aren't good qualities for any soup.The 14 oz. bone-in filet ($54) made up for it. While it could have benefitted from a more charred exterior, the seasoning was spot on and the quality of the beef was well worth the hefty price tag.We had two sides. The sautéed mushrooms ($9.50) contained a variety, most of which were slightly overdone, which I actually prefer. The sautéed sweet corn ($8.50) was average at best.Surprisingly, they have a kid's menu. With our little guy in tow, he gladly ordered a plate of chicken tenders ($14.95). What came out was a massive mound of crispy fries topped with several strips of chicken. The plate easily could have fed two or three kids. The meal also included an appetizer of celery, carrots, apples, and ranch. A kid's ice cream sundae is an additional $1.Splitting an entree usually means the wife and I have room for dessert. We went with their chocolate lava cake ($10.95). You'll definitely want to share this dish. It was a big mound of cake and oozing belgian chocolate. The vanilla ice cream and chopped pistachios provided a wonderful contrast in temperatures and texture. Countless restaurants have a version of this dish, but this one was truly memorable. The fresh whipped cream on the side didn't hurt either.The meal wasn't cheap but was much cheaper than a similar one on the Strip. They may play it safe with the menu, but it won't leave you disappointed. If you're looking for that traditional steakhouse experience it's good to know that you don't have to travel far to get it.One evening last week, we had a great Happy Hour AND Fine Dining experience in this elegant, comfortable restaurant. We'll be back again and soon!YELPIER DETAILS Fleming's has an upscale ambience, good food, superb service and at a reasonable price. Its menus offer nice selections of food and beverage.  It also has a classy bar. However, this restaurant does NOT have a view, and could be slightly noisy when filled to capacity.Yes, we had excellent dinners at Fleming's before, 2x, to be exact, since its sister restaurant right NEXT DOOR (Roy's) was closed recently- But this was the first time we came for its happy hour AND dinner. We enjoyed both!We started our nice evening with happy hour over delicious apps (Pork Belly; Calamari) and tasty glasses of cab, at $6ea. For our dinner, we had Chef's Specials: Mahi, $37; Steak & Shrimp, $43; side of asparagus, $10.50. The fish was fresh and flavorful. The steak was tender and juicy but kind of small, the 3 shrimps were tiny and  slightly overcooked. For dessert we shared a wonderful Chocolate Lava Cake/Ice cream, $12.50 over great tasting coffee!The serving staff for our happy hour and dinner were absolutely superb! Our waitress Monica and her crew were friendly and helpful, attentive but not overbearing. The hostess was friendly and welcoming. She cheerfully welcomed guests at the start, and warmly said goodbye to them at departure. However, as the restaurant was filled to capacity around 7pm, it was understandably a bit noisy. I would give it 5 Stars, if it had a view. In short, we had a wonderful happy hour/dinner experience here, and will be back again for more and soon! Nov 2013I've been to Flemings probably a dozen times in San Diego and Rancho Cucamonga.  This is my first time to the Las Vegas location.  The set up, size, vibe, and service is as consistent as it gets, but that's not necessarily a good thing.  I'm fine with the service and ambiance for the most part.  My only issue is the noise.  Tough to enjoy your steak and company when all you hear is everyone's conversation.  Regardless, I still had a decent dinner with the gf here the other night. As for my meal, I have never deviated from their 8 oz petite filet mignon.  Before dinner, I scoped out the menu and contemplated on something different.  But guess what? I chose the petite filet again.  The steak was decently sized, but was a little disappointed on the overall taste. I got my steak medium-well and thought it was too pink. As for taste, I thought it was just "A-Ok".  For a pinkish steak, I thought it tasted burnt. I don't know if it was Fleming's or if my taste in steaks have changed. Price is about what you expect at a steakhouse.  However, I've had better steaks with the same price points.  Overall, will I be back?  I'm sure I will one day.  Maybe next time I'll try their lobster or seafood.PS:  Their Mushrooms Ravioli is phenomenal.
Penn Station East Coast Subs=It had been a horrible day.  Lean Cuisine was not going to cut it.  Let's go to Penn Station East Coast Subs!Located off of Providence Rd, just past 485, this is in the same shopping center as Hickory Tavern and Harris Teeter (and Carvel!).  At 7:45 pm on a Wednesday (school night), there were more people there than I expected.  Upon walking in, I gave my order to a friendly gentleman, then moved a few feet to pay.  Drinks are self serve and my meal was brought to my table a few minutes later.   There are a few tables outside (which people were smoking at - GROSS), and quite a few tables inside as well.The food:12" cheesesteak ($9) - I can eat a 12" Subway sub with no problem, but this bad boy, wow... towards the end, I didn't think I was going to be able to finish it.  But I tried hard and believed in myself and managed to eat everything but the crumbs.   Served smoking hot, the meat was plentiful and well seasoned on bread that was toasted enough to keep the ingredients together (for the most part), but still soft on the inside.  I didn't go with the fully loaded cheesesteak (I don't like mushrooms or mustard) and had cheese, onions and mayo.  Absolutely delicious, though a bit drippy.Small fries ($1.69) - meh, they were fries.  I am not a huge fry fan and just ate a few, but they were hot and made from potatoes.  Ketchup is self-serve from a pump next to the drink machine and they also have malt vinegar if that is your preference.It was just over $13 for a 12" sub, small fry and a drink - a little more that your average sub place, but quite good.  Good food, friendly employees, clean interior, fresh tasting ingredients, Penn Station is a winner and I shall return.
Rao's=Vino, pasta & dolci, oh my!For those of you unfamiliar with Rao's, allow me to provide a little info.  The original Rao's is located in New York City.  It is super tiny and IMPOSSIBLE to get a reservation.  I mean, if Madonna and Bill Clinton couldn't get in!  Yes, it's true.  The folks that are privileged enough to dine at Rao's have standing reservations.  Fortunately for us mere mortals Rao's has a restaurant in Las Vegas at Caesar's Palace.  I have been fortunate enough to dine here several times and each time I have been pleased.  My most recent experience was last weekend.  My family and I were seated in the "fireplace" room which is an exact replica of the restaurant in NY, right down to the autographed pics of celebs and important peeps.We ordered family style so we could sample multiple dishes.  My faves were the lemon chicken (so moist and flavorful) and the penne alla vodka (TDF!!!).  Service was spot on.  The host added to the ambiance.  He reminded me of someone straight out of The Godfather.  He was so sweet to my little nephew!  Rao's is not fancy, but it does serves yummy Italian food.  Mangia bene!One of the things I LOVE about Vegas is all of the wonderful dining options.  The other thing I love is that you can actually GET a reservation at these wonderful restaurants.  Case in point: Rao's.  As most people know, Rao's (the original) is located in NYC and is so super-exclusive, that even celebrities have been turned away.  There are standing reservations so don't even try.  Until now.  Rao's LV is owned and operated by members of the family who own Rao's NYC.  The LV restaurant is much larger than the one in NYC.  There are even two rooms which are exact replicas of the NYC restaurant, right down to the autographed photos of celebrities who have had the fortune to dine at the original location.  I've been to Rao's LV multiple times, and each time I love it.  We always receive fabulous service and delicious old-school Italian cuisine.  This place is the kind of restaurant where even your Nonni (Italian grandmother) would feel like she was dining at the home of a fellow Italian family.  Seriously.It is that good.  Buon Appetito!  :)Rao's in New York City is notorious.  It is not clear how good their food actually is since no one is able to get a reservation at the restaurant.  Seriously, the wait is measured in terms of years, and at the end of the day, they primarily serve pasta like most any other Italian restaurant in the city.  In Las Vegas, it is a different story.  One can freely walk into the restaurant with the hope of actually getting a table.  Short of that, a seat at the bar is almost always guaranteed.  I believe the menu is the same, and the owner was at the restaurant on my visit, so I felt like I was able to have roughly the same experience as I would in New York if I had somehow managed a reservation.I ordered the gnocchi bolognese and had a glass of Montepulciano.  The dinner began with a bread course served with a plate of olive oil and vinegar.  I was happy with this beginning with the tasty bread and the good quality olive oil.  The gnocchi were beautifully presented simply dressed in a deep dish.  I had an impressive amount of pasta before me, and the gnocchi were not heavy at all.  I thought the texture was great.  The sauce was very flavorful and balanced.  Simple and good, exactly what I wanted.  The wine paired well.  More generally, I was pleased to have a nice selection of Italian wines available by the glass.  The restaurant itself was fairly busy and very dynamic.  The interior is dark and nearly every square inch of the walls was decorated with photos of the celebrities who have visited.  I know that can be kind of cheesy, for example at the Carnegie Deli, but here I was getting more of a Minetta Tavern kind of feel.  I think this location of Rao's is a wonderful place to have a glass of wine and a plate of pasta.  It definitely gets my vote over places like B and B Ristorante which charges far more for less.  Recommend.First, a lesson. The name of this restaurant does not rhyme with "Wows". It's more like "RAY-Oh's". And now you know. Feel free to click that little "Useful" button down below.Atmospherically speaking, Rao's is very nice. Warm, clean, inviting. Sort of homey, if you lived in a really nice home. With lots of people eating in it.Foodwise, Rao's is merely good, in my opinion. The pasta I had was fine, but there wasn't anything to really set it off from a bunch of other Italian restaurants I've been to. And it's pricey too. The average pasta price was around $24. A moderately sized side of spinach was $14. Yes, I realize price around here is as much a factor of location as anything else, but even factoring that in I don't think the price is QUITE justified. The service was good. Our waitress had good recommendations and water & ice tea glasses were refilled properly.Something else useful to know (hint, hint) is that while it doesn't say so on the menu, you can get half portions of pasta for a little more ($2 I think) than half the price of the full portion. I made a meal out of two half pastas, and it was enough food. They also give you plenty of bread. My friend's chicken dish was also quite big. If you aren't super hungry you could probably split an appetizer and an entree between two people, which would make Rao's a bit more affordable.I'm a little torn between 3 & 4 stars, but at the end of the day I'm not ready to call myself a fan.This scenario seems familiar to most...dinner for a friend's birthday...pick somewhere nice with a wide variety of food options that most in the party have not eaten at before.  The celebrant decided on Rao's in Caesar's.  I had forgotten until I walked up to the restaurant that I had actually eaten there twice before.  After this experience, I remember why I didn't remember them the first two times.  Our night began with a phone call to the restaurant to find out the dress code/attire.  We were told that it was business casual and that jeans were not permitted.  We asked even for women if they were nice jeans and were told we would be "turned away."  Upon arriving at the restaurant, the first guest I saw seated was wearing a Hawaiian print button up shirt, tan shorts and flip flops.  Next I saw a women in a tank top, white shorts and tennis shoes.  I had changed out of my outfit to meet their requirements, making us 20 minutes late, only to find out when we got there that we still would have been better dressed then some of the patrons.We were seated in a far corner in the back of the restaurant.  Greeted promptly with menus and a discussion of the specials.  The rest of my party was a bit put-off when we were told that the poached salmon was actually served in a "foil-bag."  We ordered drinks and reviewed the menu.  I explained what I had eaten before and what I thought might be good selections.  Being that I had been there before I decided to try something new.  Their vodka sauce is truly amazing and they had a ricotta shell dish that came with their famous marinara sauce, so I decided to switch it out with the vodka sauce.  The rest of the party gave their orders. Our waiter then became non-existent and seemed rushed or busy whenever he did finally come over to check on us.   Food came out after a long wait (the restaurant wasn't even busy)...mine looked like a glorified version of mac and cheese made with pasta shells and a vodka sauce.  I was very disappointed that there wasn't any ricotta in the shells.  When I inquired about it with the waiter, he told me I had ordered it that way.  I knew I had specifically asked for ricotta so he offered to bring me a side of ricotta.   The rest of the party was not satisfied with their meals either.  The waiter never asked what we thought about our meals.  When we finally got our check, we about passed out.  The drinks we had been ordering (Red Bull and house vodka) were $22 each.  These were tiny little cocktails that are served in the same size glasses that you get comp'd drinks in, while gambling in a  casino.  They charged separately for the Red Bull and vodka, which most places do, but charged us for a full Red Bull with each drink, with out bringing out the remaining Red Bull to the table (as most places do.)  We were appalled.  Dinner was over $250 per couple, the food was below average, and the service was horrible.  We even told him we were there for our friend's birthday and he looked at us like, "so?"  I can pretty much guarantee I will NEVER eat at Rao's again.  I am more than willing to pay decent prices for excellent food and service, but for what we received at Rao's, I would have rather gone to The Olive Garden and saved $200!  At least there I can get unlimited salad and breadsticks!  LOLI am not a glutton for punishment...this girl will NEVER make the mistake of going to Rao's for a nice night out with friends, EVER again.There's something a little unsettling about going to an Italian restaurant and being told by an angry German man that they won't serve you.  Didn't Mussolini and Hitler form some sort of tag team about denying people what they wanted or some such?Not that I'm comparing the inability to order a set of damn meatballs to genocide, but I've actually been told I couldn't get food there; nobody's ever tried to shove me into a gas chamber.  Melt me in lava, impale me, throw me off of catwalks that don't meet OSHA standards, wreck my pod racer, and ignite the bio gas coming from the Deathstar's latrines with a bomb, sure.Here's the deal:  If your website says you are open till midnight every night.....when someone shows up at 11, don't tell them that you closed an hour and a half ago because it was "a vittle slow".  It's Vegas - the town never shuts down.  You're telling me that you closed your entire restaurant in a major strip casino 2.5 hours early because you felt like it?  This has happened 2 of the last 3 times we've gone there.  Do these people have ANY idea how hard it is to find parking for the Deathstar?  Those resort parking lots are designed for 9 dollar a day subcompact rentals, not capital spaceships.  And don't even get me started on what happened last time I parked it valet - I'm still paying the fines associated with the planetoid they blew up because they thought the Deathray button was the e-brake.  It takes effort to get to this place.The worst part is just how unapologetic and rude these people are about it.  Look, I've dined at the Harlem location.  I know that you have to book it half a year in advance and if you don't like it then that's no sweat off of them because....well....you have to book it half a year in advance! But this is a much larger space in a major Vegas resort, and one that I have never seen at more than 20% capacity.  You aren't that damn special.  You aren't afforded the right to be a bunch of jackasses.  You guys are lucky that I had a 50,000 game Keno ticket at Caesar's that I wouldn't have been able to check on had I been thrown out of the casino for Force Choking all of you, otherwise it woulda been the end of all of you.The food?  It's delicious when you can get it.  The meatballs are literally the best I've had anywhere.  Of course, the Lady Vader has figured out how to perfectly replicate them, so we don't need you for that.  The pasta dishes are delicious, but nothing that can't be easily replaced by venturing about a mile off strip and going to Ferraro's.   The service alone drops this thing all the way down from a solid 4, possibly even a 5, to a 2.  And rest assured, we will NOT be returning to be denied for a 3rd time out of the last 4....which is probably best for the staff's health.  A very sincere "shove an iLightsaber up your ass" and a score of 2 Deathstars.Yelp is right again.  3.5 stars for this place is exactly the meal I got.  I was hoping that most of the low ratings here were based on the "oh my it's soooo expensive, I can get spaghetti & meatballs at my local mom and pop place back home for $7.50."  I hate those reviews.  Yes it's going to be expensive here, you are on the strip and that's why the meatballs are like $16.  They are also the size of softballs.  If I can throw a meatball at you and possibly knock you unconscious ....If we can play dodge ball with it...If I have the urge to put three fingers in it and I'm looking for pins and a lane....If I can chain it to a prisoner's leg and keep him from escaping...If a meatball can do any of those things, then you can charge me $16 for two of them.  Now all of that bragging said, it didn't taste as good as my local mom and pop place back home for $7.50.  Yes I'm that guy.  Tomato sauced based Italian food is comfort food.  Some Italian Grandma has made all these dishes for her whole life and has been taught them by her Grandma and will pass them on to her Grandchildren who will all open restaurants in your cities.  They won't charge you an arm and a leg for them and you will eat them all the time.  They will be really good.  So if I walk into an Italian Restaurant in Caesar's Palace where you need a reservation in advance, I'm going to hold them to a higher standard and I'm expecting to be really wowed.  I wasn't, it was just ok.For starters we had baked stuffed clams.  These smelled great but the clam was pretty tough to get out of the shell (as clams can be).  The stuffing was way way overdone with fresh oregano.  You could taste nothing else, just oregano bread stuffing. Plus with the clam hanging onto it's shell for dear life, when you scooped out the clam shell, all you got was the stuffing.  The clam was left behind.  2 stars for this appetizer.My dish was the best at the table, Ossobucco alla Milanese.  I would give it 4 stars.  It was nice and tender shank of veal cut very thick.  It was served on top of saffron risotto and in a traditional tomato/ vegetable sauce.  There was a small fork placed in the bone marrow for sampling.  I enjoyed the flavor of the bone marrow, but I'm not a fan of the texture of it.  If you eat at Rao's, I would recommend this dish.  My brother got a beautiful looking Veal Parmesan.  This was served bone in and was impressive to look at as it covered the entire large plate.  Unfortunately it's flavor didn't match it's looks.  It was also tough.  Not terrible, but not great either...3 stars.  My wife had Ricotta Purses with Sage and Butter.  Although the pasta was cooked nicely, the ricotta cheese was kind of sweet and somehow the sage butter lacked the savory element to offset it.  Just recently we had a similar ravioli style sage butter sauce dish at Angelini Osteria in Hollywood, CA.  That dish was so magical, but this one was very blah.  Again 3 stars.  One other strange bit of info is that Rao's is decorated for Christmas year round.  I asked about this and was told that at the original Rao's in New York, they never got around to taking the Christmas decorations down one year, so it became a joke that they would just leave them up.  When they opened this Las Vegas location, they kept that tradition.So there you go, as with most restaurants on the strip, Rao's is 3 star food at 5 star prices.Not bad, but not great for the money spent. I read a few reviews here on Yelp before and after I went to Rao's. I had to confirm what I had read to be accurate. Among the situations other Yelper's have listed, such as being told they are fully booked or that they they don't have a particular bottle wine (due to the lower price of the bottle..) I can tell you both of these things happened to myself and my party. We originally tried to make a reservation for 8 pm on a Friday and were told there was absolutely no way that would be possible for 3 people. The reservationist directed us to come in and sit at the bar if we liked and we could wait for a table to open up for dining. This is what we decided to do. We strolled in just before 8 pm to a crowded bar at Rao's. My female companion inquired at the door about a table for 3. We wanted to be thorough in case a cancellation or something of the sort had occurred. The young hostess assured us there was no way we would be seated in the dining room before 930 p.m. We decided to go to the bar for a drink. Sitting at the bar, the room was fairly full. As I turned to look at the dining room, I saw 7 empty tables. All clean, prepped and ready to go. At 830, then 845, still no one sitting in them. Close to 9 pm we are seated to a half empty dining room. ... ... So we sit down and my one buddy has been here before including the one in New York. He did the ordering of food. I ordered wine. Figuring the 3 of us would drink at least 2 bottles of wine throughout dinner.. (we like wine:) I decided on a $80-ish bottle of Montepulciano. The server came by to tell us that the wine was unavailable and suggested a $95 dollar bottle instead. I told him I would check the menu a bit and get back to him. Im not afraid of a $95 bottle of wine, but the review I had read was ringing in my ears.. so I decided on a $70-ish bottle instead... ALSO unavailable. So when I decided to go to the $95 dollar bottle .. they had it practically ready to pour! Haha.. It was almost comical. The sommelier came by and was pouring wine as the first course of beet salad was arriving. I was serving the salad to my friends and was told by the sommelier that I "do that very well"..I said thanks, I am in the service industry also. "Oh we didn't know you were service industry too"... she said.. Hmm. Why does that matter I thought?Overall.. I have to tell you i was so unimpressed with the whole situation, that I just smiled, ate and ordered more wine. I gotta say.. the food was really unimpressive. My main gripe about 'American Style' Italian food is the over abundance of sauce, and lack of flavor.. in a high-end place like Rao's.. I would have expected that to be a non-issue. Not so. Really bland Sausage and Broccoli Rabe, unflavored red sauce on a couple of meatballs, and really just non existent on anything over the top delicious. Aside from the bottle of Ripasso I had in place of dinner, as I stopped dining after a few bites. Just not good. The bartenders at the bar were very nice, smiling and made a great martini. It was a saving bit to the evening as they even smiled and wished us good night as we left. It was around $300 for the 3 of us, and is probably near average per person price, but far less than average dining experience. Sorry. Better luck to you if you try this out. I won't be back for dinner.We wanted to try a new Italian place in Vegas, and since most Caesar's restaurants have impressed us, we went with Rao's.  BIG MISTAKE.  Hundreds of dollars later, the only nice thing I have to say about Rao's is that the service was great and the ambiance is nice (Although Christmas-y.  In August.) but everything else?  Pass.  This is what we had: Caprese Salad-  Weird.  The tomatoes were in huge quarters instead of slices and there was a pesto/garlic/balsamic sauce all over it.  The cheese was delicious but the rest?  Not so much.  Caesar Salad-  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.  Salsa alla Marinara and a Side of Meatballs-  My husband had this dish and didn't dislike it, but didn't think it was anything great either.  I tried the meatballs in some marinara, and I'm not going to lie...there was an acidic, I-just-puked-in-my-mouth aftertaste that I couldn't shake.  Needless to say, I've had better meatballs.  And sauce.  Porcini Mushroom Risotto- I really thought this dish was going to blow my mind.  The menu lists it as:  "Vialone Rice Cooked with Mushroom Stock, Sliced Porcini Mushrooms, Parmesan Cheese, and White Truffle Oil".  What it actually is though is a different story:  Simultaneously mushy and hard rice with bland mushrooms, and an overwhelming truffle oil scent with a underwhelming truffle oil taste.  The busboy knew I didn't like it and offered to tell my server, but what is she going to do about it?  She didn't make it.  I'm just bummed we paid $30 for a dish I took five bites of.Overall, the place has potential, the service is great (I mean, a guy comes out and dishes your plates in front of you!), but it didn't do anything for our wallets or our stomachs.I went to Vegas with a very old friend of mine that I grew up with in NY.   She is less than adventurous when it comes to food so Italian seemed like a safe bet for dinner for the two of us.For some reason, I find it difficult to find baked clams in LA and they were a favorite of mine growing up in NY so my friend and I decided to split an order.  They came out piping hot, the breading was plentiful and perfectly seasoned and the ratio of breading to clam was spot on.  A squirt of lemon and I was in heaven.We didn't want to stuff ourselves before going out for the night and I wanted something simple so I ordered the spaghetti marinara (something I would normally NEVER order out), a side of meatballs to split with my friend and I had a glass of wine to wash it all down.The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was well balanced, sweet and just a little tangy and the meatballs were everything that everyone makes them out to be.  They are just dense enough not to crumble when you cut into it with your fork and tender enough that they still practically melt in your mouth.  Truly divine.  The portions were HUGE.  I had half of my pasta and half of a meatball left over at the end of the meal.  It's a good thing though because for what they charge, I might have been LIVID if I wasn't MORE than stuffed.  Our waiter convinced us to take our food back to our hotel (even though we didnt have a microwave) and I'll admit, after a long drunk night out, it tasted just as good cold as it did when it was hot and at least I felt like I got my moneys worth and didn't have to eat at McDonalds at 3am.  At least not on that night.My out of town buddy wanted Italian somewhere he hadn't been before.  He's a frequent visitor to Vegas so he has been to most of the good ones on the strip (thanks to me! ha!).  Throw in Restaurant Week and a lack of last minute tables available at 9pm on a Saturday and I was back at Rao's for the first time in 6 years.  I wanted to dine in the Christmas room again but there was a wait so we just opted for the lower floor area facing the pool.  We ordered a plate of antipasto (prosciutto di parma, mild sopresata, marinated artichokes, gaeta olives, buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, grana padano, gorgonzola cheese, dressed arugula) to kick things off and that was very good.  Everything was fresh and that was a nice substitute instead of four people getting individual salads.The osso bucco was literally calling my name right off the page but I figured I could come back for that any other time of the year.  I decided to take advantage of the great value of Restaurant Week and use the couple of bucks saved on drinking more wine.  The appetizer was "Mozzarella in Carrozza" which was described as fried fresh mozzarella sandwich served with marinara.  In reality it was 2 HUGE wedges of deep fried breaded mozzarella.  So unhealthy yet so delicious.  Fried cheese has never tasted bad...ever.There were four options for the main course but since everyone else was getting pasta (scampi, spaghetti and meatballs, shells) I decided on the pork chop and MAN OH MAN was that a solid choice.  It was a double cut of pork that was pan seared and sauteed with hot and sweet cherry peppers.  It was juicy, spicy, well seasoned and I ended up gnawing on the bones at the end like a dog.  I took only one bite of the tiramisu since I was so full and my wife ate the rest of it.  There are so, so, so many Italian options around these days (and better values to be had) but I wouldn't mind splurging a little more for this gem a few times a year.A taste of the old country; yep, New York City circa 1890.  The ultimate expression of what many have come to know as Italian or rather I-talian (emphasis on the I and meaning no disrespect) food in the US.  It's origins in Naples, but long since corrupted for American taste and bounty.  The Italian spirit and passion for sharing good food lives on.Rao's is a fun place to mangia!  Example one, ginormous meatballs the size of your fist.  Flavorful, Perfectly cooked, tender, balls bathed in a hearty red sauce.  A great blend of fatty beef, pork, and lean veal the right amount of breadcrumb filler.  Example two, spaghetti alla Bolognese, a pile of noodles hidden under a thick meaty, flavor charged sauce.Classic starters.  Baked clams, rich with butter and crisp breadcrumbs, dried herbs and a kiss of lemon; the fritto misto (calamari, shrimp, cod, and zucchini) a slightly crisp, slightly oily, aggressively seasoned; the sautéed mussels, sweet and tender sautéed in butter then quickly steamed in white wine and garlic.  No complaints.Classic mains.  Outstanding veal chop served smothered with Rao's classic sauce of mildly spicy, sweet cherry peppers.  Subtle flavor of tender veal along side the clean, pepper flavor and zesty tomato sauce.  It heightens the sweetness of the veal.  Win!  Veal not your thing?   The same sauce tops a tender grilled shell steak (Steak Pizzaiola) and a thick, juicy, double cut pork chop.  The Ossobuco, delicious.  Well braised, tender without being stringy.  A good portion of bone marrow a nice touch.  Finally "Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken; charbroiled marinated in a lemon olive oil mixture and finished in the same.  Tart, sweet, bitter, classic.Portions are large.  Very good wine list focusing on Italy.  Typical high Vegas resort pricing.Service is very friendly and efficient.  Exactly what you would expect from an I-talian restaurant from NYC.  Well done.Before my show last night, I had dinner at Rao's, something that had been on my radar for awhile.  I made a reservation for 5 PM so I had lots of time for a leisurely meal before the 7:30 show.I was greeted promptly and taken to a table on the far side of the bar and down a few steps.  It's the last area before you go to their patio.  I had a view of the pool area and one of Caesars iconic Roman statues in a columned structure.My server, Howard, quickly appeared and asked for my drink order.  He brought my iced tea quickly.  Having read about the size of Rao's portion, I was careful to choose wisely.  I went with the baked clams for an appetizer and the ravioli purses for the main course.I was soon brought a nice bread basket.  Howard asked me if I wanted some balsamic with the olive oil and I declined.  I poured some of the oil onto the plate, salted it a bit, and then dipped some of the olive bread that was part of the basket.Within a short time, my baked clams were delivered.  They are littleneck clams that had an oregano bread crumb topping.  I squeezed some lemon on the clams and dug in.  It's been a long time since I got baked clams and they were great!  The lemon mixed with the juices from the clams and I had another dipping "sauce" for my bread.  Very tasty!The main course came. Rao's calls them beggar purse ravioli.  The ravioli were stuffed with a mixture of pear and ricotta cheese and they were in a sauce of brown butter seasoned with sage and topped with dried cranberries.  This caught my eye when I was reading the menu because it was such a different dish.  It was excellent, too!  The pear taste with the cheese was very mild and the butter with the dried cranberries was a true winner!  A good dish that's really different.  Also, I had dipping sauce #3--the brown butter with sage was a wonderful place to dip a few cubes of the good bread.For dessert, I asked Howard for his advice.  He gave me a listing of the entire dessert menu without having to bring one to me.  Of the things on the menu, he recommended one, the peanut butter tart, something his wife makes--she's one of the pastry chefs at Rao's.  The tart had a graham cracker crust, a layer of chocolate ganache, and it was topped with peanut butter mousse.  It was superb!  I'll have the other dessert he recommended on my next visit.The dinner was very very good!  Service was exemplary.  The staff or Howard was always around to refill water, get more iced tea, remove dirty dishes, and simply to do a great job!  I am a big fan of Rao's.Can't say enough about this jewel!!!  How lucky was I to have participated in the grand opening. Was introduced to the owners, chefs, and the main gatekeeper... The man that allows you to make reservations!!!  We became best friends (due to the fact I was an Executive Casino Host at Caesars) and never did I have a problem getting a table.  The food is perfect, the entrees are amazing, their customer service is outstanding.Let me start by saying, I had hoped for great things  at Rao's. I mean the place was packed, we had to wait to get in. The food looked and smelled great. But then after waiting over a half hour, we finally get seated, and then reality hit! Rao's is great if you have no sense of taste and love bland food. They are known for their meatballs so a few of us ordered those. Let me tell you, the meatballs in the frozen section at the supermarket were better. Very bland. The lasagna? Again, not the worst I have ever had but very far from the best. Again, the ladies at the local church make better pasta dishes than Rao's and their lasagna does not cost $30. But the worst of the meal was the peas, onions and prosciutto.  What were they thinking? The  prosciutto was so tasteless! How do you make it so bland? Anyhow if you are thinking of eating at Rao's, don't. If you want to spend big bucks on a meal in Vegas, go over to the Bellagio and try their buffet, the locals love it. Or try FireFly Tapas over on Paradise Rd. I'm a foodie that's been coming to Vegas for 10 years. Don't waste your money here, unless of course, you enjoy spending big money on food with no flavor at all.I like good meatballs. Rao's is famous for that. Their New York location is always busy and they say the best way to try Rao's is by going to this location.We tried the lasagna and the meatballs. We had a show to go to so we let them know ahead of time that we're a bit pressed on time. The service wasn't all that great and they weren't even busy.The lasagna was good but nothing special. The meatballs were huuuuuge and tasty. I won't mind coming back for these balls but I'd probably take them to-go so, I don't have to deal with the service.Generally unamused by Restaurant Week, an excuse for infrequent diners to eat dumbed-down menus from restaurant's they'd not normally visit in the name of a charity that would be better served by direct donations, it was only long-standing New York Import Rao's at Caesars Palace that seemed willing to do something interesting with the $50.15 prix-fixe, a selection of novelties offered in addition to the restaurant's fabled fare finally providing a reason to check the space off a long-term list of places as-yet unseen.Currently toqued by Chef Fatimah Madyun with pastry duties assigned to Laura Augsburger, Rao's Las Vegas was the second amongst three current iterations of the East Harlem classic whose 'impossible' reservations and 'owned' tables garner far more attention than the food, yet with the Southern Italian recipes of Frank Pellegino presented true to form  the menu itself is a well-culled pick em' of  plates to please any palate, the "On-Strip" pricing and stereotyped Eye-talian service an expected footnote probably best ignored.Dining as a group of five, and as such able to sample widely from a tasting served in four family-style courses despite initial suggestions that the Restaurant Week option could not be 'added' to a larger scale meal, it was in a basket of fresh bread in three varieties paired to peppery tomato cream that the meal began and as much as restraint was attempted given all the upcoming carbs, any resistance proved futile as the warm trio was replenished more than once - the bites not topped with creamy spread proving more than amenable to sopping up any sauce gone astray.Dividing the meal into appetizers, pastas, entrees, and dessert, with a bit of overlap to balance out courses two and three, it was after a short delay that round one was delivered along with glasses of wine for those choosing to imbibe, and although the well seasoned clams proved somewhat skimpy in portion given the pricetag there is little argument that Rao's signature meatballs more than justify their legendary status, the balance of meat and breadcrumbs somehow dense and dainty at the same time with a spice profile that melded well to both crushed San Marzanos as well as the special cream sauce rife with blue cheese.Noting that the large space was perhaps 2/3 full throughout much of the stay, and that waiters appeared stretched across sections that saw them working two-tiers of the restaurant at once, there was again a sizable delay paired to empty glasses prior to pastas presented by a pair of back-servers, yet when the three piping hot plates arrived almost all sins were immediately forgiven, the imported dry bucatini prepared perfectly al dente beneath a smooth lacquer of eggs, pork, and cream while the tubes of Rigatoni were equally well textured amidst an aromatic red sauce, the housemade purses a far more mild option that may have benefitted from a bit of salt or grated Pecorino, though the bites taken with dried cranberries were admittedly quite nice.Seeing secondi arrive in a much more expedited manner than the prior course, each dish served with an appropriate warning that plates were 'extremely hot,' it was here that the Restaurant Week special of Duck Cannelloni was presented and although the composition was perhaps a bit reminiscent of the aforementioned ravioli the utilization of confit duck proved a substantial upgrade to the milky ricotta in terms of both taste and texture, the $51 Veal Parmesan a bit overpriced despite good quality and substantial portion while the lemon chicken was moist and surprisingly restrained, the crispy charred skin proving a more than admirable foil to the citrus.Already selecting a single cannoli as part of the prix fixe, and adding on a $32 platter with three more options to share, dessert at Rao's no doubt trends towards the classics and as good as both the dense cheesecake and crisp tube of lightly lemon cream were, neither could outmatch the block of espresso-soaked ladyfingers amidst mascarpone, let alone the peanut butter tart that no-doubt tipped its hat to Reese's while simultaneously meeting the tongue both rich and as light as a cloud.While some purists may suggest that such 'one-off' concepts are disingenuous to the original others may consider such things to be a benefit providing the cooking is on point, particularly since most lack the political (or mob) ties required to visit the original and would likely be better served eating somewhere else in The Big Apple instead.  Setting aside high prices and service that would benefit from a few more hands-on-deck, Rao's is a worthy dinner for those seeking rustic red sauce on the Strip.My first visit to Rao's was about seven years ago and I have never felt the need to rush back and try it again. I remember the food being good but for not amazing for the price point. Last Saturday, I finally got the chance to return and again, I enjoyed my meal quite a bit, but there was nothing that blew me away.  Dining with a group of five, we had the opportunity to share a large selection of different items, including one restaurant week prefix. The highlights from our meal were the meatballs, which were extremely moist and flavorful, duck cannelloni, the lemon chicken, which is another of their signature dishes, ravioli purses, which wasn't a favorite around the table, but I really enjoyed the sweet and savory elements and the veal parmigiana. The desserts were classic and delicious as well. The peanut butter and chocolate torte stole my heart but the tiramisu was also very good. The meal was delicious but nothing that was so extraordinary that I see myself going out of my way to return for.
Haus Murphy's=*** Ich bin betrunken und angefüllt und es ist ehrfürchtig ! ***Man -o -man...Big giant Spaten beers...and deep-kraut-fried-schweiner-schintzel-burp-o-pleasure-cheesy-orgasmonic. Another super short but sweet review.If you dig authentic German grub (which I grew up, thanks Granny!) this is the joint. Plus the great back bar..and do I need to mention the Spatens as big as your head (again)..?F-ing lovely!I'm heading back very soon.*caution: if you have a heart attack after eating here do not be surprised, be expectant... in a good way.Es schmeckt sehr lecker!That's German!I have been to Haus Murphy's to drink a few times in the past and was quite pleased by the beer selection as well as the size. I can get beer in a stein the size of my head? Surely you jest. I have a rather large melon. It is true though. The effer is huge and tasty.I finally got to eat here with my favorite collection of Brite girls. The whole place feels rather authentic though I have never been to  Germany so what do I know? Everything I know about Germany I learned from Polka and online pornography (I think they love the Hoff). Community tables were not uncomfortable as they can be other places. They were quite cozy and enjoyable in fact.The food while unpronounceable was very delicious. In fact I have been told that my opening line means "It's delicious" however as previously stated I know nothing of German so it could very well mean *insert funnt profane thing here*Sauerkraut has become one of my favorite things in the world  and It does not disappoint here. The sausages were delicious and the beer made it all just a happy dining sort of day.Also how can you go wrong with two old men in lederhosen playing the oompah oompah on a tuba and an accordion. These guys are rock stars. You learn to play these instruments solely to get chicks.Srsly...I know you uppity east sider kids like to stear clear of the avenues except to take in some hipster-slumming it culture, but downtown Glendale has so much to offer. Haus Murphy's is amazing and it is nestled amongst little antique shops and whatnot with brick and lace and charm. Give it a shot. Tell them "Du hast meine Katze auf dem Fenster geworfen!"Do you want an escape from your typical Arizona dining experience? Do you crave an outdoor seating area were the beer flows like water and the old men dance around in traditional German clothing holding tubas? You really need to check this place out. I live about 5 minutes from here and it took me a full year and visiting relatives to finally get to downtown Glendale to check it out. We had a 6:30 reservation on the patio (It was a Saturday and I wanted to be safe but for 4, you could have done without the reservation). We sampled several German beers and I loved them all (wish I remembered the names). We started with the giant pretzel and sausage sampler-both were SO good I am still drooling. The Sausages were served over a bed of sauerkraut and the pretzel with spicy mustard. Everyone at the table tried something different and we all sampled everything. I loved the German potato salad served with the entrees and also the cabbage soup. The ambiance of this place was fantastic! The live music is from 6-8 and I really wish it went later. My boyfriend and I agree that eating there really makes you feel as though you are on vacation-far away from Arizona! I would HIGHLY recommend this place-great spot for anyone and especially out of towners looking for something unique!Last Thursday I had the pleasure of joining a bunch of Yelpers at a UYE here.  I had not been here in over 10 years and they have move East on Glendale a bit since then.  At that time they were out of sauerbraten so they served us a stew of sorts that wasn't on the menu and I remember it being quite good and large plates of food.I still desired to try their sauerbraten so that is what I ordered.  It comes with a potato dumpling, gravy, and red cabbage.  I expect a piece of beef marinated for three days to not require a knife to cut and to have some flavor of it's own before dowsing it in gravy, and sauerbraten I have had before met this.  This one to me was quite chewy and the gravy too sweet.  Gravy is one of those things that just because I think it is too sweet doesn't make it bad or improperly made, it just didn't suit my taste.  If I had liked the gravy better it would have improved my image of the dumpling which, without gravy, was sort of tasteless.  The red cabbage was just as I expected and have had before.Now that I have grumbled about my meal.  I got a bite of a big pretzel two of which the restaurant comped us.  I thought it was a bit salty but overall a very pleasant surprise.  I chose to try mine with butter.  The bread pudding was delicious, I chose the small size and it was easily enough for two to share, but I ate it all anyway. :-)  All of this food was washed down with a good tasting Spaten lager.  The service was pretty good, especially for our large group.  And they were willing to split the checks, which even with a party of about 18 did not have the mandatory added gratuity, although I doubt if anybody in our party tipped less than 18% because they was nothing wrong with the service to warrant a poor tip.  The owner didn't introduce himself but he did make a couple of appearances on the patio to see how things were going.I could easily be enticed to come back to the patio and enjoy a beer.  I think I would opt for one of the appetizers like a pretzel or the potato pancakes to soak the beer up with.I attended a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) here and I have to say that Haus Murphy's pretty much wowed all 20 or so of us!It has taken me over a week to get to the review.  I was still reflecting on the German meatloaf, red cabbage and Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen.How do you say, "Damn that was good!" in German?  I have new found respect for German cuisine thanks to Chef Hoffman (not sure about the spelling there).The fubar of Yelpers (I am pretty sure that is the correct term for a large gathering of Yelpers) dined on the patio which is a great space.  Service was very good throughout the meal.There was quite a bit of sharing going on and although I don't remember everything I tried, it was all really good.It was great to see so many friends and meet some new Yelpers like Norm!Stumbled upon this place while driving to the Chocolate Festival. My husband was thrilled as he LOVES German food. We decided to have lunch here after checking out the festival.Being a lovely warm and sunny day we decided to sit outside....which is very cool...nicely decorated, big picnic tables and plenty of sunlight.I ordered the Hackbraten (German Meatloaf) which was very good, the mashed potato and red cabbage were superb! With this I of course had to try a German beer.....I asked the waiter what he would recommend, he asked what type of beer I like and I said usually the darker ones...he recommended the Franziskaner Dunkel - an unfiltered dark wheat beer, dark roasted malt with a smoky roasted grain finish .... a great recommendation as it was just perfect with my meal.My husband who is constantly craving Weisswurst Sausages was finally at peace having found it on the menu. He insisted I try some of his and said it would melt in my mouth....wow!...it actually does melt in your mouth....delicious. Our waiter was awesome as he knew everything on the menu so he was very helpful as well as very friendly and a great photographer! Everything you need in a waiter : )The German music playing in the background was really festive and added to the great atmosphere. We will definitely be back!Ugh, I would really like to like this place. Getting to the location is awful, traffic is painfully slow since there are no left turn signals on the main street. Parking was okay since it was Saturday afternoon, but having to re-park every two hours kinda sucked and the food was bland!! I have been to Germany, and all the dishes I had there were flavorful, and yummy...but this place? bland and embarrassing. I met a group there to play board games and the staff was so nice and great! But the turkey sandwich with horseradish mayo was dry and gross. I ordered it thinking the mayo would throw me off but "hey, it's a German restaurant, let's give it a whirl" I couldn't even taste the special mayo! My homemade sandwiches have more flavor than this one. I ordered the apple strudel hopeful for some redeeming quality to compliment the great service...0-2, again like the Compass Restaurant, the best thing about the dessert was the sliver dollar shot of whip cream. This place was so accommodating and fun to hang out at, with really nice service...but I wish I could have something nice to say about the food.Haus Murphy's is fun place place to go for German meals and it has a lot of fans.  I found them to be a little dated with their decor and their food is usually cooked well done or over cooked.  Their service is A~OK.Food feedback:Apps ~ Sausage Sampler, Bratwurst/Krakauerwurst served over a bed of homemade Sauerkraut is tasty! Potato Cakes,  served with a side of Apple Sauce and sour cream was a bit overcooked very dry. The Giant Bavarian Pretzel Imported 10oz. salted Pretzel is highly over rated and was not cooked evenly. Meals ~ Their beef & pork sausages are all served over their homemade sauerkraut with German potato Salad or fries.Bier Bratwurst - Beef-Pork Sausage is good.German Bratwurst - Pork Sausage is bland.Krakauer Wurst - Polish spicy Beef-Pork Sausage is awesome! Their Schnitzel's are good but again overcooked at times. I preferred their Steak Schnitzel topped with a Gorgonzola cheese and Roasted Onion Sauce.  Served with German Fried Potatoes and Bacon Roasted Green Beans. Beers~Spaten Lager or Weihenstephan Hefeweizen are best, you cant go wrong here.Shame on the owners of Haus Murphy's for participating in the sham of a TV show "Mystery Diners!" When the producers promise free publicity, and you so easily lie to the public - that is not a business I will support. The "manager" under scrutiny on the show was an ACTOR - not a relative, and not a manager. The show, the conversations, the issues......all phony. Entertainment is one thing, but. I do not respect this at all!Reheated, insipid food and perfunctory service in a kitschy atmosphere.We drove 32 miles from our house to Haus Murphy's because we were in the mood for German.  It was the middle of a Sunday afternoon so it wasn't very busy.We ordered a couple of beers and the Bauernplatte combination for 2.  This includes several kinds of sausage, a pork cutlet, a schnitzel, a kind of hamburger in gravy, red cabbage, sauerkraut, spatzle and fried potatoes.  It look great! Sadly, it all appeared to have been pre-cooked and then microwaved.  Let me repeat that -  a precooked and microwave schnitzel!  The spaetzle in particular was a soggy, water-logged travesty.  $35 for this by the way.So with two beers and tip, that was $60.00 for lunch. For microwaved food.It's quite sad that they don't really care about the quality of food here.  This type of Bavarian food is fairly easy to prepare so it's hard to understand why they would have so much contempt for the customers or the lovely cuisine of Germany.Any restaurant that would serve you reheated food like this really doesn't care about you or about the food they are serving.I wish I had noticed the 50 filtered reviews before eating here.A few weeks ago I was watching an episode of Diners, Drive-ins & Dives and they're doing a feature on this restaurant.   Knowing I would be heading to Phoenix soon AND I don't have German food very often, I bookmarked it, then ask my friends if they want to have dinner here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=xeRpdNyGlTwF4SNYZ3588A#XdSMeOjMFXkDYkLe9CmVSgFast forward to Friday afternoon.  I call and ask if they take reservations, they said yes, so I made one.   We arrived about 15 minutes early and the place is packed!   Come reservation time, they didn't have a table ready and asked us to wait in a "waiting area".   It's a small group of tables at the back of the bier garten.  I figured I might as well have a bier, right?  So I ordered a hefeweizen.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofA#fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofAAfter about 15 minutes they had a table ready in the "bier garten".   Yes it was cool outside but they had tons and I mean TONS of heaters!   There were three heaters around our table in very close proximity and another heater near the next table about 2 feet away.  We sat down and while my friends enjoyed the heat, I started baking immediately.SERVICE: All of the staff were very nice!   Our server Jeremy seemed to have very little personality and only smiled once when I made a joke.    However he did do a very good job taking care of us.   I ended up speaking with Rose, the owner.    What a sweet and fun lady!   We chatted about the restaurant and her experience with Guy Fieri and the production staff for the show.   She said they filmed that segment about 6 years ago.Rose also told me they've been in business for 18 years and at this location for the last eight years.  Her restaurant can seat 300, she has a staff of 22 working the front of house and 12 in the small kitchen.As we were dining two gentleman came out and started serenading the bier garten with an accordion and a tuba!   Hmm, does two make an "Oom-pah-pah band"?   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#Xg7Kg3cwQvevC0BJMIuXbAThey starting with "roll out the barrel" of course, and continued with a number of other bier drinking songs and Christmas songs for a good 30 minutes.   For me anyway, it made the whole evening that much more fun!FOOD:  We started with a giant pretzel!   It was warm, soft and very tasty!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#2s8FvkPpB0J_OGZSxDiYHA  (notice my phone for a size reference)   I really wanted to try 5 different entrees, but could only have one, so Paprika Schnitzel it is!    The entrees come with a cup of soup, which was a "lemon martini" on Friday.   It was quite tasty, but I didn't really get lemon or martini.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#lYe5isj_vkLSPwbdJHF8qQ  The schnitzel is pork loin pounded flat, breaded and pan fried golden brown and is topped with an onion and bacon infused paprika sauce.   it also comes with German fried potatoes (with garlic and caraway) and wirsing (shredded cooked cabbage and onion in a creamy cheese sauce) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#L0eXT4gWympRVAeAB-1_PA   The pork was very tender and tasty.  The paprika sauce was WONDERFUL but also very subtle and nearly "disappeared" on the schnitzel.   I LOVED the wirsing!   The potatoes were very good too!   One friend ordered the Hackbraten, which is a beef and pork meatloaf with roasted onion gravy, spatzle and red cabbage.   I was able to taste the meatloaf and it was fantastic!DESSERT: We couldn't leave without dessert, so we ordered and shared the Apple Strudel (Very good), Cherry Strudel (to die for!) and the "sauerkraut cake" (A chocoholics dream!).   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#NGjfFFw99WpS8Gzdt0-U8whttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#DdkM66FWNZZh2yjbHPQGFAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#ovcyB00DsctJwyk3X7TMpAOVERALL: it was an awesome evening with wonderful food and a great German atmosphere!  4.5 stars rounded up!Nice restaurant with good food. I had the Jaeger Schnitzel which came with potatoes and a cabbage and sour cream type side that was my favorite part. The Schnitzel was tender and the sauce on it was very flavorful. The potatoes were ok, nothing fantastic but good. We were a large group so I understand slower service so that isn't my complaint, my reason for not 5 stars is the waiter gave us a hard time about ordering any drinks while we waited for a few more people. The first table designated to us was full and he said he didn't want to take drink orders till everyone was there. He ended up doing it but wasn't to happy about it. That is fine but not great customer service. I have only been to one other German restaurant and I liked their food just slightly better but this was very good and I would return with a smaller party!I had a really good time, but sometimes I think your experience at a restaurant is much better due to the company.  I really enjoyed our gigantic table.  It created a little bit of havoc for the server and it made service a little slow, but I will cut them some slack.  I ordered the pretzel, because I am a carb addict.  I was so happy we had such a big group, because after cutting a piece I could pass it around to share and not feel so guilty.  It was big enough that about 10 people were able to taste it.  I really liked it.  The spicy mustard was indeed spicy. Before our dinners we got split pea soup, it was very tasty, I am usually not a soup person, but I was hungry and I enjoyed it very much.  For my entree I ordered the Wiener Schitzel, I had not had baby cow in a long time, it was well worth it.  I ate only have of it and took home the rest.  It came with potatoes and wirsing.   The potatoes were very good, on the other hand, I personally didn't like the wirsing (a creamy cabbage concoction).  Good thing Amy liked it, lol. We ordered dessert, but they were taking so long that we asked to have our Black Forest cake and Cherry Strudel to go.  When I got home, I was trying to be so good and got only a third of the strudel, then gave my hubby a third and put the rest in the fridge.  Well that freaking strudel was amazing, I went back to the fridge and ate the rest.  The next day I went twice to the gym.2nd meet up for the International Supper Club UYE (#ISCUYE) for 2014 and Haus Murphy was the place picked to try! It was a big group this time; we took 2 tables, holy cow!! Our server was a little frazzled about having to deal with this. We were pretty darn close to the bar and our server told me that he was not taking any drink orders until everyone had arrived and I had already known some were 10 to 15 mins out, so off to the bar I went!  I'm still fairly new to the whole ordering beer, so when I walked up to the bar the bar tender asked what do I like, and I told him I'm still unsure, since I'm new to drinking beer, he said oh you must be 21 haha Love him!! He offered me samples of all the beers they have on tap, which I thought I was pretty sweet and I went with a nice glass of Warsteiner Dunkel, it went perfectly well with everything! Kudos to the bar tender!   When I had already ordered my drink my server came to me and told me well I'm taking drink orders now, and I told him you told me to go to the bar and get my own drink so I did and I have.  Everyone placed their order, even folks who arrived 20 mins late got their order in, everyone except me got their food, even my daughter who was on the same check as me, ten minutes go by and the server noticed I didn't have my meal, oh it must have been forgotten. UGH!!!! I was upset!! But within minutes my food appeared and I took a bite and OMG ITS DELISH!!! and being upset slowly faded away, one could say I ate my feelings LOL (not really)   I ordered the Huhner (Chicken) Schnitzel with German fried potatoes and Wirsing, it did also come with a bowl of split pea soup, which was amazing, reminded me of the times I went to Pea Soup Andersen's in California, so good! The schnitzel with mushroom gravy was soo yummy!! Couldn't believe I ate it all!! It also came with fried taters and this Irish girl luvs them taters & wirsing, it was my 1st experience with that, didn't even know what I was eating when I started, it was creamy melty goodness, learned it was cream cabbage, omg really? That was dang good!But what I came for was the Sauerkraut Cake, yea that's right, sauerkraut cake!!! I have heard nothing but praise for this cake, they said its better than a death by chocolate cake!! I had to find out for myself!! OOOOMMMMYYYYYGGGAAAWWWDDD!!!! It's amazing!!  Sometimes the company makes the evening more pleasurable then the overall experience & the food was simply delicious , service well that could have been better.  I'm already craving some more schnitzel so I see myself coming back soon.Great food, service not so much! Let me first say that we had a large group and one server  was definitely not enough but Patrick gave it a great effort. On the other hand we did call in a reservation so perhaps a bit more preparation on their part would have been helpful so all of us might  have been served and waited upon in a more timely manner. Also, I didn't know it went against protocol to turn around and ask the bar tender whom was not busy to refill a soda. I guess it was since I was told that was my server's job and he would get it, apprarently if he was I woudn't be asking the bar, enough said.It was my first time at Haus Murphy and one of the best things about going with a big group is friends share. I ordered the Kilometer sausages, with fried potatoes and sauerkraut. The sausages were Hungarian, great flavor and so big they hung off the sides of the plate. I've never liked sauerkraut growing up but theirs I liked. My food was excellent and back to the friends and sharing, we exchanged bites, sausage for schnitzel, I tried a few, and every bite was amazing! I was getting quite full but since it's quite some distance from where I lived I figured I better try dessert. Oh bread pudding would have made the evening, but unfortunately for me but probably fortunately for my waistline they had just ran out. I'd go back again, the food is definitely worth coming back for!I haven't been to Germany but I have been to Haus Murphy's. Why does this matter? Haus Murphy's makes me feel like I haven't missed out on the great beer halls of Europe.My first visit to Haus Murphy I was serenaded by a tubist (Duane) and an accordion player (Elmer). Both gents were wearing short lederhosen and alpine hats (complete with a feather!) Perhaps entertained by my slack jawed expression they asked for my name.  And so I heard the song "Good night Irene" as performed by a tuba and an accordion. These guys are here on Friday and Saturday nights, 6:30-8:30pm. They take requests!You should come hAngry. The food is served in enormous sized portions. The Wiener Schnitzel is perfectly delivered. "But Irene. You haven't been to Germany!" Heck no. But I've been to Vienna and have gobbled my way thru many a schnitzel.  Haus Murphy's version is tenderly prepared, lightly fried in such a way you want to forget about the calories involved. I've had the good fortune to enjoy the indoor and outdoor spaces, in small, medium and large groups. The outside space is a wonderful venue to enjoy people watching. The indoor space readily accommodates larger parties. I would recommend coordinating in careful detail if your party is larger than ten. At my last visit for Int'l Supper Club the staffing was a little stretched for a party of our magnitude. We ended up walking to the bar to obtain our drinks, which wasn't really too much of an issue.Haus Murphy's is a really fun place to visit and dine. Also, RSVP for holiday events as they fill up!
Egg & I=The best thing is the Banana Nut Muffin! OMG it is TO DIE FOR! How good is it you ask?  My sister made me bring it back to San Diego for her on a business trip! I had to lug the goodness in the car all the way back to OC and then back down to SD! See the love for the muffin and for the sister! I delivered a muffin from so freaking far! lolYes, it is THAT GOOD! I still think about it that I drool and want to drive to Vegas again just for it! lol The muffin top is flat so more chewy crisp surface area.  We all know that is the best part! Here are the dishes I recommend.  I have had a bunch of different ones but I only order the Piggy Skillet.  It's the best of all the meat worlds! They put Crisp Bacon, Diced Ham, Pork Sausage, Potatoes, Cheese, and Eggs.. how can you go wrong! Mmmmm meaty cheesy goodness! Yes you can easily make this at home but I want the muffins! lolThe Chicken Enchilada Omelette is pretty good too.  The chicken inside is tender and flavorful paired with all the condiments on top.  All the dishes are huge and plentiful.  I can never finish it, but that can also be that I scarf down as many muffins on the table and more! lol Still the food is pretty good and the seasoned potatoes are delicious! ^_^ Yum Yum.If you are ever in Vegas, be sure to come try it out.  I think the design of the place is cute too, very wholesome! I like the mom and pop feel with cute sweet servers that are very attentive.  I have been back many times since and will keep coming back! Muffins!!! O=pI am not a big fan of Rachael Ray, but she doesn't get on my nerves nearly as much as she did when she was all unfiltered perkiness. Now that she has been homogenized and Oprah-sized and puts on make-up like Jack Nicholson as the Joker, I am somewhat sympathetic to her insatiable need to be the people's home cook, the pint-sized Paula Deen. Maybe that's why I was rather turned off by one of her Tasty Travels recommendations, the Egg & I on the corner of a strip mall out on Sahara Drive in Vegas. Even though it doesn't have the A-frame roof, it's really an IHOP with a country kitchen vibe that seems to draw the who's who of the Convoy-and-trailer-park set. Rachael was giving her thumbs up to this place for all the egg dishes they offer. That I won't argue as the menu went on with variations of omelettes and skillet breakfasts that span the globe and stretch the pocketbook. Jamie W. was being very good and ordered the Original Breakfast Burrito (see photo). However, it was quite a log that came out with a flour tortilla stuffed with four eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers onions, potatoes, cheddar and jack cheese. It came on top of a plate of cubed ranch potatoes and some salsa. It honestly tasted like any breakfast burrito, just more of it to justify the entree-level price. I went all self-indulgent and ordered the Blackened Prime Rib Benny, an Eggs Benedict variation which had little cubes of prime rib (whether it was blackened or even prime rib was quite arguable), sauteed spinach, roasted red bell peppers all chopped over what looked like a slice of Texas toast. Two poached eggs lay on top, and I asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side (see photo). Thank goodness since it was the congealed variety that clogs arteries faster than Drano cleans them out. It was on the meh side with nothing hofbrau-ish about the meat at all.The dish came with the same cubed, packaged-looking potatoes Jamie got, and neither of us had any desire to finish them out. When you order coffee here, you actually get a little pot so they can charge $2.25 for it. Jamie had a glass of milk but it was $2 for just six ounces. Hell, I would have lactated myself for that price. Service was efficient, and even though they have a little egg sign you can flip over to get a waitress' attention, there was no need for it since they seemed interested in turning over tables lightning fast. I'm afraid I will need to second-guess Rachael Ray's judgments on what amounts to good eats on her travels, or else I may be doomed to high-calorie intakes of mediocrity. FOOD - 2.5 stars....just thought the dishes were just too generic despite the abundance...it didn't seem human hands touched those ranch potatoes AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...country kitchen quaint if that's your idea of charming SERVICE - 2.5 stars...efficient if rather impersonal, no need to flip that egg sign over on a busy morning TOTAL - 2 stars....right on the border between 2 and 3 stars, but I need to go with my bulbous, post-benny gut on this oneVegas. Two girls. Hungover. We had a long drive ahead but needed time to collect ourselves. In our dysfunctional state of mind, we decided we wanted brunch.Off to Egg & I we went. The place turned out to be a local favorite. It was fairly packed, but we got seated right away. Extensive breakfast menu. Options! And loved how it was printed on newspaper! Chicken Omelet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=5jiBgyVg3dAhbE4X129pOw): I can't remember its name, but I do remember that it was absolutely tasty! Chicken, cheese, avocado with sour cream on top. Moist chicken. Fluffy omelet. Yum! Ranch Potatoes: Came with omelet. Addicting! Even though they were overly seasoned for my taste buds, I couldn't stop eating them.Banana Nut Muffin (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=6JXT3ryRPelUwv5grDI67A): Came with omelet. Gigantic homemade muffin. Chewy top. Soft inside with bits of banana and nuts. So good!Eggs Florentine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=YvTvI5skrvIBBFC4W7TUVg): I didn't try it. But judging by its looks, I would imagine it to be delicious!Coffee: Great quality coffee. It was unlimited refill and I had the whole carafe to myself. They have their own line of coffee. Huge portions!  We both packed half of our food to go. Great service! Friendly and attentive. And best of all, great prices! 2 breakfast entrees, 1 orange juice, 1 coffee, plus tax and tips all for $30! =DI'm always happy to find a local place in LV to have meals.  Sometimes being on the strip is just too congested and I crave some sense of normalcy... and buffets are just too much food and too expensive.Hence I visited the Egg & I.  And it was closed.  Computers Down. :(When I was finally able to return I looked through my newspaper style menu and was torn between the biscuits and gravy or a omelet.I tried the artichoke omelet and sub'd for some mushrooms.  I love the fetta cheese on top and the fresh tomatoes.  One thing that lacked... I couldn't taste the artichoke... and it could probably use more mushrooms.  It was a great idea however probably would taste better with bacon and mushrooms or ham or something to that effect... Something you can actually taste.  The potatoes were really good, home fries... and more of a fries taste since they had a TON of seasoning on it.  I would prefer less seasoning, and have a bottle to the side if you want more.Servers were very nice, there was a line of people waiting to be seated.  It was a good experience, I think I like Blueberry Hill more, but I wouldn't be opposed to returning here again.My first impression was, "Cute sad and happy egg people everywhere!"The decor of this breakfast house really caught my attention as I first walked in. Eggs are featured on everything from their tableware, to their menu, and their walls. It's too adorable. The menu looks like a real newspaper which is also a nice little touch to the theme of this restaurant. Bright yellow everywhere is a great way to brighten up and start your day in Vegas!We went to Egg & I for brunch and I can say it loud and proud, this is the best American breakfast I have ever had. Hearty, filling, innovative, more than just eggs and waffles. Egg & I has taken breakfast foods to a whole different level. I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine (featured on Rachel Ray) which had  spinach, canadian bacon, two poached eggs on a grilled english muffin, with hollandaise sauce. We also ordered an omelette, Both served with ranch potatoes...by far the best breakfast potatoes on this planet. I forgot the name of the omelette, but I know for sure I'd order the eggs benedict florentine and extra banana nut muffins on the side. The complimentary banana nut muffins are made fresh in house, and they are SO GOOD. The service was just as bubbly and friendly as this restaurant is. If you want to start your day right in Vegas, this is definitely one of your options.The lasting impression? "Love my breakfast, let's get it on country style at Egg & I!"Located "off of the strip" in a plaza, The Egg and I is definitely a local's haven. We only discovered it since our hotel (The Artisan) was nearby and we used our Yelp app to find the closet breakfast place that wasn't a buffet (by day 3 of buffet hopping, I needed major portion control).Even though it was Mother's Day and the line was out the door, this tiny restaurant somehow managed to get everyone seated quickly and keep diners moving through the door. The menu was quite extensive for breakfast with everything from stuffed french toast to eggs benedict to the infamous breakfast burrito. I tried the eggs benedict, which came with ranch potatoes and a huge portion of fruit. The orange juice was the best part though, it tasted like it was just squeezed in the kitchen.Highly recommended if you are staying "off the strip," in Downtown Vegas or if you are on your way out of town!A group of 15 girls arrived here on a HOT Saturday morning. Half of us were hungover, half of us were starving and all of us were in a rush. We had bachelorette duties to attend to in oh about 1.5-2 hours. The place was really busy and didn't seem possible to get a large party seated and fed within our time frame. Surprisingly enough, we got seated in about 20 minutes. We got right down to ordering and in about 20 more minutes, our food was in front of us ready to be devoured. We ordered the Chicken Fried Steak, Eggs Benedict Florentine, Ultimate Skillet, French Toast and of course the Banana Nut Muffin. The portions were huge and the food was tasty. The best part of the brunch was the service. It was very friendly and fast. We got out of there with satisfied tummies and within good time. This place is definitely worth the trip off the strip.Solid breakfast joint!We decided to go off the strip for breakfast this past weekend to save some money. I swear we always spend at least $50 on breakfast when we eat in the hotels. Breakfast at Egg & I was under $30 :)They were busy when we arrived and we waited about 15 minutes to be seated. They put us on the patio, luckily it wasn't too hot yet and there was one table left with shade. It was tolerable.Service was decent but not over the top. They have a system where if you need something you flip over a plastic egg on the table and the waitress will come back. Seems like they never check on you unless you flip the egg.Breakfast was good. I had the eggs benedict with bacon instead of canadian bacon. One of the bacon slices was too fatty and not cooked enough, but the other one was good. The hollandaise was tasty, although a little runny. The potatoes on the side had a nice flavor to them.BF had their daily special, which was Cinnamon Roll French Toast. It was really good, had a custard batter. Too sweet for me, but he enjoyed it a lot. That was also served with a little cup of yummy cinnamon apples. I liked those very much.You pay at the register, which is kind of annoying because that area is already super cramped with people waiting and there isn't really anywhere to stand in line to pay without getting in somebody's way. Overall though, a good breakfast place. If you're willing to drive a couple minutes off the strip to save some cash, I recommend this place!Summary: Every time, and I do mean EVERY TIME I'm in Vegas, I HAVE to stop by Egg & I for breakfast. I mean, I was offered free breakfast at Wicked on my last day there and yet I decline because I MUST go here. The wait at time is long especially on the weekend but if you are willing to be seated in the patio, the wait time is cut in half. I couldn't have ask for a better service from all their staff.Food: Waffle, Scramble Eggs, Omelets, Work Potato, etc etc etcYou just can't go wrong with whatever you pick. Well, you might but I haven't. No matter what you order, make sure you try their work potato, it's like country potato but crunchier with more flavor. Overall: Hate their parking lot, at times we have to park at the end of the plaza and walk over but it is so worth it.Our last place we visited before coming home from Vegas. Thank you YELP for letting me find you. This place was the Bomb.com. I loveddd it!!  This place was super packed however we only had to wait 5 minutes before getting seated. Simple menu on paper but tons of options. I ordered the Chicken Skillet, my husband ordered the chocolate chip pancakes.  Both items were reallyyyy good however the chocolate chip pancakes were total overload, the pancakes were drenched in chocoalte chips and i love chocolate but it was a little too much actually not a little just TOO MUCH for my liking even my teeth starting to hurt because of the sweetness.The prices were really reasonable and food was good and the service was awesome especially for how busy it was all.  You must visit this place! yummmmy!In spite of its obvious chain affiliation, the food is better than average.First, there is the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet.  Just so you know, the CFS has a crispy crust, cut into bite sized pieces and placed on top of their mini crispy potato cubes.  Topped with a good tasting, creamy gravy, this dish is really good.  I had to restrain myself from ripping it away from my son.The Hanks Scramble contains fresh spinach, mushroom, tomato, and cheese.  I don't know where they went wrong, but I have had much better tasting vegetable scrambles.  It was a disappointment mainly because it tasted way to bland. Dumping their house salsa on it redeemed it considerably.Then there were the pancakes and bacon. Decent pancakes, but nothing that stands out.  The bacon was salty but not smoky tasting and rather flaccid.  I like crisp.  Good, not great.The Waffle and Bacon combo was similar, neither the waffle nor the bacon were crispy.I really liked the serve yourself carafe of coffee left at our table. Got it hot.  Got it exactly when we needed it.The service was excellent. Maybe part of that was because they did not need to run around filling coffee cups instead of taking care of more important matters like getting food out of the kitchen fast. Smart.This was ok, but we shall continue to search for the ultimate Mom and Pop places in Vegas.My favorite breakfast joint in Vegas!Thank the Yelp gods for throwing this gem into my search for brunch.  Best part is that it's off strip--meaning that the price is reasonable and not completely inflated and ridonkulous.  It's not too far off strip where it's a drag to get to, but you'll definitely have to drive or take a cab.We've only visited during the week, so we haven't really ever had to wait for a table, but I can imagine that weekends can get pretty hectic.Food for DAYS!  Portion sizes are pretty large + with most breakfast entrees, you'll receive a choice of toast or their incredible banana nut muffin.  If you choose against getting the muffin, you're BSC!  Their muffin is the shyyyyza, plus they currently have a Yelp check in offer for a free muffin!  DOUBLE MUFFIN!  I haven't strayed away from my favorite (chicken fried steak with their perfect potatoes), but their menu is quite extensive, and I'm pretty confident you'll be able to find something that you'll love on there.  But seriously, what's in those potatoes?  You've got me addicted, Egg & I!The servers are attentive and friendly, but the tables also have a small egg sign to get their attention.  It's a yellow, sad egg when you need assistance (so cute).  Every time we've gone, we've never had to utilize this, since their waitstaff are so great.Egg & I will always be on our list for breakfast eats when we're vacationing in Vegas!So I had a craving for steak and eggs and my yelp radar picked this place right up. My steak was tasty and my cheesy eggs were extra cheesy. The potatoes were way beyond delicious and my sourdough was on point. You put up the sad egg and you are quick to get help.I'll be back for sure.If you love a good breakfast, this is the place to try. I have to say first of all Brady our server was awesome! Personable and very professional, I haven't had this kind of service like this in a long time.It was Brekkie Time and I decided to check out the Sahara location,this place is smoking busy even on a weekday.First of all if you're the kind of person like me that can't decide on what to eat,you'll be in trouble, huge breakfast menu! The banana nut muffin is must when eating here, it's that good. I ordered the Cordon Bleu Skillet, which has their tasty seasoned potatoes lining the bottom of dish. It was a deceivingly filling and I was very Happy with my dish.I can see why Egg & I is such a super popular place to eat no matter what time of the day. Excellent attentive friendly service with lots of parking makes this place a great choice.This place has to be related to Egg Works because they are literally exactly the same. From the decor to the menu!It's a Sunday morning so we came into it assuming we would be waiting at least 30+ minutes. Although it was packed we probably only waited between 15-20 minutes. For breakfast on a Sunday morning that's really not bad.We got seated on the patio which is what we wanted at the time but honestly we froze to death. If you're eating breakfast before 11AM sit inside or wear like ten sweaters.We both ordered omelettes. I had the mashed potato Omelette and my friend had the bacon and avocado omelette.Huge, huge portions! And very tasty! I had half of my omelette left over to take home!It's a pricier place to eat breakfast you're probably looking at between 11-15 dollars for breakfast and OJ but it is very much worth it!Review - Egg & IIf I were looking for a reason to move to Las Vegas the Egg & I would be the reason.  Funny thing to say when speaking about a location that has something to offer for everyone and a few of the best dining experiences that money can buy. The Egg & I is simply a great place to enjoy breakfast and that's because it is simple.  Everyone who knows me knows that I love breakfast and can almost always be found at my favorite breakfast place in Corona, CA every Saturday morning without fail.The Egg & I is a place that locals visit and has a lot of regulars.  It's located in a small strip mall that is way off the strip.    The interior is what you would expect in a diner that intended for locals.  It's a large open space with lots of tables and country-ish decorations on the wallsThe menu is consists of many different egg dishes, pancakes, waffles and some incredible looking skillets.  On my first visit I tried the Works Omelet, which as you would expect has a list of ingredients including bacon, sausage, ham, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, mushrooms, cheese and sour cream.  It is served with Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes and a choice of toast or a house made banana nut muffin.    The omelet was cooked to perfection.  It was served hot, light and fluffy. The cacophony of ingredients came together to form the perfect symphony of deliciousness.   My preference for breakfast potatoes is hash browns.  I love them!  The Habla Diablo potatoes were a treat and a nice departure from the hash brown rut I'd been in.  The high point of the meal was however was the banana nut muffin(s).   They serve one almost like an appetizer when sit down before you order.  You get a free one with a Yelp check in.   It told our waitress, Chance (awesome Las Vegas name) how much I liked them and she sent me home with a couple of extra.  Bless her!  I'm not a huge fan of bananas.  In fact I hate everything about them but the banana nut muffins here changed my mind.  It's worth a trip to Egg & I just for muffins.To summarize, great food, fun local ambience, extremely friendly staff.  I'd repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat...
Thai Basil=The minute I walked in I felt like I was in Thailand.  No wait, I felt like I was in Japan.  No wait, I felt like I was in Vietnam!  If an independent restaurant could steal anything from American corporate restaurants, it is this identity crisis.  Let's get one thing straight; Thai Basil does not serve Thai food.  They serve Asian-styled American food.  However, I feel that Thai Basil, even despite the name, advertises itself as a fusion restaurant above everything else.  Normally I am hard on non-authentic Thai restaurants, but this one really is just an Asian fusion restaurant, thus I will rate it as such.We ordered the 'Thai" iced tea, the Drunken Noodles ($5.95), Panang w/beef ($5.95), the Thai Basil Chicken ($6.95), and a Philadelphia roll just to try.  We also tried the cream cheese wontons, which were a slightly better version of the ones you would get at Pickup Stix, although they were a little bit over cooked.  They came with a non-homemade, sugary sweet and sour sauce that didn't really impress me.  They also offer Pho here, and its probably the only Pho in all of North Las Vegas!  The "Thai" iced tea was the first clue that this wasn't a Thai restaurant.  It was normal brewed coffee over ice with a lot of sugar in it.  I could feel the slight heat from the freshly brewed coffee as the ice cooled it down.  The second hint was that they had soy sauce, but no real Thai chili peppers or fish sauce.  They brought us a thinly ground chili powder, and some sort of chili "flakes" upon our request for Thai chili powder.  The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  The beef Panang was lightly sweet, perhaps a little too sweet for some hardcore curry lovers.  While it was a thick-soupy consistency, it had a definite Indian flavoring to it.  The beef was very tender, although perhaps a little bit fatty.  The Thai Basil Chicken was more of a Chinese dish, with a very light but sweet marinated sauce on it, along with cabbage.  The chicken was well prepared, and very tender.  There was no spice involved in the dish, as one might suspect from a Thai dish.  Probably the worst item that we had was the Drunken Noodles.  The noodles were a flat noodle that you would see in Americanized Chinese restaurants, and the sauce was pretty flavorless.  The noodles were too dry. The Philadelphia roll wasn't bad at all.  I am not an expert on sushi, but it seemed fresh, and they stuffed a lot of salmon and cream cheese in the roll. If this were a purely Thai restaurant, I would give them 2 stars for the Thai food.  However, since this is more of a fusion restaurant, and the food was for the most part acceptable, I am giving a generous 3 stars. The prices are also extremely cheap, although the portions are a little bit on the smaller side compared to other restaurants.  I would consider coming back for the sushi, but definitely not the Thai food.If I had not tried the drunken noodles dish, this place would've gotten 4 stars from me. I've always got the same thing whenever I come to Thai Basil and loved my signature dish. My better half, on the other hand, gets something different every time (pho, the Thai basil dish, a bento box, chow mein, etc.). He's never completely happy with his meals here, so that's another reason for the three star rating. Out of everything he's ordered, he likes the Thai Basil Chicken dish best! THAI BASIL TOFU ($8.59): Love this dish. This is my regular order. You can't go wrong since it's the namesake of the restaurant, right? I like the veggies in the dish and the texture of the tofu. The spiciness level is perfect and the portion is plentiful. I love how the rice comes in a pyramid shape. 4/5 DRUNKEN NOODLES ($8.99): I ordered this dish on my most recent visit. Very bland and I didn't like the way to tofu was cooked. I won't order this again. 2/5SERVICE: The staff is quiet but attentive. 3/5VIBE: I like the feng shui going on in here. The restaurant is cloaked in shades of greens with bamboo accents. Worth a Return Visit?Yes, but only for their lunch specials where I can get a spring roll with my Thai Basil Tofu dish for $7. 95! Go elsewhere for drunken noodles.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #140
Roy's Restaurant=5/27/10Service alone deserved 5 stars!  Our server didn't even bat an eyelash when I asked for specifics on dish preparations (though, she did go to the back a couple of times to get the info), and the manager even apologized for the noise coming from the bar area due to NBA basketball finals- he even offered to move us to a quieter section if that was our wish!  We started w/ complimentary edamame, then onto the wonderful calamari http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roys-restaurant-chandler?select=nqSeC4BhUb4SVYbZlctbiw#nqSeC4BhUb4SVYbZlctbiw and continued w/ the Sweet Home Waimanalo salad (loved the creamy herb dressing- so tasty, we would've been happy to order a plate each and call it a night!), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roys-restaurant-chandler?select=roCbXZ4rpCLb104MFuoZOw#roCbXZ4rpCLb104MFuoZOw and finally to Roy's Trio (hibachi salmon, blackened ahi, and misoyaki butterfish).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roys-restaurant-chandler?select=Y2CqA0n2v7LOl7eE2Vz8vA#Y2CqA0n2v7LOl7eE2Vz8vA  For another $4, we enjoyed a serving of macadamia nut-crusted mahi mahi, too.  These beautiful servings of fish offered about three to four bites each of pure bliss!  They came w/ their own sauces: salmon/Japanese citrus ponzu; butterfish/forbidden black rice and sweet ginger wasabi; ahi/spicy soy mustard butter; mahi mahi/lobster butter.  These bites took us through varying complex, lovely, fun aromas and flavors AND textures (from melt-in-your-mouth salmon to steak-like mahi mahi!).  We enjoyed our meal so much, it didn't feel right to order dessert.  Does that make any sense to you?  I hope so, bec. I'm at a loss to explain further!If you haven't tried Roy's, do yourself a favor and make a reservation to visit during Restaurant Week coming up in September!First off, I will NEVER patron Roy's in Chandler ever again!! Please read on to see why...A friend and I went for Aloha hour and it was awesome. Everything on the HH menu is only $5!   We enjoyed everything from the food, drinks, & service, that we decided to come back and try their dinner menu.9/4/2010My friends tried the Hibachi Style Grilled Salmon, they both were quite pleased. Perfect portion size, above average quality but yet still a bit pricey. Nonetheless, the dish was quite satisfying. For my meal I had the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish.  It came with black "forbidden" rice and bok choy.  Each flaky bite was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Excellent choice!This is where it gets ugly...As our average service was about to conclude, the waiter drops our check off. I ask him for another cup of coffee and as he pulls his hand back from delivering the check, he knocks a quarter glass of wine all over my friend and her phone. He proceeds to apologize and cleans a portion of it up, then walks away. He never returns for the coffee I asked for, nor did he offer to refill my friend's $8 glass of wine. I gave him time to reconcile as I saw him pace back and forth but to no avail. I had to chase him down for my refill on coffee. Despite my friend getting wine spilled over her without compensation, our party decided to reflect our displeasure through our tip (~8%) opposed to an open, verbal complaint. However, our waiter wasn't pleased with his gratuity. He came back to the table after he discovered his low tip. YES! He actually had the nerve to return to our table as if he didn't understand why he received a low tip! He spilled wine, which we had paid for, on the customer without compensating for it! What did he expect?? He came back to the table asking if we were displeased with his service. Astonished by his ignorance, we explained to him what we were displeased with. Get this... He didn't think spilling the wine over my friend wasn't a big deal because he thought it was a small amount and that she was finished anyway. Imagine a waiter spilling a paid for glass of wine over you and justifying it because you were almost done anyway. Absolutely ridiculous! Plus, what did he expect from us at that point. Did he expect that we would change our minds and tip him more? The waiter apologized once more and we just got up and left.Our server, THOMAS  the absolute most ungrateful, inappropriate & rude bastard of a server I've ever encountered!! The manager was of no assistance either. Just a note, in the Service Industry, there is no verbal apology that is acceptable. In the Service Industry, the only apology comes in the form of compensation. The manager apologized but asked if we would like to have gift certificates. That's like saying "May I say 'Sorry' to you?" He should've given, not asked to give. Putting the onus on the customer is an insult. We declined since acceptance would paint us as opportunists.Bottom line you expect above the standard level of service when you're shelling out $25-40 per entree.  So even though the food was great, the horrible experience with how we were treated is cause enough to never return to this location.  It's like being slapped in the face but saying it's okay because the food was wonderful...NO THANK YOU!!03/31/11Had planned to partake in Fleming's happy hour (had a giftcard), but came here instead when I saw how busy it was at the bar (and I didn't want to sit outside in the heat).  I knew Roy's had a quasi-HH (free edamame-- what kind of HH is that?), so I had resigned to have Roy's tasty Waimanolo (sp?) salad.  Surprise, surprise!  Roy's now offers four food items (ahi tuna, calamari, Wagyu sliders, and beef skewers!), as well as a few wines by the glass and ALL of its signature cocktails during happy hour for $5 each!  I've tried the skewers before and wasn't too impressed, but I knew the calamari was very good, so I didn't go for that (even though I really wanted to have some).  No, what I had my eye on were the Wagyu beef sliders, w/ caramelized onions and, wait... what else did I read?  Sweet potato fries??  Oh, yeah!  My name was all over this dish!  I also placed an order for chardonnay, but I changed my mind when I saw that I could try another of Roy's signature drinks-- the last ones I'd tried many, many months ago were my espresso martini and a friend's lemon martini I'd sampled.  I was doubly-excited when I spotted Roy's Hawaiian take on the classic sidecar!  This happy hour was going to be FUN!The Fred and Ginger cocktail did NOT disappoint!  It contained Hennessy VS cognac and Domaine du Canton ginger liqueur w/ a candied ginger peel garnish served in a martini glass.  It was beautiful to behold and so very delicious to sip!  'Twas a shame I couldn't finish the whole drink-- had to save some room for the sliders and fries (and the dessert I hadn't even planned on having later on!).  I really liked the sliders-- there were two of them, one on either side of the mini-Chinese takeout box filled w/ seasoned crispy sweet potato fries.  The sliders tasted like Whoppers (back in its heyday in the early 80's) kicked up several notches (LOVED the crispy/chewy pretzel buns!), and the fries were seasoned w/ herbs and even had a bit of cheese drizzle here and there!  I would definitely order the cocktail and app again, and for $5 each, they're a steal!  (I almost did not want to yelp about Roy's happy hour, bec. I wanted to keep this a secret for a little while.)Thinking back, the cocktail and app would've been enough to satisfy me for the rest of the day, but I didn't really want to leave Roy's just yet ( had planned to write a review or two), so I broke down and decided to try the Chocolate souffle ($9.95), Roy's take on the chocolate lava cake, but w/ homemade vanilla bean ice cream and a raspberry coulis.  This item is baked to order, so if you are on a time limit, you should place your order in early, as it takes about 20 minutes to bake.  Was it worth the wait?  Hmm...  I liked the outer edges of the chocolate cake, which had the chewiness of a soft, fresh-baked brownie.  The lava center was definitely gooey and rich, and it tasted like hot brownie batter.  I think I'd have enjoyed the cake and its lava center a lot more if the accompanying vanilla ice cream was of a better quality.  I didn't care for its texture (not creamy enough), nor its flavor (vanilla bean specks were absent and the vanilla essence wasn't strong enough).  This dish cost as much as the app and cocktail combined, and I didn't think it was worth the price.Can't wait to go back here for HH w/ friends!This has forever and a day been my favorite Restaurant, my daughters as well.So when I asked her where she wanted to go for her Birthday , this is where she choose. Now we had not been to this location ever. Just some of the others around the Country and Hawaii.Plus it had been well over a year since we had even visited Roy's, but they were the shiny star of my memories. Every thing you could ever want in a Seafood Restaurant.When I made the reservation they asked if it was a special occasion, I told them it was Rachel's B day. When we arrived they told her Happy Birthday and gave us special menus on the inside it said Happy Birthday Rachel and the date. Wow, I thought that was pretty amazing.Our server was an amazing girl that thought of every thing. The manager even came over to wish my daughter a Happy Birthday.All the drinks were usurper! The food was truly amazing!! We had the Canoe for two for starters, even though there were 3 of us, there was more than enough. Plus, Mario got a salad which he said was delish!We had the Butterfish , the Mahi Mahi , and the Old School combo,which was 4 fish dishes on one large dish.Mario had that one. Every thing was perfect, I mean everything. For dessert we had the Chocolate Souffle and they even treated the Birthday girl to a wonderful Creme Burle, with fresh fruit and chocolate cake. They even put Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce on her dessert plate.Yes it is expensive but, at least you are getting what you pay for . Great service and Great food.First and foremost service in this restaurant is amazing.  I opted to sit at the bar and the bartender, Matt, was excellent.  He provided a really good run down of the menu and zeroed in on great recommendations given my appetite.  I chose the weekday prix fixe ... Which was a ton of food for a really good price.  For the price of any entree you get a three course meal.  The shrimp dumpling appetizer was okay, not great but tasty.  The alternative "surf n turf" with prawns and pork loin was bleeping deliciousness in my mouth.  The plate was beautiful and everything (absent the cold tomato side) had a purpose on the plate.  I would come back again and again just for that dish.  I was so full I had to grab the dessert to go... It made a spectacular breakfast ;)
Triple 7 Restaurant & Microbrewery=I just got a hankering for a Vegas trip again, which reminded me that I never reviewed Triple 7. How can that be? Oh yeah, it's probably because I had a few too many of those amazing microbrews and had a slight lapse in memory. I had some Vegas pals always telling me that this was THE place to go for cheap dinner and amazing beer, and I always would reply, "Don't bother me. I'm playing blackjack." Well, one day the blackjack dollars ran out a bit too quickly, so off to Triple 7 we went. And we were pretty famished (and sober) when we arrived, so we went to town on that menu...Meatball sliders, garlic fries, nachos grande, Prime Rib ($10!!), and, of course the microbrew sampler - you get five 5oz pours for $5. Can't beat that!When the food starting arriving all six of us got a look of dread in our eyes, thinking, "Dear lord, what have we done?" If Vegas is about excess, than we sure as hell were doing something right, because this was a MASSIVE amount of food...and mostly pretty damn cheap and amazingly tasty too. The beer? Ah, the beer. It's so good when it hits your lips. It really is. The Porter was my fave, but the night we went there was also a brewmaster's special that had upwards of 9% abv...I think that was the one that really did me in. We left that place full, tipsy, and more than satisfied. Can't wait to do it again.Had a working lunch meeting here last week.  I had my favorite dish, the Chicken Philly Sandwich w/Salsa Ranch on the side and Fries.  It was as good as the last time I was here.  We arrived when they opened at 11 am to beat the lunch rush and to have some quiet time to meet.  Everything worked out perfect and ran into a few old friends while I was there.Will I return?  You bet.The Triple 7 Restaurant & Microbrewery was conveniently located inside my hotel, the Main Street Station Hotel. I came three times in five days. To the restaurant. Not in my hotel room. Please get your mind out of the gutter.My 11 day work trip to Las Vegas lead me from The Strip to Old Las Vegas. It's definitely not a place to be "seen in the scene." But "Old Vegas" has to be experienced. It's full of charm, character, and characters. Seriously, the sun goes down and the weirdos come out to play. It's freaking awesome.Anyway, this place provides good service, good food, and good service at great prices. What's not to like about that?The menu has a variety of dishes and house brews. There is something on the menu for everyone. And it's all super cheap. My meals consisted of the fish and chips, fish tacos, and a bacon cheeseburger. It was good, good, and super good.Speaking of good, the service was as well. The servers were helpful, patient, and never screwed up an order, even if we had a party of 8 or more. Nice.Anyway, if you are off The Strip and exploring Old Vegas, this is an inexpensive dinner option. And the variety of beer will keep the drinks flowing and the party going.Viva Las Vegas.I feel like i always end up here, although i've only been here twice. It's inside the Main Street Casino in downtown. Its nice cuz they have a pretty large menu, lots of sports TV, beer and not too crowded. Their cheesy Garlic bread is super yummy.I had their chicken and avocado sandwich with sweet potato fries. They give you huge portions!This place is awesome. A locals favorite for years. I get a half pound hot dog with chili, onions, and cheese that comes with fries and it hits the spot every time. Pizza here is really good too. The place gets packed even tho they have plenty of seating but don't let the large crowd keep you from stopping in because they seat people quickly. If you are a beer drinker then you will love this place. Cheap, yummy food and good times.Triple 7 Microbrewery serves its purpose in DTLV.I stopped in while in the area for a power lunch with a coworker that lives in the area before my return to OC last week and although the old school kitchy Vegas look was welcoming, the food was rather underwhelming. The menu is expansive and I think that the kitchen is running by the "Jack of all trades, master of none" mantra. I decided the San Fransisco Burger was the safest bet after some considerable consideration. A Beef Patty is Charbroiled and then mated with Swiss, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Lettuce, a house sauce and toasted Sourdough. They nailed the temperature and all of the ingredients were of good if not great quality. With that said, it was a little boring if not an all out yawn. A mediocre burger in a fun environment nets a 3 star review all day, everyday.Review #777    Yelp Review 777 only appears once in a Yelper's life. I couldn't think of a luckier  place to write about for the landmark Yelp review 777 than 777 Microbrewery and Restaurant in the downtown Las Vegas.   Where Yelp review #777 appears once in my lifetime, the Triple 7 Microbrewery appears often. The surface parking lot at Main Street Station is my parking place of choice when I visit the Fremont Street Experience. The deal is that you have to buy $5 worth of food or drinks to validate the $5 to use the parking lot. Usually I make a beeline to the Triple 7 for a lucky cold one or two before a night on Fremont Street. The problem is that the beer is so inexpensive causing me to buy two to cover the validation. For example, currently draft beer is $2 during football. That was the case yesterday when I drank a large draft strawberry beer that came out to  $2.16 after tax.    Triple 7 is an upbeat spot to enjoy a couple of Lucky cold ones. The atmosphere is rock & roll music, professional sports, bar talk, and the 1800s railroad station motif that permeates Main Street Station. Yesterday I'd take in U2's "With or Without You" between glances of a soccer and baseball game. Triple 7 is a cavernous bar and restaurant with high ceilings bordered by two large bars and a microbrewery. The large space in between is filled with tables. From past experience, the bar on the right is the quiet bar that is frequently closed where the bar on the left is the party bar. Regardless of where you sit, a lucky strawberry or any microbrewery beer tastes good.   Yesterday, I took my Triple 7 experience to the next level by returning for dinner. Besides being a microbrewery, it is the unofficial cafe of Main Street Station unless you count the cafe in its sister property The California. After spending time in the Fremont Street Experience, I returned for dinner. Let me say that I was impressed. I ordered the meatloaf which included a vegetable of choice and mixed vegetables for $8.99. My choice of vegetable of the day was a baked potato. I added soup of the day for an additional  $1.99. Complimenting the food, I passed over a beer for Pepsi. The chicken gumbo soup with saltine crackers was of the same high quality as their beer. But the meatloaf was the bomb. The quality and quantity satisfied my expectations. The tasty mushroom gravy with genuine mushrooms brought the meatloaf to a level that exceeded my expectations for a microbrewery restaurant. The baked potato that included butter and Land O Lakes sour cream was  mutant. I don't recall eating a baked potato this large. Ultimately the soda glass was huge. All this came out to around $15.25.    Throughout dinner, the waitress was attentive and friendly. Additionally she did not make the error of serving the soup too close to the entree or rush me.  When I drink a cold one in Triple 7, it is "Cheers " to good luck. In conclusion Review 777 is an Internet toast "to good luck and good times."
Popeyes=This is one of the better Popeyes restaurants in this part of town. It is a full service location and not part of a stinky gas station or quickie store. The inside is decorated with jars of chili peppers and other fun ingredients and there is a bigger seating area than some of the others stores. Usually stop in here when I'm in the area picking up some industrial parts for the shop. It is close to several vendors and a quick and easy meal when my stomach is growling for some Cajun yummies.Normally order something off the Spicy side of the menu and get several Jalapenos to wash things down. The dark meat is a treat and I like to get a bunch of thighs and avoid the less juicy white meat. Must say that the Red Beans and Rice are also a favorite and like to save them for dessert.Service is always super friendly and you will see some of the same people working here over the years. The orders come out pretty quick and the food is consistently very tasty.Watch out for the bus load of school kids that walk over during their lunch break. The place can get really busy and the wait times can take longer than usual. Whatever happened to the lame brown bag lunches that we were forced to eat back in the days? See ya there next time and remember Tuesday they have their 2pc chicken special for super cheap. AYEE!3.75 STARS
Thanh Huong Cafe=I hate to give my peeps 2 stars, but this cafe just didn't deliver.Enter your typical strip mall, into a very small store with a few tables along the walls and a counter.  Loud Vietnamese patrons sat around "playing cards" (it's a euphemism), smoking and  talking loudly.  You know you're in a relatively growing, but new Vietnamese neighborhood when there are a lot of "card houses" in the area.  The kind of place you walk into and they're a little surprised you want to order food.  I don't think they speak much English and looked at me and my Caucasian husband as if we might be lost.  FYI, we tried the Banh Mi Cafe up the road, but they don't serve banh mi anymore and this was an even more awkward entrance than where we ended up - strange goings ons that I don't want to know about.We ordered the white ham sandwich and an iced coffee to go.  The coffee was good (as it is at most, ahem, card houses), but skimpy.  It filled only half my cup.As for the sandwiches, they use traditional Vietnamese bread, not the long french Vietnamese baguettes, which is fine, except mine was pretty stale and chewy, as only a stale Vietnamese baguette can be.  The meat, veggies, peppers, cilantro etc. were all pretty good.  If only they baked their bread fresh, in house.  Your best bet is Le's Sandwiches.  It's a little out of the way for me, but worth the drive.
Vintner Grill=Best high-end restaurant on the westside? It might be a toss up between Marche Bacchus and Vintner Grill. Thanks to some much needed vacation time between Christmas and New Years I had the pleasure of dining here for lunch on a weekday.The place is hidden in an office park and doesn't look like much from the outside. But, as soon as you step in you'll feel like you've been transported to the some posh, elegant, urban metropolis. With its white couches and ceiling there's a airiness about the place despite little natural lighting. Black and green accents throughout the comfy interior add a modern touch. Of course you'll be reminded that you're still in Vegas when you see the video poker machines along the bar.Lunch was excellent. There's a good selection of wines by the glass and the strawberry caipirinha shouldn't be missed. I'm a sucker for carbs and the bread basket they brought out didn't stand a chance. Among the selection was a brioche, pretzel bread, cranberry bread, and one with jalapeños. They were accompanied by an olive tapenade.Following the bread basket was a cheese and meat platter ($25) with prosciutto, salami, a house-made camembert, goat gouda, Saint Andre triple creme cow's milk cheese. The triple creme was the standout among the cheeses. The salami had an almost jerky-like texture which I didn't care for. Their selection is an interesting mix of familiar and not so familiar items, some of which are house-made and seasonal. Your best bet is to tell the waiter your preferences and let him choose for you.Their appetizers, flatbreads and some entrees are available as half orders, which is convenient if you want to try many things. We tried a half order of the pan seared crab cake ($8) with tarragon cream, roasted peppers and mache. The plating with the single crab cake sitting atop the cream sauce was beautiful and the flavors were equally as good. If you don't expect a Maryland style crab cake with jumbo lump meat (which this is not) you may be impressed.My wife had a half order of the spicy chicken sausage flatbread ($7) with romesco sauce, leek confit, marjoram and truffled ricotta. A half order came as 4 slices. The crust was more chewy than crispy, but still tasty and generously topped with quality ingredients.My dish was amazing -- the braised lamb bolognese ($11) with black pepper tagliatelli, truffled ricotta and fresh grated nutmeg. It wasn't the most visually appealing dish to look at, but it didn't last long enough for me to take a second look. Wonderful flavors with tender and savory chunks of lamb and fresh pasta. The dish is reason enough for a return visit.Service was solid but a little stiff -- probably because they're used to serving dudes in suits most lunch shifts. No matter, I'd be glad to come back for dinner or have some small bites out on their patio when the weather warms up.4.5 StarsSo here are the facts, keep in mind my reservation was set a week in advance for my 1 year anniversary, it took 30 minutes to merely get sat, 30 more minutes to get my first cocktail and starter, and then another 45 minutes after that to get my entree. All the while the large groups of 5 or more are getting sat instantly, served in minutes and catered to. We were ignored and put on the back burner because there were only 2 of us and are a younger couple.   I'm tired of going to a restaurant held in high regard and when we get treated like crap we get to hear excuses like, "well, your table is saved the group before you is just hanging out though and we are double booked tonight". (Snobby hostess that needs a reprimand for her terrible people skills and attitude.) Or, "I'm sorry that everything is taking so long, we are just backed up and I'm not too sure why" (Waiter trying hard to cover up for managers neglecting their patrons.) This is an acclaimed restaurant but can't keep on top of their shit on a Saturday in December? Is that a joke?  My experience was completely unacceptable and I will never ever suggest anyone to go here simply based on principle.   Thanks for ruining my anniversary.First heard of Vintner Grill during my real estate group's cocktail party launch of Diamond Cake magazine. Finally made it around to having dinner here last Saturday. It is tucked away in an office complex off Charleston. The entry is unassuming and easy to miss.The decor is upscale chic modern. We were seated right away as we made reservations from Open Table off Yelp.The clientele that night seemed to be predominantly retiree age with a few scattered specks of youth. Our observation was that most of the women in there looked miserable. (You can marry for money but it doesn't buy happiness). You must come dressed up here or feel dramatically out of place amidst the money crowd. Luckily we came prepared.It took a while for someone to finally come over to bring us a menu and take drink orders. The cocktail menu consisted of old timer favorites with modern ingredients. For such a fancy place, they could have utilized a classier menu holder, rather than a plain clipboard.The selections seemed standard when comparing to previous posts of the menu with some slight changes. One of our favorite things was the butter dish with wells of infused olive oil...a welcomed forbidden treat after a week of "clean eating". The bread selection was very nice as well...get the brioche and try the cranberry bacon loaf. We each ordered the butter lettuce salad with warm Brie. The salad was a little difficult to eat because of large leaves but the encrusted Brie was good.I ordered the Mediterranean sea bass with haricot vert (French baby green beans), potatoes and chopped olives. The fish was fresh and light just like a sea bass should be, the veges were a nice accompaniment and retained their crispness. My wife ordered the veal scallopini with angel hair pasta. I tried some and it was delicious. Lean, thin veal cutlets in a wonderful marsala sauce. I would order that the next time. The wine was a Malbec that was smooth and light. They bring the bottle to the table to pour. The waiter seemed a bit too touchy feely for our comfort but not too creepy lol. Service was slow at some points. The prices are Strip prices without the Strip feel. As a local, I would rather spend my money on a restaurant on the Strip next time for the same quality of food with a little better service and much better ambiance.Shame on me for not eating here sooner! Vintner Grill is in a business complex and can be easy to miss, but you will not want to. I was surprised upon entering VG, it had  a modern beach feel to it. The patio chairs were very roomy, comfortable and had pillows. If eating inside isn't your thing they have cabanas outside, but only a couple so if you want to make sure and get one it would be best to make a reservation. If cheese & wine are your thing then VG is the place for you! They have a selection of over 400 wines from different countries. They also offer 30 different beers from around the world. When it comes to the cheese, the menu says VG has one of the largest selections of cheese in Las Vegas! They also have a nice selection of house cured meats. If you are interested in buying their cheese online instead of at the restaurant you can go to the following website http://vgcheese.3dcartstores.com/ to place your order.Out server checked on us often and was very nice. A man came around with a bread tray and offered us a complimentary variety of breads and left some butter and oil on the table. The bread was delicious, but it would be easy to fill up on this stuff so I just had a few bites. After looking over the menu it was hard to decide since so many things sounded tasty. I chose the "Classic Cobb W/Grilled Beef Tenderloin Salad" that had a bacon-blue cheese vinaigrette. This salad priced at $14 and had green onion, hard boiled eggs, hearty blue cheese crumbles, fresh greens and of course the beef tenderloin. The vinaigrette was so good! The beef was cooked perfect, tender and flavorful.  I couldn't stop eating this salad it was just so good. All of the flavors meshed well together and I will happily order it again! I was having lunch with a friend who ordered the "Grilled Lemon-Marjoram Chicken Salad" also priced at $14 and she enjoyed it. Vintner Grill is the perfect place to have lunch with a friend, date night with that special someone, or celebrate an occasion with family and friends. VG has a private party space and also offers catering.I'm not sure why it took me years to try Vintner Grill but I'm glad I finally did. I've been back a couple times since for dinners, and drinks and appetizers, and each time was a unique and a great experience. During warmer days and evenings, I highly suggest sitting outside because they have a beautiful patio. Some of the sitting areas are close to the fire pit, while others are more secluded and would provide some privacy if that's what you are looking for. The inside of the restaurant is also really elegant and nice. It reminds me of an upscale restaurant in Miami because of the predominately white furnishings. Food here is fresh and made with care. The standouts I can recall are: -The bread and butter for the table is amazing. -Cheese and cured meat platter - You choose from a list of meats and cheeses, including their in-house homemade cheeses (if available), and they serve it with dried fruits and jams. -Lamb ribs appetizer is delicious quite a large portion for an appetizer.-Octopus - Perfectly grilled and seasoned as a salad. -Pork Belly - who doesn't like thick cut bacon?-Beets with Lavender Goat Cheese - Love floral in food! I would certainly come back anytime for a glass of wine and appetizers with good friends.I thought for some time before assigning a five-star rating to this one. And after my extensive contemplation, I am confident in saying that this was a five-star experience. If the criteria for five stars is "as good as it gets" then I'd say without reservation that Vintner Grill is as good as Vegas gets. Here's the breakdownAMBIANCE: 5FOOD TASTE/QUALITY: 5FOOD CREATIVITY: 4SERVICE: 4.5Overall, what I like about Vintner Grill was that it delivered on providing an experience. And there are are not many places in this town (off-strip) that even attempt to do that. The overall aesthetic is a modern take on a light Art Deco/1930s decor. Everything from the black and white checkered floor to the white and pastel green color scheme worked to set a mood from the moment you walk in. If you're reading other reviews, you already know the restaurant is located inside a business center--and it's that very juxtaposition between the bland stucco sameness of the business center and soft, light and glossy interior of the restaurant that left me feeling transported. The contrast of the business center location totally works in Vintner Grill's favor by creating an immediate expectation of luxury and quality. And Vintner delivers on both fronts.Our party ordered and shared:Two of their signature cocktailsCheese and meat platterLamb bologneseNY stripHalibut on couscous and orzoWhite bean hummusTiramisuCarmel upside down cakeTurkish coffee cheesecakeWe were thoroughly pleased with all but one dish-and even that dish (cheesecake)  was fine. The dishes were not overly creative and clever, but they were all seasoned well,  made with high quality ingredients, and prepared with skill.  The food was delicious. The seafood was fresh and buttery while the steaks were tender and cooked perfectly. This was one of the two best NY strip steaks I've had in this town. The bolognese was heavy and the truffle oil threatened to over power the flavor of the sauce, but the richness of the lamb and sauce made for a dish that most people at our table called the best of the night.The service was considered, the food was delicious, and the decor / atmosphere was luxurious.  I will definitely return to Vintner Grill.One of my favorite places in town!The setting is very sexy in the best of ways. If it's your first date take her here because she'll appreciate your style, and if you're looking for a special spot with someone you've known for a long time, she'll love it & it should guarantee a fun evening. It's all white with black & silver touches and yes it's trendy but bottom line the food is great & the service is usually perfect. It's the perfect balance between feminine & masculine touches. I've been here many times & the only complaint I have is that sometimes the service can lack (when there's large parties). This has happened to us several times. What's great about the service here is that usually the waiter knows things are backed up & that's when a complimentary starter or dessert will pop up. It's always appreciated. Let's get to the food. I've tried nearly everything & I love it, especially my mans NY strip that comes with crispy potatoes (crispy perfection) and balsamic reduction drizzled over everything. Hands down one of the best items on the menu. The portion is massive so ladies just have a few bites from your partner. I typically order the scallops which always change a little depending on what is in season (it's always delicious). And we never skip starting with the cheese. They have a wide selection and it always comes with a side of jam (this one happened to be apple cinnamon) amazing! Don't skip the cheese...There's also a beautiful outdoor space that you should take advantage of when the evening weather is nice. It feels like you're in another world and its the perfect sunset dining moment. If you haven't been here yet it's an absolute must. Make a reservation because evenings are always busy here.This is a great place for people watching, especially if you want to grab a few cocktails and play spot the cougar on a prowl. The ambiance and decor are very old school Vegas and the vibe is very Mad Men-esque. The design is simple with a gorgeous patio for outdoor dining and interior that boasts secluded booths with TVs playing old black and white motion pictures.We arrived on a Thursday night assuming it would be pretty mellow. WRONG. It was some company's appreciation party so the place was pretty packed. We were able to snag a table without having reservations. I would strongly recommend reservations just to be on the safe side. We were seated and shortly after the server came by and took our drink order. We started off with a bottle of Fiji and I had their G&T and my husband one of their martinis. The cocktail prices range from $10-$15, but are masterfully prepared.We started off with a 3 cheese plate and went solely based on our server's recommendations. We opted for a soft cheese, blue cheese, and a firm cheese selection. All of them were phenomenal. There is also a 5 cheese selection option for $25 if you'd like to sample more. The 3 cheese selection was plenty for the two of us to share. The platter is accompanied by warm brioche along with raisins and marmalade. I chose their roasted pepper with crab soup as my starter dish. The flavor was extremely unique, but once my taste buds adjusted I thought it was wonderful. It was creamy, rich, and had a generous portion of crab.I opted for the lamb bolognese as my entree, husband went with the Mediterranean Sea Bass with heirloom potatoes. I appreciated the bolognese, but found the flavor to be a little too rich for my personal taste. The lamb and ricotta combination just made it overpowering and quickly filled me up. The sea bass was perfectly cooked. It was flaky and flavorful. The service was to the point, offering some great suggestions. Initially i thought the server appeared aloof, but I think he was just swamped. He was happy to help with our cheese selections, and our water was constantly refilled. Their pacing and scheduling was on point.I'd like to come back here for lunch and try the cobb salad that my husband keeps raving about.  Overall, I think this is a great date spot that's sure to impress.Dine among sexy and the sexy cougars.  Off strip in the Summerlin, you won't see it from the main streets, just off Charleston & everyone's favorite to say street, Hualapai ("Wall-a-pie").  You'll be surprised how they've sandwiched a fine dining place within a corporate plaza and offices.The food and service is top notch.  I've been a handful of times, catching happy hour to dining first class all-the-while mainly with Summerlin locals.  White leather, browns, greens, chandeliers sets the ambiance ablaze.  Plus, their is a blaze of fire with outdoor firepits in luxurious outdoor patio seating.Recommended============1.  Roasted Beet salad with lavender goat cheese, mango, hazelnuts and mustard vinaigrette dressing (5.0 stars, $10)2.  Italian Sausage Flatbread with burrata cheese, roasted peppers, pesto sauce ($12, 4.5 stars)3.  Wild Mushroom Risotto with preserved lemon, pepper, and shaved pecorino ($24, 4.5 stars)4.  Braised Lamb Osso Bucco with couscous, shallots, and swiss chard ($32, 4.5 stars)Conclusion=========With service always pro, food great, this is a great off-strip place to save a few dollars without skimping on experience.  Shhhh...hidden secret.  Parking Tip: you can valet, or park a ten spots over and not have a problem in the lot.
Zaw's Asian Foods=Best Asian food in the city!!!! Though there are a few (and very minor) drawbacks: Must pay cash, place is old and a bit dirty on the customer end,  this food is fabulous! Fresh chicken, beef, shrimp, pork and veggies (also tofu dishes as well). Forget about that hammered-thin chicken filled with MSG you see so often in Asian fast-food restaurants. You can see them prepare every morsel of your food; 100% fresh! Zaw's is as fresh as it gets. Like spice? Get it as hot as you want (if you ask for spicy, it's gonna be SPICY). I have tried many of the items on the menu and found about 5 that I rotate every time I order. Trust me!!!! I have been eating there for over 12 years. once you find your dish, you will be craving it at 6 in the morning. Once Sonny, one of the owners, learns your name and the dishes you enjoy, He will recognize your voice on the phone and know your order before you can make it. The three staff: husband, wife and brother are loving, personable people who deliver great food for an unbelievable price. Recommendations:1) Order by phone. When Sonny says it will be 45 minutes, it will probably be close to an hour and 15 minutes if you want to just run in and pick up your food. If you go "on time" you will wait as the make your food fresh right in front of you. Don't worry! Your food is given to you hot and fresh; don't get discouraged as other customers come in and get their food before you. It is ALWAYS busy, but these customers have waited at home for at least an hour and 15 minutes... worth the wait.2) Try it more than once and try several dishes. This IS NOT you average Asian food take out. It may take 2-3 times to find what you like, but...worth the wait.3) If you enjoy a bit of spice DO NOT ask for extra spice. The food is a tiny bit spicy in all the dishes I've tried (about 20 different dishes). To add spice it to get it SPICY (which I love). 4) Do not concern yourself with the restaurant itself. It is old and a bit dirty, but once you eat the food and meet Sonny and the other staff, you will know that the food prep and kitchen is well up to standards. There is a reason it is take out only and so popular, not just with people who enjoy a hole-in-the -wall food place, but all walks of Pittsburgh people who enjoy great food.5) Be a regular customer. Sonny and his family make you feel like you are the only customer that matters at Zaw's, but here is a secret: he does it to every single return customer (and there are a lot of them). Feel free to adjust your meal to suit your needs. My wife asks for all-white meat chicken in the General T-so's Chicken (know it's not spelled correctly, but this is not your average meal) and I get extra onions in my Pork Lo Mein .Try it a few times, find what you like and I promise you you will not be able to live without Zaw's Asian food.P.S. I had it last night!
My Big Fat Greek Restaurant=I was craving hummus for lunch. I was shopping at the mall and wanted something close...Big Fat it is. We sat down and ordered our water and tea. My dining partner wanted to see a wine list, so the waitress brought it over. Then she decided not to return for 15-20 min! We asked to taste two different wines, the waitress brought them over and my friend decided on one. Well, the waitress then took away the tasting glass, still half-full?! This chick was in a zone. We ordered the chicken soulvaki and the hummus trio. The hummus was really bad. It was gritty and flavorless. The chicken was so dry that my friend actually chocked on it!!! While trying to swallow our lunch we noticed that the bus boy would leave the side dishes on tables if they looked clean, for the next guests to eat off of, eeewww!! There we no towels in the bathroom when we got there, so I told the waitress. I went back to the bathroom about an hour later and still no towels?? I told the "manager" who was just as useless. My iced tea sat empty for quite awhile until I flagged down our space-cadet waitress. I used to come here and sit on the patio with my dog....never again...
La Scala=This update is long overdue.  Was here for dinner last night with The Better Half (TBH) and four friends.  We were pleased to see many of the same familiar faces working there. We were greeted like old family members coming home for the holidays.We started out with a bottle of Chianti before we ordered dinner.  We had all night and was enjoying the company, so our waiter ran down the Specials list and then gave us time to decide.  I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer ($9) and special ordered a Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Sauce ($14.95)...not on the current menu, was on the old menu from a few years ago, but it's our favorite and they have no problem whipping it up.  TBH ordered the Escargot ($8.95) and the Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Sauce ($14.95).The Portobello Mushroom appetizer was excellent....the Mushroom was juicy and the Sauce that came with it complimented the dish well....it was a Tomato based Sauce that didn't overpower the dish.  It's a nice sized portion that can easily satisfy two people or four people with a light appetite.The Gnocchi of course was perfect....which is why it's our favorite dish here.  The Gorgonzola Sauce was rich & creamy, but not too heavy.  The texture of the Gnocchi was just right....not too soft, which is a common mistake that many restaurants make.For Dessert, I shared a Tiramisu ($6) with TBH and I had some Coffee....which is why I'm writing this review early in the AM.  The Tiramisu was very good......light and fluffy, just how we like it.The service is awesome.  The server remembered us, even though it's been over 7 months since our last visit....made us feel special.  One thing about this place is that they are always willing to please their guests.  Two of our friends had special order dishes that they were more than willing to accommodate.  This was in addition to our Gnocchi order....which the server remembered how we like it and didn't ask for much direction on the order.Will I return?  There's no doubt about it.I had been so excited to try this place based on all the great reviews from fellow Yelpers. When the Groupon popped up, we snatched it up. I really wanted to love this place. I have to admit, I was a little (er, a lot) disappointed. We ordered the Prosciutto di Parma e Burrata appetizer to start. This was the highlight of the meal. The dish was good. I ordered the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese. It wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped. I wasn't a big fan of meat sauce. Just a little on the bland side. My fella ordered the Petto di Pollo ai Funghi e Cipolline Borettane all'Agro and felt the same about his dish being a bit bland. My mom got the Lasagnette al Forno, which was probably the best of the three entrees we ordered. The food just felt underseasoned, which is odd for Italian food.As another Yelper noted, the decor is a bit dated and I felt the food prices were on the expensive side for what you get.The service was fantastic. Everyone at this restaurant was so welcoming and friendly. Attentive was the word of the day here. Even as someone who prefers a little anonymity in a restaurant I felt their attention was welcomed.The service definitely outshone the food here, unfortunately.
Gilley's=I am in limbo about Gilley's. I love country music, I enjoy people watching, I tend to not care where I go after enough drinks, and so Gilley's would seem like a perfect place for this. I might not have had enough drinks in me to prepare me for the sensory overload, but I just felt out of place. The drinks are definitely Strip price. The cocktail waitresses, clad in bikinis and chaps, make their way around the floor rather often. One of the aspects that turned me off the most was that I signaled to be cut off when my friends were ordering drinks and the girl ignored me and brought me a drink anyways. I was planning on leaving soon and wanted to sober up, but the sale was more important than my wish. This has happened a few times on the Strip and that is a main deterrent  as to why I avoid  touristy attractions.Been here a few times for parties while in Vegas. While I can say I'm a huge fan of the uniforms and beer prices, watch yourself on the liquor. Prices are night club high!WHEN YOU GO- Go for the beer, country music, mechanical bull and the servers. Don't go for the authentic BBQ, the real sh*tkicker bar ambience or real cowboy/cowgirls. This is Vegas. This is also the Treasure Island Hotel-Casino. This ain't the real Gilley's.Lower your countrified expectations just a little, have some beers and enjoy the views.
Kaizen Fusion Roll & Sushi=This place has an AYCE menu now. I only started coming here after seeing the big sign outside the window. This menu must be fairly new because I've never heard about it before and it was the reason why I decided to finally check out this place.The AYCE menu is great with lots of quality appetizers, rolls, sashimi, to name a few. I noticed they had a lot of non-seafood items on there in case someone in your party is not really the sushi type. Here are a few items worth trying:Poke salad- deliciously served on some seaweed salad and a lil on the spicy side. Not too spicy but had a nice kick.Beef ribs- if you like Korean spareribs, you'll love these. One order per person, understandably so cuz they'd probably lose out if they served unlimited amounts of these.Snow white roll-shrimp tempura inside topped with yummy whitefish sitting on top of a tart and tangy sauce. Might have been ponzu, now that I think of it.Dynamite-the usual baked scallops in mayo but their version had big chucks of mushrooms and was covered in cheddar cheese. Very tasty!I can't remember not liking anything I ordered. Kaizen is def taking place over Sushi Tachi as my AYCE sushi spot in North Town. My only gripe is they don't offer half-rolls like Sushi Tachi. This sucks for me because I dine alone very frequently and this place makes it hard for me to try a lot of different things. If they offered half rolls i can try several different ones without risk of being scolded for not finishing or have to pay for the leftovers. Which I came close to doing the very first time.I used to come here all the time way back when they first opened and did not offer AYCE. I've never seen this place get busy so, there's usually just 1 or 2 servers working. On my last visit, the server didn't even bother introducing herself - ok, fine. But what aggravated me was that she tried ignoring me every time I want to order more food. She was quick grabbing my empty plates and before I could even open my mouth to place another order, she's already gone - seriously?The food here is pretty good. I tried some of their rolls, skewers and some nigiri from their AYCE menu. But with the poor and slow service, I was falling asleep while I was eating.Bacon Scallop Asparagus Skewer:1 skewer per order. The scallop is so little and the asparagus has seen better days but it's AYCE so, not a shocker. 4/5Chicken Katsu Roll:I was craving for some chicken katsu but they didn't have it on the menu - ordering this roll was my only hope of eating chicken katsu. It has imitation crab, chicken katsu, cucumber and avocado with eel sauce. 3/5Salmon Killer:Spicy salmon and cucumber inside, and salmon and jalapeno on top with ponzu, spicy mayo and hot sauce. It's not as spicy as it sounds. 4/5Drum Roll:Chopped deep-fried salmon crab mix and cucumber inside, and salmon on top with garlic ponzu sauce. 3.5/5Sunrise Roll:Spicy tuna inside, and salmon and green onion on top with ponzu sauce. 4/5Salmon Nigiri:The fish was pretty fresh and served at the right temperature. The cuts were decent. 3.5/5This is definitely not one of Vegas' best sushi restaurants but if you're in the area and you're desperate then. this place will do. AYCE is $22 at lunch time (11:30am-4pm) and $27 at dinner time (4pm-10:30pm), half rolls available, items in red are not part of AYCE, and they charge for leftovers.
On The Border Mexican Grill & Cantina=My oldest daughter took her mom and sister out for a belated Mother's Day lunch to On the Border on Bell Rd. I stayed at home and waited for any left overs. When they returned, they gave me a bag that was quite heavy and I thought they felt bad for me so they purchased an entire entree for me. Wrong...It was their left over entree's. I was hungry so I opened the bag and sadly discovered about 7 lbs. of what tasted like canned refried beans and partially eaten enchiladas and burritos. None of it was flavorful cold so I reheated it in the microwave and there was absolutely no improvement in flavor so I tossed it. Sounded like a brick when it landed! YUK!!! Save the trip and go to Fry's and get some $.99 Banquet T.V. dinners. I felt really bad for all of them especially on this special occasion! Oh well, at least I know where NOT to go if they take me out for Father's day lunch. I hope my daughter isn't angry at me for writing this but I wanted to give you Yelpers a heads up! They should rename the restaurant  "Borderline Mexican Cantina" Ha Ha
Udupi Indian Veg & Vegan Cuisine=The food was OK.    Buffet style. What really left a bad taste in my mouth wasa.) Having my complete credit card number left on the receiptb.) Getting hit with a $100 phone call charge to my credit card.  When I called my bank to investigate, it turns out somebody had charged a $100 phone call from London to INDIA on my credit card.  c.) It turns out it was somebody from this restaurant.  Stay away from this shady place.  There are plenty of other honest Indian food businesses in the metro Phoenix area.I have had Udupi bookmarked for about three months and I cannot believe it took me this long to make it over here, especially since it is less than seven minutes from my apartment. I had dinner plans with an out-of-town friend and he mentioned being in the mood for Indian. The stars aligned and we ended up here. I started out with a hot black tea and Mixed Vegetable Pakora as our appetizer. The deep fried potatoes and veggies came with two awesome sauces; one reminded me of A-1 sauce with a little sweet tang. The waiter was extremely friendly and did not take offense to our slaughtering of the names of the menu items. He even made a bread suggestion and explained what each of the sauces were made of. We opted to go with the Batura bread, which happens to be a giant deep fried poof of bread that tastes like a sopapilla. It actually looked like a giant jellyfish when it came to the table. As an entree we went with my personal fav, Mutter Paneer, which was EXCELLENT, and Udupi Special Spring Dosai... basically thin crepe chutney spring roll type things. They were good, but not great. Our food came out quickly, the service was attentive, the prices were reasonable and I was REALLY impressed with the taste, portions and quality of our dishes. I will be back to Udupi for sure, this place is amazing!
Market Street Cafe=For all the years I've been traveling back and forth to LV, there hasn't been a time when I didn't stop by this place.  The oxtail soup is why I always go here, and evidently the reason why everyone else goes here.    After a long drive from California, this dish surely hits the spot.  With tender oxtail meat, carrots, celery, ginger, peanuts in a flavorful broth....I have reason to sleep well afterwards.  There have been a few times when the meat doesn't fall off the bone though.  But most of the time it does.  With 2 scoops of rice and a side of cilantro and minced ginger, about $8 is still worth it...even when I used to pay about $6 back in the day.  I've also ordered the steak graveyard special, breakfast, and the banana fritters platter.  For $4, you can't go wrong with these cheap eats.  They definitely fill you up after a long drive or after gambling all night.  The service here is okay, pretty friendly staff.  Expect a long line at around 11 PM, when the oxtail soup is available, but if you're there around 3 AM like I usually am, its smooth sailing.  If you end up waiting long, many "locals" will tell you that it's worth the wait.OMG. I absolutely love oxtail soup! My Mom used to make it when we were kids and she rocked that dish!So, after a long night of dancing at Tao, a bunch of us headed here for the famous oxtail soup!There was a long ass line and it was 4 am. I think we waited about 30-40 minutes. I was tired and cranky already, so wasn't too happy for the wait.But, when we sat down and ordered, the food came within 10 minutes. It was so good! I loved the oxtail, perfectly cooked and huge, seasoned well and had good meat and some fat on it. There were about 6 oxtails per soup, but I was only able to finish 3 1/2 tails. I loved the minced ginger and cilantro on the side. It gave the soup a nice kick. Sigh.. I wish I could have some now. $8 for a bowl of oxtail goodness!pix- http://pandaliciousforme.blogspot.comFirst time I came here was over the summer of last year. Boyfriend was craving Oxtail soup and wanted me to try it since I have never had it in my life! It was a little after 2:00am when we arrived here, and no joke this place was hopping. The line was long and the wait was about 15mins to get a table. Everyone was there from old to the very young. The hostess was nice as she sat us toward the back of the dining room. Now I am not one to complain about where I eat, but some of you might turn your nose up and the place. First of all, this is not new Vegas, its old Vegas. Things are well taken care of in this place (think Denny's) but have an older feel. They have midnight specials, which cannot be beat by anyone else around town! Cheap prices on good cooking!Our waiter was nice, as he brought us water and our silverware! Boyfriend ordered two bowls of their oxtail soup and two sides of rice. When the waiter brought our bowls to the table, all I could think was. How am I going to finish all this? There sitting in front of me was a piping hot and smelling delicious oversized bowl of  the tenderness looking meat sitting on the bone (psst don't tell anyone but I found out that it isn't really ox meat it's the meat from a cow)with cilantro, carrots and mushrooms. The side bowl of sticky rice was piled high. The rice was okay did not eat much of it, but the soup was fully loaded with flavor definitely leaving the bones in makes the broth that much better. Since this was my first time eating the meat from the soup, I was not as graceful as my boyfriend was while eating it. Instead, I tore into it with a knife and fork and when that did not work, I used my fingers to get the meat off the bone. Yes, I am not happy to admit that but just could not think of putting the bone near my mouth and chomp chomping away at it! Not 100% full we decided on having a little sweet snack before leaving. Ordered the banana fritters, which were pretty filling as I could only managed to eat two before being totally full!Make a note people before coming here: Oxtail soup is not served during the day it is only served after 11:00pm...  This place is totally worth going to DTLV for late at night!WHO: Anyone & everyone. As a matter of fact, bring the entire family!WHEN: I believe this Cafe is open 24 hours a day? Correct me if I'm wrong please!WHERE: Downtown Las Vegas inside the California Hotel.WHY: Personally... OXTAIL SOUP!WHAT: One random night while my family was in town. We were stuck in a situation, and the situation being... WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO EAT!! A light bulb must have lit up in one of my cousin's heads when she mentioned we get the infamous OXTAIL SOUP FOR ONLY $9.99! It was a unanimous decision, so this is where we went.They have one of the best graveyard deals ever! You cannot get oxtail soup for 9.99 anywhere! The catch is, it starts at 11pm to 4am I believe? I came here on a whim another time during the day and was bummed because they didn't offer it. It is specifically on the GRAVEYARD menu. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get anything else because our tummies were QUITE SATISFIED. The soup comes with a bowl of rice, which is the filling part. SO GOOD!I will go there soon and try the other tasty meals they have! The menu looks bomb! HAWAIIAN FOOD FOR THE WIN! =) But in meantime, if you are looking for a late night grub after the clubs, this has to be it!!I will leave you with this...OXTAIL SOUP!Like I promised I came back to give their oxtail soup a second try.Refer to my first review and stop reading it right when I taste the soup. Then go back to this spot.IT WAS NOT SALTY! Not only was it seasoned just right, but it finally justified what everyone else has been raving about! I guess the first time I had it something wrong definitely happened. Im glad I came back to verify!My wife orderd the New York Steak dinner. They cooked it medium rare just like she requested. The green beans that came with it was bland but who likes green beans anyway? Anyways, MY SINCEREST APOLOGIES TO THE MARKET STREET CAFE AND ITS EMPLOYEES FOR MY RANT IN MY FIRST REVIEW. I know I dont have to apologize for someone else's mistake, but I wanted to make sure you guys got the right review you deserve.So, yes, I will be looking forward to taking new people to your fine establishment to experience hopefully the goodness of your oxtail soup!For the past 10 years, it has become tradition for us to come here each time we're in Vegas and we ARE in Vegas at least twice a year. What we come here for?? OXTAIL Soup! Served only from 11pm to 6am, the soup is just the perfect way to end a long night of partying in Vegas. It's a simple beef broth cooked with tender oxtail, carrots, celery, and peanuts. What makes this dish superb?? Cilantro, ginger bits, and Kikkoman soy sauce. Eat your meat and soup as you would with rice but add the seasonings on top of it. Ooh la la! It makes all the difference! It is served with two small cups of rice on the side but the bowl of soup itself is huge and can be shared by two people. Imagine what great value this was years ago when they were serving it for $5! Now it costs $10..hey, blame it on the economy! Nonetheless, it's still a pretty good deal. Oxtail soup is not the only good thing here. They have quite an extensive menu of breakfast options that are of great value, too. SERVICE: We already know most of the servers here by face and they are always prompt and quick despite the unholy hours to be working. There can be a line to get a table but don't fret, it moves pretty quickly. Until our next Vegas trip...Mahalo!Thanks to friends who flood my Facebook wall feeds with local Vegas eats!After a long night of partying hard during our first night in Vegas, it was time for a night cap meal. 3am and my cousin and I had anti-hangover food in mind. That's were I remembered the oxtail soup at the Market Street Cafe inside the California Hotel.When we arrived around 4am, we were about the fourth ones in line. But, the dining area was packed. Our wait didn't take that long since we were only a party of two. Once we were seated, I searched for the oxtail soup entree. I read the fine print on the menu regarding the oxtail soup special. The menu states that the soup is currently served from 11pm to 9am with a $9.99 price tag. With it being 4am, I was elated to try it out!Our waiting time for our food was around twenty minutes. It was understandable since the cafe was always packed. When our food arrived, it looked like I had one big piece of oxtail. But that wasn't the case. Under the thick cuts of celery and leaves of cilantro, more pieces were under there. There were also meat pieces embedded at the bottom of the huge bowl! The meat was that tender! This dish was also accompanied with a small plate of white rice. This place knows carb control. As for myself, I would have filled up my bowl with rice until there was no broth left. The broth of the soup had me in shock! It actually tasted like how my Dad makes his oxtail soup, but with different vegetables. Full of flavor and the right kind of saltiness.Market Street Cafe had my home cooked meal waiting for me. But having my Dad pop out the kitchen, that would have been just too weird!Anybody with a drop of Filipino in you, take note!  I don't know about the rest of the menu, but if you can manage to stay up past 11:00 p.m. (I know, I know, so take a nap), you must treat yourself to a huge bowl of rich oxtail soup.  $9.99.  As good as Mama made, maybe better?Market Street Café is located inside one of the smaller, older casinos downtown, The California Hotel.  We went on a rainy Monday night after a show, and there was absolutely no line to contend with. I consider our timing lucky after reading all the reviews about the wait.The bowl is a deep, ~ 8" bowl, filled with lots of meaty, fall off the bone oxtail and an exceptional tasting beef broth.  It also had carrots and celery.  I don't know if the veggies are always this way, but ours were slightly undercooked, still crunchy.  Just the way I love it.  You are also given a bowl of steamed white rice, a small cup of cilantro and even smaller "pill" cup filled with pulverized fresh ginger.  Sink your teeth into those bones, then slurp away!If I had any complaints, it would be.... I couldn't finish it.  Ended up bringing half of it home with us.  And.....our dogs suddenly forgave our being away for 3 days, they were in hog heaven with the bones.  And the leftovers were just as good as the first time around.  You have far better odds of feeling like a winner by joining the soup squad than gambling. Yum!Just one of the largest menus I have ever seen in a really long while.  Just about everything is already on the menu.Breakfast - I loved getting the steak and eggs or bacon and over hard eggs.My dad liked his pancakes.Sandwiches were good.  Burgers were good burgers.  Fries were normal- just fine.  Most of the food was just good cooking.  Normal- and not too out of the ordinary.  Most of the food is good normal ordinary.I get it that this could be a really un-fun job.  But all the staff were really friendly and had their speals down pack for us and knew all the normal questions that they must get asked 50 times a day.  Still it is so nice to see a smile and hear other things besides the ringing of casino bells for a while.It's about 3:45am, and after a successful night of partying and drinking..drunchies came a knockin'.We were originally waiting in line at Secret Pizza..and when we heard it was $26 for a box..we were said, "HELL NO!!!" & decided to come back to the hotel and eat.Waking up the next day and thinking about it, it's kind of an average price for a box of pizza lol. Anyways, we immediately got seated..and it was still on and crackin inside MSC.My friend and I shared the chicken tenders with fries, and all of the food came out fairly quickly. I think we all got the same thing lol.Though they REALLY skimped out on the fries, like literally less than a handful, the chicken tenders were delicious. Crunchy, chicken was juicy and flavorful, and that ranch made it allll the better!Our waiter for the night was this sweet older gentlemen...so cute!Def enjoyed my meal here.
Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery=Let's See....  Horrible service from a skanky girl, serving food that belongs in a correctional facility.This had to been one of the very worst dining (for lack of a better word) experiences I've ever had, anywhere.Can't I post anything lower than one star??
Sierra Gold=Sierra Gold invites you into a very comfortable atmosphere with good quality food & satisfying craves to enjoy whether one might be there for televised sports, video poker, or simple just sitting down at the bar or amusing seating area.First thing to keep note: HAPPY HOUR everyday from 3pm-7pm & 12am-4am (50% off all drinks & pizza)As for the food:_Thin crust pizza (not a fan, but just got sold with the quality & outcome of the pizza that's served here)_Bucket of wings (so many favors, garlic parmesan is a favorite)_Bucket of curly fries (gotta love'em)_ZOOKIE (too good to be true! The warm white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whip cream, & dizzled with chocolate/caramel just hits the spot to that sweet tooth crave)Service could have been better, but what do you expect at midnigt: top noch service? (minus 1 star)I have yet to try more & what's best: this local spot is open 24hours!!!
Jason's Deli=They are SUPER SUPER nice and friendly here!!! Oh my!! They are so attentive and efficient, so our meals were prepared super fast!!You guys are awesome at Jason's Deli, and we left satisfied and healthy after consuming our meals!!! :) Thanks a bunches!!
Valle Luna=My wife & I have been going here since 1985. The salsa( I'm a huge salsa guy ) In my opinion is the best salsa in the valley. Their chips are always served hot and taste fresh. They are so good I could make a meal of  just their chips and salsa. We pretty much stick to a few of our favorite dishes. After I make a pig out of myself on salsa & chips I start my meal with a bowl of Albondiga Soup (Meatball soup with fresh vegetables).For my entrée I usually get a  SIZZLING platter of beef Fajita with grilled vegetables. My wife usually gets a Chimichanga.  Both dishes come with a side of guacamole, sour cream and Spanish rice.  In addition the Fajita comes with corn or flour tortilla. As for the flavor of their food, their dishes are bursting with it. The food here is always cooked to perfection, tasty, fresh, delicious and served hot.  The service is usually awesome. In fact my sister who lives in Rhode Island always makes it a point to stop at Valle Luna to get her Mexican Food fix. WARNING: If you get there during normal dinner time you're going to have trouble parking and you're going to have to wait to get a table. FOOD: Drool worthy Arizona-Sonoran recipes!!! Always fresh, consistent, and served promptly.  PRICE: Very reasonable. SERVICE:  Service is usually good but they can get very busy. However I must say the wait for food is normally pretty darned fast considering how busy they can be at times.  CONCULSION: We've had our share of lousy over-priced Mexican restaurants. This place has been a go-to eating spot for outings with family and friends for years. Parking can be a challenge when they are busy but I feel their food is so good its worth trying to get a parking space.   RETURN  FACTOR: 100% We keep coming back! because we love this place.************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again if a friend or family member wanted to go. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!If you've read any of my reviews, it's no surprise that I take into account the fact that Valle Luna is what it is... it's not backed by some culinary genius mixing up roasted pepper foams to top off a taco. This is downright classic, fried, greasy goodness.There is some history to my love of the Mexican food. I originally wanted to be a chef so at the young age of 12 I got my first prep cook job in a small town at Zapatas Mexican Restaurant. It wasn't long until I was 13 and running the kitchen at night. I'm sure this was illegal, but who cared in Page/Lake Powell, AZ?Long story short - I ended up pursuing another career, the owner passed away and the new ownership screwed up the recipes and menu. Since then, I have been on an endless journey to find my 'Zapatas' here in the Valley. The closest I had found was El Minuto in Tucson. And then one day, my brilliant friend and co-worker invited me to lunch.That's when...I met Valle Luna.It's been a dirty love affair ever since. A time warp back to my youthful days at Zapatas. The chips are fried in-house. The shredded beef tacos are everything I remembered them to be. I finally have found a reincarnated Zapatas!!!!This is true Sonoran Mexican food as it was meant to be.I could probably get my elite status revoked for saying this...but it dawned on me that as much as I've eaten here over the years I have never reviewed Valle Luna. Valle Luna is one of those places you just kind of take for granted. Like a sweet guy who maybe isn't exactly your type and is in the friend zone and  is always around until he disappears and then you are like "Where'd you go?". My analogy isn't the best,,,but I know what I mean!So it always makes me smile when people "tell" me about Valle Luna. "There's this good little Mexican place on Cave Creek"...."Oh...Valle Luna?"...."Yes!"Valle Luna is a place where I have had many a happy hour and super casual dinner. I prefer the cantina as I feel the service is slightly better in there...(not that I have had poor service in the restaurant it is just "happier" in the cantina.) Like my daughter told me just last night when I pointed out I like the cantina better...She said, "Yeah...the restaurant is for old people". I replied with "Yeah, and we are NOT old", which is funny because...well...I am actually old and was appreciative that my daughter didn't point that out like she normally does.I love their seafood taco dinner with cod as well as their steak tacos. I also love that you can substitute calabicitas for the rice/beans. That gives Valle Luna a star right there. They have a really good Happy Hour menu too.So if someone mentions a Mexican place they want to go to on Cave Creek-by all means check it out!
Sushi Wa=The BFs coworker is a bit of a foodie and declared this to be his favorite over the other AYCEs, even better than our favorite haunt. We were in the area and decided to go for dinner at $26.95 pp.-NIGIRI-*Albacore- even though it just says plain, it kinda comes slightly like "cajun albacore" that other sushi spots do. It has a bit of pepper, thin slice of jalapeno and ponzu. It was pretty tasty and fresh so we ordered quite a bit. *Super White Tuna- was pretty fresh*Yellowtail- decent, but not as fresh as other ayces I've had.Spicy Octopus- this is a mix of thin sliced sweet vinegared tako, jalapeno, masago...must for the fans of tako no sunomono.(Seared Pepper baby tuna- this was peppered tuna that was freshly torched. I like this kind of stuff, but the BF thought the sear makes it a bit chewy.*Mackerel- This was totally the star and what impressed me the most. Every have mackerel where it is just kinda dry, fishy, and very salty? Not here. It was fresh cut off a fish and not bought salt packed/salt cured. I almost never order this since it rarely gives me satisfaction...I got several orders. I have not been this pleased with mackerel aside from sashimi I had at Ichiza. The chef puts ponzu on it which makes sense to me since at home I squeeze lemon on mine and soy and helps a lot of people with the strong flavors, but if you want it pure make sure to opt for dry. It was amazing alone with some fresh wasabi. * Sashimi Yellowtail...odd, but these pieces tasted better than the nigiri. * Sashimi Albacore w/ Jalapeno- it was rolled with thin sliced red onion as well which gave a nice bite to it. -ROLLS-*Salmon Skin handroll- it's a comfort staple I end every AYCE meal with. Love. *Albacore Crunch- this was spicy tuna roll with albacore topped with sweet onion fried onion strings with a spicy garlic ponzu. The fried onions wasn't what I was expecting when the BF said it has "crunchies" and made for nice texture and a bit of a sweet flavor element. We're not big on rolls, but some perked out interest. However we were too full for more. -APPETIZERS-*Monkey Brain- mushroom with tuna and creamcheese fried and served with a spicy cream sauce. This was really good, with a lot going on that went well together, but I can still taste the separate elements. *Softshell crab- I love these things. Poor crabs. I must have had 10 of them. *Hamachi Kama- it was fresh fish. I think Island Sushi down the street takes the prize though since they cook theirs much longer which makes for crispy skin. There were parts of this skin that was just fatty and rubbery still so I left it alone. *Butter Saute Scallop- it comes on a hot plate in butter and herbs. They weren't rubbery or overcooked. This is a very plain app, but good to me. Sometimes I just want scallops simple. I put a tiny bit of soy into the mix and it was some good little bites.*Kalbi Ribs- these were cooked on a hot plate. They were pretty soft and had decent flavors*Firecracker- wonton crackers with tuna, avocado with spicy sauce and a sweet kinda honey sesame sauce. I liked these, they did get pretty spicy- fire cracker indeed!We ended with green tea tempura ice cream and mango mochi. I don't get why they put chocolate sauce on my mango mochi...its best to leave a good thing alone so maybe tell them to lay off the sauce. Also was limit one contrary to a earlier review by Patrick D. stating no limit.-SERVICE-Our sushi chef was nice, the owner (also working at the sushi bar, on the other side) came to check on us and even the sushi chef working aside the one in front of us also checked on us. Food came out in a good amount of time even though they were busy. The servers cleared plates fast! I mean sometimes I would be trying to move a plate out of the way and there's someones hand grabbing at it nearly missing a few degrees of me being doused in sauce. However, I'd turn around to ask for some appetizers and they're gone off. Someone snuck in hands to refill drinks fast as well. They didn't really check on us to see if we needed stuff from the kitchen so we flagged down if we wanted stuff. Then when we were ready for dessert, we were ignored when we asked and our sushi chef was too who shouted and pointed to us saying "Dessert". And it wasn't because they were busy, in fact, 4 of them were standing by us or milling about picking up an order. We were held hostage for a bit til I was able to catch someones attention. It was just very odd front of the house service. Also, the ladies weren't very personable, one even seemed a bit cranky at how "big" our orders are which was polarities different from the cheerful sushi men. I wouldn't put several orders if I didn't think it was so hard to put in a order.Overall- I think this is a good place with the nicest ambiance and pretty plating. I get why the BFs coworker recommended it. However, my favorite place still remains because of the awesome service on both sides of the bar."Wa-Wa" (sound of failure).  Sushi wa-da-fa!?!  I got held hostage by a sushi bar!!! and not in a good way!I came here with good intentions - going to Terri K's first UYE, sitting in the "bamboo jail" table with 12 other awesome yelpers and yelper friends, eating raw fish galore.  However, it did not turn out that way.  We came early (6 PM reservation) but could not leave until after 9:30 PM.  The only reason this gets one star from the restaurant side of things is that our bus boy was awesome.  He was polite, refilled drinks super fast, and cleared empty plates like Flash.The service was deplorable.  We really only had one waiter, and he only liked one half of the table.  That half happened to include a lot of people that speak his language, so he spent all of his time taking their large orders and giving them food.  These are all my yelp friends, and I am glad I got to be with them, but the server only waited on them essentially.  When it came to our table, he never gave us what we ordered - 30 minutes passed and we had never received items, whereas our companions on the other side got several orders in and food was coming out in group portions.  The waiter argued with me after I asked 3 times for my mackerel sushi, one of the 3 things I ordered...after waiting 30+ minutes - he finally said he already brought it to the table (but it was someone else's order) and said I never ordered it.  After I asked for it 3 more times, couldn't he just put in another order?!  When I asked him a question about an item, he answered and ran off before I could order food.  I never got to order more than once, and most people on my side of the table had to re-order food or wait forever to order.  If only we spoke Korean!The payment was a disaster too.  We asked for separate checks (for parties of one or 2 - we all did AYCE so it was same price all around) and we asked before we ordered and again before we asked for the check.  We were refused.  Our waiter gave attitude to Bobby Y. when he brought our credit cards and cash that added up exactly to the bill with gratuity.  Another waiter came over and Jieun spoke Korean with him - he said if he rings all of the cards up, he cannot put in any orders for other guests and they are BUSY (well, we were already there 3 hours hello!) so it would take him awhile.  Instead of going to start ringing our cards up though, he stood there and kept repeating the issues with their system - so I told him to go do it already!  It was an igloo in there - when Eric R. asked for them to turn the a/c up, I think that caused our waiter to hate us.  I had to borrow Nelson Q.'s jacket to survive the hours of hell.  I finally went to our car and put the heat on for 10 minutes.  The only reason I ate enough was that Jane shared some of the food from her side of the table with me, very generously (amaebi, ikura, saba, oysters) - because I never got my full and only order from the 6:15PMish range.The upside -hanging with great people and meeting new people (Jane, Maria).  The envy - Terri K. bolting after convincing jerk waiter to give her a separate bill.  The downside - Wa still has a sticker on its door saying "People love us on yelp."  I call BS on that!SUSHI Waa--heres my order? Sushi wa-s the server ever gonna take an order?Sushi wa-it. Sushi wa-tttt theee FUCK?!Im sitting in "bamboo jail" as I write with all the Yelpers here for a UYE. We started at 6pm, it is now 8:50pm as I start this review and we are sitting waiting on them transacting everyone out.Food is still decent, however service is rude and inefficient from our main server. One half of the table was getting service and the other half where I was sitting was kinda ignored a lot more, waited more to put orders, etc. He'd take their order, leave, come back with something for them and then we would have to try to flag him. We'd wave him, he'd say he'll be back and doesn't come back to us or he would walk passed us like we didn't wave at all. A few people had lost orders and instead of saying something kind like "sorry, let me go check on that and get it out"....it's more of remarks like we never put the order, you got it (no someone else got it) ,etc. One of our Yelpers asked three times to get her first order when the other side already on their 2nd round of orders. I was gonna do 3 stars but now with tge transactions, I'm miffed. First, they wont split the bill and kinda told us we had to just deal with it because they're busy.  We computed what we all owe and wrote in the back which cards to charge what. Now something with POS being the only one for orders and transactions so they don't want to back up orders by transacting all us out so they'll transact when orders aren't coming in. We had a Korean speaking Yelper go talk to him and he was rude about it so she went to talk to the manager who said he will do it in a bit. We had to wait for him and explain everything. It took like 20 minutes of discussing things and explaining how we wrote down what before they went to the back to start. We have no choice but to wait. I'm sorry, but one thing I learned about restaurant hospitality that turnover is important because waiting for a check lowers the impression farther than waiting a bit for good food. People are done and want to just go. We finally got our receipts back and......they charge my credit card for two drinks and two AYCE. We wrote everything down clearly on the back on to receipt. We put the last 4 digits of each card to identify them and what amount to charge to each card. HOW is that NOT clear enough? They charged me for someone else. Okay, so basically then they should give me some cash back then bring back the cash people some change. Well, first time they not only gave me less than what I was owed, but also no change for people with cash. They finally gave it and we left at 9:40pm.50 minutes to transact is pretty crazy long. I know it's easy to say that well, it's a pretty a-typical effed up situation. That maybe with the busy place and a waitstaff that doesn't micromanage it well it went down south fast. However, I do have previous visits where I do specifically state how odd the service was odd, not friend and inefficient so that holds true that the waiter service isn't that good here. Also, it got super busy on my last visit towards the end of my dinner and I also waited 20 minutes to get a mochi and 15 minutes more to get my check back to sign so I was held hostage prior to this. So no, it can happen to you in some degree. Please retrain the staff....and HIRE some good servers. The busboy was polite and did more than just remove plates by checking orders and refilling drinks. PLEASE make him a server and maybe make your rude server a busboy until he learns how to talk to people. I don't deny the AYCE is good, but if you go then don't go at peak hours, don't sit at a table- ONLY with the nice sushi bar guys and do cash if you have a party splitting the check. Look at how thorough I was in taking pictures and reviewing individual items because I wanted people to come with my last review. However after this incident I am not recommending it or coming back. I was frustrated all throughout the meal and exasperated at how I was charged and then shortchanged cashback. I haven't felt this way about a dining experience in a long time so 1 star isn't out of line.There are many AYCE areas in the area including my favorite, Island Sushi whose staff is pure aloha hospitality.Update- Owner sent a apologetic note....I give him kudos for that and would've given a star for his professionalism. Then a week later I get a anonymous note from someone in henderson talking about me giving bad reviews and how dare I "destroy families". Given that I only have 15 1 star reviews out of nearly 500 and havent given a bad review in ages, it made me wonder. Then I found out other people got the same message that dined with me here so it doesn't take two to figure out our crabby server didn't like what we said. SO unprofessional and cowardly! Your server really made sure we don't come back.I'm sad for 3 reasons.1. Sushi Wa is a far drive from my residency and from work.  But because my friends raved about this place, I really wanted to take the time and drive to try it.2. My favorite kind of sushi which is the simple Salmon Sake Nigiri was laid on top of a super huge portion of rice and more importantly, the fish was NOT fresh.  HUGE disappointment!3. My favorite roll which is the spicy tuna over crispy fried rice here was bland!  The fish looked like it has been out for days and they don't use fresh jalapeno?  Makes no sense.  I was a bit disgusted.I also had their Yellowtail Nigiri; also not fresh.  I tried their garlic edamame; no taste and not even a hint of garlic.  When you say there is going to be garlic in a dish, I better taste it.  It's as if they like they completey forgot the ingredient and it's in the freakin' name.  Boo!  Then, I had their Ultimate Garlic Tuna Roll...and THUN THUN THUN.....again, no taste of any garlic.  The roll even sits on a bowl of soup that only makes it even worse because the soup base doesn't taste like anything but yuck.  I couldn't believe my dismay!The one star goes to one appetizer: Fried Oysters, and one roll: Volcano roll.  The volcano roll was a little too much on the saucy side that if I had to finish it myself, I would feel guilty for my because of all the mayo clogging up my heart valves.  But because it had sauce, it was the only roll that had any flavor.This was a huge disappointment.  Not only the taste, but the fish wasn't fresh.  Fresh comes first!The wait  staff though was really nice, and the place is decorated nicely; kind of too fancy though.  Also, they over do the food presentation.  They need to work on the food taste rather than the presentation.  Just because something looks good, does not mean it tastes good.   I'll end on a positive note though.  They do have coffee mochi for dessert.  Not many AYCE sushi places have this mochi flavor.  If my friends convince me to go back to try their orders, I don't know.  Because the fish might still be from today.I am giving one star for a reason...  I used to love this place, food quality was good and service was great.  But that all change today, and it was unbelievable what the server had told me.  The Nigiri was not fresh today, food was ok.  The service I would give 0 star if I could.  Every time we are trying to order, the server always give us this bad look.  And we don't really eat that much, trust me.  The worst part was the server lie to us in our face saying there is a limit of the Ice Cream per person...  Which is not true and I told her I have been here plenty time.  She immediate change her story saying it is not limited "BUT I THINK EACH OF YOU HAVE 1 MOCHI ICE CREAM AND 1 REGULAR ICE CREAM I THINK THATS ENOUGH FOR YOU GUYS"  I seriously start to laugh and tell her forget about it.  And this is my first time in my life left a $0 tips.  I thought it's AYCE!!!!  As a business owner, I feel sorry for Sushi Wa owner to have staff like that.My friend and I were looking to try out a new AYCE sushi place. Although Sushi Wa didn't have as high a rating on Yelp, my friend wanted to give it a try. There are so many sushi places on Eastern, almost too many options. This place is adorable. It seems like a nice, high end sushi place. When we arrived there was basically no one in the place, but by about 20-30 minutes later and the place was pretty busy.We both ordered AYCE and each started off with Baked Lasagna and Mussels. Mussels were pretty good but neither of us cared for the Baked Lasagna. I've had better at any other place I've been. There was a lot of cream cheese on top if that's your thing, I'm not that into it so I usually take half of it off. Regardless of that this roll doesn't compete with surrounding spots. There is definitely some kind of distinct, additional flavor being added and I'm not really into it. It wasn't bad, just not as good as other places I've been. We also ordered the Fire Cracker ($6) and it really good. Equally as good as any other place I've ever had it. I highly recommend trying it. I don't think it's as spicy as it sounds, but there is definitely a kick to it. Popcorn Scallop was also pretty good. The sauces they served with it were ok. Beef Teriyaki roll was ok. My friend liked it more than I did. I don't think I'm ready for a meat/sushi infusion yet. Rose roll was pretty good, description says that it's a baked baby lobster on top of California roll with eel sauce. I'm not sure but that doesn't sound like what we got. It was a roll covered in a lot of stuff, I tasted scallops, there was definitely a really good creamy type sauce. This dish looked kind of messy, but as actually not that hard to eat. The only thing I didn't like about it was the red onion that was mixed on the top. They were pretty easy to remove but one snuck through on my last bite. Screaming Orgasm was pretty good, but again I've had equal or better at other places. My friend ordered the Las Vegas Roll, I didn't try it. 4 Kinds of fish, crabmeat, avocado all completely deep fried. It's not my thing. I don't mind some light tempura, but I'm more of a raw sushi kind of girl. I did try the sauce that was in the bowl because my friend didn't like how spicy it was. I usually like anything spicy, but this didn't have a great flavor. So for my first visit here, I'd say it went ok. I mean I don't think I'll be rushing back here. I feel like I can get better value at any other place. The best thing about this place is the ambiance. Service was ok. Servers seems to be friendly, but also ambivalent. It's also one of the more expensive AYCE places that I've tried. I don't think that mixes too well with the level of deliciousness. Sushi quality seemed legit, but I also want quality flavor.We came here on a Saturday evening and ordered 2 AYCE1. Regular salmon skin hand roll2. Spicy salmon skin hand roll3. 2 orders of soft shell crab4. Short ribs5. Pocky roll6. Superman burrito 7. 2 orders of yellowtail sashimi (4pc an order)8. Hamachi kama9. Rose roll10. Nabeyaki udon11. Energy roll12. Green tea and strawberry mochi for $69.27- Seated right away. Pleasant welcome. Friendly. Smiles. - Chefs are kind. attentive. entertaining. Choi! Great guy. - Salmon skin hand roll was was like Dohs. Not good. Not crispy. Poor. - Soft shell crab was small. Fair. - Short ribs a bit too much fat. - Pocky roll was amazing. Loved the avocado and presentation. - Superman burrito was flavorful. Didn't look like Superman or a burrito. - Their sashimi order was fantastic! thick slabs! Best for AYCE - Rose roll was fulfilling. Shove it all the mouth deal - Nabeyaki udon was great! Best AYCE soup. Ridiculously hot. - Hamachi kama was a bit oily, but still crispy. Maybe I'd stick with salmon. - Energy roll was okay. wouldn't get again. - Nice cuts on mochi. chocolate drizzle. - I felt that there was collective effort to try their best to ensure a good visit.- Definitely coming back for more!
Cafe Porta Alba=Pizza... good.  Service... good.  Atmosphere... good.  What I didn't appreciate?  Being followed outside & accused of not leaving a tip on a $116 bill.  We left $38.  Funny thing is, our group of 6 were all restaurant managers/servers and would never think of leaving less than 20% on a bill for just ehhhh service.  Want GREAT pizza, GREAT service, GREAT atmosphere?  Try Pizza Brutta on Monroe Street.  (am unaffiliated by the way, just my neighborhood pizza joint that never dissappoints.)
Makino=Ahhhh..Makinos.... My first initial favorite sushi buffet!  (Too bad you are in vegas otherwise I'd be there once a week!)I know that real sushi fanatics don't believe in sushi buffets, but for huge fusion sushi fan like myself, Makino's is heaven.First of all, the price for lunch is about $14, and Dinner will run you about 20.  I think the weekend pricing  is like $17 and $25 respectively.Sushi selection... it's got everything you would want.  Various types of California roll mixes, simple nigiri sushi, and other tasty variations of fusion sushi that you can indulge all you want as long as you can stuff it!  I can't tell you what my favorite roll is because the sushi chefs gets creative all the time, so everytime I went, it's always something different!  For those non-sushi fans, they also got a very nice hot dishes.  The tasty selections includes traditional shrimp/vegetable tempuras, fried oysters, steamed white fish, white wine clams, BBQ riblets, Fried rice and Yakisoba.  All are very tasty!  So you definitely will not feel left out if you are not into the raw fish deal.The dessert section is ok... all the cakes and sweets taste generic (as if they were taken out of a box from trader joes or something), but they do have the bomb red bean ice cream which I always have some at the restaurant, and have to have a cone to go as well.  But you will have to ask for it (that is the only problem because it's not self serve)Lastly, for those that craves sweets, there is a chocolate fountain that you can literally dip anything into  (If you believe in spider roll covered in dark rich chocolate.. I guess go right ahead.....)  But you can definitely dip as much as your heart desires!)This location that I'm rating (in the  LV outlets) and the off the strip location (Decatur) to me taste comparable.  Therefore, either one you go you should not be disappointed.  However, just remember that this is a buffet, so for those hard core sushi fanatics, please leave the mindset of having the top notch fresh sushi like you would at a $200 a night sushi restaurant mentality at home so you won't be disappointed, but just enjoy how much you are paying for such tasty creations drawn up by Mr. Makino."AYCE SUSHI!!" (pops head up)That light bulb in my head shined bright when I heard we were heading to an AYCE sushi place (+ more). This restaurant, located in an outdoor shopping mall/outlet in Vegas made me yearn for sushi as I saw their sushi display. They had other sections, such as, a soup section (miso soup, etc), hot foods with mussels, noodles, etc, but all I cared for (besides dessert) was just  sushi.  Everything looked good, but there weren't any labels of what exactly each sushi was. Luckily I had an eye for sushi, being that I LOVE sushi, and was able to distinguish what each roll had. Everything looked fresh.. or so I thought. As I sat down, I devoured, well, tried to devour each roll. I couldn't eat everything from each piece of sushi because geez, there was SO MUCH RICE. C'mon people, where is my fish?I didn't pay for rice! I literally had a pile of rice chunks on my plate, just so I didn't get full off of rice. I need to make room for other things like dessert! Plus the fish didn't feel or taste fresh at all. But I guess that happens when you're at an AYCE sushi buffet +more. If you've been to Todai, then Makino's is like or perhaps a little bit better than Todai's quality of sushi. I honestly don't think my $16.95 (wkend lunch price) was worth it. But I did eat it any way, and managed to eat some of the tempura shrimps they had, which weren't that bad. The best thing that this place offers, besides good service, was their dessert! Yes, there are cookies, mini cakes (that are what ever), but they have GREEN TEA ice cream.. and drum roll pls..... RED BEAN ICE CREAM, one of my favorite flavors, EVER! Oh man, I felt like I was in red bean, green tea heaven. I have never in my life been to a place that offers all you can eat green tea and red bean ice cream. NOM NOM NOM, is exactly what you heard after going back two times to get more of it. Too bad it wasn't mochi.. or I would have stuck with dessert the whole time I was there!A couple of us with a slight hangover and couple of us really hungover, made our way to the Las Vegas Outlet Center to meet up with some Japos.  Sweet.  My kind of get together.We dragged our feet inside and plopped down on our seats.  Get our drink orders in and venture to the food.  Not that much going on as far as quantity goes.  I grab some udon and do some surveillance on the sushi.  The set-up looked like a busted up lip.  What a mess!  Some people are just vultures, I tell ya.Some say I'm way too picky with my sushi.  You want to know what I tell them?  Too bad.  I'm telling you anyway.  I tell them to eat fat bowl of sh%t, straight up.  Besides, my otosan (father) was a sushi chef way back when.  So there.  Suck a fat one, you haters =)Anyways, the stuff looked like you would expect from an AYCE sushi dig.  Only it's better than any of the stuff that I've had from a buffet on the Las Vegas strip. Man, have you guys ever tried that sh%t?!  That stuff tastes like an uncooked potatoe. The udon was better than I expected.  I threw in some tempura in it, because that's how I do.To top it all off, I had green tea ice cream.  Only, they gave it to me in a cone.  I've never had it any other way than in a bowl.  So that was kinda weird.  It wasn't maeda-en stuff, but it was aiiight.This place is better than Todai, that's for sure.The girl here makes sure you will not go thirsty.  It is the desert after all.When your stuffed you can waddle yourelf to all the surrounding shops and gather up all your Ed Hardy gear.  If that's your thing.  Hopefully it isn't.West west ya'll.As a sushi lover who lives in Vegas, this was actually my first time ever eating at Makino's. It was just a bunch of family members on an adventure for the nearest food place, and this happened to be what we found. Its a good place for a group of people to just go and grab lunch. One positive is it is all you can eat sushi for $16.99 lunch!! If you aren't a sushi fan, there are a couple of alternatives, like teriyaki chicken, fish, and other dishes. One of my favorites was the whole "build your own miso soup". The soup came out of some sort of tea dispenser, and you got to put whatever else and however much tofu you wanted!! Thumbs up all the way!Oh I also can't forget the dessert! There was a variety to choose from, but I believe the favorite was the fondue fountain where you can "chocolate-up" fruits and marshmallows. Overall, I was pleased with it being just a whim!
Eleven=I went to Eleven on Friday night for a late dinner and got some delicious food but rather bizarre service. We made a reservation, but got there a bit earlier than expected, so we asked the hostess about getting a table overlooking the bar if one opened up, and went to go sit in the lounge to have a drink. I had a delicious Red Ruby martini with pomegranate and blood orange, and the bf had a Pear-secco, which he enjoyed. We didn't have to wait as long as expected, and were taken to a table on the upstairs patio. It was a nice night, but the space was pretty generic and there were open tables in the area we'd asked for, overlooking the bar, so we asked to be moved. When we got to our new table and started perusing the menu, I noticed that the tasting menus weren't there, which I'd read about online. I finally asked about the tasting menu and the waitress said that they don't serve it on the patio, and asked if I'd like to see it. I did, and it was what I ended up ordering (the vegetarian one), but I felt the whole situation was weird and uncomfortable. I just wished the waitress talked a bit more about the food in general. She never talked about what was on the menu, told us about what was good or tried to elaborate beyond the most basic answers to questions we asked. The bread server, on the other hand, told us all about the three different bread selections, the type of wheat used in each bread and what made them unique. It was more in line with what I was expecting from the waitress and left me thinking, "someone needs to give this guy a promotion, stat."The meal itself was very good. It started with a taste of grilled cheese from the chef, then I had an artichoke soup and mushrooms on toast. I then had a small bowl of fettuccine in an olive sauce, which was a bit too olivey for my tastes, and a delicious grilled mushroom on black rice. I had the wine pairings with the dishes, which I liked--and it ensured that my glass was always full--and I got the chocolate peanut butter pretzel for dessert, which was a bit crunchier than I was expecting, but tasty. I'm sure our experience would have been different with another server and another host, and overall I was really pleased with the quality of the food and the thought put into the dishes, especially the vegetarian tasting menu.Full review in Blog:Calling the restaurant I was informed that the Chef's Table was generally for groups of 4-6, but if no one had booked it for a given night they'd be willing to seat a solo for the standard price of $100 for 9 courses - placing my reservation a couple weeks in advance I was glad to find out that Mondays were generally quiet and I'd have the table all to myself.Somewhat disappointed as my only vantage point of the action in the kitchen was through a small slit in the tiles, I was promptly greeted one of two servers who provided the cocktail list and filled my water.  Professional and courteous I will note that service throughout the evening was mostly competent, albeit not overwhelming - a course was delivered without silverware, water reached empty twice, plate clearing was a touch slow.  Fortunately, as part of the Chef's Table experience I had the honor of receiving all of my dishes (and excellent descriptions of preparation and ingredient sourcing) from Chef Chad himself.Shortly after the chef's departure the bread-lady arrived with a woven basket featuring three house-made breads.  Browsing the online list and realizing Eleven takes orders for breads and confections all I can say is that the bread basket gives me a good idea why - all three of the options were excellent.  From a sweet yet toothsome Currant Semolina Sourdough, to a rustic and aromatic Carraway Wheat, to a heavenly moist Sea Salt Focaccia each of the options was excellent...and while my primary server wasn't always on the ball, I was never for want when it came to bread.The third course of the evening would provide the first "wow" of the tasting - an impressive accomplishment given the simplicity of the dish.  Served proudly and with great description by Chad the House Cured Prosciutto with Three Sisters Mesclun, Vin Cotto, Olive Oil was sublime - the nutty notes of the silky pork only enhanced by the slightly bitter greens, acidic yet sweet vin cotto, and smooth olive oil.  A new passion of the young chef I was even given the opportunity to see the curing area after my meal - a small section of the wine vault with meats aged anywhere from a week to nearly a year - a return visit for charcuterie at the  bar would certainly be on my agenda if I lived locally.The final savory of the evening would be my favorite, as well.  Large in portion and bold in flavor, Elysian Field Farms Lamb - Sous Vide with Crispy Lamb Neck, Anson Mills Polenta, Golden Artichoke, and Mint was marvelous.  Nearly raw yet sizzling hot, the lamb itself was not as gamey as would be expected and the crispy wrapping of neck lent plenty of texture and savory flavor.  Acting as a bed to the butter-knife soft lamb was a chive laden and creamy polenta with the slightest hints of mint and mace.  Flanking the protein along with a savory lamb jus were crispy artichoke hearts - pan seared and creamy within, a vegetal composition not unlike the lamb in terms of presentation.I was next greeted by the pastry chef who presented me a trifecta of her favorite desserts from the menu.  Titled on the menu as "Tasting" the trio contained miniature versions of Eleven's Famous Peanut Butter Pretzel Candy Bar, Banana Cream Pie with Tapioca, and Brioche Bread Pudding with Cinnamon and Strawberries.  While I will note I'd have preferred received all three as separate courses (time and temperature reasons only) I will also note that the lady has talent - each option was stunning.  Creamy peanut butter with chocolate ganache and salty pretzels, caramelized bananas with hand whipped cream and graham crackers...and oh the Bread Pudding.  With finger-thick slices of buttery brioche caramelized and doused in a salty cinnamon caramel reduction, the only thing that made it better was the ice cream, a smooth dollop of spicy cinnamon that melted slowly over the hot pudding.Looking back on dinner at Eleven the word the two words that come to mind are "American" and "Competent."  To be fair, in my experience I've never really had a tasting menu that I would call "American" without pronounced flourishes of French or Mediterranean - the Chef's table at Eleven was almost like going to CUT or a similar high end steak house and getting a tasting...the food varied from very good to excellent, but certainly did not re-invent the wheel.  For $100 the quality, presentation, and ingredients were certainly worth the price - but at the same time, I can't say I would rush back.  That said, Chad is an excellent Chef with a lot of potential and the space at Eleven is beautiful - I'd certainly go back for some a la carte selections and dessert anytime.Officially, our favorite restaurant for Brunch. We have been here a few times now and are always very happy with the choices. We always go with the prix fixe. I have enjoyed the pumpkin squash soup, the beet salad, the crab cake sandwich, the pork huevos rancheros, and chicken sandwich served with the killer fries, just to name a few items. BJ has tried the New York strip and eggs, shrimp, leek, ham & cheddar omelet and loved every minute of it. We always swear that we are going to try the Eleven burger or the grilled sticky. But something else always manages to catch our eye. They also serve a bread basket with a yummy croissant and random tiny little muffins with an ever changing delicious homemade jam and flavored butter. Kudos to Eleven for serving up the best brunch in town!Delightful.  That's the word that comes to mind.  From the first step in the door with the welcoming fireplace and soaring ceilings, to the soothing sage greens and wood, to the inlaid tables, to the professional and friendly service, to the exquisite food.  Five celebrated a special occasion together this afternoon....Eleven made it even more special.We started off with the roasted beet, Belgian endive, Maytag blue cheese, hazelnut salad.  It was beautiful!  Gorgeous jewels of golden and ruby beets sprinkled with soft, salty and sharp bleu cheese, crisp, crunchy endive, sweet hazelnuts, lovely apples and a drizzle of molasses vinaigrette started us off beautifully.  Entrees....well, 4 out of 5 voted for the strip steak salad and all raved about the beef!  I opted for the lobster roll sans the roll, please.  Beautiful mesclun, which I understand was the first of the season and locally grown, was piled high with succulent chunks of Maine lobster dressed with a fresh lemony vinaigrette.  The lobster had been cooked perfectly...tender and sweet.  Absolutely heaven.  Oh!  And the housemade, fat dill pickle rocked.  Mmmmmhhhmmm.On to dessert.  We were a little more diverse in dessert selection, but only marginally.  3 out of 5 ordered the molten lava cakes that were accompanied by hazelnut ice cream - housemade, of course!  All three wore happy little chocolate smiles the rest of the day.  Our 4th was all smiles over the apple crumble pie with roasted cinnamon ice cream and I....well, of course I had the creme brulee.  In this case it was pumpkin creme brulee.  Warm, toasty spices infused the lovely, soft custard with that gorgeous, crunch of bruleed sugar on top.  I do love a good creme brulee....this ranked right up there with the best.A round of coffee and those adorable little macaroons brought to the table left us all happy as clams.  Delightful.I could live here! I could live here if they would also feed me 24/7....wouldn't that be livin' the dream? I can't even get to the food before I tell you how amazing it is inside! It has that cool urban loft feel. I love the outdoor seating. I love the huge garage door that opens up the entire restaurant. I love the upstairs intimate dining area. I love the bar area. I love love love it all! Remember to keep an open mind and an open wallet, because you'll need it! First off, cocktails....hello! I ordered the Summer Strawberry and my friend ordered the Leven-ade. We were so confused because the waitress set them down in front of us and I had the yellow colored drink and she had the pink colored drink. We thought she had mixed them up.  But she hadn't.  I swear mine tasted more Lemonadie and tart and my friends tasted more fruity. So to solve that issue, we switched! And all was right in the world again.... I had heard over and over again that the portions were incredibly small. So with that being said, and not wanting to be a cheapskate by ordering only an app, I ordered the Asparagus Salad. The portion was big to my surprise...and utter joy. Score one! The asparagus was fresh and crisp with balsamic drizzle and pieces of thinly sliced pork (properly called Lomo...which I totally had to look up the meaning of, don't worry!) and parmesan. Perfection! I ordered the Tuna because I can rarely resist tuna if it's on the menu. It was perfectly cooked....or uncooked. There's really no other way to order Tuna then to order it rare. Go rare or go home! It was fantastic! It really out shined the mixture of rice below.  I also really liked the slight green olive taste in the dish. Score two!  My friend got the Hanger Steak rare as well and it was equal in amazingness.  I, of course, had to try it!   I'm a fillet girl all the way, but the way the steak was cooked made the flavor just right! So we left, empty wallets but full bellies. And I'm totally ok with that!This is it. This is without a doubt in my mind and my wife's, the number one restaurant in Pittsburgh.Everything about this restaurant is outstanding-  the ambiance is very sophisticated and  wonderful, the service is educated, informed, efficient, unobtrusive and helpful.We have dinned here numerous times for business and for pleasure. We have had outstanding lamb, veal, pastas and seafood. Chef Stevens never disappoints and when we get the tasting menu and often we do it with the wine pairing it is a dining adventure. Sometimes we ask the chef to add an extra course to the tasting menu and he always obliges with something superb. I should mention that the deserts are amazing.The experience is EXCITING AND WONDERFUL.Seriously!  All you happy hour gurus like me, listen up!!  They have updated their happy hour menu so that now you can get ANY gin or vodka martini for $6.  This includes Belvedere, Boyd and Blair, etc.  It used to just be Stoli but now it's anything.  My jaw dropped.  This is HANDS DOWN the best happy hour in Pittsburgh!!  Not to mention the dynamic menu (changing weekly) and array of good wine, cocktails and food (oysters!) on HH.I've also had dinner here twice.  They send out birthday coupons if you are on their mailing list for a free entree (up to $30 value).  Hello!  This is killa.  I used mine in Dec.  A friend emailed Big Burrito saying she didn't receive hers and they faxed a letter to the restaurant for her free dinner a month later.  Best customer service.  I really can't say enough good things about this place.The overall theme of Eleven is balance.The pork belly was like a gift from God: the saltiness of the grits balanced by the sweet maple gastrique; the soft tender pork belly enhanced by the crispy apple slices; and the brown color of the seared belly offset by the bright greens.  Truly a perfectly conceived dish.  Did I mention that it tasted AMAZING?The scallops were the only thing that didn't blow my mind.  They were good, just not out of this world.My main dish was hands down the best lamb dish I've ever had.  If you like lamb, get the lamb.  Again, perfectly balanced.  The lamb, smoked shoulder, mint, lamb bacon, and red onion marmalade could all be tasted in different combinations.  You could make every bite different and every bite equally amazing.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly executed, and beautiful to look at.Finally, there's a reason the chocolate-peanut-pretzel candy bar is at the top of their dessert menu.  This is not your kid's Snickers bar, THIS IS YUMMY TIME FOR ADULTS.  It all comes together and again, is perfectly balanced.  The cold sweet ice cream, the salty smooth peanut/preztel filling sitting on a thin dense brownie (acted almost like the crust).  Truly an incredible finish to an amazing meal.The service was outstanding and probably the most personable service I've ever had.  Our waiter Daniel was extremely courteous, informative, nice, and helped make our night one to remember.***Eleven's food is not exceptionally creative or original, but the food here is good, fresh and reasonably priced for an upscale lunch***Eleven is part of the Big Burrito group, which has many notable restaurants in Pittsburgh.  This one is an upscale spot next to the John Heinz History Center.  The restaurant has a nice contemporary decor.  There is a slightly open kitchen.  The main dining room makes a good use of green and there is comfortable seating along with white tablecloth.  The room also has high ceilings.  In some ways, the room reminds me a little of a cross between Tavern and Lucques (though Eleven lacks the inside-and-outside like atmosphere of Tavern).Eleven's lunch menu is very inviting.  There is a great collection of starters--some nice sounding salads but also scallops and crab cakes.  Their entree section features a mix of gourmet sandwiches and burgers as well as plates with proteins like lamb and fish.The bread at Eleven was standard stuff--not much of a crust, not much of a chew and even a little bit dry.My starter was good.  I had the seared scallops, which were garnished with fingerling potatoes, pearl onions, spinach, sorrel, and sauce gribiche.  It was a very generous portion for a lunch starter.  I thought it was good.  Everything tasted fine and a lot of the ingredients were good.The scallops were nicely seasoned and had a good outside crust.  They were tender, but the scallops lacked the moistness of the scallops at Lola.  I liked the pearl onions and I thought the sauce gribiche was briny, sour and good.  I also liked the spinach.The fingerling potatoes were too big.  They were not bland and definitely not raw, but the insides of the potatoes were not as tender as they should have been (4 stars for this dish).For my entree, I had the Elysian Fields Farm lamb t-bones with a salad of radicchio, arugula, endive, fingerling potatoes, and idiazabal cheese.  Elysian Fields Farm is a great producer of lamb (the farm is located just an hour outside of Pittsburgh).  I once had their lamb at Sona and it was exceptional there (they also provide lamb to The French Laundry).The lamb here was good.  The lamb was like little porterhouse steaks.  There was a New York strip part that was flavorful and juicy but also with a chew and less tender texture than the filet mignon-like portion, which was very tender.There were two t-bones and they were a tad uneven.  One was seasoned a little too heavily while the other was not as juicy as I wanted.  Still, the lamb t-bones were flavorful and good.The salad was a very bitter salad with the radicchio, arugula and fennel.  I did not mind the bitterness, but I think some would.  I liked the cheese and they did a better job with the fingerling potatoes here, which were sliced and tender (3 stars for this entree).For dessert, I had the chocolate-peanut pretzel candy bar, which was surprisingly  good.  The base of the candy bar was a decent though not great brownie.  There was a very good and creamy peanut butter mousse as well as a thin layer of a dark chocolate bar.  There was a decent chocolate ice cream on top as well as peanut brittle and very good pretzel nuggets that were topped with smooth melted chocolate.There was also a caramel sauce.  The dessert tasted pretty good and while there were a lot of sweet and rich elements, the dessert did not get too rich or too sweet (4 stars for this dessert).The meal ended with a coconut macaroon, which was mediocre and dry.Service was good.  My server was pleasant, personable, polite, and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.Prices were about what you would expect to pay for an upscale lunch.  When considering the many high quality and premium ingredients used, this lunch at Eleven was probably a little less expensive than equivalent places in LA.I liked my lunch at Eleven.  While the food was not exceptional, my starter, entree and dessert were all at the very least good.  The food was not really creative or exciting enough to make me want to come back, but I think this is a good option for an upscale lunch in Pittsburgh (they had a pretty good lunch crowd on the day I went).There are several metered spots along Smallman Street.  There is also a paid lot for the Heinz History Center, which is $5 per day.I absolutely loved my first trip to Eleven for lunch a few weeks ago, and I cannot wait until I'm rich and can go again.I love the upscale feeling, but you can also go in not super dressed up (at least for lunch) too.  At lunch time on MLK, the place was pretty quiet, but I'd imagine you need a reservation at dinner time.  The service was fantastic.  Our waiter was very friendly, especially for a more upscale place.The actual food isn't particularily creative, but it's delicious.  Everything is fresh and hot, and I really enjoyed the entire experience.  I ordered the Crab Cake Sandwich ($14).  It was a substantial size, and it tasted amazing.  My friend ordered the Eleven Burger, and it looked equally amazing.  Our waiter was telling us that when he comes into work, it's always some new cooking adventure in the kitchen, and he is always excited to try the food.  How many servers and people in the restaurant industry can say they'll eat where they work?  I won't eat where I work!  If that isn't enough proof enough that Eleven is amazing, I don't know what is.We wanted dessert, but we could not make up our minds.  So our waiter said he would suprise us.  All desserts, at least at lunch, are $10.  They are also all meant to be split, which our waiter was kind enough to share with us.  He surprised us with two ice cream sandwiches- homemade pumpkin ice cream between two ginger snap cookies.  I'm salivating just THINKING about them.  AMAZING.  Highlight of the meal.I loved Eleven, and it's definitely some of the best dining in PIttsburgh!  Check it out.Good for happy hour! The first time I came to Eleven was for lunch in December and I wasn't that impressed. The second time was today for happy hour with two friends. No wait and it was a great day, so we sat outside. I wasn't in the mood to drink, but friends got the Ruby Red and red sangria which they both enjoyed. We shared the oysters, Blue Bay mussels (comes with kielbasa), calamari, and onion rings. The oysters were tiny and salty, not exactly how I like my oysters, but still decent. (No need for the big plate though.) Mussels were good; I especially enjoyed the soft center of the fried sourdough. The calamari was great, no complaints. I thought the onion rings were just okay; I usually prefer my onion rings to be more substantial (thicker). For the price, the portions of the mussels and calamari were large, but not so much for the onion rings and small oysters. Still, Eleven is a good option for happy hour if you're Downtown! Taste | 4Atmosphere | 3.5Presentation | 3.5Service | 3 OVERALL | 3.5Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher this year, I decided to go to Eleven to redeem it.  Two friends accompanied me for my visit on Sun., 12/13, and I was able to given them each a $10 off voucher, so we all were able to receive a discount on an otherwise pricey dinner, which is always nice.  Overall, we were quite impressed with our experience, as the details below will show.Although we all decided to forego appetizers, we were served bread from a bread basket containing three varieties.  Of the three types we tried, I enjoyed the sea salt focaccia best.  The only thing that's a bit strange is that, instead of placing a basket on the table, they dole it out by the slice, but you can request two slices at a time if you so desire, as I did.The night of our visit, the entree list was pretty seafood heavy, so all three of us ordered seafood entrees.  My friends ordered the seared salmon and the walleye pike ($28 each), and I ordered the seafood tasting ($36).  The seafood tasting consisted of a crab cake, a sea scallop, and salmon topped with shishito peppers and salt and vinegar chips over some seafood chowder.  The crab cake was generous in size and consisted of lump crab meat with no pepper and very little filler.  It was definitely one of the best crab cakes I've had, which is saying something given that I went to high school and college on the Eastern Shore of MD.  The seared salmon was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside, just as salmon should ideally be.  The sea scallop was also very large and meaty, and tasted appropriately (I must confess I'm not a huge scallop fan).  The chowder and chips made for a nice presentation and accompanied the main components of the dish well.  The only component of the dish that I didn't really care much for were the peppers--but then again, I'm not a big fan of spicy green peppers.  I tried bites of my friends' entrees, and they were both delicious, as well.After finishing our entrees, we sprung for dessert.  I was torn between the warm dark chocolate cake and the candy bar desserts ($10 each), so when my friends ordered the former, I went for the latter.  I'm really glad I went for the candy bar dessert, since it was absolutely delicious!  It consisted of chocolate olive oil cake, chocolate malt ice cream, and peanut butter sauce, and they even included a piece of white chocolate on which they wrote happy birthday because I mentioned that it was my birthday.  I also tried a bite of my friends' dessert.  While it was delicious, I enjoyed the candy bar dessert more, so I made the right decision.Needless to say, my friends and I very much enjoyed our dinner at Eleven.  The quality of the ambiance and service matched that of the food, making for a comprehensively wonderful experience.  I've since learned that the head chef will be leaving in a couple of months to start his own restaurant.  I wish him great success in that endeavor, and trust that the new chef, who currently heads Casbah, will be a worthy replacement.  If you're looking for a classy place to dine, I highly recommend Eleven--it easily makes my top 10 restaurant experiences in PGH.
Siu Wok=Ok, Ok, I gave 'em another chance. Let's just say last fall I had a shrimp fried rice that disagreed more with me than Rosie ODonnell disagrees with Anne Coulter. After several hours bowing to the porcelin god, I vowed never to return. Well, everyone deserves a second chance, rice, er, um I mean, right? Plus it SO convienent to my job and home. Pork lo mein has become a fav of mine and I actually crave it. For about $7 I usually have leftovers I can enjoy later. My bf Rickie is a spicy man so he loves spicy food, his craving, the Sun Devil chickien with gobs of jalepenos. We enjoy the crab puffs as well. Pretty standard Chinese fare, but the place lately has been spotless and the service great. It's tiny and probably does more take out and delivery. I say they're worth a shot if you're in the hood. Chow Chow yelpers!A-OK!!I've enjoyed take-out from Siu Wok four times now and haven't been disappointed. Very inexpensive for the amount of food you get. I have created 3 meals from one lunch special. The Pepper Steak was really yummy and perfectly spicy. The Kung Pao Steak was quite good as well as the Szechuan Chicken. (I'm noticing a spicy trend here). The lunch specials are served with fried rice, an egg roll and (2) crab puffs. The only thing that annoyed me was the "crab" puffs. OK,  not only is there NO crab in them, there isn't even a hint of "Krab" in them.... you dig?? Call them what they are...... cream cheese puffs, thank you. I'll eat them anyway..... no need for deception. Yesterday I had the Teriyaki Chicken for lunch. I questioned it immediately because it looked *interesting*. I actually joked to my lunch date about what I was eating and that I didn't believe it was chicken at all but in fact the victim of some "ghetto backyard, dove massacre"... alas I was wrong. I'm just not used to eating only dark meat chicken and let me tell you, it was fucking delicious. In closing:good cheap eatscream cheese treatsbomb dark meatsnow if only they had crushed ice.....I ate lunch here with my friend John, and I have to agree with him that 4 stars is a good rating for them. I like the fact that they are very accommodating to vegetarians. You can order anything from the menu, and they will replace the meat with either crispy or boiled tofu. The portions are also huge! I could not finish my dish. It was totally worth the money,  it is a clean restaurant,  and very inexpensive too. Not the most authentic Chinese food out there, but for the price and the amount of food that you get it is excellent. It is also close to the light rail, so that is a big plus.Siu Wok has been a favorite for quite some time.  Sadly, today's experience knocked them off the list.My co-workers and I decided we needed a tasty meal today so we placed a delivery order through Siu Wok.  We were happy when the meal arrived much sooner than the 45-minute delivery estimate.  Our food was hot and smelled delicious.  We were all enjoying our food when one co-worker made a stomach-turning discovery: a dead fly in her food.  We all immediately stopped eating, repulsed by the large fly nestled up to a sliced carrot.I immediately called Siu Wok to complain and spoke with Jennifer.  I told her what happened and asked for a refund on the entire order.  She said she could refund the contaminated meal but would have to speak with the manager for authorization on the other two.  She called back a few minutes later and said she was only given permission to refund the $7.95 for the extra-protein meal.  She seemed to understand why I was disappointed but said her hands were tied.  I asked her to relay to management that I was very disappointed in his lack of attention to the matter and that Siu Wok had just lost a considerable amount of business, as our office frequently places orders there.Instead of Siu Wok being out $23.44, they have lost an office full of customers and gained a negative Yelp review.  Doesn't the fly look delicious??I have done the research for you & happy to tell you that Sui Wok is the best Chinese food in Phoenix! Consistent. Inexpensive. Fast delivery & damn good food!  We have dined in once but have had countless dinners & work lunch delivered over the past 3 years. I even had a party of 20 catered from Sui Wok. Every time it has been great! Sweet & sour pork, vegetable lo mien, honey walnut prawns, & vegetable chop suey are my go to items. Egg drop soup is good as well as the sizzling rice soup. The combo dinners are enough food for three meals! Can't beat that!I have recommended this place to a lot of people and always get a good response! Even a picky New Yorker who knows good food from China Town NYC. Huge delivery area!! 43rd AVE- 40th ST & Northern- Buckeye.Give Sui Wok a try!!  I guarantee you will have it again!
Amazing Jake's Food & Fun=Horrible, terrible foodborne illness.Shoulda turned back when I saw a kid put his whole fist into a jello after wiping his nose. Sure, they replaced it, but... one person manning a three mile long buffet cannot snuff out all the snots.How bad was it you say? Oh, well, when the PARAMEDICS showed up at my house, they thought I was a goner. During the ambulance ride I profusely vomited on, and shat on, the sexy EMT. The sexy ones always show up when you are projectile... anything. Almost ten hours and two bags of fluid later, I was allowed to leave the hospital."Oh, but Anna," you say. "How could you have possibly known this unfortunate illness was the result of excessively greasy pizza, premade salad and buffet style fruit?" Well, the neighbors who had gone around the same time also spent a few days wrestling for the toilet. If we could sell explosive baby poop, we would have been in business. Amazing Jakes was the only food within a week that we all shared... I'm going to go ahead and place the blame there.That pizza tastes exactly the same coming up 24 hours later. Thanks there Amazing Jakes. I am now thoroughly terrified to set foot in a buffet place again.Have to agree with some of the reviews here. You should only go here if you want to lose a lot of weight quickly from vomiting and the other end all night long. Dirty dirty dirty. Everything is dirty and nasty and on top of it all they charge you way to much. Chuckie cheese is a cleaner place then this and I would not want my dog eating off the floor of this place.  I am sorry to be so harsh, but this is the sad reality of this place.  If you own the place and are reading this, fix it up a little - do a better job and more people would probably come.  Think about quality and your kids eating and playing there.I was not amazed. Nope. Sometimes it's fun to act like a kid again. I love Dave and Buster's, but we were in the mood for go karts and it was too hot outside for Fiddlestix. I saw a deal online and should've realized then it was too good to be true.We got 3 hours, some video game credits, and a meal for about $20 each. When I was reading the description online, I was picturing this: large pizza and salad buffet (ok, I wasn't really expecting a lot from this), indoor go karts, bowling, 18-hole mini golf course, rock climbing wall, indoor roller coaster.. I was sorely disappointed.As soon as we walked in the door, I noticed everything seemed cheap. A lot of the paint here is sloppy, and in areas the floor is messed up. The furnishings are well worn. It looked like there used to be a large grocery/big box store here that was repurposed.  I'd already paid for our tickets online, so we proceeded.First, we ate the buffet. There were grubby grubby children all over- I have no problem with kids (or I wouldn't have come here in the first place) but there was no supervision whatsoever at the buffet, and some children don't know enough manners to be by themselves. I stayed away from a few of the items for this reason- not enough tongs and too many dirty hands touching noses and foodses!The "salad bar" was pathetic. Plain iceberg lettuce and not much to go with it. The pizza wasn't much either, very bland but I can see kids liking it. The pasta was the same, along with being overcooked. For dessert I had an ice cream cone and a rice krispie treat...those are hard to get wrong. We each got a beer- it took about 10 minutes just to flag someone at the liquor counter down. Eager to go be "amazed", we quickly drank the beers in a faux garden and then made our way onward. We went to the other side of the building to start our "fun". To let our food digest, we decided to go for the mini golf first. Probably 75% of the holes are just simple variations on straight lines and zigzags. The landscaping is pathetic..I think maybe it was supposed to be beach-themed? I felt like I could build something better in my backyard. Again, it was totally unsupervised so kids were running from hole to hole, going in the wrong order, and getting in the way. Next, we tried the "indoor roller coaster". If you've ever been to a fair, it's a Himalaya. It's a very old, rickety, bumpy Himalaya. I had bruises on my legs after riding this. I was somewhat worried it would fall apart while we were on it.By now, we were getting a little low on time and decided to go over to the go karts. There was a long, long line that seemed to move so slowly. They only had 4 karts, and only ran 2 at a time while the next 2 people sat waiting. We soon saw why- this go kart track is just a small oval. We decided to make the best of it, and anxiously waited our turns. At long last, we were racing! Well, that was until they decided my fiance was driving too fast and *electronically slowed his car*. That pretty much took all of the fun out of it. After that, we used the credits on our cards- the games were not a great value so they were all gone within about 10 minutes. I didn't even win enough tickets to get good junk candy, so I ended up giving my card to a coworker for his kids. Initially, we had thought about bowling after our time expired (you have to pay extra). However, by the time we'd been through the whole experience, we wanted to get out of this dump and back home. Amazing Jake's may be good for kids who don't know any better, but it's not a good place to try and have fun if you're just adults who wish they were kids.It doesn't really feel fair to give Amazing Jake's 4 stars, because there are really two experiences going on within those walls.  You've got the culinary struggle, and then the action from all the games/rides.Based on food alone, they'd get a generous 2 stars, with the only saving grace being their limited salad bar.  All of the other pabulum aint fab-u-lum.  They should could call it "ween cuisine", cuz all it takes is one time Cuz, and you wont be back no mowww (what you say!).  Mushroom fettuccine sounds delightful, until you get a punch from whatever that whacky-ass oyster essence is.The pizza was a train wreck... a train wreck with fatalities... that spilled like 1000 gallons of ammonia, which threatens to asphyxiate the nearest small town.Man, go to Cici's buffet.  See what those playas bring to the table for $5, and then try to replicate.  Better yet, take $100 from the till and hit the nearest Little Caesars.  Daaaang!The dessert case proudly boasts "Freshly Baked"... what you don't know, is what month it was freshly baked, cuz Money, it wadn't today.And I know the difference between ice cream, frozen yogurt, and frickin ice milk.  Ya hoodwinked me, G!  But in the eyes of a 4yo, this place is almost as fun as Disneyland.  She was sooo excited to go on all of the rides, so if you've got a little adrenaline junkie too, the mini coaster will hold the pinnacle of thrills.And one word of advice.  When you're leaving, and you see that free photo kiosk hanging on the wall, where you can email the photo to yourself... the touch screen is way out of calibration.  Check the email address twice before you hit send.  Even after checking it, you still may not get your portrait sent to you... and that makes daddy sad.
Dozo Japanese Cuisine=If you are looking for a detailed review of the sushi here, I can't help you.  I am not a sushi eater.  You may tie me to the whipping post now.  My husband, however, LOVES sushi.  He would like nothing better than to live in Japan again.  And I will say he is very impressed with Dozo.Since our relationship is not all about me, I allow him to take me to dinner here once for every 20 times I make him eat Mexican food.  And I admit, I always enjoy it too.  They have a great menu in addition to sushi.  I always have a combination which is tempura with your choice of entree.  Fantastic tempura every time.  I've tried the katsu chicken, terriyaki salmon, and plum chicken as well.  Service is excellent.  The servers actually seem to appreciate your business and the sushi chef always thanks us as we are leaving even though we're not sitting at the sushi bar.  Relaxed, casual atmosphere.  No need to ho up to come here.  Very enjoyable.I don't miss much about Portland...but what I do miss, I miss a lot!With specific regard to good eats, I miss Lew's Dairy Freeze where they sold almost mystical coney island hot dogs...what the hell did they put in that sauce?!?!? It was great!I also miss Sumida's...Sumida san was sushi chef of the first water...trained as a sushi master since boyhood, he was the real deal.I loved to go to Sumida's for lunch and watch sumo on the big screen TV (Sumida san had a satellite dish...live sumo:) and eat until I felt like I was going to explode...so good, so relaxed, so "homey"...I even got know who was who in sumo:)Flash forward through SF to Scottsdale and directly to Dozo!No sumo on the big screen, but everything else is right at Dozo.Robert, the sushi master and owner is as scrupulous about his fish and process as Sumida san was and the results show in the sushi and sashimi...beautiful feasts for the eyes and a treat for your palette:)I had a business lunch there yesterday (that's right, I am getting to pick the lunch spots again:)I had the sushi and sashimi lunch...a bargain at $13!...nigiri sushi and sashimi, along with a salad and miso soup:) The sushi and sashimi are chef selections and always presented beautifully, created fresh for you, in the moment, by the sushi master:) I was going to go into detail about what he made for me but you know what, your sushi experience will be different and you should go to Dozo and try all of it...I have:)It's a sublime experience...I think a good sushi master knows what I want better than I do:)My lunch companion was not a sushi fan and went for the salmon teriyaki...he pronounced it some of the best he's ever had...always a reasonably good indicator of satisfaction:)There is not much more to tell you about Dozo...I don't know if it's the best in town (I hear good things about Yasu), but it may be the best in Scottsdale:)If they had sumo on the big screen, I might never leave:)Domo Arigato, Mr. Roberto:)Don't let the "I used to be some sort of restaurant with a drive-through" appearance fool you - Dozo is a GREAT spot for Japanese food.  A place where the food is tasty, the staff is friendly and it is not over-styled and trying to be a nightclub.  The word dozo can be translated as "please", as in "be my guest".  My friend and I have certainly been made to feel very welcome on (multiple!) visits.  Sushi?  Oh yes!  Consistently fresh and nicely presented.  Try the yellowtail sashimi, albacore tataki or maybe a Dynamite roll stuffed with slightly spicy scallops.  Your taste buds will thank you.  Not a fan of fish in the raw?  No problem!  Dozo has an extensive selection of cooked items, including a to-die-for hamachi kama (yellowtail collar) served with a light, citrusy ponzu.  Wait, forget that part.  Don't order that or there won't be enough for me!  :)If you like loud music, shot girls and lots of California rolls topped with gooey sauces, Dozo is not for you.  That is why I like it.Itadakimasu!!Had a craving for donburi!  So I came in here with my son.  The menu was extensive good chocies between sushi and non sushi items.  We were not that hungry so I ordered one dish to be shared between my son and I.  I felt bad for the waitress and she couldn't help but give us a stare.  Luckily, my son was so charming and loving and funny that by the end of the meal he had totally won her over and I left a tip amount as though we had ordered two entrees.The only disappointment was of course the donburi.  The donburi I crave for and remember is a donburi from long ago when I was a student at Ann Arbor where they would pile on the rice in a big bowl and pile on top a big pile of gooey mixture of onion, egg, and chicken.  It was soooo good!  I haven't been able to find the remembered donburi anywhere else since then.I think I need to recreate it in my own kitchen to satisfy not necessarily my stomach but my memory.  Not kidding.
Nobhill Tavern by Michael Mina=I felt somewhat sheepish eating here.  Really?!  You are from the bay area and you go to a SF style restaurant on a Vegas vacation?  Yes, bitches.  Because it is so fucking good.I had kobe beef for the first time at this gorgeous restaurant.  My mouth was delighted!  Ever since then, the beef I have eaten pales in comparison.  Mouth not happy!Yes, it is expensive, but worth it.  If you are going for a high-end dining experience, this is a good spot.do you want to be one of ocean's 11 or nick cage in leaving last vegas? if you choose to be the former, do not spend that last $60 at the poker or roulette table. here's how you should spend that $60 and still could feel like a winner even after you lost everything. - order a 3 course prix fixe dinner from nobhill for $40 - pay about $15-$16 as tip for their impeccable service (you'd feel like a high roller) - the rest goes to the city and the state, unless you know a way to avoid it... nobhill indeed is the best thing happened on the strip. where else can you enjoy a piece of michael mina for under $40? p.s. - this review is WAY overdue (like about a year!), but better late than never, right? :) i don't have that photographic memory so the review cannot be elaborated, but trust me, you'd rather bet on michael mina for $40 than anything else in vegas.What to do when you're in Las Vegas and already missing home? Stop by the Nobhill Tavern by Michael Mina of course ! A sumptuously designed restaurant distilling the essence of what a tavern should be by adding a modern twist.  Alcoholic beverages to accomodate  weary travelers and a comprehensive fusion cuisine to satisfy any palate.   The long walls of panelled glass draped in a dark forest green fine haberdashery provided the intimate dining cubicles complete with soft lit lighting and music to soothe the spirit. What I tasted from the menu: Shared lobster rolls- perfectly seasoned and just the right homemade mayo and herbs to highlight the sweet lobster meat on light pillow bread. Delicious. Striped bass cooked perfectly crispy skin and translucent white meat, simply salt and pepper seasoning- perfect with delicious broth. Sides of Green kale and cannelloni and kidney beans ( a bit too salty). The highly recommended lobster pot pie was as sublime as what our server described it as being. It is comparable to the Plaza Athenee Lobster except the domed buttery pastry covering the lobster "stew" was replaced by a heavenly souffle. The lobster consomme was delicious and velvety smooth with hints of the remaining essence of cognac stewed in the mirepoix juices for hours and hours. Dessert I tried was the Tarte Tatin- but found it substantially redone that it lost the simple goodness of what this tart should have been. Just full bold caramelization of the apples on a buttery dough. Their dough was hard and overly seasoned cinnamon and cloves. It doesn't need to be a purist to really say that it was just a poor rendition. Minus one star. Other mentionable: Drinks were well made with special attention to the Martinis andour attentive server provided impeccable service.PS. It was a wonderful start to celebrate NYE. Woot Woot! :-) Happy New Year!!!UPDATE: We want to thank Nobhill Tavern's bartender extraordinaire, Michael, for making our wedding's cocktail hour so spectacular. You see, Michael, maker of my favorite cocktail in the world, the Cable Car, aka spiked Orange Bang, aka spiked Orange Julius, gave us a crash course last fall on how to make these frothy wonder drinks. From our first sip, two years ago, to our 50th, all made by him, we knew that this was what we wanted for our signature drink. Michael graciously made that happen for us.He took a good chunk of time out of his day to show us step-by-step directions, tricks and tips. It probably helped that since we see him EVERY TIME we're in Vegas and knows us by name, we're almost family. The reason he was so vital is because Nobhill Tavern's Cable Car can't be duplicated. Trust me, I've searched, tried and sipped. We even had one at Caesar's Palace, just to compare, and it was absolute swill. Everyone we've ever taken to Nobhill Tavern has gotten absolutely hooked on their Cable Cars. I'm not talking, "yeah, that was pretty good," I'm talking, "do we have time to go back to Nobhill Tavern?" and "since we're in Vegas, can we stop by MGM and get some Cable Cars?" Nobhill Tavern really crafts a work of art and we can't thank Michael enough for making our signature drink, the toast of our big day! PS Their food is pretty damn good too, unfortunately, since those super tasty Cable Cars sneak up on you, I can't recall specifics from any of my meals other than I recall it being yum. I def do recall that the service was spectacular because those Cable Cars were coming out to our table lighting fast as if on a conveyor belt.If you want to see Michael in action, minus some extra special instruction, see here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvCWP3mjZRkWith suitcases in hand we checked this place out to satisfy my curiosity about Michael Mina. I've heard his name thrown around here and there when the conversation is about restaurants. Why is he famous? Why does have so many restaurants??NEW ENGLAND CRAB & LOBSTER ROLLS ($17) - 3 pieces of warm bread with crab & lobster goodness on top. Scrumptious!SEARED FOIE GRAS ($25) - It was perfectly seared and buttery. It also had an apple compote that made it super sweet, super yummy!FRENCH FRIES ($7) - Perfectly salted and perfectly crunchy.BEIGNETS ($9) - So warm, so soft, and so sugary! Then I dipped it in the chocolate caramel sauce....ohmanohmanohman, I was in pure ecstasy! The salty caramel ice cream was a delightful bonus to this dish!CHRIS-TINI ($14) - There was something beyond sweetness, something odd and sour that made me a bit dizzy. I liked it!SUMMER FLING ($14?) - So good yet so bad...The first sip wormed its way into my brain and made me giddy!SERVICE - There was 1 to 2 people standing in each corner watching the dining room. At least they were on it when we needed something. But as the restaurant got busier, we saw less and less of our waiter. We had to flag him down when I wanted to order dessert, when we wanted more drinks, and when we were ready to pay. But my tummy was happy so I wasn't upset with the wait. And props to the manager for hiding our suitcases in his office.After a few appetizers and drinks I kind of understood why Michael Mina is known by a lot of foodies. AHHHH...dining here was a great way to end this Vegas trip! Now I'm curious about the other Michael Mina restaurants!
Eden's Grill Inn=Eden's Grill is, without question, home to some delicious, homemade Middle Eastern food. Not since going to the houses of friends of my father many years ago have I tasted food like this. I should clarify...There are great Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix, but a lot of the places have food that tastes like restaurant/deli food. This is not bad at all...restaurant food can be very delicious. But, then there are places that serve food the way "Mom" makes it. It's that special little bit of love that I'm talking about. In the case of Eden's Grill, "Mom" IS making the food. Well, not my mom, but the mom of the great waitress that served my table today (So sorry I didn't catch her name.). For our lunch, Bobby T and I went for a side of hummus and baba, a gyro plate and a beef kebab sultani plate. The hummus and baba were solid, loaded with garlic and topped generously with olive oil. The gyro plate was also solid, the meat wasn't too dry and the veggies were definitely fresh. Above the previous two menu items stood the beef kebab sultani. Each bite had the two of us smiling because it was so good. The kebab meat had flavor infused into the core of each piece...never did I chew a bite and not get the flavor of the marinade. It was awesome. We also got to taste some of their hot dolma. I have only been served hot dolma at three restaurants, and each time they have been great; definitely worth trying if you're a dolma fan.There is one last thing that we tried that everyone needs to come to Eden's Grill for though, and that is the rice - basmati w/ golden raisins and chopped almonds. The rice especially tasted like it was made with love and not just by a chef. I still crave it as I write this (good thing there was plenty left over). I'm excited about this "new" find for me, and I think other Yelpers should be as well.I feel like part of a new secret club after discovering this tasty little hot spot.  It's even spelled homous (not hummus), so you know you've hit the authentic homous jackpot here. (say it with me... hhhhhhooomuuuus)I went on a date here, he picked the place.   Bonus points to him!   If you do go on a date here, or if you generally want to speak to anyone after eating here, you may want to pack a toothbrush and mouthwash.  Hellooooo garlic!!!      Don't get me wrong, I love me some garlic, but consider yourself forewarned!!    That goodnight kiss could turn evil real quick, so if you want a second or third date, pack your breathmints!  =) We split a plate for 2 which was the beef, lamb and chicken.  We both thought we just ordered the beef and chicken, so the lamb was a little bonus.  And I'm glad, because the chicken and the lamb were definitely the best!   While the order says it's for 2 - it's actually probably a portion for 4 - 5 people.   We ate until full and then took two to-go boxes.  I ate it for lunch and dinner the next day.  I'm STILL oozing garlic from my pores. The saffron rice was delish.   Servers were non-invasive, but still attentive and friendly.  Loved the neighborhood vibe here - people walked in and were obviously regulars, there was a big birthday party going on, overall just a nice, relaxed vibe.  Great for a date or for families.Sincerely,Uninspired in PhoenixI've had Eden's Grill Bookmarked for a while now, seeing as I do enjoy a good gyros and today I happened to be just round the corner and hungry. I pulled up Yelp, went to my bookmarks, low and behold a nearby 4.5 star! I quickly decided, "That's where were going" and away we went. Now many of my reviews come from inspiration, something seems to catch my attention. Maybe it was the amazing house made ketchup, perhaps the superior service, or the cooked to perfection polenta. Inspiration sometimes comes also from a crude wait staff, under cooked chicken, or runny macaroni and cheese. Today, I find no inspiration and thus, this spot gets filed as Vanilla. Not quite one of my favorites, but an OK choice if it's easily accessible and no alternative choices to speak of.Upon arrival the wait staff seemed to be hours deep into a game of poker. Showing neither excitement nor distain to see me enter the dining room, they certainly had an amazing poker face. "Two?" she asked, then escorted us to one of the eight available tables in a dining room of ten tables. $7.95 for a gyros and (salad, fries, or rice) seemed like a square deal to me, so I ordered up a "gyros with a salad - and please, no onions or tomato." I knew I could break that poker face of her's; although, I didn't expect it to be in offense to me wanting no tomato on my food. It's rare I get asked "you want no tomato?... on your salad!?" with a sneering look of offence, as if my personal distain of tomatos somehow reflected poorly on her or the kitchen staff. Sadly, the salad; having fresh lettuce, cucumber, and a "barely there" amount of feta cheese - just enough to "call it out" on the menu as an included ingredient, was bland. Adding salt and pepper to a salad is never a sign of a good salad or dressing. Along comes the gyros, and tasty as it was, the gyros meat was sliced super thin - no problems if you like it that way though, and it was also topped with the onions I specifically requested to be omitted from my meal; I quickly picked those off myself.Maybe it was an off day, maybe it's just me be picky, maybe there were forces at work here that wanted my meal to be "pretty good, but uninspired", but this 4.5 star place seemed a little over stated, IMHO. It's possible I'll come back again, but hailing from central phoenix, it's rare I'm up this way, and more rare I'm up here and looking for something to eat.Happy Yelping Phoenix.This is a really nice Mom and Pop family owned restaurant with several Best of PHX awards. We have both been here several times and it is always really good. Mom does the cooking and her recipes are executed and seasoned to perfection.Located in a small strip mall next to the hardware store. This place is small but cozy and very simply decorated. They have an assortment of table sizes based on your group. The larger tables can easily accommodate those bigger family occasions.Normally come here for lunch and get one of the specials. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable. You can also request something off the dinner menu if you wish. This is a larger menu with items that are a little bit more fancy.My favorite so far is the Moroccan Chicken. She makes mine extra spicy and it is delicious. The Kebabs are also very good and the Salads are humongous. Mom's top secret Rice is so good that it just melts in your mouth. It is covered with toasted raisins and almonds and is at the top of my list to reproduce at home.Service is very friendly and helpful. You are always told to make yourself at home. They go out of there way to answer any of my questions or request.Food is always fresh and tasty and we always leave feeling full. Still have not had a chance to try out any of the many tasty desserts. Good reason to come back sooner than later. YUMMO!4.25 STARSI can't believe I've never stopped in here to have lunch before. This restaurant is family owned, laid back, and the owner personally serves you. But let's talk about the food. I ordered the chicken pita for $7.95 and when my friend told me the portion was generous- she was not kidding!  We shared the entree and there was still enough left over for me to take home for another meal!  The chicken breast cubed were tender and full of flavor. Look at the photos- you will not be disappointed by the food served here. And the lunch specials come with a side salad and a drink. All for $7.95!  I will definitely be back again. And again and again!  Hidden gem!!!Mom and I arrived to find EG bustling during lunch (it was around 1:15 pm).  There were around ten tables of different shapes and numbers of chairs.  Our server Noreen was amiable and eager.  She took our orders of water and left us to look at the menus.  I didn't find the lamb entree Mom mentioned, and when I asked Noreen about it, she said that while it was only on the dinner menu, she could get the kitchen to cook it.  Mom balked at the price ($18.95), so we stuck with the lunch menus.  She wanted to try the Gyros (#6), which came with "Mom's Rice with toasted raisins and almonds, grilled bell peppers, onions and tomatoes."  (No pic taken- sorry!)  The menu also mentioned that fries came with the order, but Mom's entree came without it.  I unfortunately did not know, or I would've asked Noreen about it.  I ordered the Chicken lunch combo, which was a chicken pita and choice of side (salad or fries) and beverage for $7.95, as well as Mom's Favorite Appetizer Platter ("tabula, falafal, and potato cake"), $13.95.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=brmcSOiLLJM3Girn0_3nXw#brmcSOiLLJM3Girn0_3nXwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=iP5cjNX1xAP9xQBZfa2RNQ#iP5cjNX1xAP9xQBZfa2RNQMom enjoyed her meal!  She ooh'ed and ahh'ed over the rice (which I tried in spite of a rice allergy, and yes it was good), as well as the pita that the lamb and beef slices were served on.  She preferred it over the standard pita that came with the appetizer plate.  When she mentioned to Noreen that her pita tasted better than the other pita we had on the table, Noreen kind of leaned in and said it was made in-house and that they cost a $1 a piece.  I asked Mom to break off a tiny piece, and sure enough, it felt different (thicker, more doughy, and a bit greasy) and tasted fresh from the fryer, making the store-bought pita seem like cardboard.  I didn't like the greasy aftertaste, though, but I did appreciate the flavor of butter in the beginning and the pita's textures.  I also enjoyed my chicken entree, which had juicy grilled chunks of chicken, strips of greens and tomato and onion slices (which I picked off before taking photos). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=1o5oZXbNdAK7_YNDihQ0Vw#1o5oZXbNdAK7_YNDihQ0Vw  The "white sauce" was a nice accompaniment, although the chicken didn't need it.  Mom and I split the side salad- it was good, although I found the dressing to be too tart.  I enjoyed- tremendously, I might add- the potato cakes that came in the appetizer plate... Wow!  Am I glad I spotted that Yelper's tip to order them!  They're basically button-shaped croquettes filled with seasoned and juicy ground beef.  Definitely a must-try!  I also enjoyed the falafel, even if they were a bit on the dry side, and a bit harder-to-the-touch than other falafel balls I've tried.  The sauce it came with was too bitter.  The tabula was too tart!  I could only bear about three small forkfuls before walking to where Noreen was, standing behind a counter, to tell her about it, and that perhaps the kitchen should taste it and understand what I mean.  She offered to replace it with "homous," and I took her up on it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=E5NYPbb9moOZyX2VMl9kpg#E5NYPbb9moOZyX2VMl9kpg  It had a pleasant mouth-feel, but again, I found it a bit sour.  Noreen later came back to say that the I was right- the tabula was very sour, that it needed more parsley, and to thanked me for letting them know.  Mom agreed with Su-Shien's review I read to her about size portions-- they were generous, and Mom likes generous servings, especially when they taste as good as her entree!  She wished she'd ask for more of the rice, instead of the homemade pita that we were sent home with, with an accompanying charge of $2.  I told her we could always go back for more...Last, but not least, we had some baklava, two pcs., $4.  Mom and I split one- it was perfect!  Loved the buttery, toasted, and flaky crust, and the rich, walnut filling.  It was so good that I could've eaten the second piece in a heartbeat, but also so satisfying that I didn't feel the need to overdo it.  A great way to end a good meal.I'd return back just to have more of those potato cakes! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=6RVy7cQMG8RVosc6PvM3fQ#6RVy7cQMG8RVosc6PvM3fQI've been coming here for quite awhile now and was surprised by my review of this place. I love the family owned business. The mom and the brother is in the back as cooks, the older sister is the owner, and the younger sister is the hostess and waitress. They are all from Iraq and their food is all from the Middle East. I've notice they've upgraded their place. Walls painted, nice new floor, with nice new table tops. They got rid of those gaudy pink table clothes. I really like their decor. A lot better than before. We always order the potato cakes. It comes with three in an order, garnished with cucumbers, and tomato slices with a yogurt dipping sauce. It's so good. It's crispy on the outside with a meat filling on the inside. Put some of that yogurt sauce on it then I'm in heaven. To die for. Really like it as you can tell. Me an my wife always order one dish and we split. It enough for two people. I could probably eat a whole dish but would be totally stuffed but sharing is perfect. Today we had the chicken and lamb kebab. It comes on a bed of rice with golden raisins and almond slivers with grilled vegetable which included green peppers, tomatoes, and onions. Lamb was so tender and chicken was so moist. Really good. Loved it. They used to give even bigger portions with about two or three scoops more of rice but their portions are just perfect. One thing is their prices stayed the same with smaller portions. Doesn't matter to me cause it's still enough for two. Just love the grilled lamb and chicken. We've had their deserts before but not tonight even though they have some of the best deserts. They said they used to own a bakery back east and bake a lot of their deserts so if you have a chance try their deserts. You won't be disappointed. So this place is small with about 10 to 12 tables. Very busy on the weekends. Great food and friendly service. Sometime they can get busy and sometimes come off as not being as friendly but the service is good. So trust me. I love this place and will for sure be back. Enjoy.
Serrano's Mexican Food=Serrano's is to Mexican food as Friday's is to American food.That is to say Beans and Rice are to French Fries as Corona is to Budweiser.What I mean is Chimichanga is to Cheeseburger as Salsa and Chips is to Bread and Butter.So you have Quesadilla to Pizza as Margarita to Cosmopolitan.In summary, Two stars is to restaurant ratings as Die Hard is to movies.  It'll get the job done but it won't be memorable or soon repeated.
Chicago Dogs=Just like the best places to get a Chicago dog IN Chicago, this spot is one part good food, one part hole-in-the-wall atmosphere, one part genuinely friendly service. They've got good prices too.The namesake dog is done right on the requisite sesame seed bun, get yourself more than one or upgrade the size. If you're not in the mood for that, grab a Philly- the small is sized just right for a solo diner, and the bread is sturdy and fresh. Add on a side of chili cheese fries (with liquid cheese, not shredded!), ask for white onions on top. If you really want to take it back old-school, get a pizza puff or a supreme tamale and let the flavors take you back to childhood.Bonus points for having Green River soda, Dusseldorf mustard, green relish, sport peppers, Giardiniera, and other treats to stock up on at home. Their daily $5-$6 meal deals are worth the trip, too.
America=Disclaimer Alert:  This review is just on their donuts, not the main restuarant. That being said, by the looks of their menu, there's an extensive line of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Prices look decent, especially since America is inside a casino.  We arrived around 7:30 AM and there wasn't much of a line.  So, I'm sure we'll be back one day for some real food. As for my review...it's all about their donuts. I tried their maple bar with chocolate drizzle and some of their cronuts.  The maple bar wasn't as good as it looks.  The donut wasn't fresh, it was lacking any flavor, and for about $3, way to expensive.  However, I think America's has some of best cronuts that I've had in Las Vegas. I have my favorite out there, but America had a unique taste to their's.  Their cronuts were layered with the outside of each layer having a crunchiness to them.  It was moist inside each layer and as you get closer to the center of this hybrid donut, it's even softer.  There's a uniquie citrus taste to these cronuts which appeals to me.  America may have bad maple bars, but sure made a huge comeback with delicious cronuts. PS:  Additional photos of America's cronuts can be found here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donut-crawl-ii-las-vegas?select=IWJfpUAAiQK3e4zSSwB2Wg#IWJfpUAAiQK3e4zSSwB2WgYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (057/366)We stopped here for breakfast one morning since we were staying at the New York, New York. The hubby got the all you can eat pancakes for $7.95. The first go around, they bring out a stack of three pancakes. After that, it comes in a stacks of twos. The hubby ate five pancakes in total. He said that the pancakes were light and fluffy.After reading so many articles about the famous croissant doughnut, I had to try it. This was the first time that I'd seen a Cronut in my life. It's truly the best pastry that I've had in a long time. Yes, it must be really bad for you and really fattening, but it's so good. It's hollow on the inside, which makes it light and airy. On the outside, it has a sugary glaze, and is flaky and crispy. It really doesn't get much better.I like the decor of this restaurant. While it's not fancy or sophisticated like fine dining, it's bright and clean. They have this piece of artwork that hangs from the ceiling. It's a map of the United States and has decorations of what each state is known for. Alaska and Hawaii is off to the side and have their own little section. At first when I didn't see Hawaii on the map, I was disappointed. I'm glad I looked over to the side and saw it.
MadHouse Coffee=With expresso running through my veins...I guess it would be an understatement to say that I am always in search of a good coffee shop to make my next destination.  A friend has been telling me to try this awesome place out...of the 5 mins i was in this place..I was terribly disappointed at the customer service they provided.   I ordered 3 shots of expresso with 3 pumps of toffee nut over ice.  Seeing the price of the triple shot (2.50 + flavor shots)...I questioned the girl helping me when she quoted Over 3.50...She told me that if i order this over ice...it costs more than if i ordered it hot. (#1 reason I didn't think it was right).  So i told her to just give me a cup of ice on the side.  She charged me $2.81.  i was fine with that... I got my drink and poured about 2 tablespoons of half/half in my espresso.  Then the owner came up to my table, and said that if i poured milk in my drink next time and poured it over ice, he'll have to charge me more.  (#2 reason i didn't appreciate this place) I was a bit confused so i asked for clarification about my drink and to my disbelief, he said the next time i came in his shop and ordered my three expresso shots with flavor shots, I'd need to pay for if I add a splash of milk to my drink since he has something on the menu like that. First of all, The amount of half/half i added was nothing amounting to the 80-90% of milk which goes into a latte (its was literally only a splash), I order the drink I wanted like any good customer would and used a bit of the condements (which i thought was free to customers who purchased something from the menu) on the side...and to have the owner come over and haggling me about it was unacceptable to me. Although there might have been a small difference in price (0.50), I didn't order the latte because it wasn't what i wanted.  He rudely made it a point to tell me that he'll be charging me for a drink i won't be ordering.    I was upset so i returned the drink to the girl who helped me and told her that although the expresso was good, I wasn't coming back.  Totally no sense of customer service...for a $0.50 difference...He lost must more since I won't be bringing them any business.   I recommend Saxbys in Henderson.  I live only 2 miles from this coffee shop and I drove over 30 minutes to visit madhouse coffee.  NEVER AGAIN.******   Update 8/18/2011*****************************8I honestly don't think the owner was trying to be a pest....in retrospect, he was trying to ensure that his place stays in business.  But a tip for a consumer would be, there are better ways to approach the situation.  It really isn't good business to charge someone more for ordering expresso over ice vs. Expresso hot.  Secondly,  I order what i order with coffee because I like the taste of it.  if there was a stipulation as to how i should order my drinks because management doesn't like it simply because he isn't able to weed a penny more from me, I just don't come back.  This only employs other coffee shops that don't do that.  I pay less, but in return, I give quite a bit of tip. :)It's a quite a figurative slap in the face when you support a company through purchasing the product often, promoting the company on websites such as yelp, and getting to know the staff and even establish a relationship with the owner and then get a BRUSH OFF that leaves you feeling snubbed, and worse - unappreciated.I get it.  The owner wants to enjoy his music.  The SAME music that was playing the previous night at the SAME very loud decibels.  I enjoy loud music - I WORK IN A CLUB!  That's fine!  NOT at a coffee house.  Everything I loved about this place - the relaxed atmosphere, the chill crowd, the great place to sketch client work and play my DS - gone.  I spent years giving my money to great drinks, sandwiches, and conversation with the overnight baristas.  Instead is pounding dubstep music, baristas who complain about the owner's repetitious music, and six dollar drinks.  Don't get me wrong - I will pay good money for great product that wants me there.  But after politely inquiring about the volume level being turned down and having a barista tell me no and the owner refusing to even look at me - I'm done.  It's not called entitlement - it's GOOD SERVICE.   I say hello to staff, order my drink, chat for a few minutes, and get to work, sometimes ordering a sandwich or snack.  Apparently, that's not enough to justify the music getting turned down.Add this to my previous visit when I was accused of owing the store MONEY when they confused me with another customer whose card didn't charge, making me wait for twenty minutes while the staff ran around calling individuals, then finally made me a drink and sent me on my way.  Incredibly frustrating.I'm frankly just disappointed in this establishment as this used to be a staple in my routine and I'm not returning anytime soon.  I'll give my money to Sambalatte or hell, the ItsAGrind down Durango.EDIT: Be sure to read the owner's response.  There was nothing polite or professional in response to my review, my opinion, labeled "crying."  Lowering the volume to music that I ENJOY is a little is a "dramatic change" that is selfish and self entitled.  Really?  Again, disappointing on all fronts.There's something off about a place if they try to charge you twice the price for a drink if you want it iced instead of hot - especially if it's a simple chai latte. In the end, I settled for a regular iced latte and it tasted like 95% milk and 5% coffee. Not so good.I bought a two drinks, which amounted to 1 hour of wifi (why isn't wifi free in the first place?) and the cashier insisted that I could only get the 30 minute wifi code. What even.I only tried this place out because so many people told me it was amazing. I really don't see it. The only thing I like is that it's open 24/7 and has a nice vibe to it. However, the whole drink ordeal and the customer service put me off - the employees only really talked to the people they already knew and the cashier was the opposite of friendly. I really wanted to like this place but I just can't. Maybe if I were a smoker I would appreciate the expansive outdoor patio more, but I couldn't even take advantage of that feature.Bumping this up to two stars because my friend got tea that tasted decent. If I ever go back, I'd probably stick to the tea.If you have money to waste on mediocre food & service ..this is the spot for you.My husband and I were invited by friends back in November 2012. At first we really enjoyed it, then started noticing unprofessional attitude by the owner, such as alcohol on the breath, and shouting at the staff in front of patrons. The owner's claims that former patrons just "hung out" without purchasing anything is erroneous and inflammatory; furthermore, these patrons are personally responsible for bringing in many new customers.I fully expect to have the owner remove this negative review; that is his prerogative. However, just know this...word gets around Marco.This joint packs tons of character in such a small space. With art covering the walls and a quirky type of jazz coming out of the speakers, the atmosphere is simultaneously fun and mellow with friendly baristas to match. Small groups will find it more spacious outside on the patio, but there are a few tables inside. Solo sippers have more freedom with all the counters and barstools along the walls. If you don't intend to get cozy, MadHouse also has a drive-thru; if you do, it's open all day and all night.Their sizes have normal names! A medium blended drink comes in a 24-ounce cup, the equivalent of a Starbucks venti in size, but its contents are full of creativity and taste. Their grasshopper is a subtly minty mocha combination. I like their crushed coconut mocha, but have much more of their menu to try. I've only indulged in their blended drinks, but their brewed coffees and sandwiches tempt me every time! If you want to use their internet, let them know when you order and you'll receive a one-time use code. The time limit is based on how much you spend (e.g. $4-7 = one hour of WiFi, $10+ = four hours), so the more you pay, the longer your WiFi privileges stay. I haven't settled on a favorite drink yet, but I've discovered my new perch.Yelp 100 Challenge * 100/100 Madhouse coffee is located less than a mile away from where I live and I can't believe I have kept myself away from this Hippie, San Francisco-esque coffee shop for so long!Late Thursday afternoon and pretty tired out from schoolwork, I came here for a More Cowbell sandwich treat - roast beef folded into a slice of herb infused focaccia bread and topped with cheddar, lettuce and tomatoes - and a Nutella white chocolate frappe. As if they weren't filling enough, I made an effort to take myself out of study mode to appreciate the cool artworks around the cafe and random funny deets on the cashier. That fed my artsy soul pretty well and I came out of there physically and spiritually refreshed. For $10 or more spent, you get a wifi code. There's a patio out for peeps in need of a smoke and did I say this cafe is open 24 hours? Coming here to study again soon and get things done!Items selected:Croissant Bread PuddingWhite Chocolate Raspberry MacaronAlmond CroissantNutellamisuAmericanoWith 9 on the Plate not yet serving up sweets and myself running low on caffeine it was to MadHouse Coffee that I walked after dinner and always hoping to find a new, local coffee shop to love and support I'll simply say that save for the kitschy décor and 24-hour service there isn't a whole lot to like about MadHouse at all.  Locally owned and operated with a menu of drinks both classic and novel plus a collection of "pastries baked fresh on the premises" it with a simple Americano that my experience began and faring well enough at a mere $2.50 it was onward to pastry that I moved, the promise of '100% Charent Butter' ostensibly promising the quality of Echire but not a single item better than average, with one in particular an early contender for worst thing I'll eat in 2014.  Starting first with a $3.24 Almond Croissant it would be hard to imagine something more doughy and less crisp coming from 7-Eleven and moving right along to a $2.50 White Chocolate Raspberry Macaron with decent crackle yielding gummy crumb and sweet 'frosting' of a non-descript flavor I sat and wondered exactly what was going on; a brief reprieve found in admirable, albeit microwave-heated bread pudding drizzled in light caramel.  At this point sitting with half a macaron and 2/3 of the croissant unfinished it was last, and certainly least that I moved to the 'nutellamisu" and while certainly not the prettiest presentation nothing could have prepared me for the taste - an acrid, sour, and questionably spoiled cream cheese 'pudding' debauchery of the Italian classic that tasted nothing of Nutella or Tiramisu, a second bite of the $3.95 cup yielding similar results and landing it plus the remaining pastries in the trash as I left the store thankful I'd not yet finished my coffee so as to cleanse my palate.So, we're leaving lunch when the coffee craving hits me and I pull up Yelp to find MadHouse Coffee. The whole way there, I'm thinking I have been here before, and not until we pulled up did I realize we came here a few years back when it was It's A Grind. From what I remember, it's definitely changed. It's a fairly small spot and even though it's a little hipsterish, I dig the art on the walls and some of the quirky little knick-knacks lining the counter.The menu here is pretty big and naturally, the first thing that caught my eye was the mention of Nutella in multiple items. They've got quite a few unique items too like mocha frappes in Cake Batter, Red Velvet and my pick, the Monkey Mocha, which is peanut butter and banana. While both the peanut butter and banana flavor were really good in the drink, it was a way too watered down for me. The wifey had the Cake Batter Mocha and it was so insanely sweet, I don't even know how she drank it. I also got what they call the Nutellamisu and wasn't a huge fan. It didn't taste anything like Nutella and I think it may have been old. It was ok, but the taste just wasn't right and the ladyfinger portion of it was super soggy.My biggest reasoning for the two stars is the employees. Whenever I go somewhere that has an open kitchen or whatever you call it in a coffee shop, I tend to watch what everyone's doing. Not because I want to nitpick, but because I'm legitimately interested and intrigued by what goes on back there. So, as I'm sitting there watching the two people back there work, I notice the girl keeps eating food behind the counter. And she kept doing that thing where when you eat something crumbly, you're almost putting your fingers in your mouth to catch it. Well, after she does that...she goes right to making something else and touching other food that was for a customer in the drive thru. Coupled with their not so friendly attitudes, it seemed weird and gross to me that she's back there eating, but not washing her hands. It was enough for me not to want to try anything else on the menu, including the sandwiches, which looked pretty good too by the way.Prices aren't terrible, but they aren't great either. A medium blended drink will set you back about $6, which made our total bill just under $18 with two mochas and the Nutellamisu. For me, there was very little to like here and unless I was in the area at some weird hour craving coffee, I probably won't be coming back.We ordered two drinks and two sandwiches. I really like that they offer Almond Milk, but dislike that it is an additional $1 extra. (That is outrageous!) I ordered the Green Card (Turkey, guacamole & minus the bacon for me), and the bf ordered The Very Charming Pig (Ham, Swiss, Cream Cheese and Bacon) I ordered mine with no bread and he ordered his on Focaccia. His Focaccia had an upcharge vs the ciabatta, which would have probably been fine, if it wasn't for mine being the same price as normal without either bread. I get a little frustrated at these restaurants up charging for every thing, just because they know people prefer it. I'm sure we'll be back to try it again, but probably just the coffee side. Neither of us was overly enthusiastic about the food. Although I do like that they are open 24/7. I even noticed they were open on Christmas. Although I felt bad for the girl holding a sign out to inform everyone they were open Christmas morning.I'm MAD ABOUT YOU...you know who you are.  I'm also mad about this coffee spot.  I thank Antonia and Renzo for introducing me to this place.  Very hip Urban vibe with a fair amount of indoor seating and plenty of outdoor setting.  Love the decor!  The art on the walls that were made by local artists, kinda Urban hipster...very cool.  I've noticed plenty of locals come here to chill.  Being 24/7 makes it more inviting, and par for a city that never sleeps.  Madhouse has a great selection of goodies such as hot/cold coffee drinks(including the water drip cold brew), sandwiches, and various desserts(made in house), even macaroons. They also have Hookah to Relax you while you get Jolted from your coffee...hmm            One Vegas scorching summer day (is there any other?), when I first laid eyes on you, I mean Madhouse.  You know, Vegas=my ### is on fire=something COLD to drink.  I chose the NUTTELA WHITE CHOCOLATE MOCHA.  Later finding out it was a local favorite.  I can taste why...outstanding drink...an absolute must try!   I also had the LOONEY TUNA, which I wasn't too crazy mad about.  It was good, just not great.  Didn't taste the red apples, almonds, and for sure couldn't tell what 'few secret ingredients' they're talking about on the menu item description.  I like my tuna very looney, creamy with a lot of flavor and texture. The CROISSANT BREAD PUDDING was a tiny bit dry, but good.  I like my puddings tender and moist to the touch, yet firm enough to keep its shape.  Now I know why I'm mad about you.            What a great coffee house!  From a Yelp bookmark(never been, but looks good), to a regular(looking forward to going again)...already have 2 under my belt.
Elephant Bar Restaurant=Lest some readers of this review think that I've suddenly lost my touch or perspective, I can only say in my defense that I have seen the woefully low overall Yelp rating for this establishment and read many of the low-rated reviews, but must nevertheless ignore them and honestly report on my recent trip to the Elephant Bar.   I don't know whether I had an atypical dining experience, or if Elephant Bar staff took heed to recited complaints and improved their food and service, or if other reviewers just encountered a bad day there, but my overall experience was enjoyable, and all dishes I sampled were tasty.  I began with very good Macau Shrimp Noodle Soup, sporting mushrooms, green onions, white onions, bok choy, and fairly large shrimp in a lightly spicy broth.  It was an unusual and interesting Asian-flavored dish.  For my entree, I selected Chicken Marsala, which included a nicely grilled chicken breast, pappardelle noodles, and a mild traditional Marsala Sauce, accompanied by a good cooked tomato half and sauteed spinach.  It was a filling and satisfying display.For dessert, what turned out to be a very big order of Strawberry Shortcake tasted good but I could have done without the thin Strawberry Sauce.  I also tried a friend's Creme Brulee, and it was very good.Service was friendly and on the whole very efficient.  Food and drink orders were correctly fulfilled.  But entrees arrived a little early after appetizers and soup.  And, on the initial bill the server had forgotten to credit Senior Explorer card discounts.  This oversight was quickly corrected.  Judging by this one personal encounter with the Elephant Bar situated in Henderson, and several previous good dining outcomes I have experienced at Elephant Bar restaurants throughout Southern California, I expect to return here fairly soon for other fare, like the tantalizing Chicken Lettuce Wraps with glistening moist bits of chicken, diced water chestnuts, unblemished green shells of lettuce, and peanut sauce that one of my tablemates simply was not willing to share.  Boo!  Hiss!The Elephant Bar is a place that I visit when other people make the choice to eat here.  It's in Henderson and popular with the work friends because we just head over after the work whistle blows.  I came here for dinner recently and as is usual for me, I searched their menu online beforehand to see if there was nutrition info available and there was.  I decided that I would either go with their chicken lettuce wraps or the petite sirloin, based on calories and protein content.  They happen to have a gluten-free menu as well as a "lighter" menu, which I appreciate.  Once there, my friends and I had great service from our waiter the whole time.  I went with the petite sirloin, which came with vegetables and a parmesan baked potato for only 450 calories and 36 g of protein--right up my alley.  It was a tasty meal and I was more than impressed with it since I didn't know if it was going to be good or not.  This is only the second time I've been here in maybe a year.  Between them, my friends had the mongolian beef and the shrimp and crab louie salad, with the mongolian beef looking like something I'd try the next time.  The pals also had a coupon for free strawberry shortcake with the purchase of two entrees and I had a sample taste of that:  delicious!  The bill came to $43, without the dessert being charged--not bad at all for three people.  Overall, this place has a lot of options on its menu, enough to satisfy everyone's palates and dietary needs.  I hear the happy hour is great, so I'll have to return and check that out sometime.Happy hour? Let's go to the Elephant Bar!  Located in the District directly next to the GVR, it's easy to find.  There is plenty of parking in this area.  I usually have better luck parking in the back for easy access to the restaurant.I've had good visits the majority of the time I have dined here.  They have great happy hour specials in the bar area.  The food has been great and pretty consistent.  The french onion sliders are fabulous.  Simple and Wonderful! The nachos are plentiful and great to share.  The buffalo chicken wontons are just ok to me.  I'd stick to the sliders and nachos for happy hour.  Their market cobb salad entree is delicious.  The chicken has a great seasoning which makes this salad yummy.  The service here for us has been hit and miss.   Sometimes my drink is empty for a while.   I've noticed on a few occasions during happy hour the bartenders are more interested in talking to each other than their customers.  Hmmm.  But mostly they have been good and attentive.It's a chain restaurant but it's one of those that I enjoy!We came on a Sunday evening and ordered 1. 2 Mango Swirls, 4.50ea2. Artichoke dip and chips 3. Kona BBQ ribs 4. Crispy shrimp and white rice for $37 (Used the 2 for $20 coupon that I received in the mail) - Seated right away. Hostess was pleasant. - Dining area very clean. Comfortable seating - Server was very nice. - We ordered one Mango Swirl, but she instead gave us 2. Didn't really feel like disputing since the drink was so delicious. haha. - Artichoke dip was average. Needs more artichoke. Not enough chips. We asked the server that handed our food for more chips and she said okay, but never came back with them. fail. Wasted dip. - Kona BBQ was exquisite. Loved how tender it was. Needs a bit more BBQ sauce. Not finger-licking enough. The meal also came with peach cobbler, fries, and cole slaw. - There was a mix of potato and sweet potato fries. Not fresh, but not old. Could be better. - Shrimp and rice was good. Reminded me of Pei Wei. Rice a bit harder than normal. Needs more water or change it to 3 ladies. haha. - Portion was enough for the dine. No extra. - Pleasant meal. Great location. Will come back with coupons. Rewards membership available.Came here for a quick bite with Cesar Q.  and some work peeps.  The ambiance at this restaurant/bar is great!  Love the safari theme.  The staff wears pretty cool safari type shirts with denim bottoms.We were greeted at the door and promptly seated in the back just off the kitchen.  There were 5 of us and apparently this was the only place for us!?  Whatever our food got to us quicker I suppose.We were lucky that there was someone in training so we had 2 servers.  We were asked what we wanted to drink and quite quickly we got our beverages.  Placed our order with ease.  The servers did a good job.I ordered a dinner salad and baked potato as my entree.  The salad was fine, nothing special.  My stuffed baked potato was good but the outside had been burnt with crispy black spots on it.  Such a let down.  We spilt one tortilla soup and I can say it was really quite good.  I'm not overly impressed by this place.  It's pretty ordinary something like an Applebee's type place.  Everything appeared to be pre measured.Would only come back if I have to because of work or drinks.
Qdoba Mexican Grill=Once upon a time, there were Q'doba restaurants all over the place.  Now, you have to look for them....it's like an Easter Egg Hunt trying to find one.  Luckily, the Yelp app on my iPhone found one relatively nearby.  I made the trek to seek out their Queso Steak Burrito, which is one of my favorites.  I think they put crack in their Queso Sauce.....that's the only explanation I have for wanting to drive a ways to grab something from this joint.It didn't take long for me to finish the Queso Steak Burrito and a Side of Chips.  The Chips were *bleh*, but the Burrito was awesome.  I'll definitely be back.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ePxLE7eU4kRoags_ytAAg?select=vA0CDhsc27IY9r2zUjBUXAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ePxLE7eU4kRoags_ytAAg?select=aopb2citCn_x0UF-KeMI2AReturn Factor - 90%
Owen's Bagel & Deli=I really wish that I could make this my go to bagel shop...but as the saying goes, 3 strikes and you're out. Prior to todays visit I would give Owens a solid 3 stars. They're Bagels are nothing to rave about...but they do have a pretty funky/unique space and they do offer tons of sandwich options. Personally, I don't really care for all these crazy sandwich combinations. I just want a GOOD bagel with some cream cheese...maybe an egg sandwich. I'm pretty sure if you take two pieces of card board, load it up with the grubby bubby or booty bagel options, or add avocado, tomato. etc - it's going to be tasty. If that's what people are into, that's cool. I'm more about the actual bagel, ya know? I've been eating Bagels all my life up in NY and I can honestly say that I was spoiled with the amount of great options that I had up there. And yes I get it, this is Charlotte -- Not NY. Now I'm not a professional, but I'm pretty sure this place skips out on one crucial step of the bagel making process - the poaching step. I do understand that boiling equipment is super expensive and also takes up lots of space. I'm pretty sure that they just brush their bagels with some water and a little baking soda (similar to what you would do with a soft pretzel) and then hit them with steam once they're in the oven. It's easy to identify an imposter by looking at the bottom of the bagel since steam wont get to the bottom of the bagel once its on a pan or in the oven.  LESSON OF THE DAY: If the bottom is much harder and darker than the rest of the bagel, you're eating a roll with a hole, not a bagel my friend! The bagels here almost remind me of one of those Thomas' bagels from the super market. But anyways, enough about the bagels.Today's experience brought them down to a 2 star rating - I ordered a bacon egg & cheese (with salt, pepper, ketchup) to go and I got a small coffee - My bill was  $8.39. The word "pricey" doesn't usually come out of my mouth....but I walked out of the store thinking to myself..."dear god, did I just pay almost $9 for a bagel & small coffee?"I get to my office, sit down and go to enjoy my sandwich, which for that price should have been wrapped in gold foil. Slowly, disappointment began sinking in (insert worlds saddest song on worlds smallest violin here**)1) My sandwich was pretty small - hey, it is what it is. I wouldn't complain about it being small if it at least tasted delicious and the order didn't get screwed up. 2) The eggs reminded me of dunkin donut egg sandwiches - you know, those premade egg patties that get nuked in the microwave. 3) Lastly, they left out the salt, pepper & ketchup!!! The SPP is crucial on my egg sandwiches! BEC with salt, pepper, ketchup...doesn't seem like a difficult order. Anyways,I'm happy that most people on here have had a great experiences here... I wish I could feel the same way. Long story LONGGGGG, It's safe to say that I won't be coming back to Owens. As I mentioned earlier, I really wish I could make my go to spot since they are around the corner from where I live...but it does look like I'll have to take a 10min drive elsewhere when I'm in the mood for bagels -- (wont name drop other businesses as I don't like to do that).Hey.  You.  Owen's is terrible.  Don't go there.Not buying it, huh?  Well... I guess we couldn't keep it a secret forever. Owen's is hands down the best specialty bagel sandwich shop in Charlotte.  Listen, that's a big statement from me.  My family has been in the bagel business for over 50 years.  We owned one of the first bagel shops in New York and LA before Brueggar's and Einstein's came in and demolished everyone.  You want a good bagel in Charlotte?  Owen's or Poppy's.  That's it.All you need to know is if you can dream it, Owen's can do it.Fan Favorites:* Grubby Bubby* Booty Bagel on BlueberryPersonal Favorite:* Bagel, Egg and Chive Cream Cheese (add salt and pepper) on Everything.Other Important Notes:Dogs are welcome, but not preferred inside the actual bagel shop.  You can write on the walls.  If you're going with two people, best to each get your own sandwhich and then share a Booty Bagel for dessert (Yes, I most certainly believe in breakfast dessert).My only wish is that they had better coffee.  But for how good the bagels are, I'll drink it.Cheers to the fat kids!
Zoozacrackers Deli=Went here this afternoon because ever since I've heard that Wynn has added vegan options to his menus, I've been dying to try the vegan matzo ball soup. Walked up to the counter with a friend and asked for the vegan menu, which is just three items but the soup was the only one I was interested in. My friend was also curious so she ordered it as well, and I also got a side of fries. We chose our seats and waited. The soup was brought out about 15 minutes later (the cashier mentioned there would be a wait) in huge bowls on square plates. It was definitely the perfect amount of soup especially for the semi-high price tag of $6.95. It was essentially three medium-sized matzo balls, vegetable broth with small bits of carrot and celery. The vegetables were nice and crunchy, not soft and overcooked. The matzo balls were really good and held their shape well, they didn't fall apart easily. The fries I got were salty and crunchy and very good, but kind of a small portion. The soup tasted very good, it had a little bit of a tangy kick and my friend (a non-vegan) and I loved it and would definitely come back again to order it. Very tasty and a nice meal that just satiates you perfectly. A little pricey, but totally worth it!We came here during our recent stay at the Wynn for some late night dessert. They had these huge slices of cake in the display cases, so we figured between the four of us, we could easily polish one off. Now, when I saw huge, I am talking seven layers of cake and seven layers of frosting. Huge.At $11.95 a slice, it was a little pricey. Because there were so many of us, we justified that it would have been more if we had purchased individual items on our own. So we went with it.Upon ordering, we were greeted by a fellow named Dylan who was less than helpful. When we asked him questions about the menu, he just shook his head or muttered yes or no. Whatever. My friend asked for a glass of water, he ignored her. She asked again after the transaction, and he slammed it in front of her. Maybe it was us. Nope- the next group of people weren't from the US and were having a some trouble communicating their order. Did Dylan help? Nope. They asked a question about a sandwich and he just pointed to the menu and said, "whatever's up there, is on it." Thanks guy- I'm sure that helped.Now, only Dylan was less than pleasant. The other lady (who I interacted with while getting some drinks), Denise, was super friendly and helpful. She greeted people at the register, asked if we were having fun and thanked us for coming. Complete difference.Now, I did take off a star for service (was going to take off more, but Denise was the saving factor)- but the rest of the stars were taken off because of how bad the cake was. We went with the Strawberry Shortcake version that was made with strawberries and white cake. The cake seriously tasted like it had be sitting in the fridge uncovered for quite some time or next to a macaroni salad. It definitely didn't taste like sweet cake- but something that should accompany a salad. I think it was sitting for too long next to too many different ingredients. It acted like a sponge for all the other flavors. Gross.I guess the cakes in the display case are just for looks- such a bummer that something so beautiful tasted so rancid. For being the Wynn, I expected their standards to be a little higher in food and customer service.Overpriced (duhhh...it's the Wynn) deli. All the usual suspects in deli-style sandwiches, for around $12 each (fries/side not included).The gem here is the vegan burger! For $9 you basically get a vegan Happy Meal: a little gardein "cheese"burger that tastes/looks just like those little McDonald's burgers, a side of French fries, and a little chocolate shake. It's a filling meal, and alllll vegan....which is great for me, because I looooove me some milkshakes, but my inability to digest lactose normally makes them an ugly proposition!!!It's not really gourmet foodie-food....but it's solidly good, for being vegan -- and the price is great. I will probably have this again!I could never pronounce the name of this place. I don't even know what the f*ck a Zoozacracker is! I always thought Zoozacracker sounded like a racist remark people would use in Queens or the Bronx or something. I've probably come here once every year for the last 4 years. I wrote a review about this place about a year ago but the filter ate it, claiming I was a worker here. Finally wanted to figure out what a Zoozacracker is, so I googled it. Found no information. Decided to break the words apart. We all know what a cracker is, but what the f*ck is a Zooza? Well, according to google a Zooza is some dude who provides an individual legal proof that they are the owner of a horse..or something like that. Still, I have no f*cking clue what that is supposed to mean! Combining Zooza(Horse licensure litigation specialist guy) with Cracker(Saltine Square), doesn't make a shred of sense. But, nothing does here. The interior design looks like either a David Lynch movie, or the room where Debbie Harry starts rapping in the 1981 mtv music video, "Rapture". I know "irony" is the big thing these days, but I don't f*cking like irony. It sucks. The interior design can ironically f*ck off!They got this burger that they pack with coleslaw, thousand island, and swiss cheese. It's not bad. It's extremely messy though. The Rueben is also pretty good, but I don't think there is one New Yorker alive that would say it can compare to Carnegie, Weiss, or Greenberg Deli(all here in LV/Henderson). The first time I ever came here was with my poker buddy in 2009. We had accumulated about $15 of comps. The bill came out to like $17 and the lady at the counter waived the extra $2. They had excellent customer service back then. Came back a few months later but this time they made us pay the balance. Of course they charge for every little thing. I've been to kosher delis that would charge for a side of thousand island for my New York Sky High, so I'm not surprised. Actually, I won't be surprised if they start charging for the water and the pickles soon.The first time I decided to eat here, I asked multiple Wynn workers the question: "Where is Zoozacrackers located?" None of them knew the answer. Most of them didn't know what the f*ck I was talking about. One guy even told me that Zoozacrackers was located at Koval and Flamingo.... When I finally found the place, I couldn't get in because in front of the entrance was Antonio Tarver. He was piss drunk and having an argument with some chick who was dressed like a stripper. Typical day in Las Vegas.....I had been eyeing this place for a while because I heard the pastrami and corned beef was good here. Wrong! Maybe it used to be? First, they have no signs posted showing where this place is. They have the usual signs saying which way to go for what, but nothing for Zoozacrackers Deli. I finally looked up the number for Wynn and called to ask. I explained that I was standing in the casino and needed help finding this place! The woman who answered was polite and guided me to the correct place. Zoozacrackers Deli is attached to the sports book. The music being played is so loud that hubby and I had to yell at each other to have a conversation.I walked up to the line that was somewhat long, but it moved fast. The woman who took our order was very friendly. Priced at $12.79 I ordered the "1/2 Deli Sandwich & Soup Combo" and because I wanted a Reuben it was $2 extra. I wanted to try their lemonade, but not at $5.50 a glass with no refills! The sodas are $3.79 each and you get free refills. The food took a while to come out, but when it did I couldn't wait to try it.Reuben Sandwich - This was just flat out gross. All I could taste was swiss cheese and grease. The corned beef had no flavor. It looked good at first until I started to eat it and noticed the meat changes from a good color to fatty parts and gray colored parts. It just didn't look or taste like quality corned beef and the grease was all over my hands. The sandwich is supposed to come with sauerkraut yet it was in a small dish on the side of the sandwich. What the heck? Why wouldn't they have just put it on the sandwich to begin with since I didn't ask for it to be left off or anything? Weird. Also what is up with the size of this sandwich? I know I ordered the half sandwich, but when you have places like Greenberg's and Carnegie in town putting out the type of sandwiches they are, I can't see why anyone is coming here. Where's the beef?!?!?! I felt sick in my stomach from the grease and right after leaving ended up feeling sick through the night. No good.Tomato Bisque - Size on this is great. The taste is blah. I expect more from a place inside the Wynn and was surprised at how dusty and dirty this place was. I did see a lady going around sweeping the floor, but a rag on the surrounding stuff would be awesome. Our total was $38.76 for 1 sandwich, 1 half sandwich, 1 bowl of soup and 2 sodas.  With other places that put out a much tastier sandwich and portion and the fact that I got sick and felt the price for what I got wasn't good, I wont be back.Zoozacrackers Deli inside the Wynn was the most feasible option for a dinner date before catching Le Reve because we only had 45 minutes to spare and Zoozacrackers is just a stone's throw away from the Wynn theater. WYNN BURGER ($11): The entire meal is vegan. Literally the exact same menu option is offered at Society Cafe inside Encore for the same price, but with poorer presentation here (plastic cups instead of glass, etc.). This meal is the cheapest option on the menu because it comes with a chocolate milk shake and fries. Everything else on the menu is served a la carte. I asked for lettuce on my burger and they obliged. I happen to like the chocolate shake but my husband begged to differ. Smh. 3/5PRO TIP: If you're going to order the Wynn burger, walk on over to Society Cafe for a way better experience!ZOOZA BURGER ($15.49): Expensive for a burger, but my better half gave it his approval. It's pretty gigantic too, so at least you're getting your moneys worth. 4/5FRIES ($3.99): Taste like Burger King fries (not necessarily a bad thing). 3/5VIBE: Upscale Denny's minus the servers + counter service for ordering. I was surprised at how slammed this place was on a Sunday night at 9PM. It's connected to the Sportsbook.  SERVICE: It was near impossible to catch one of the servers for a refill. The option to go up to the registers and ask a cashier for a refill is an option but they were so busy tending to the never ending line of customers we didn't want to bother them. The Deli is pretty much self-serve. Worth a Return Visit?Our grand total came to $37 and some change. I'm not planning on coming back, but if you're in a rush or are trying to keep your dining costs at a minimum while you're at the Wynn, Zoozacrackers Deli will do.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #105Zoozacrackers is one of the less expensive options inside Wynn Las Vegas. They offer deli counter service. Sandwiches, burgers, salads and soups. You order at the counter and they bring your food and drinks to your table. Free refills are offered and the food is decent. One of the better deals to be had in this otherwise upscale resort.
Sen of Japan=We were in search of an authentic sushi bar where they serve high  quality fresh omasake menu owned by a Japanese sushi chef but knew that none would exist on the vegas strip.  After all, Vegas isn't exactly known for sushi.  I found Sen of Japan on Yelp and noticed their high rating from 60 reviewers and voted as the best sushi restaurant in Vegas by Zagat.   Well, worth the try!!  This place is around 10 minutes away from the Vegas strip.  We sat on the sushi bar and ordered the Omakase.  Our sushi chef's name was Sunny.  I would have to give him 5 stars for excellent service.  He was very attentive and worked quickly to serve not just our dinner but also the orders he had to full fill from other customers.   The sashimi were all nicely plated and were topped with different garish on each fish.  The layout of every dish was so pretty but the taste was even better.  I loved the way they prepared the rice where it was perfectly moist and wet.  Some places gives you a glob of dry rice that ruins the whole experience.  Omasake was $55-$85 per person depending on how much you wanted to eat.  I was full when I reached the $55 mark.  After the last toro fish, I felt content.  LA offers higher quality sushi places but for being Vegas, it was good enough for me to rate them at least 4 stars.  If I were in Vegas again, I'd come back here. If you're sick of all those typical hotel buffets, go try Sen of Japan.  I don't recommend ANY sushi restaurant on the strip.  Those are catered to non asian customers who don't know the difference between sushi or sashimi and are content with previously  frozen fish.I used to go to Sen of Japan all the time when it first opened, but hadn't been in quite some time because it isn't very close to my house and it's only open for dinner. I've recently been twice, however, and am happy to report the food is as good as ever.Both times I had the Black Cod Soy, because going to Sen of Japan and not getting the Black Cod Soy is like going to Italy and not getting pasta. It's a buttery piece of fish with a caramelized, but not overpowering, sweet exterior. Each bite melts in your mouth it may be the best piece of fish you've ever tasted. The pickled shoot that adorns it is also fantastic and offers a complementary acidic element ($13.75, add $9 to top it with fois gras).Besides the cod, I sampled a few other old favorites, the home-made Japanese Pickles and the Mushroom Salad. The pickles are made from yamagobo (similar to a carrot), turnip, Japanese yam, cabbage, and something reminiscent of a caper berry. Each piece has a slightly different flavor and texture, but all offer a colorful, crunchy start to the meal ($8.50). The mushroom salad consists of a warm mound of gently sauteed mushrooms, including enoki and wood ear. It has a heavy dose of yuzu that makes it taste bright, and a bit tart ($7.75).The sashimi is of the caliber of Raku, but here you can have rice with your fish at the full service sushi bar. The spicy yellowtail hand roll ($4.80) is bursting with flavor and filling, but a new favorite is the Sashimi Combination Salad with Garlic Vinaigrette ($12.95). Impecably fresh slices of normally mundane varieties, including tuna and salmon, are arranged around a pile of delicate Japanese greens topped with finely shredded radish. A light dose of garlic vinaigrette and sprinkling of capers complete the masterpiece.Another surprise favorite was the fried calamari with onion (around $9). Tender strips of squid are paired with onion slices then beer battered and toped with slices of jalapeno. These taste like onion rings of the upscale variety.The sukiyki was the only thing I wouldn't order again, but that's probably because I'm partial to preparing my own sukiyaki at Swish (review to come later). Overall, however, Sen of Japan is a place you should try at least once, even if it might be a little inconvenient to get to.After much debate, and lots of help from great Las Vegas Yelpers, we decided to dine at Sen of Japan last night.  This was my second visit, so I thought it was best to dine with the Omakase menu.John was our waiter, ask for him when you go.  He is knowledgable and just a genuinely nice person.  The national championship game was on the tv behind the bar, so I had everything I needed for a great meal.We opted for the $85 Omakase, which was 7 courses:Kanpachi sashimi with Oysters - Like Butta!  Smooth and succulent, the kanpachi was served with a dash of ponzu, fried garlic chip, and micro greens.  The oyster was served with a garlic slaw of sorts.  The oyster was flavorful and light, and a great way to start the meal.Sashimi Salad w/ spinach and micro greens - Tender and delicious cuts of salmon, tuna, and red snapper nestled around a bed of spinach and micro greens with a light vinaigrette.   This dish was fine, but forgettable.  The sashimi was cut very small, which affected the presentation a little bit, but the flavors and quality still shined through.Fried Fish Eggroll - This wasn't an egg roll at all, but I am lost for words to name it.  This was various fish, not sure what wrapped in a shiso leaf and fried topped with tobiko.  A little dry and my least favorite bite of the night, but it was very creative.Baked Black Cod in a soy sauce topped with foie gras and a shiso pepper - Best dish all night.  The cod was perfectly cooked to retain some moisture and finished in a light soy sauce.  The foie on top made the fish even more decedant.  The chef nailed this one, it was an evolution of flavors with each bite, and I wanted more.Filet in mustard ginger sauce - Cooked closer to medium than medium rare, this dish was executed well.  Nice amounts of salt and the right amount of mustard, let the beef shine through instead of other flavors.  Various nigiri - Tuna, Salmon, Kanpachi, Ebi, Snapper.  All delicious and perfect.  I didn't even use soy sauce with these, it just felt wrong since the fish was of such high integrity.Dessert - Chocolate souflee with homemade green tea ice cream - Great soufle, the chocolate oozed out as my fork pierced the fluffy cake.  The green tea ice cream was made with matcha and complimented the bitterweet chocolate in the soufle wonderfully.  I was so full at this point two bites was all I could handle.Sen of Japan is close to being perfect.  It provides great individualized service, superior quality product, and creative execution.I really don't like giving out 1-star reviews, but I have to be honest. I did not enjoy my SoJ experience. In fact, I was frustrated. The sushi itself was pretty good. We went during happy hour (currently 10:30pm-1:30am Mon-Sat), so the prices were great. Unfortunately, to put it lightly, the service was lacking. I'm too frustrated to bother with details. I hesitated even writing this review in the first place. The bottom line for me is that there are plenty of sushi places in Vegas with good to great sushi and good to great service. I don't need to return. Luckily for SoJ, they have enough of a following (100+ reviews) that my lowly 1-star won't affect their stellar average at all.I don't get it.Sen has 4 1/2 stars with over 100 reviews.  It's Michelin rated.  What it doesn't have is food to match.  Our party of five was eager to try what was purportedly one of the best sushi restaurants in town.  We drove all the way from Hendo - in rush hour traffic - just to eat here.  On the way, we decided that we should do the omakase and let the chef put his best foot forward.  Here's what was served:1.  Yellowtail with peppers and garlic chip - the presentation was wonderful, but the flavors were overpowering.  The ponzu was too strong for such a subtle fish.  The addition of garlic and a spicy habanero (or jalapeno?) just kills any chance you can taste the fish, let alone feel the texture of it while your mouth burns.  2.  Mizuna salad with salmon, tuna and albacore - This would have been a nice dish, had it come before the spice of the yellowtail.  In fact, this is how good, fresh fish should be served: with very little detraction.  As an individual dish, however, I'd rather just have thick cuts of sashimi instead of thin cuts of fish with a salad on the side.  3.  Soy Miso Block Cod - really good execution of one of my favorites.  Only downside was that I didn't have a bowl of rice to go with it.  By itself, it was supremely tasty and buttery.4.  Fliet Mignon tataki - this was good and tender, but lost in sauce.  Fliet has zero flavor profile, so covering it with any sauce really just makes the meat a sauce delivery vehicle.  Chalk it up to personal preference. Also a personal preference: I would really have liked it to be medium RARE rather than medium well.  5.  Miso soup with clams - delicious.  This was the highlight of the meal.  The combination of clams and miso just hit the rights notes or flavor and smell.  Really good stuff.  I could have just had a couple bowls of this with miso cod and called it a night.6.  Nigiri - The fish looked and tasted fresh, but the texture of the salmon was slightly mushy.  The rice was really good, with just the right about of koshi that makes me happy.  +1 for the rice.7.  Chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream - I love green tea ice cream and this didn't disappoint.  The souffle, however, was another matter.  It was hard and nowhere near as fluffy or light as it should be.  IMHO, if you offer it on your menu, you need to execute it well or don't bother.Being hungry after all that, we ordered two additional rolls:8.  #24 (Shrimp tempura with tuna on top with pineapple wasabi) - This is one of my least favorite rolls...ever.  The sushi itself probably was good, but the sauce killed any chance me wanting to take another bite.  It was too sweet and too much of it all over the roll.  9.  #25 California roll with soft shell crab - this one at once pretty good and also fairly standard.  I'd probably choose this if I didn't know what else to try.I liked this place, but it's a tough sell at 4 stars.  Out of 9 items, only 2 stood out as things I would make it a point to order again.  I've read the reviews.  I've heard the raves.  I finally tried Sen.  I just don't get what the fuss is all about.I have a rule of thumb when it comes to passing final judgement on an Indian restaurant: the quality of food should be based on their a la carte dinner entrees rather than their buffet since the drop-off between the two can often be quite steep.  I believe there is a Japanese restaurant corollary in that one should judge the quality of food based on their omakase (tasting menu designated by the chef) rather than their a la carte menu items.  Of course, there is usually a hike in price in both cases but sometimes you pay for what you get, and what you get here for omakase is definitely money well spent.One would never guess that tucked away in SW suburbia lies a restaurant opened by Hiro Nakano, the former head chef of Nobu (Hard Rock Casino) and was listed in the 2009 Michelin guide.  I met up with some work colleagues and since my boss was treating the group, we decided to indulge in the $55 omakase experience (an $85 option was available, but one should not test the limits of generosity when being treated to a complimentary meal by your superior).  Probably the most interesting question I have ever encountered when deciding on the omakase was being prompted by the server as to how many times I have had the omakase specifically at their restaurant.  Apparently the chef likes to vary the dishes so as to create a different experience for the diner much like a video game character advancing to higher levels of play!  Apparently the variations can go up to "level 5" and possibly beyond so I found this to be a ingenious incentive to return for repeat tasting adventures.  A couple members of our party were second-timers so it was cool to get a preview as to what I would be expecting after my first omakase here.  I'm sure the chef would be more than willing to mix and match specific items since the theme to this idea is thoughtfulness towards the customer.Items I could recollect along with occasional sidenotes with regard to the level 2 menu.1) Hawaiian yellowtail marinated with yuzu soy:  unctuous and refreshing with bright notes of citrus from the yuzu, very nice start to the meal (level 2 was japanese red snapper)2) Sashimi salad- delicate slices of assorted fish mixed with shredded daikon and greens in a subtle onion vinaigrette--very clean flavors3) Miso Black cod with grilled shishito pepper- perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the fish pretty much melts in your mouth and goes well with a nice salty crunch from the pepper (I think in the $85 omakase, this dish is accompanied with grilled fois gras....talk about umami overload!)4)  Sliced filet mignon served with grilled asparagus-  found this one to be slightly underwhelming since while being cooked medium rare, was a bit under-seasoned and would have liked some asian flavors to be incorporated (the second-timers received a similar cut but was topped with a spicy chili sauce so I'm thinking that version was tastier)5) Miso soup with wakame (firm seaweed) and mini button mushrooms-  the cute little mushrooms are not only tasty but also provide an artistic glow to the otherwise cloudy earth-tone broth. 6) Nigiri assortment- fairly standard with a couple tuna sushi rolls, one regular shrimp and mackerel nigiri, and pairs of salmon and tuna nigiri....nothing mind-blowing, but helps to fill you up with the added load of rice.7) Chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream-  nice way to round out the meal.  Souffle could have been more fluffy, but definitely a unexpectedly pleasant flavor combination with the green tea ice cream...I got a chance to taste the almond frangipane cake with pineapple sorbet in the second timers dessert course and that was equally exquisite.I'm thinking I may have omitted one more sashimi course, but as one can see, this is quite a spread for $55 and I definitely did not go home hungry.  Folks residing in this part of town should definitely take advantage of having such a fine dining option nearby and for those trekking from across town, definitely a nice introduction to omakase at a reasonable price with opportunities to "level-up" with subsequent visits.  Be sure to also take advantage of their excellent sake selection.The Skinny: so-so sushi and incorrectly cut sashimi (2.5) service is shamelessly trying to upcharge you and ignore you when you don't feel like playing along(1) value: given the fact that I've been to Korean sushi joints that served similar product, their outrageous prices do not match the quality of the food. (2)My hubs and I came here about 2 years ago to sample their Valentine's Day omakase. Although there did appear to be a lot of cooked items, the quality of the food was enough to make us contemplate coming here again last week.We arrived with a friend for some good eats but were disappointed on many levels.First of all, the service is highly lacking. Our waitress had the annoying habit of always trying to get us to order more expensive items on the menu. No, we do not want a miniscule bowl of edamame you want to charge $4.50 for when I can get a massive bag of it for less than $2. No, we do not want to order alcoholic drinks. No, we don't want any of your appetizers.After we kept politely declining her suggestions, she pretty much ignored us until she wanted to us to clear the bill. Which was frustrating because she didn't even bring out a bowl of rice that came with our meager meals. Not to mention that they removed our small plates when our food came out. Let me tell you, it feels totally ghetto eating out of their massive sashimi bowl because you are likely to drip soy sauce on the other pieces of fish. Not cool. Not zen. All ghetto. Sorry, but it had to be said.Enough about the shoddy service. More on the food.Our friend and I ordered the Sashimi Special Combination ($29.95) while the hubby got the Shin's Special Plate ($19.95).For $19.95, the only special about Shin's Special Plate is how epic a rip it is. Although beautifully presented, the fish texturally, lack the firmness of really fresh product. The size of the fish on the nigri was also on the thinner side. Although the seasoning of the various fish was varied, the pairing of flavors were only okay in my books. Nothing terribly innovative. And for 7 pieces of nigri, it is very expensive.The sashimi special combination (sashimi plate, bowl of rice, miso soup) for $29.95 is also very expensive for what it was. The thin slices, the small portion size left me very disappointed. Top it off with fish that wasn't the finest quality (I went on a Thursday - no excuses!), I cannot recommend this dish to anyone.Overall, it's disappointing because there are very few decent sushi joints in town. But between the shoddy service, the lackluster fish quality and the skimpy portions, this place gets a 2 star.Let me begin by saying that I liked this restaurant's design and rolls I had were actually quite good.  Although I was at the sushi bar, the waitress who served drinks and edamame was actually fantastic.Why only 2 stars then?  Funny you should ask.While sitting at the sushi bar watching one of the chef's prepare someone else's nigiri, I happened to catch him proceed to throw the fish down on the preparation surface to flatten it a couple times, and then some error in trajectory resulted in the 3rd throw landing on the floor in front of him.  He picked it up, washed it off in the sink, looked right at me, and then laid it neatly across a rice ball.  It went onto a plate with several others and off to a table it went.  Call me crazy, but there is no 5 second rule in restaurants!  Washing it off doesn't change that rule!So, a few minutes later, while conversing with my dinner partner, the same chef, who appeared to be more tenured or the ranking official behind the sushi bar, called out to the waitress behind us and scolded her abruptly about a customer waiting for a to-go order.  She happened to be directly behind me and not only was it rude and inappropriate to do so in front of customers, but it totally stopped our dinner conversation dead in it's tracks.  She responded that it was being taken care of and went about her business.  I think I just sat there with a dumbfounded look on my face.Sufficed to say, there are many excellent sushi choices in Las Vegas.  I prefer one that takes values sanitary practices in preparation of the food and where the staff is a little more pleasant to one another.This will likely be my first and last visit to this establishment.Wow this place is ridiculously amazing. Stumbled upon this little gem last night and wasn't expecting much. I'm very picky when it comes to Sushi and this place blew me away. First off the service was impeccable. Everyone knew English and our waters were always kept full. Also when we were through with a plate it was taken away immediately. My cousin and I shared 3 rolls. Spicy Salmon, Spicy Yellowtail and one that had caramelized onions on the top infant remember the name but it was Delish! You could also tell the ingredients were very fresh. Located on the corner of Desert Inn & Durango it's very assessable. I suggest this place very highly to anyone looking for outstanding service and fresh sushi.Sometimes places leave you speechless and it is okay. Sometimes you don't need to drone on and on about how good the food is. Sen of Japan leaves that almost perfect impression on me and it is hard to put it into words. Starting out with the Hawaiian style edamame is a must. So is the mixed seafood cucumber salad. From that point, it only got better. All of the nigiri was fresh, a generous slice, but could have held back on the dressing. At points, the rice was falling apart due to how much sauce was on some of the pieces. My friends that I had dined with had prefaced that Sen's miso black cod rivals that of Nobu's. I had to get it and for $14, it is a steal. The steak with the sweet soy based sauce was freaking fantastic. Dragging the meat through it to dab on my rice was not enough. I should have been as smart as my dining partner and just tipped the plate over my rice. You need to save room for the chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream. It is magnificent. The nice crunch from the shell to the gooey center pairs so well with the homemade ice cream. I died so many times throughout the meal.I cannot complain about one thing that hit our table. I call that a win with around eight different fishes, a few appetizers, a couple of entrees, and two desserts.Sen of Japan is a neighborhood gem! If you are lucky enough to live or pass by this area often you have to stop into Sen. You'll become a regular for sure. The quality of the fish that you will find here is outstanding. The food is also prepared very well. I've never walked out of this place unsatisfied.The ambiance of the restaurant is somewhat romantic...the lighting is dim and the music puts you at ease...perfect to where you can hear the other party but not have to constantly be conversing to avoid awkward silences. My favorite item on the menu is the Black Cod Miso with Foie Gras. The dish is just delicious! The sauce is so addicting!!! Sweet but not too sweet where it overpowers the fish...I found myself dragging the last piece all over the plate to make sure that I had every last drop. Their desserts are also amazing. They serve Bubbies mochi icecream which is a popular brand that comes from Hawaii !! Their chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream is a must try for those who love chocolate!! The souffle is made to order and served hot fresh out of the oven. Out server always suggests this to us while we are ordering our main dishes so they they could get a head start.  It is perfectly gooey and lava like on the inside and crisp on the outside like a delicious souffle should be.They also had a wide variety of Sake to choose from if you enjoy that with your meal. Overall the service is fantastic. The food is impeccable. Sen of Japan just does it right. *****1030-130 happy hour!!!Located on the westside way up by Desert Inn and Durango Sen of Japan is cool find. The restaurant is big with plenty of room but with minimal decor and hard chairs.We ordered two of the Omakase $52 and some sushi items. The Omakese was good except for the generic fish that came with the sushi course. The last course of molten chocolate cake was excellent.
Jackrabbit Supper Club=I love going out. One definition of an extrovert that I heard recently is that your batteries are recharged by being around other people. You don't need alone time. That's pretty much me. The idea that I just need to chill out and be by myself is a totally foreign concept. But I've heard enough people talk about it that it must be real. So that said, you would think I would love this place. It offers the most Jack-rasses Scottsdale has to offer per square foot. Last time I was there, which was very recently, I played some crazy human tetris to get back to the bar to pay my tab. I bumped into 84 pairs of fake boobs, which is not really a complaint, 500 asses, of which only 321 were women, and I pretty much was sweating like a seagull on fire on the 4th of July, which ruined my perfectly coifed and excessively huge hair. I paid $20 to get in. I said "Twenty. Fucking. Dollars." You should have seen the look on the face of the money-taker. Apparently, she thought it was totally reasonable. $50 for 5 drinks. I didn't cuss at the bartender. Now, it's not all bad. The burlesque dancers' asses are sublime. A true delight. Coconut creme pie for my eyes. Some super hot girl kept staring me down. I would have talked to her if not for the music that requires screaming over and the fact that it would have taken me 20 minutes to get to her and she probably would have been gone and the women I was there with probably would not have appreciated it. And the music wasn't bad. That said, do your wallet, your senses, your sense of space, your intelligence, and your friends a favor and go somewhere else.
Double Wide Grill=My dad and I stopped in here on a Tuesday night for dinner a few weeks ago, and we both felt this place was just ok.  There was nothing wrong with the food when we ate it, but it was about $50 for two of us with a tip.  Too steep for non-memorable food.I ordered a shrimp burrito ($12) that was ok.  The amount of shrimp was decent for the price, but it was just beans, rice, and shrimp.  My dad ordered a burger that was also fine.  We then ordered 2 slices of cake.  A chocolate cake, that was supposed to be super chocolate-y, was flavorless.  The red velvet was slightly better, but at $6.95/slice, neither was worth it.  My dad ordered a beer that was ok, but overall, most of the food was something you could make at home.I wouldn't come back here except for the Vegan options, which bumps this place up to a 3 star rating.
Red Robin Gourmet Burgers=I haven't been to Red Robin for a really long time and we decided to give it a try tonight. I guess I would describe this place as a family friendly burger joint. A lot different from Paradise Valley Burger Company, Hop Doddy, and Zin Burger. All are gourmet burgers but RR is a family friendly with lots of bright colors, always kids and I guess reasonable prices. Our server was pretty good in greeting us, getting our drinks, and taking our order. Not bad. I ordered the Smoke & Pepper Burger. Nice thick juicy burger with bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, pickles with a nice BBQ ketchup. Not bad. I thought that it was pretty good with a little kick to it. Also, comes with steak fries. They give you a little bit of fries but then again they have bottomless fries. You just have to ask for more. My wife ordered the fish & chips. It came with four good sized pieces of fish. And nice portion of steak fries. The fish was moist and tender. Tasted pretty good and filled my wife. As for my son, he ordered the Whiskey River BBQ chicken salad. Chicken and avocado in the salad over a BBQ salad dressing. He had to ask for more BBQ dressing but he loved it. Ate it all. So must have been good cause he such a picky eater. So good food, decent service (not great but not bad either cause I had to ask for refills), and a very interesting ambiance. It's very loud. Not super fun but family loud atmosphere. Young and old. So I enjoyed it. Like I said if your looking for a different atmosphere from the other burger joints then this is the place for you. Plus it looks like they have good desserts even though I didn't try them. Enjoy.I'm usually down for Red Robin as I love a good burger, but my recent visit to this location had me running for the door.Red Robin is great spot for some pretty decent burgers and chicken sandwiches. The bright colors and décor scream family friendly and they definitely go out of their way to please young children. (The TV in the floor is cool touch) On an average visit you will hear their rendition of the birthday song several times. Fortunately, there is a full bar and good happy hour for the grown-ups. It had been a while since the last time I was here so I convinced some friends to check it out around lunch time. We were promptly seated by the host and greeted by our server, little did we know that this was going to be the last time we saw her. I decided to get my usual, the peppercorn burger and onion rings to share. After we made our selections, we waited for our server to return... and waited and waited and waited.About ~20minutes later one of the bussers came over looking confused and asked if someone had helped us. He acted like we had just taken menus from the front and just sat down randomly. Soon after a new server appeared, for whatever reason she seemed annoyed that we were there; as if we had done something wrong. For whatever reason our food came out in waves; after the onion rings I was the first to get my food. We were expecting the other two dishes to come our soon but they took almost 30 minutes. My friend who ordered the bruschetta chicken sandwich was brought out the fish and chips instead, I have no idea who they mixed that up. They brought out her correct order later but our other friend and I were long finished with our food. My request for an additional serving of the "bottomless fries" also seemed to have been quickly forgotten as well. Not sure what we did to deserve the neglect but it sucked.
Mexi-Casa=I've lived in Dormont for 3 years and have never hit this place up. Why? Well, there's absolutely no good reason! I love Mexican food too, so this means there's been a lot of missed opportunities to eat tacos. While I feel like there's always a great debate about what's "authentic" Mexican food, I always feel like I can't chime in. I know that there are taco's I like, and taco's I don't like. A lot of it for me has to do with flavor. So my knowledge isn't on what's "authentic" but what is tasty to me. I had the taco platter where you're able to choose from a plethora of different meats. Sadly, this did not include the "new" fish tacos, which I was bummed about. I went with the spicy chicken, pulled pork and portobello mushroom. They come dressed with lettuce, cheese and onion, in a flour tortilla (you can also get a hardshell). While the mushroom was a little blah, the spicy chicken and pulled pork were awesome. What made them awesome was the meats, of course. They were seasoned fantastically and cooked perfectly. I kept saying over and over how good they were. I also had a side of guacamole and salsa. The salsa is more of a pico de gallo, but I dig that kind. I also thought the gauc was very good. Plus, they have a whole wall FULL of hot sauces you can choose from. I'm literally in sauce heaven here!Their beer list is small, but they have some good drafts, like the Pumpking. I mean, there's nothing like a taco and Pumpking... I kid, I kid. I also kept going back to the drink menu and looking at this Apple Pie cocktail made with moonshine. You're only allowed to order 2 per person, assumably so you don't run down the street naked or something. I threw caution to the wind and ordered one. It was delicious and not once did I taste any kind of alcohol. You definitely could end up in the danger zone. Glad I stuck to one. The service was incredibly friendly and I'm excited to make this my new go to Mexican joint in Dormont!
Loco Patron=I want to give this place two stars. It deserves two stars, HOWEVER, I have decided on 3 for the sheer fact of the sale of cheap tacos and cheap beer. I will be first to say that I strongly dislike the semi-douchey scene of Loco Patron, but what can one expect when they're in an OTSCO bar that is frequented by barely legal drinkers? So I set my thirty year old snobbery aside and went for some cheap tacos. When I walked in to what I thought was a restaurant, I was carded! WTF? There was a 7 year old kid munching on his taco, watching my carding go down. We locked eyes for a moment while the bouncer flashed his light on my ID, I think the child was mocking me. I was wondering why he was allowed in. Oh well. After that puzzling moment, I met the gang. While the conversation at the table was rousing, I couldn't help but notice the coke-ho dancing without any rhythm or to the music that was in her head at the bar in front of us. She was really working it too! I tore my eyes away from the train wreck to peruse the simple menu. I ordered off of the regular menu to get some shrimp tacos. They were pretty flavorful! I was rather surprised. I also ordered a steak taco off of the "Taco Tuesday" menu to try. Again, another pretty good, flavorful taco! The rice and beans were just alright. Nothing too amazing. I guess my overall impression is that Loco Patron is a great place to meet some friends if you're broke on a Tuesday and you're hungry and want a beer or two! I wouldn't rush back to visit this joint, but it would do in a pinch.
Kincaid's Classic American Dining=Happy Hour review:I was skimming through Christine O's review and elated to see "happy hour every day from 4pm-6pm and reverse happy hour from 9pm-close....all appetizers are half off and mojitos, house chardonnay/cabernet, and all beers on tap are only $3"  Thinking to myself that it sounded great and the rest of the reviews were awesome I decided to try it out this weekend. The plan was to meet my girlfriend there about 4:00, but after traffic from the game and the roads being tore up from the light rail we arrived about 5:15.. Parking was ok but finding the actual restaurant was a little confusing, point being if you've never been here before allow yourself some extra time.. The appetizers were excellent, they normally range from $8-$27, and at 50% off you can't beat the price so we indulged. We tried the teriyaki tenderloin (served with ginger and rice), the blue cheese and bacon chips that was drizzled in chipotle cream sauce and the scallop lollipops. The portions were generous and I can't wait to go back and try the calamari and the artichoke crab dip. Wash that down with $3 mojitos and you have yourself a very happy -  happy hour!I already really liked Kincaid's as a fancier dinner option, but thanks to Sunny B (who went to check out their happy hour based on the information I saw on the door when I was there for dinner), I tried their happy hour, and I was impressed enough to bump this place up to 5 stars. There is a list of 10 or so appetizers that are pulled from the regular menu, and all are 50% off during happy hour. Drink specials (mojitos, margaritas, draft beers, house chardonnay/cabernet) are actually $4 now, but that's still damn cheap! It's also worth noting that even outside of happy hour, they have a short bar menu that is much cheaper than their normal fare. We had five appetizers (macadamia-nut encrusted Brie w/ sliced house bread, fried calamari, sweet potato fries, teriyaki tenderloins w/ rice, and Kobe meatloaf sliders), one margarita, and two glasses of wine, and our total cheack was $38.50! That would be a sweet deal even if the appetizers weren't good, but all of them were excellent and quite filling. We essentially got a full dinner, which always makes for a successful happy hour!Our server, Jennifer, was also super courteous and attentive. She was available when we needed her but didn't rush us either. We also really appreciated when she offered me a second glass of wine "at happy hour price" even though it was basically 6 pm already. If you live anywhere near the Collier Center (corner of 2nd Street and Washington), work downtown, or have friends that work downtown, you will want to check this place out for happy hour. We couldn't believe how empty Kincaid's was, despite offering these crazy and wonderful happy hour deals, but I'd like to believe that after this review, it won't be! Check it out - you won't be disappointed.The entrance to the parking garage is on the southwest corner of Washington. Pay attention, people. This is important. Yeah, I know - it looks like it's on 3rd Street, but it's not. That's a service entrance. The actual entrance is the one that looks like an exit. But it's not just an exit - it's the entrance. My first pass I drove right by it thinking it was the exit and the entrance must have been on 3rd Street and had to go around the block. But it was 5 o'clock. And there was a Suns game. Fuck the Suns. Took me 20 minutes to go around the fucking block. So my second pass I turned left on 3rd Street. And 3rd Street's a one-way going south so I couldn't just turn around. Another 20 minutes around the block. Third pass I was so pissed it was my third pass I wasn't paying attention and thought 3rd Street was 4th Street and drove right by it again. Fucking shit, man. Why is there no 4th Street? What the fuck happened to 4th Street? Jesus Christ. Who built this fucking city? Burn them. Find them and fucking burn them. Are you paying attention? Pay attention, people. This is important. I don't want this to happen to you. I care about you. Well, most of you. Some of you, anyway. Whatever. The entrance to the parking garage is on the southwest corner of Washington.The food's okay. Little pricy. Cool presentation. I'll upload a pic of our app later when I've had some time to cool off. Make sure you go with someone you that makes you smile, that's what made it for me. Sorry for all the fucks.What a midweek treat. Georgie S and I met here after work on Wednesday to enjoy their happy hour special: $4 beer and a few select cocktails. I had arrived a bit early so I dove face-first into a pomegranate margarita. Nice, good, but a bit too sour for my tastes; nevertheless I don't regret trying it. Afterwards I moved to my trusted BFF Guinness. :doe eye: The appetizers are half off, which was a treat since they aren't exactly cheap. But, it's not your typical happy hour fare. This is high class/high class, like let you meet mama and introduce you to papa. After laboriously narrowing our choices down to one a piece, Georgie and I decided on the teriyaki tenderloin and grilled jumbo scallop lollipops. Both were melt-in-your-mouth good. We both had two beers and our bill was around $35. However Christina P received a $20 gift card. She wasn't able to use it before it expired so gave it to Robert M. He is out of town on business this week so he gave it to Georgie. As the card was being redeemed, it was showing there was no balance on it; had someone snarkily used the balance of the card and passed it along? Hork, imagine the possible hours of dramady! But, alas, the card turned out to be valid so, with tip, our evening was $11 each (with tip) for a fine afternoon.
Smallman Street Deli=I came here for dinner tonight with CM and a few of his friends.  One of them organized the dinner and chose Smallman St. Deli due to its proximity to the Manor Theatre, since several of them were planning to see Avengers there afterward.  Although CM and I didn't see the movie, I was excited to try the deli since I'd heard good things, and had been favorably impressed by a catered sandwich from there.Everyone in our group ordered different things, with some people opting for breakfast foods, and others opting for sandwiches.  Since I like to try whatever a restaurant is known for on my first visit, and I don't eat beef, I ordered a turkey Rachel ($10.99).  CM opted for a Yellowfin tuna sandwich ($8.99), and we also split an order of pasta salad ($2.99).  The Reuben came on toasted Rye bread, and was stuffed with a generous quantity of turkey and cole slaw, which was of the creamier variety.  It was pretty good, but I was hoping for bolder flavors--then again, to be fair, turkey isn't known as a particularly flavorful meat.  Also, pieces of the cole slaw kept falling out as I ate the sandwich, which is one of my pet peeves--I like a sandwich that sticks together!  CM's sandwich surprised him a bit, since he was expecting fried fish, but it was filled with tuna salad; however, he didn't mind, since he hadn't had tuna in awhile.  He ordered his sandwich on pumpernickel with all the fixings, and came to regret the latter decision since the fillings, like the cole slaw, had a tendency to fall out as he ate, and he didn't want as many banana peppers as he was given.  Although I didn't ask anyone else directly how they liked their food, judging from the speed with which they ate their meals, I think it's safe to say that they liked them.  :-)At the time of our visit (5:30pm on Fri.), the deli was pretty empty.  We hoped to take advantage of the pleasant weather by sitting on the open porch, but the doors were locked, and none of the employees could find (or wanted to bother finding) the keys.  Service was pretty efficient, given the size of our group--we received our sandwiches about 10 min. after ordering.  I felt that the prices were a tad high, but then again, the quality is better than at other delis I've tried, so I can't complain too much.  Overall, we enjoyed our visit to Smallman St. Deli, and would definitely return--I'd love to try the desserts some time, since I've heard they they're delicious!
Famous Dave's=The wife and I used to frequent the SanTan location often, when we lived in Mesa. We always had great service, and the place was always clean.However, after moving to to the N. Phx area we tried this location, as it was the nearest.We were in for a shock, it was a completely different experience.We were seated fairly quick, and immediately noticed that the BBQ sauce assortment looked as it had not been cleaned in years. Every one of the containers had crusty discolored sauce caked on the tips. It was disgusting, but since we don't eat the sauces we were willing to overlook that.The table was not clean, it had obviously gotten the two second wipe down. This is unacceptable at a BBQ place where most food is messy.So, the food. I can't comment on this as we were never served, or even waited on.We sat in our booth for a solid 10-15 minutes watching several of the wait staff walk by us, look at us, and do nothing.The most annoying part were the seaters. They had 3-4 seaters huddled around the little podium, and one (the tall/larger one) kept looking at us. It was obvious she knew what was going on. Other tables around us even noticed we had not been waited on. None of the seaters bothered to do anything. There was no manager in sight either.We got up, and proceeded to the door, when the taller seater woman blurts out "Leaving Already?"I turned and said "We have been waiting for 15 minutes, and have not even seen a waitress." She kinda gave a "whatever" look and said "Have a great day!"So, after frequenting the SanTan location and receiving nothing but great service and a clean place to eat, we are NOT going back to the Peoria location. We drove ~10 miles to get there, and had to take our money elsewhere because they couldn't be bothered to serve us. We frequent places we like, and get good service. We eat out nearly every night as we both have busy careers and don't like to cook. Famous Daves Peoria lost out on "regular" customers, and we will not recommend them to any of our co-workers, or friends.Had a family get-together in Vegas and we were all craving some BBQ. Whipped out my handy iPhone Yelp app and sure enough, I was directed to Famous Dave's. (This app has been so fricken useful in so many ways! ) I ordered a rack of their famous ribs, some corn bread...well actually that's a lie. All 16 of us ordered 4 All American Feasts, which comes with some amazingness; Brisket, Beans, Coleslaw, Ribs, a Whole Chicken, Potatoes, 2 corn on the cobs and... I think that's it. Nonetheless, I was in heaven. Nom nom nommm. The end.I still had $12 on my gift gard so I stopped by and grabbed a BURGER on the way home since this week I had already tried all the BBQ.It was a tough choice but I went for the Devil's Spit Bacon Burger!No Suprise! It was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. Cooked to perfection medium well with a nice layer of bbq sauce cooked into it Topped with a toasted bun & cheese,crispy bacon,lettuce,tomato and crunchy Hell-Fire pickles.I don't think I took 1 breath until this thing was GONE!I can't wait to go back for another! Maybe they need a drive-thru? What is the BEST Chain Restaurant Burger you've ever had?Red Robin vs TGI Fridays vs Famous Dave'sI'm gonna check more thoroughly.So it is hard to decide for me what I wanted especially at a BBQ spot. I wanted to try everything since I don't know the next time I'd be back. I had some of they larger platters with a sampling of a few items which was corn, ribs, chicken, cole slaw, bread, corn bread muffins, fries and brisket.  As much as I tried every sauce, it was hard to pick one I truly liked but I seemed to stick with the sweet and sassy. I wasn't a fan of the sauce as much as I was the meat. it definitely hit the spot and sent me immediately home to go to sleep. I also like the interior set up with hunting gear.
N9NE Steakhouse=2 WordsBone-in Ribeye 2 More wordsTruffle Fries2 last wordsThe Steak and FriesOk, so that's 4 words, but it's really only about that Ribeye and the fries.  I never knew a Bone-in Ribeye existed till I ate at N9NE. It was like something out of the flintstones, HUGE and DEEELICIOUS. I couldn't  finish it. I was definitely full from the appetizers. We had a cold shellfish platter, fresh and amazing. They have wonderful seafood at a  steakhouse. But my favorite thing was the truffle fries.  I'm not a huge fan of fries but these fries could be an accompaniment to my death row meal. Everyone knows this place is modern, sleek and sexy.  It adds to the dining experience.  If you don't want to go for a long drawn out dinner, opt for the bar and have one of their specialty cocktails and an order of truffle fries. If you opt for dinner, the Bone-in Ribeye is the way to go. *Special shout out to Andy & Tiff for taking us out to an incredible dinner.If I were God and I was faced with the task of writing Heaven's menu, I would draw a significant amount of my inspiration from the folks over at N9NE. Most restaurants, like most people, have an area of weakness. In my two visits to N9NE, I have yet to find theirs. Everything is good. The scallops are fantastic, the lobster mac and cheese is... well, lobster mac and cheese, the cocktail list is inventive, and, while you'll be hard pressed to find less than stellar service anywhere in Vegas, that at N9NE is a step above the rest. Food, service, cocktails, ambiance... N9NE is the complete 5 star package.The best of the best? The surf in turf is stacked (cited from the bottom up): mashed potatoes, a mouth watering filet, and de-shelled lobster, which is then topped with a truffle cream sauce. Yea.If I were to dare speak a bad word about N9NE, it would only be that as rich and heavy as the food here is it doesn't always make for the best "party till the sun comes up in my barely there Vegas-only attire" precursor. After dinner in both of my experiences I felt a lot more like going and trying out the plush hotel beds you pay an arm and a leg for and never use than I did raging. In an effort to keep the party going, I suggest a round of espresso cocktail shots for the table.Prices are steep. Luckily money and calories aren't an object in my heaven.If you enjoy eating at pretentious, overpriced, lackluster steakhouses, then N9NE is perfect for you.  If you're a sensible person who enjoys good food and getting value for money, stay away from N9NE.The appetizers were boring and unoriginal, comparable in quality to most sports bars or your average Applebees.  The steak was well overcooked, and I find it hard to believe that even if it were cooked properly, it wouldn't be any better from a filet you can buy from any grocery store and cook yourself (I should note here that I had their signature "world famous" filet - or whatever self-indulgent tagline they were using to describe it that particular night).  The decor of this place must be funded by the Massengill company, because it reeks of douche.  There is a big difference between trying to be modern, trendy, and chique, and trying too hard and falling on your face.  Maybe if they focused more energy on the food versus trendy mood lighting, this review would be different.  The only good thing that came out of my visit to N9NE was our waiter, I only hope that he's taken his talents to a restaurant worthy of him.This is the worst meal I've ever had at any fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas, period.This may come as a surprise, but I am a mere mortal. Being a mortal (even if just barely), I do have my weaknesses. One such weakness would be a well prepared steak. I have set upon a mission to slowly but surely try all of the amazing steakhouses this town has to offer. My next box to check off was the absurdly spelled, but well reviewed, N9NE Steakhouse at the Palms. If you don't enjoy reading, I'll give you the conclusion off the bat. This place is pretty bomb! It's definitely worth checking out. However, as is the case with a lot of good steakhouses, it isn't cheap. But it's well worth it. I started with the Fried Chicken Won Tons. They are pretty awesome. You get like 6 or 7 crispy Won Tons on a long plate over a little bit of blue cheese with a nice hot sauce on the side for dipping. It was a great starter. They also have like 3 kinds of bread, I tried the pretzel bread which was great, I also sampled a delicious soft foccacia bread. Then I ordered the massive, aged Bone-In Ribeye. It was cooked perfectly and was nice and juicy. For sides, I opted for the Mac and Cheese and the Gnocchi. My god, these sides did their absolute best to outshine that magnificent cut of meat. The Mac and Cheese was so rich and creamy. The cheese was a perfect blend of creamy, cheesy, richness. A nice complement to the rest of the meal. But honestly, as unexpected as it was, the Gnocchi stole the show. It is a potato gnocchi in the most incredible truffle cream sauce. Each tiny bite just melts in your mouth. Just thinking about it as I write this review a day later almost brings tears to my eyes. I have some left over in the fridge and I think I'm about to reheat it when I'm done here. It's side dishes like this that could make N9NE appeal to everyone, even those kooky vegetarians I've been reading about on the internet. Not sure if there are any Vegan dishes, but this place is friendly enough that they probably can accommodate.I saw the dessert menu and there seemed to be some amazing options. But I couldn't fit another bite of anything in my already stuffed, yet thoroughly satisfied stomach. This is a mission for next time.So you know the food was outrageous, but how was the service at a place that seems like it could easily be a typical pretentious Vegas establishment, with a nice decor and celebrities coming in daily? It was actually phenomenal. The bartenders are super personable and talented. I'm bad with names but I believe it was Anna and Kerry. The manager Christian was also very friendly and accommodating. In closing, this place checks off every aspect that I feel makes a great restaurant. If it was a little cheaper, I'd probably eat here every day. That's probably for the best though. I can't wait for my next visit, there's much more on the menu that I have to try. And obviously the Gnocchi Round 2.When finding out I was moving back the the Vegas, in no way did I think of going to The Palms...for ANYTHING. Well, maybe a Ditch Friday...and GBDC...and the Pearl...and the diner rueben... OK, fine. I would've been at The Palms. But I didn't see a 5-star meal coming from here. Enter N9NE.  Through the grapevine (yelp) I heard about this $65 AYCD 5-course prix fixe and since I had a date to impress, to N9NE we went! On a Monday at 6:45 the place was nearly empty. It's an odd looking spot. A giganto bar in the middle of the dining room and little to no decoration to be found. Any who, before I could really look around a friendly white coated waiter came over with some menus. I didn't even snag a look at it and went straight for the prix fixe. Off the waiter went and returned with a white wine. He went into a speech about it, but I stopped him and told him to pour first and ask questions later. He obliged, filled the glasses tall and went on his way. Class personified. The service was terrific throughout. Here's how the meal went...Amuse Bouche: Potato and celery soup - Small cup came out and wasn't as heavy as I expect most potato soups to be. You could definitely detect the celery flavor. Starters: French onion soup and garbage salad (a salad with a bit of everything) - LOVVEE both of these in concept and N9NE did them well. Bits of bleu cheese, olives, salami, tomato and others all over salad is always a good time. The soup was on point. Gooey cheese and salty broth make me a happy camper.Fish: *Note: I am buzzed at this pointStriped Sea Bass (Sautéed, Escarole & Beans, Black Garlic, Pancetta, Extra Virgin Olive Oil)- This was solid. Crunchy top with light bites of fish underneath. Next time I would probably skip this step and leave more room for the meat.  Entree: *Note- I am drunk now and the red wine has entered the picturePrime Ribeye Steak with grilled asparagus and parmesan mashed potatoes  - This bad boy was cooked perfectly rare and had was served in a plate of its own juices. Smooth move. If that wasn't enough, it was also served with 3 side sauces (Creamy Horseradish, Au Poivre and Béarnaise Sauce). Don't even bother with these. Although really salty (IMO), the crust was extremely flavorful and the piece was easy to cut. Not the best steak I've had this year, but doable. Dessert: - 3 mini pieces of a peanut butter cup, carrot cake (bomb!) and cheesecake. All fun, but you should prob be full by now. So, about those 5-stars. The food was FAR from perfect, but the experience was great. Anytime I leave a place full, tipsy and satisfied with a lady in hand (who was feeling the same), I'm more than just 'a fan'. Let's call it a generous 5 with a suggestion to have your next date night here. Tip: check out the worlds smallest TV's in the bathroomTrendy high end steakhouse inside of the Palms. I was taken here on a date and had an amazing experience...so kudos to the guy for choosing this joint.The service was great. We had a reservation and were greeted at the door. They were still getting our table ready so we decided to get a drink at the bar, which was right by the front of the restaurant. For our appetizers, we got the rock shrimp and garbage salad, which were both, fabulous. The server helped with suggesting those.I ended up ordering the bone in rib eye, which was cooked perfectly and had so much flavor, with a side of the mac and cheese, also just fantastic. He got the filet, which was good too but nowhere as amazing as my rib eye. I most likely scared him with my appetite for meat ...but what can I do? I love a good a rib eye.New look.  New menu.  Same vibe.Updated contemporary décor in a dining space where line of sight for celebrity sightings is as important as the LED mood lighting.  High energy, loud, for the young and young at heart.  Quality steaks but, "not your daddy's steakhouse".    The new menu sees the addition of dry aged beef,  contemporary cuts and steakhouse staples such as a  beautiful braised short rib and a classic 3lb lobster thermidor.Starters fail to impress.  Secondary to conversation or an after thought kickin it with your buds, the flavors are correct, the presentation OK, no WOW factor.  The fried rock shrimp OK.  Perfectly cooked but the accompanying lemon aioli increases the oily mouth feel.  The lobster pot stickers with bok choy, shitake mushrooms and a chile ginger soy sauce, not memorable.  The king crab and gruyere stuffed shrooms, a tasty bite but the cheese masks the sweetness of the crab.The steaks.  All USDA prime, wet aged (except he 35 and 50 day dry aged rib eyes), very well trimmed.  Excellent sear.  Even cooking.  Accurate temp.  Standard cuts are, well standard.  Great bone in fillet and porterhouse.  The 35 day dry aged rib steak is tender, and pleasantly nutty with hints of cheesy aroma and a wafting umame finish.  The 50 day, meltingly tender with a pronounced bleu cheese aroma.  Some funkiness at the edges, not for everyone.  The standout, "Barry's Steak".  A simple grilled rib cap.  Tender, packed with flavor.  Served with complementing cipollini onions and shishito peppers.For entrees, the "Kobe" short rib is excellent.  Not true Kobe beef but, perfectly braised, not stringy, finished with a horseradish crust served with curried root veg and a Cabernet sauce, the earthy flavors marry well.  The lobster thermidor, a classic in every respect.  At three pounds, massive, with firm but still juicy meat enveloped in cream and cheese.  Simply put, good eats.For sides, the creamed corn, adds a great sweetness to any steak.  The broccoli and cauliflower gratin with a cheddar cheese sauce complements the dry aged steaks umame finish.  The highly touted lobster mashed potato is good but far to rich as a side dish to steaks.  It steals the show.Very good service.  Steakhouse proper despite the cool vibe of the place.  Very good wine list.  Vegas resort prices.A steakhouse that understands what not having "Las Vegas Blvd" in its address means.  Translated:  it's less expensive, omits baller ingredients but manages to keep the vibe of the Palms.What an amazing experience I had while at N9NE Steakhouse at the Palms! If you haven't visited this place yet, set a date as soon as possible! I can't wait to go back for round 2!Here are the highlights:1. The hostesses are actually nice! This seems so rare in the fancier steakhouses.  It was a nice way to start the night.2. Awesome bartenders and strong drinks!  We actually arrived a bit early, so we headed to the bar for a cocktail.  It turns out it was Ladies Night, which is every Wednesday.  They had several drinks for $5 and apps for $9.  Not too shabby!3. The atmosphere is beautiful! The GM, who stopped by our table to chat, told us it was recently remodeled.  It is very pretty and the new booth seating is quite comfy. Nothing is better than great food and being comfortable as you totally pig out! 4. OhMyGoodness the FOOD!!!!! We had some awesome food on this visit.  I think I got pictures of almost everything, but they don't do the food justice.  Everything was fantastic! I am still thinking about my amazing Classic Ribeye and the Hot Potatoes Austin Gratin.  Of course, the memories of the Crab Stuffed Mushrooms, Potato Gnocchi, Creamed Corn, and Buffalo Chicken Wontons keep fighting for space too! Ok, I just drooled on the keyboard!5. OhMyGoodness the sommelier and the wine pairings for the night!  I am totally not a wine person.  I have never really acquired the taste for wine, so I usually just skip it all together.  This night though, we had an awesome sommelier take care of us for dinner.  He made me totally rethink my stance on wine! We started with Pierre Joliot Champagne to celebrate some fun stuff going on in our lives right now and then it just keep coming.  I can't remember the names of all of the of other wines we had, but they were all fantastic! If you have the chance, ask for Marco and his sommelier services for the night.  He is totally worth it!6. The desserts! We had the Banana Pudding Pie and the S'mores.  Both were so fun and yummy.  I would have to recommend the s'mores though because it was so much fun!  You get fire at your table, in-house made marshmallows in plain, strawberry, banana, and chocolate flavors, and graham crackers already loaded with chocolate! Yummy!7. We even got to meet the Chef! It's always so much fun to have the Chef come out to meet you.  Nice touch N9NE!8. I almost forgot to mention the Béarnaise!!! I love love love Béarnaise sauce.  The Béarnaise sauce here was ah-ma-zing! My sister and I were fighting over the last drop.  The other three sauces were tasty and I would recommend you get all four and play around with them, but the Béarnaise is definitely the best of the four!9. And last by not least, the service! Our server was fantastic! Everyone we encountered through the meal was great.  Everyone was en pointe and giving 110%.  This is really what sealed the deal on this fabulous meal.  We felt like royalty the entire meal!!!This meal was easily in my top 5 of all time.  My sister and I had such a great time! I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone that would listen to me!I have no idea where to start; My boyfriend and I ate here on Saturday night, we were staying at the Palms, checked in late, it had been a long day , we decided since it was so  late we would ask the front desk at check-in how they felt about Nine Steakhouse and Nove Italiano, most seemed a little more pumped on Nine so we decided to give it a try, I really wanted to like this place based on the feedback we received at Check-in, but unfortunately I was utterly disappointed!!!!For starters we had the oysters on the half shell which was ok; the garnishes were a spicy cocktail sauce and some sort of wine sauce that you drizzle on the oyster, pretty good.Our waiter was somewhat pushy we had just received our glass of champagne to go with our oysters and he was ready to take our wine order and food order, let us enjoy one thing at a time! Can we savor the moment, please, since it would all go downhill after this! We placed our order:  Organic Fire Chicken for myself and My boyfriend had the 18oz Prime Bonein Ribeye (35 Day, Dry Aged). To share: Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Mac and Cheese and Garbage Salad, we were hungry! Organic Fire Chicken, the concept was good, I see where they were going with this, however the chicken was dry I paired this with a Merlot which was much needed to assist in washing down the dry chicken. Prime Bonein Ribeye steak - My boyfriends first thought I can cook a better steak, but whatever he takes it down no complaining, he hates complaining.  Lobster Mashed Potatoes - Way too fishy for my liking, didn't mesh well. Mac and Cheese - I've had WAY better, in fact my Mac n cheese is better!  Garbage Salad - wouldn't know, never received it! Basket of Bread - Full of Gnat Flies, two lingered around long enough to take a picture see in pictures #307We complained to the waiter on the things we were unhappy with and let him know we never got our salad, he said I'm sorry about that, we told him about the flies he said "I'm sorry about that, its summer". No buddy it feels like summer, it isn't summer yet!  Offers us a free entry to the Ghostbar, what a joke! We couldn't even get into the lounge "they were at capacity". Back in our room - my boyfriend starts feeling sick, next morning I'm vomiting!! Great, We've been food poisoned or picked up a bug from this place! Never would recommend this place to my worst enemy or set foot in this place ever again!!!!  Who is running this disgusting establishment? We should of spoke to a manager, but my boyfriend the guy who hates to complain preferred to pay our $246.00 tab and move on, well I can't move on especially when I am still grossed out on food 4 days later, so here I am on yelp! Just don't eat here, there is way better out there, trust me!Happy 5 year anniversary to me and my beau! And this was the perfect place to celebrate it at!We got seated with Sandy (Thanks Carl I.). She was amazing, she really hooked it up! We decided to start out with Moscow Mules. Best moscow mules ever! They bring out a copper cup with vodka and the ginger beer bottle and pour it in front of you. Oh how I love ginger beer! Sandy also brought us out some toasting champagne. Cheers to another 5 years!Cesar salad came out with some bread. The bread was so good. It was different kinds. I picked up one that had onions inside the bread oh that was really good! Only thing I didn't like about the salad was it had big chunks of bacon. Like really BIG fatty bacon! Another round of moscow mules and champagne...My eyes watered when our food came out. I got the Surf and Turf -- 8oz filet mignon, Maine lobster on top with white truffle aioli and it laid on some Bomb mashed potatoes. Or I think it was mashed potatoes! The meat was cooked with absolute perfection. The lobster was not minimal but a lot and paired well with the aioli sauce. My mouth waters as I write this review. The beau got the 18oz bone in ribeye that had been dry aged for 35 days! It was ginormous! I don't know how he finished that thing! We also got the Lobster Mashed Potatoes as our side. Yes I know.. Lobster again!! Yes lobster again! I love lobster. Best decision yet! Because that dish was so fantastically delicious! Again, there was loads of lobster. Next time I'm gonna get the Lobster Mac N Cheese! We were absolutely full. But Sandy brought us out some dessert! Smores! They brought out a small fire stove device, crackers with dark & white chocolate, marshmallows and sticks! we had a mini campfire at our table. Stay with caution though because I almost burned the restaurant down twice. I'm exaggerating! Overall, a great anniversary dinner. Thank you N9NE, thank you Sandy, thank you Carl I., and Thank you to my beloved beau for the amazing night! Can't wait to come back!
Sherwood Forest Cafe=For a 24 hour cafe in a hotel, this restaurant is not bad at all!  Here's a quick list of the Pros and Cons of this restaurant....PROS: The food! The swiss cheese and chicken sandwich is excellent! Very tender chicken, with a pesto mayo spread and all the fixings.  Also served with huge pickle and very good friesPaying the cashier up front; you don't have to wait for your server to keep coming back to you for the bill and then back with your change or cc.  Huge seating area, this is a must especially in a big casino like the ExcaliburFriendly servers and cashiers.  CONS: Nice, but SLOW service.  The line to get into the cafe especially during peak times can stretch out into the casino floor. You don't really know who your server is, one person comes to take your drink order, the other takes your food order, one person delivers it, etc.  But as long as you get everything you need, I guess it doesn't matter huh?  Definitely a fan, especially for the chicken sandwich!
Cafe Carumba=Visted twice in the past few weeks.  First visit was for happy hour, and I tried three items at $5 each: the house margarita, the churrasco (steak skewers) cooked medium-rare, and a Tex-Mex take on eggrolls.  LOVED the margarita... one of the best I've ever had!  Really liked the eggrolls (pork, carrots, black beans).  Can't say the same for the skewers, though, as they weren't cooked enough- chewy texture and still pretty bloody, actually.  Yes, I ordered them cooked medium-rare, but I've ordered steak burgers at the same temperature before at a few other places and all came out very edible.  These weren't.  If I were to order them again, and I probably won't, I'd go for medium to medium-well.  On the second visit, I had their cheeseburger, cooked medium-rare, with smoked gouda (wow!), sweet potato fries as the accompanying side, and (subbed) chipotle mayo.  I found the buns used very, very tasty- loved the grilled texture.  Last, but certainly not least, the sweet potato fries were superb!  These were light, non-greasy, no cinnamon-sugar coating, and easy on the salt.  I loved it both ways- at times plain, and other times dipped in the chipotle mayo.  Should I ever have a craving for SPF, I'm heading to Cafe Carumba!  Very friendly service and clean women's restroom.  I'll definitely be back!If you go to Cafe Carumba try the charuscurra (sp) sticks.  And the rocky point pizza.  And the spicy jalepeno sausage slider things.  And the mini chimis.  And the...well try whatever you can but unless you are with a big group for an event you may not that far through the offerings.I attended an event at Cafe Carumba and I was impressed with the food and the service.  I would keep them in mind for corporate gatherings or even a small meeting (they have a private room for such things).The staff at the bar was great as were the servers.
Greektown=What is the name of every fourth male born in Greece?George!George, who I believe is the owner, took care of us over lunch the other day... When we asked his name, he responded with the trivia question above!  He is quite the character.We started with a dip sampler platter that had 4 dips:  Tsatziki, TaramoSalata, MelitsanoSalata, and one more... but it wasn't hummus.  They don't serve hummus at Greektown.  The dips were accompanied by perfectly warmed pita bread.  I could've made a meal out of the pita and TaramosSalata, but I had a Greek Salad as well.It was the perfect lunch portion.  A tad bit on the overdressed, garlicky side, but luckily I wasn't planning on kissing anyone that afternoon.I don't live near Greektown, but if I'm ever in that hood again, I wouldn't hesitate to return!
