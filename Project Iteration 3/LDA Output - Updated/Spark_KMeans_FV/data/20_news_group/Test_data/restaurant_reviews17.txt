***Chase Field's main concession stand Double Headers features a value menu that includes hot dogs, corn dogs and popcorn for $1.50 each; the concessions here are similar to what you will find at any other stadium, but the lower prices are refreshing***Double Headers is the main concession stand at Chase Field.  They have multiple locations all throughout the stadium, which make them very easy to find.  They serve the traditional baseball stadium food like hot dogs, french fries and popcorn.  There are some items that are only available at some of the Double Headers stands though (like the nachos).  I am not sure, but I think some of the Double Headers also sell a foot-long corn dog.Double Headers does provide one big advantage over many arena/stadium concessions stands.  They have a value menu that features items like hot dogs, corn dogs and popcorn for $1.50 each.  We went with the popcorn and it was okay.  It was not super light or super fresh, but it was perfectly serviceable.  It was a decent size too.  That size of popcorn would probably run about $4 at a movie theater concessions stand.We also went with the nachos, which were corn tortilla chips topped with jalapenos and a side of melted nacho cheese.  The chips were the kind of hearty gold tortilla chips that you would get from a grocery store.  They were crunchy, but they were not the freshest chips.The jalapenos were good and the nacho cheese here was better than what you would find at most arenas/stadiums.  The nacho cheese had a little bit of spice and heat to it.  That is rare for stadium cheese dips.  Usually, stadium cheese dips are very bland.Service was fine.I like trying more city/team-specific concessions when visiting a new stadium and there is a good number of them at Chase Field (local chains like Macayo's and Streets of New York pizza).  Double Headers, on the other hand, is very run-of-the-mill concessions.  Still, the value menu here makes Double Headers a good option if you are a stadium regular or are looking to get some food without having to spend too much money.

I've read several reviews of this place and others and I'm getting mighty tired of people from Chicago or New York or wherever blasting local restaurants because they don't have "authentic" food from their home town; pizza, hotdogs or whatever. This is PHOENIX. It's not Chicago. It's not New York. It's not St Paul, Minnesota (although for half the freakin' year it's hard to believe that last one). If you want authentic stuff from your home town then why the heck did you move here? I'm an Aussie and I never shoot places down simply because the hamburgers and fries don't taste like what I grew up with. If I don't like the food I say so. If I don't like the restaurant or service I say so, and vice versa. If only people could judge based on the individual pros or cons of restaurants and their ~local~ competition, and not some rose-coloured memory they have of sometime years ago or someplace three thousand miles away, things would be a lot fairer. Plus, this is a HOT DOG place, not some haute cuisine dining establishment! Exactly how different do Chicago buns or pickles taste?! If I maintained this same philosophy, every single Indian restaurant I've eaten at in Phoenix would get a single star rating. See how this works?Rant over. Went here for dinner the other night, arrived at just after 6pm. A lady with iridescent blue eyes greeted us and was very friendly in discussing the different options. Truth to tell, there aren't many - Chicago Style, one or two other styles, and a kids menu with three or four combo options. The lady noticed our toddler and said that if he sat on the other side of the table she would turn cartoons on for him on one of the tellys. We ordered our stuff and out it came in a few minutes. First plus were the fries. If you've read my talk thread here (http://j.mp/ovV41z) you'll know how I feel about crispy fries. Props to this place for serving actually fresh fries (albeit with the skin on). Yes, they were a bit oily - you get that when fries are fried in oil. Yes, they were a bit soggy - you get that when fries aren't pre-processed by blanching. These fries are what you get when 1) you chop a potato and 2) fry it thereafter. Try it sometime. Go to In-N-Out, same thing. If you want crispy fries, go somewhere else. Me, I could have eaten them all. day. long.Hotdogs were okay - it was my first go at Chicago style. I got two. Pickle, tomato was fine. The relish was sort of a bright fluorescent green - bizarre, but tasted ok. I didn't get the sport peppers as I had had jalapeno for lunch. One mistake was to forget to ask for no celery salt - I hate the taste of celery and the salt spoiled the dogs for me. I wiped off what I could. Still finished both. The wife enjoyed hers. She had a tray of chili fries - very good indeed. The kid wolfed down his dog and half his fries, as expected.All in all, a great meal. I was checking in on Yelp when the wife told me that they had already closed. Sure as shinola it was after 7. I read on their facebook page that they're planning to stay open a little longer. 7pm shutdown is definitely way too early and puts this place dangerously close to White Eagle IMO in terms of stupid business hour planning. But, 6pm is fine for us for a family dinner and it's not like we got bounced out at closing time. Anyone looking to have dinner later, just stand in front of this place and then turn your heads left and right. Several options. You know, or else just move back to Chicago where everything is so much better.I would have given this place a solid 3 star average, but it nosed up to 4 due to the thoughtfulness of the counter gal and the quality of the fries. Screw authentic, the food was good. And now I've half a mind to go eat at Portillo's in Chicago and then slam it on Yelp because the hotdogs didn't taste like the dogs I ate back in Phoenix. Oh wait, I said rant over, didn't I? (sips peppermint tea expressionlessly)

Quality off the Strip wine bar at off the Strip prices.  WIN!Straight to the libations.  There is a short list of outstanding, highly rated, old world and cult wines offered by the bottle at dirt cheap prices (ie the impossible to get '09 Mollydooker Velvet Glove $225.  It's so hard to get that a wine shop in Hawaii only let me touch and caress the bottle but not buy)  There is also a good selection of wines by the glass offered both in full and half pours to help with tasting.Unfortunately whiskey, scotch and bourbon drinkers are left out.  For a place named Wine and WHISKEY, you expect more than just the most common names behind the barThe simple food is wine centric.  It all pairs well.  Props to the "Grown-ups grilled cheese" with its gooey, melted gruyere and smoked ham core; olive poppers (goat cheese and chorizo studded olives); and the rich mushroom arancini with a white truffle scented aioli.  The cheese and charcuterie selection is very good (thanks to a misunderstanding, I tried them all.  No one thought it was funny to serve a dish for 5-7 to ONE me huh?)They do offer salads, sandwiches and pastas for those wanting something heavier.  Don't be surprised to find the same items at their other location, Bottles and Burgers.Great happy hour from 3:30-7:30RecommendedGenerous happy hours a good happy hours.  Going from 3:30pm - 7:30pm daily makes it very accessible to most people.  Happy hour specials get you $3-$6 appetizers, $3 beers, $4-$7 wines, ~$5 cocktails, as well as 1/2 off premium well drinks (what's a premium well?) and 1/2 off their whiskey of the month.After several visits here I've found myself enjoying their grilled cheese and arancini appetizers the most.  Gruyere and smoked ham make for a tasty grilled cheese, and the arancini comes with a good truffle sauce.  The food isn't amazing, but these are the two dishes that I've liked most.  As far as drinks, talk with Jessica if you're sitting at the bar.  She's a good bartender that is always happy to make you a drink based on your mood and palate.  Otherwise, their happy hour cucumber martini is delicious, and made with Hendricks Gin!  Decent food and good drinks make for a nice stop at Town Square.Double Helix is definitely one of my favorite places to go in Town Square. My drinks of choice are wine and whiskey so it's the perfect place for me. It's also conveniently located half a mile from where I work so I frequently stop by for an after work drink and on occasion some food as well. They've changed the food menu a little but from what I've tried so far the food is pretty good. I recommend the adult grilled cheese, it's mouth watering. I bring friends in often and always sit at the bar. Kyle and Jessica are great bartenders and they make the experience all the better. If you're in the area or taking a shopping trip to Town Square, I definitely recommend stopping in Double Helix.Great happy hour! My friend & I wanted to meet for happy hour & she suggested this place. Good call, Heidi! Bartender was very patient as my friend sampled the happy hour wines trying to decide on a favorite. I went with the malbec right away and was pretty happy with it. I tried to be good and ordered the gluten free appetizer, Seared Yellowfin Tuna. It was really good and at happy hour prices, it was a steal. But then I got weak.... And had to order the Grown Up Grilled cheese. It was adorable. I ordered it sans pork (allergy) and it was really good. My friend ordered the Olive poppers, but I couldn't try them (also had pork) this place is very pork friendly. I don't think she expected them to be breaded & deep fried. She also ordered the Salmon Caesar salad. It was very big & looked delicious! She said she liked it. I'm definitely coming back to try some other stuff, if I can keep from ordering the Grown Up Grilled Cheese, that is... Try it!A great alternative to the Strip or Downtown watering holes when it comes to "adulting" on a Saturday night, wait... what is "Adulting?"  "Adulting" - Definition: Sipping one or two drinks, staying within your cocktail budget, and using all of your Uber credits for your inebriated friends. The Double Helix is a great lounge for both snackers and whiskey lovers alike. This spot is located in the main hub of Town Square and they feature over one hundred whiskeys and an entire vineyard's worth of wines, both red and white.  Instead of just staring at their vast drink menu, I suggest going with a "drink flight", this is the best way to find out exactly what you do and don't like and yes, they offer whiskey and wine flights for the indecisive person. They also have great happy hour deals that usually highlight a specialty whiskey or wine. If you really want to get educated on whiskey ask for Kyle, one of the bartenders, he's the hunky guy in the Kilt. The dude is legit when it comes to drink suggestions and whiskey anecdotes. Hummus, quesadillas, and fried cheese is just a small sample of the snacks they offer here, they also have excellent charcuterie plates to go with that bold red in your hand. Sip smart Las Vegas.

What the HELL is wrong with you Yelpers who like this place?!  A rare Yelp miss, but an almost unforgivable miss.  I am tempted to write a letter to Yelp to audit the accounts who posted positive reviews for this place!  You're either tastebud deficient or a friend of the owner.First of all, we should have walked out when we saw that two employees were just sort of lazily hangin' about and chatting it up in a booth in the back of the joint.  Both looked unkempt and disinterested; thought they for sure were just a couple of hungover college kids.At first I thought they must be on break, but nope they were both involved in us getting our food.  Whoever is managing this place needs to get it under control.  Employees like that will kill your business!The chips and salsa are a joke.  They are just sitting out there under a heat lamp with a sign that says, basically, please don't take too much so we can save money.  Uh,.. never seen something so remarkably cheap in my life.  Even the sign looked cheap, printed on some old paper, off center, and filthy.  The chips were hard and seemed to have been sitting out for a while and likely not fresh.  The salsa was below average and didn't taste fresh.  I am convinced the tomatoes were out of a can.I tried their "specialty," if you dare call this piece of shit special, the Green Chili Pork Burrito.  Again, no way in hell was this fresh. Also bland and boring.  The rice was room temperature and the beans watery.My wife thought hers was just boring and the kids barely ate it.  Stay away!!!Drove from Queen Creek to the Pecos and Lindsey location for a to-go order and trip to the park after with the kids. I paid 20 dollars for my food and asked for a cup of water. They handed me a tiny plastic cup, to which I begged for a cup with a lid. After arguing with the manager for 5 min with a toddler in my arm and two kids running around. I left pretty annoyed at the place for not sparing a 5 cent cup that would make all the difference in this momma's world to take to the park with A LID.  I didn't get one.This may seem petty, but they also got my order wrong and therefore I came to the conclusion that if I make the effort to drive all that way, spend a good amount on a couple tacos and burrito, I expect a business to return the kindness even if it is as simple as a cheap water cup with a lid,  and getting the order right.The food was decent, but I won't be back. Consider the customer service when you decide to satisfy your Mexican food craving.

Review Text :
Ok...I waited a while to write a review about this place because I wanted to at least get two visits under my belt before I make any praises or judgements....and the verdict is...da da the da da..well you already know what it is!  Since this is the only restaurant specializing in hot pot here in Phoenix/Chandler, maybe all of Arizona, there really is no other place I can compare it to.  So I gotta compare it to the hot pot/shabu shabu restaurants I have visited in L.A, San Gabriel, etc.Compared to the other places I have been, this place tops the list!  The soup broths that they offer are very unique to different asian regions.  I had the Ying Yang which is half non spicy traditional chinese herbal broth and half traditional Taiwanese Ma La Spicy herbal broth.  Sometimes these other place would make the Ma La broth not edible because there is too much of the numbing spice, but here they make it just right.  They also did not skimp on the herbs used in the broth...very flavorful.  THey also offer all their broths vegetarian.  The second time I was there I tried the spicy Lemongras veggie style and is was also very good.So, Tien got the broth down, but what about their menu items?  Three words...Fresh and Top Quality.All the veggies and mushrooms I ordered were very fresh.  This is important because with Hot pot/Shabu Shabu there is no hiding bad or poor quality items.  THe meat selection was also cut perfectly and of top quality...comparable to the top Shabu restaurants I have been to in Cali.I ordered the Shabu beef, lamb, and beef tongue.  the shabu was so tender, it basically melted in my mouth!In addition, the udon I had was also very good and so was everything else I had the two time I was there.Everything here is a la carte, so you can always get something different with each visit.All in all, I will be back again, and again, and again...keep up the quality and the service and I am sure this place will gain the popularity it deserves!!After my third trip to Tien Wong, I thought it was time to write the raving review it so obviously deserves, even despite the fact that they do not serve alcohol!Hot Pot is basically fondue with a soup broth instead of cheese. It is an absolutely amazing concept and is a great group or date event. It is a blast to go through and pick different veggies and tofu (they have meat and fish as well) and try new things you never would have tried under normal circumstances.I have really grown to love the greens, Tang O, taro root, the five spice tofu, and the iced tofu. They have probably 5-6 kinds of mushrooms, bock choy, spinach, four or five types of noodles, dumplings, and somehow like 4-5 different types of tofu! It is amazing! You also get a peanut and a soy dipping sauce, but I think the flavor of the vegetables drenched in miso is amazing without any sauce!I saw someone complain about the price here on Yelp, but we had dinner last night for 4 with a hot tea and a dessert for $50.00 total. We had 4 different dishes of tofu and 7 different kinds of vegetables in our huge pot of miso broth so that we could try our a variety. Every single one of us was stuffed and remained full throughout the rest of the night. I think it is a great value. People who don't normally eat vegetables or Asian enjoy the fun experience, and enjoy being able to try something they normally wouldn't. Also a great place to take a group of people so that you can all try something a little different.I was looking forward to trying the newly renamed T-Spot for a tasty bowl of hot pot, but it sadly didn't meet expectations. The blueberry boba tea was great, the service alright, they had pretty decor & the experience was nice, but perhaps better suited for a smaller party of two. After figuring out the menu & concept we chose a couple types of meat, veggies, noodles and two types of broth. The meat was lacking in flavor, barely a difference between the two different broths and not nearly spicy enough. Once cooked the portions were small and the bill we received nearly $70 for 3 was too much for so little.The meal left my wallet & my stomach empty.

Q:  How did the jury find the hamburger?A:  Grill-ty as charred!This beloved California chain that has made its way to Utah, Nevada, and Arizona is amazing.  Mr. Dubs and I came here today when SRP screwed up one thing or another and the whole neighborhood's electricity went out.  Do you know how hard it is to pop in your contacts and do eyeliner in the dark?  It's hard.  But the struggle was well worth it when a delicious charbroiled burger and lovely A/C was there to greet you.After the lovely server went through the menu with us and gave us some suggestions, we ordered the Teriyaki Char, the #2 Original Double Char meal, and a side of tempura green beans.  Such delicious charry bits of goodness!  Everything was well-seasoned, had good flavor, and tasted great.  I especially loved the tempura green beans with a side of ranch.  It was well worth the extra calories.  Get lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, and grilled onions on your burger for no extra charge but cheese is like $0.55 extra and stuff like bacon and avocados are also an extra dime or two.  Don't forget to stop by the swanky chili peppers/pepperchinis/pickles bar and grab yourself a strawberry puree limeade with cucumber slices.  It was a bit sweet for my liking but it was super refreshing on this hot summer day!All in all, I'll definitely be back here again! Indoor seating is limited as well as parking and since there was a constant flow of customers, the place could end up a bit messy but oh well.  Good food at decent prices!  $20 lunch for two ain't too shabby for a fast food joint with much better quality.

Hand-pulled noodles...enough said!No, seriously...they are the star of Beijing Noodle Cafe and it would be a crime if you didn't order them.My trusty Yelp app reminded me I was in the neighborhood and not only did we recently read about this restaurant in the local paper, but Paul Y. was raving about place to the Husband.  As soon as I checked in, I realized fellow yelper Andy T. was just here and he quickly sent us a message telling us what we had to order!  Located in a strip mall, this hole in the wall mom and pop restaurant is quaint and simply decorated with pictures of the menu items and hanging red lanterns.  Of course, the very clean fish tank is something you can't miss when you walk in.We were given a lunch menu - on one side featured lunch specials, but the other side was where the specialty noodles were offered.  We shared:* Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup ($6.95) - Hand pulled noodles in a very light aromatic broth with wood ear mushrooms and sliced beef.  It was very flavorful and we were quite impressed.* Szechuan Eggplant with Noodles ($6.95) - Hand pulled noodles with a stir-fry of eggplant, tomatoes and garlic sitting on top.  Again, very good and quite rich.  Although both dishes had the same noodles, they were showcased quite differently in broth versus sauce.  Once you eat a freshly made noodle, it's hard to want anything else.While we waited for our order, we inquired about when the demonstration for noodle pulling takes place.  The waiter told us that the chef was out, but usually during the evenings.  The chef came in a few minutes later and he started making our noodles.  It was quite impressive and definitely entertaining.  At that point, the female owner explained more about the different sizes of noodles offered (small, medium or large - although she recommends medium), and that they the hand cut noodles into water as well.  (If you've seen Bizarre Foods, you know what I'm talking about here!)  She also mentioned their appetizer dumplings as being made to order.  We initially thought they weren't offered at lunch because it wasn't on the lunch menu we were given and per another yelper's review.  On the contrary, it IS available!  Sweet!  So we added:* Pork Wonton in Red Chili Sauce ($4.95) - Twelve little handmade morsels sitting in a deadly chili oil sauce.  They were fresh and light, and not your average wonton.* Pork and Chives Potstickers ($4.95) - They came in a set of six that were pan fried and just filled to the brim with pork and chives.  It also came with a dipping sauce, and you can really tell the freshness of this potsticker.  They told us it takes 8 minutes for them to make it, but I think it took less.We're loving Beijing Noodle Cafe and we think you will too!  Be sure to ask the friendly lady owner for suggestions because she is more than helpful and willing to please.  You'll find out taking out-of-towners here for sure!Please make my noodles BY HAND! Thanks! SERIOUSLY!!! They hand pull their noodles here. If you are lucky (or you just ask) the chef will even come out and pull noodles. Amazing! And you can taste the difference! The noodles are so delicious!I always have the mushroom and beef noodles. Oh wow! So flavorful and rich. We shared the wontons in chili sauce appetizer last time and it was so good. I don't even like spicy food but it was goooooood!This place is located in a small strip mall and you could miss it if your not looking. It is quaint and clean and the staff is always friendly. If you are looking for not only a good meal, but a neat experience you should stop by. Trust me, Beijing is not that far! LOLGot noodle?  Yes.  Where?  Beijing Noodle Cafe of Las Vegas!I was recovering from a flu/food-poisoning, and as I was on the mend -- soup, particularly noodle soup, is what this non-medical professional prescribed to self.Searching online from my hotel room on the strip, Beijing Noodle Cafe rose to the top with it's 4+ star rating and FRESH made noodles.  Next step, muster up energy.I take the elevator downstairs, and take the long walk thru the lobby of the Luxor.  Hobbling and wobbling, all-the-while not drunk, I finally reach valet to retrieve my car.  Next step, find it.About a 15 minute drive down Flamingo, east of the strip (only 10 if you're really hungry), I arrive at a not-the-best looking strip mall & parking lot.  I didn't see the sign at first...and began to worry it fell victim to the economy.  Alas, I see it and parked right near.  Next step, get it.I open the door, and find that I am a VIP today...a private place all to myself, no papparazis, no TMZ, and no bother.  At 315pm, It was a strange time to eat, even for LUNNER (lunch/dinner).  A lovely, sweet lady greeted me, and I found a nice table...with some sun on my back.  The decor was cute but not fancy, with chinese artifacts, artwork, and painted a pretty mint green.  Next step, stop looking at the decor and pick a fricken noodle.The menu was great!  They serve lunch specials late, and I was able to take advantage of it.  Lanzhou Beef Noodle was the choice (and like Seinfelds' George, I like it spicy), with a side of dumplings.  Next step, intend to order a little too much so I have leftovers.The noodles are made fresh to order, so it takes a few extra minutes.  This translated is, the soup isn't already made where they take a ladle and dish it out to you.  FRESH noodles are worth the extra 10 minutes.  Next step, Zen-like patience.The dumplings came out first.  Wow - they were huge and a bit oddly shaped.  Translation: homemade, and not pressed out of a machine.  Forgetting that I've been ill, energy came from somewhere and I furiously dig into dumpling #1.  Holy Potsticker Batman!  Dumpling #2 was even more fricken great!  It's served with homemade chili sauce/oil -- pure heaven.  Next step, stop after eating 2 dumplings or be too full for the soup.The soup comes out, and it was absolutely FULL with FRESH noodles, and lovely pieces of tender beef.  Wow.  This is a great bowl, and perfectly executed by the chef.  Tasty broth, tender beef, and amazing noodles.  Next step, slow down or splash the window.I ate all the soup, one more dumpling, and took 2 dumplings 'to go'.  I was full, and full of noodle happiness I was!  Next step, don't eat the 2 remaining dumplings in the car, no matter how good they smell.CONCLUSION -- Great place, great service, great prices, great small business to support, and 2 great cold dumplings later from my hotel.  That's a lot of great, and greatly deserved!   It's best for locals and those looking for off-strip, hassle-free dining.  Next step, your turn.Quality, authentic, hand pulled noodles and hand cut noodles in the middle of the desert!If you're on a low carb diet, STOP READING.  Also, this is not for you if your idea of "authentic Asian cuisine" comes from a place that serves general tzo's chicken or beef with broccoli chow mien.  Skip if you enjoy eating rehydrated microwaved noodles from a styrofoam bowl.This is the real deal.  Extremely glutinous, al dente noodles with just the right amount of surface imperfections to hold the sauce or soup.  Enough, it's just good eats!The sliced pork and mushroom hand pulled noodles that other yelpers rave about is THE standout dish.  Loads of meaty mushrooms and tender pork.  Very flavorful, not too oily.  The beef noodle soup is also a worthy try.  Fresh herbs, ginger, garlic, chilies, and five spice create a very aromatic base for tender beef, mushrooms, and noodles.Ultimately, the strong flavors, lack of acidity, and the lack of textural contrast fill you up quick.  Avoid the "eyes bigger than the stomach" syndrome.  Nothing worse than a carb brick in your stomach and a cloying flavor in your mouth for hours.Note:  They use MSG with no apology.  You've been warned.Service is OK.  Prices very low.One of the best kept secrets in Vegas so shhhh, recommended.Came in out of the rain to kill time before meeting locksmith at my clients' home nearby. I was reluctant (even with the good Yelp reviews) to try out this "hole in the wall" establishment,  but my longing for a nice hot bowl of soup to warm me up was stronger than my fear. Upon entering, Beijing Noodle Cafe was the typical Chinese restaurant with minimal decor and a red glow that only seemed apparent in photos. I was greeted and seated immediately. The lunch specials looked tempting but after some Yelp research, I decided on the wonton noodle soup...wontons seemed like a popular choice amongst the Yelpers.My soup came within 5 minutes and it was DELICIOUS! The broth was nice and hearty with flecks of red chili, seaweed and shrimp, and the wontons...uniquely long rolled dumplings bursting with flavor in a thin wonton skin. These were some of the best wontons I've had in Vegas. I didn't care so much for the seaweed because it gave it more of a Japanese taste, so I must  remember to ask them to omit it next time. The noodles had a great chewy texture to them and I too was hoping to catch a glimpse of the noodle guy making them, but alas no.It was a satisfying bowl of real Chinese comfort food. This discovery was just in time for the cold weather ahead. 3 stars for now but I will upgrade my stars once I've had a chance to try other items from their menu.

You guys, they are updating their menu and had a "Lamb Burger with Feta and Curry Mayo" to try as a special that they are adding.  It. Was. Awesome.  Seriously, so tasty.  You need to go here, and get that burger, and then die of happiness.  Been here several times, and although service is a tad slow during lunch, they're always very friendly and the food is great, so I don't mind.  ALSO - check in on Yelp... you'll be glad you did :)If I'm heading to a Knights or Panthers game, you can find me over in Latta Arcade. The entire alley is such a great pre and post game spot.Rule number one for a sporting event: eat a meal before you start boozing. It sounds simple, right? Of course, it never is. We ventured here around 4pm before the Monday Night Football game. We ordered chips and salsa, the triple grilled cheese with waffle fries, hot dogs with kraut (plus mashed potatoes and gravy), and a couple of quesadillas. Now, I have no idea if they make the gravy from scratch, but I will say it's peppery and absolutely delicious. I will make sure every order I place here included something covered in gravy. The grilled cheese features brie as one of the three. Let's face it, brie makes everything better. A warning about the quesadilla: the Habenero Ranch is no joke. It's a delayed burn after the first taste. The table next to us got the fish and chips and I immediately wanted to order that, too. Huge portion for the fish. It looked really good.This place was absolutely slammed both inside and on the patio, but the staff never seemed to miss a beat. We had fantastic service and several people waiting on us. Thanks Valhalla for being a consistent game day favorite. Oh, and GO PANTHERS!!! Rarrrrrrrrrrrr.

Possibly the cheapest meal you will find in any of the casinos on the Las Vegas Strip.  And this unassuming and "hidden" pizzeria, which is not even what their name is (according to the man I spoke to behind the counter) is located in the newest luxury casino to opened in Las Vegas.  It is on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, across from the escalator and located next to Blue Ribbon Sushi.  There are no signs indicating that there is anything down the short hallway adorned with album covers, besides of course the pinball machine and flat screen televisions mounted on the wall clearly visible to anyone who bothered to look in.  But instead of finding a hidden alcove of arcade games, you will find a counter where you can order your pizza by the slice or by the whole pie, and work space where they prepare the NY-style pizzas from scratch.Prices are reasonable.  Slices starts at $3 per slice (plain cheese), $3.50 (one-topping), $4 (two toppings combo), and for $6 (you get a slice of plain cheese pizza and domestic draft beer).18" Pizza by the pie: $17 (Cheese), $18 (White Pizza - Ricotta & Mozzarella Cheese), $22 (three-toppings), or $25 (five-toppings).Available Toppings (in alphabetical): Black Olives, Extra Cheese, Fresh Garlic, Green Peppers, Meatballs, Mushrooms, Onions, Pepperoni, Ricotta, Roasted Tomatoes, Sliced Sausage, Spinach, White Anchovies.Beverages: Coca-Cola Brand fountain drinks, beer and wine (domestic and premium draft), Illy Coffee.  The cup of soda is pretty small, but you can ask for refills. :DDesserts: New York Cheesecake Slice and Cannoli.Also if you are staying at the Cosmopolitan and too busy/lazy/important/lost :p to make your way to the "Pizzeria", you can ring up the hotel to have someone deliver your pizza order.BTW, the concept of selling pizzas by the slice has been around for a long time, just ask any UCB students, but to implement this concept inside a mega luxury casino is as Misti (LV Yelp CM) stated, "genius"!----2/15/2011----Holy cow!  I have no idea this place gets so packed at 11pm on a Tuesday night!  And their cheese-less pizzas with extra garlic oil added to the pizza sauce is dope!  I am glad I ate the last slice that no one else wanted, even though I was rather full already :)Decor: 4.5/5Pizza: 3.5/5Price: 4.5/5Staff: 5/5 Friendly and nice to the guests.Shhhhhh! can you keep a secret?  We stumbled upon a secret pizzeria in the new Cosmopolitan hotel.It was 3 in the morning and we roll in jonesin for some food.Nico was such a sweetheart, he told us stories, listened to ours, and gave us advice on life, love, and all things worldly.  He was like an elder teaching us life lessons while he kneaded dough and turned it into pizza for us!It literally turned from this.....       )   (    )    (     ___     (       _.'      `._  )     .'               `.  _(________)___Into this...in a matter of 20 minutes                                              . ------------.               \-------------/                \%=@%%/                 \ O%O%/                   \%(_)O/                    \ *%8/                     \&8/                       \*/Great pizza, nice crust, and awesome company.  Nico hooked us up and managed to teach us about life all in 30 minutes.  He made me feel like I was in Italy and if this was his pizzeria he'd have given us the pizza for free!  Nico made our trip a memorable one.This place gets 5 stars just based on the fact that it oozes coolness and style.  This place is not listed on the cosmopolitan website and directories, there are no signs, and you have to go through a dark hallway in order to find it.  The only way to know about this place is pretty much by word of mouth.  Pretty ballsy move by Cosmopolitan, but it's working out pretty well for them.  It's a pretty solid piece of pizza.  I've never been to NYC and I can't tell you if this is authentic, but it looks and tastes how I'd imagine it to be like.  I got a white pizza with three different types of cheeses and I had it topped with roasted tomatoes and mushrooms.   It was delicious.  It's open pretty late, so if you need solid eats after partying and drinking around citycenter, then this should be your spot.This is the perfect place to wander into after a long night, and all you want is a greasy pizza with the 1 dollar bills you have left in your pocket you purposely created from your $5.00 so you can play more penny slots. Instead of being left with those .16 cents ticket redemption stubs you can't even play, save those dollars to be spent in the rabbit hole- with no directory name or signs, the fun part is trying to find this place!But i'm not going to spoil your fun by telling you where this place is- but will give u one clue. If u see a pool table, you're warm. So warm, you will be burning the roof of your mouth in 5 minutes biting into that hot cheese. You've been warned.Went here after multiple drinks by the pool and it totally hit the spot!  This place is the closest I've ever come to a real NYC slice in LV.  We got a slice of cheese, pepperoni and veggie which came out to $11.75.  That's STILL less than 1 piece of shrimp next door at Blue Ribbon!  I was surprised I liked the plain slice the best.  Not that their other ones weren't good.  Sometimes great pizza doesn't need anything else but sauce and cheese.  Wish there were more places to sit but not that big a deal with so much seating in the middle area of the 3rd floor.WHO: Any one of you who are craving pizza past midnight! =)WHERE: Inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel, on the 3rd floor. It is literally A HOLE IN THE WALL! I had to ask one of the front desk men where it was! There is no sign whatsoever, so asking is the safest way!WHEN: I have no idea when it closes, but it closes late! We went at 2am, and there was still a line to order!WHY: Thin-crust pizza is the way to go, THAT'S WHY!WHAT: Standing in the line, I was looking for some sort of menu, but there actually wasn't one! I was somewhat confused because I am so used to there being a menu explaining it all!When you get up to the counter, there are toppings you can choose from to make your slice of pizza to your liking, or there are also pre-made slices you can get! I just chose one of the pre-made slices that looked pretty interesting!On my pizza, along with the mozzarella cheese, there was another type of cheese that I didn't get to remember, but it was REALLY GOOD! I also had mushrooms and green peppers.  I did get to try the White Pizza from my friend!! That was actually one of the most unique slices of pizza I have ever tried!! Instead of marinara sauce, there was some type of garlic sauce under CHEEESE, CHEESE, AND MORE CHEESE! =D*NOTE: Try it out after all that partying one night! The line might scare you off, but it's okay- the line went by fairly fast!The allure of knowing something that only the "in the know" know has played into human behavior in seeking out food and drink since the time "Joe sent me" got people through the speakeasy door. Given the pizza joint at The Cosmopolitan is not listed in any of the hotel's customer collateral nor is it advertised on property and one has to both know it is there and how to get to it, my hubby and I figured this would be more the myth of "secret place" hype than good pizza. Happily, we were wrong.Finding ourselves at the Cosmopolitan about 1:30 in the afternoon one day last week and hungry for just a little something, we went to the Pizzeria. What we discovered is this teeny place makes really good pizza. In fact, my Brooklyn born and reared hubby thought it a good rendition of New York style pizza and coming from him that is high praise. It was the chewy, foldable crust, he said, and just the right amount of sauce and cheese. A generous slice was about $3.50 so a good value for Las Vegas eats. Pies are sold whole too. The VERY little pizza shop has standing at counter space for maybe eight - and another two spaces that are low enough to be used by both people in wheelchairs and shorter people...love universal access like that. But you could not get my claustrophobic self to stay in that little space to eat, so we walked to the lobby outside the Pizzeria and enjoyed our slice in that "game room" setting with a pool table, board games, low tables, chairs and sofas scattered about and multicolored glass lit ceiling above. And here goes a nod to the very nice Security guy who walked over to talk to us. "Oh oh" I thought, "we're probably not supposed to be eating pizza here." But as it turns out, he wanted to simply ask how we liked the pizza and being from New York himself, he agreed with my hubby that it was very good indeed. He introduced himself as Chris (Cosmopolitan staff do not wear name tags - a tactic that is part of a service strategy to get the employees to introduce themselves to guests) and asked if he could answer any questions about The Cosmopolitan for us. That kind of friendly approach from customer facing employees was consistent with every one of our experiences at the hotel, by with way, with the exception of the staff at the Chandelier Bar on the second floor.  ( But that's another review.)  We made sure to leave the lobby table as clean as we found it. Pizzeria opens at 11a.m. and stays open until sometime in the wee hours of the morning. Here's how to get there (see photos included to illustrate): a) Take the elevator near the Chandelier Bar to the third floor. When the doors open you'll see the lounge with the pool table in front of you. b) Make a hard right hairpin turn as you exit the elevator and you'll be in the short hallway that leads to the tiny Pizzeria.  You'll see a pinball machine at the end of the hallway. ( If you make only a right turn as you exit the elevator, you'll end up at the hallway that dead-ends in a concourse of meeting rooms. Ask me how I know that. :-)  A hairpin right is the thing. )c) The pinball machine you'll see in front of you as you make the hairpin turn is actually at the entry to the pizza place.So there you go!  Mangia!After hanging out at the Chandelier bar my friend Ashley was wanting a soda. Not knowing where to get one at almost 3am, she said to follow her, after going up a couple of escalators and down a narrow hallway the smell of pizza hit me in the face. OMG there is a hidden pizzeria in the hotel!!  Not only does this place have no name, you'll find no signage, and no menu. It's a very no nonsense New York-style pizza counter. To find it, look for the hallway wrapped in vintage records.There was a small line that was forming when we walked up. This place is super small and had limited seats (bar stools and a long counter). You can order a whole pie of just a couple of slices. Minh D decided to indulge in his pizza craving and get a slice which he ended up sharing with me. All i can say is wow this pizza tasted wonderful and full of cheesy goodness!! Ashley ordered a rootbeer (which has unlimited refilled as long as you are eating there). That rootbeer was the best i have had in a long time. Make sure you save your change because they have a classic pinball machine there too!!SECRET GEM!!! ... literally a secret, you can't even find this pizzeria listed on the cosmo's directory!!!its a CHEAP vegas meal option on the 3rd floor cosmopolitan in between 2 fancy restaurants.. behind a large wooden door w/o any name to distinguish it!!walk down the long hall towards the pinball machine & order pizza w/ fresh olive-oil-soaked-tomatoes on it YUM & only 4 something for this thin crust slice!!!i hope this small pizza place stays a secret =)If you are anywhere near the Cosmopolitan you must grab a slice of pizza here! At $3.50 a slice and $.50 per topping, this NY style pizza is just what one needs to curb that Vegas party appetite. Even better at 3 am after playing an awesome game of craps and lovely with a coke.The service is great here and just beware that if you want a whole pizza you should call ahead. There's almost always a line no matter what time of day or night you visit this hidden pizzeria. During my four day trip to Las Vegas I came back to the pizzeria three times. Now that I'm back in Honolulu I only wish I could magically transport myself down to that little hallway. Crispy crust, amazing pepperoni and just what the doctor ordered when you're hungry and waking up in Vegas!Yelp 365 Challenge: #34/365 (The Slice)It just cracks me up that this Pizzeria is still not getting any publicity on The Cosmopolitan's own website.  But that's not such a bad thing really, as it keeps the location mysterious and 'in the know' plus it makes it kind of fun in discovering it.  The spot is literally hidden from view and the only way I found it was when I saw some dude come out from a dark hallway with a big box of pizza.  I ordered two slices and they were delicious!  You especially have to try their White Pizza with Ricotta and Mozzarella Cheese.  It was my favorite slice.  Take a look at their slices......(http://bit.ly/1CK1fbR) they're huuge NY Style thin slices.  Very good and actually pretty filling.  The slices can range from $4.50-$6 depending the toppings which are a little pricey but considering that the slices are extra large and are very tasty, the price is pretty much justified.It's nice to see more quality pizza joints open up on the Strip.  With this spot and La Pizza, I'm glad that I can pick up a slice for a cheap lunch or even for a late night snack.  If you have a big group, you definitely can't go wrong with ordering a pie from here.Move. the. hell. over, Earl of Sandwich. I found a new late-night lover and it's NY style pizza in Vegas. My girlfriend raved about this place, while I rolled my eyes and insisted we go to Earl instead. She convinced me and we walked on over after a long night at the Marquee (both conveniently located in the Cosmo) and we were all speechless after our first bite. We ordered a combo of white cheese, sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms. I've never been a HUGE fan of pizza, but this thin, wide slice was simple and flawless. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=3cIZSbjXqJxr59N_84xHKQDo you remember when Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael (TMNT) ended their adventure by tearing down a slice of ooey gooey cheese pizza? WE FELT EXACTLY LIKE THAT (or at least I did).HELLOOOOO hung over food...vhere hve uuu beeeeen?? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=18_2XSMyx0Lwl2RWNkLMpgT.H.E. place to drag your post Marquee, hung over, puked out, makeup-less ass to stuff face....if you don't mind the walk of shame, that is.  Of course there are plenty of normal ppl (Meee) lining up for the delicious NY style pizza by the slice or box. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=4NbyT2TlL2PdMyrG-0BLLA$5 per slice or $22 per box, this baby is like the 2am diiiirty hot dog on Hollywood Blvd but better. http://www.yelp.com/biz/hollywood-blvd-hotdog-vendor-hollywood#hrid:HID2ZLJ9bBGibM5yP-NX3g Don't mind the wait, chat up the stranger standing in front of you or behind you and dont' judge if someone suddenly made a mad dash out to the restroom (comes standard when you are waiting with a bunch of equally boozed out crowd).I'm actually craving for a slice right now...mmmm....pizzzaaaaaThere are no signs leading you here, but it isn't hard to find if you know what you're supposed to be looking for. I'll decode it for you: 3rd floor where the pool table is, look for the hallway dressed in album covers & voila! Secret Pizza found! The first time I came here was in Jan but since enough alcohol will erase your memory, I couldn't remember a thing about that experience...except that a certain someone I was with, in all her drunken-ness, was claiming to be heiress to the hotel & all the equally-drunk boys around us believed her...I came here again last week, this time sober & therefore, able to write a (somewhat) coherent review. I had a huge slice topped with mushroom for about $5. Thin crust, not too oily & dee-lish with a few sprinkles of garlic powder & crushed pepper flakes. Limited counter seats, so be prepared to eat standing up. Uncover this yummy secret for yourself!You really should try out this secret pizza place called Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan. I admit it. While celebrating my 25th extravaganza in Vegas last week, I am guilty of being a repeat offender of Secret Pizza. For a bunch of girls (and boys) who revolves our schedules around eating and trying new places, I would say that is quite a compliment!Here's how it all started. Before we decided to go bar crawling in the Cosmopolitan, a local friend of mine told me that I should get the white pizza at Secret Pizza. Intrigued by this mysterious pizza joint and white pizza, the gang and I headed over in our tight dresses to devour some deliciousness. Being greedy as ever, I decided to go for their famed white slice and a combo. Halfway through, I realized my stomach is much smaller than I thought and had a difficult time finishing. The unique taste of the white pizza (composed of 3 different types of cheeses) had my taste buds jumping for joy but the familiar taste of the combo had me equally impressed.Secret Pizza makes me feel like I'm so "in the know". From the outside, no one would know what the hallway leads to. For those who rarely ventures off into random hallways, well that's their loss! I plan on coming back next time I'm in Vegas, so yelper's-- please keep the long lines as short as possible by keeping this place a secret!I remember VERY LITTLE of how, when, and where exactly the "Secret Pizza" place was, but I do remember the delicious aftermath.  After finding the "secret" hallway, we stormed in like gangbusters, asked the nice pizza man what was "good"  to which he rightfully suggested his own "meat lover's" version -- a seemingly off-the-menu creation concocted of pepperoni, sausage, peperoncinis, some other kind of meat, and some other stuff I'm failing to remember.  It was SO DAMN GOOD -- the not-so-soggy thin crust was absolutely what we needed, so much, that it got the stamp of approval from the two Manhattanites I was...ahem...dining with.  This WHOLE PIZZA easily fed 3 inebriated people or would feed about 37 models, 4 normal people or 15 people on a diet.  It should be noted that the two latter classes of people really don't belong in Vegas anyway.There is minimal seating inside, but you can take your pizza "to-go" and park it on one of the Cosmo's luxurious couch seating areas in the hall right outside.  Beer and wine only.Secret 1 - Yes, I was trying to look you in the eyes, but I'm a man and my eyes tend to stray.Secret 2 - I'm a bit shy.  So buy me alcohol and I'll open up a bit.Secret 3 - If you are female and I left you a compliment, it's likely I think you are cute.  Not so for men.No more secrets!!  I've given too much away--unless you go the Secret 2 route.Service - 5 StarsCleanliness - ExcellentPrice - Approximately $26.00 (The soon to be brother-in-law paid).Seafood - ??Meats - YesVegetables - YesDessert - Yes, Cannoli & New York Cheesecake.Fruits - N/AOther - (1) Located on Level 3 of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, (2) You will find it between Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill and Jaleo. (3) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here.  (4) Papst Blue Ribbon Beer is on tap here.  (5) Avoid the times 1 am to 5 am because that is the busiest times--that is when all The Situations and J Wowws come out from Marquee.  What was Ordered:Pizza with 4 toppings ($26.00) - A-Okay (3 Stars) - My sister and fiancé chose a 3 topping pizza.  One side was pepperoni and green peppers pizza.  The other side was sausage and roasted garlic.  All pizza here is thin crust and the large pizza has 8 large slices.  Here is the breakdown by slice:*The Crust - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - You are looking at approximately a 14" diameter of thin crust with tomato sauce and melted cheese.  One word comes to mind, "greasy."  *Sausage and Roasted Garlic - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - The sausage was good, but I think the Roasted Garlic was forgotten--maybe that's why they charged us the 3 topping price.  Plus, I do not think they gave us enough of the sausage per slice to make it more fulfilling.*Pepperoni and Green Peppers - A-Okay (3 Stars) - Probably the best combination of toppings that made the pizza tasty.  The pepperoni tasted like it was suppose to.  What brought this slice up a notch was the flavor of the roasted green peppers.  The Secret Pizza is really in a nondescript location--with no signage at all.  If you are near a random billiards table, you are in the right place.  The place is A-Ok, but I've experienced better.  Maybe if I was crazy drunk and just got out of the club, this place would have been rated higher.  Unfortunately, I'm sober.The secret is that it's really just OK pizza. Typical greasy under-the-heat-lamp pizza that tastes delicious if you're drunk but just all-right if you're sober. The flavors are as-is for the most part but you can accessorize for a price. The best part about coming here is that it is a secret - no signs or special doors, just a hallway. You feel special just to find it, along with the other, yeap I'm gonna say it, hipsters. IPA and PBR are flowing as well as wine and soda. Pinball machines are in check.About a year ago, I was aimlessly strolling thru the Cosmopolitan, taking in all the beauty that the hotel has to offer.  While walking around the Chandelier Bar on the upper floors, I stumbled across a long hallway lined with album covers, with a questionable ending.  What could be at the end? Narnia? Or the Springfield Mystery Spot, complete with Ozzie Smith? Of course, being the quizzical individual that I am, I walked down the hallway.  Couldn't believe what I saw...a walk-up pizza joint!Anyway, with over 500 reviews, I don't know how this is a secret anymore.  No sign, no advertising, but excellent NY-style pizza.  At $4.50/slice, with the Strip-markup, it's a pretty good value for wasteepants late-night munchies.  And if you're not ready to end the rager, they have beer and I think, boxed wine.This is obviously a place to go after a night throwin elbows at the club.  At times, I've seen the line full of button-down shirts, fist pumps, sky-high heels, and dresses that leave little to the imagination.  Sometimes the line is long, which is understandable given its popularity.  But they try their best to keep the line moving swiftly.I'm glad I stumbled onto this place, as it has become a staple when I visit.   I applaud the Cosmopolitan for this inspired idea.Who doesn't love a slice of warm, greasy, cheesy, goodness at 3am?Late night study session, putting the finishing touches on a major presentation, hard night of clubbing, end of a 24 hour session of hard core grinding on the green felt.  You crave it.  You gotta have it.  Once you do, you're smiling and loving life.That said Secret Pizza is more about the experience than food.  Decent New York style thin crust with a good balance of quality ingredients.  Tasty sausage, good quality cheeses, ripe acidic tomatoes.  Generous toppings but not overloaded.  Never too out there combos (ie,  CPK).  Is it the best pie in the US?  NO.  Not even the best in Vegas.  Inexpensive for the Strip (less than $5 a slice).  You get to play the cool, adventurer as you seek out it's goodness (exactly what the Cosmo is all about).  The best part, you can take your slice and eat it while walking through the casino and watch the envious drool.  One of them might even ask you where you got it.  The answer is obvious, "it's a secret".Sometimes, to experience the adventure is more important than the food.Recommended.I'm not good at keeping secrets, especially when it comes to food.But I'm gonna try my best in this review. Secret Pizza is a small joint, located down a long, secret hallway lined with music record covers on the third floor of the ___________hotel. Since SP is not listed on the hotels website or in their directory, nor do they have any signs indicating they are even a buisness, they can be hard to locate. Since SP is open till the wee hours of the morning, most people usually stumble in here in the early AM to cure their drunken munchies. Not me though. I stumbled in here right when they opened at 11am to cure my I just woke up and I'm hungry as hell munchies. All they serve here is pizza and beer. Simple. Delicious. You can buy your pie whole or by the slice. These are the slices my wife and I bought;1 white pizza slice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=24ppCiDbltVR9nt4spAUFQ1 sausage & pepperoni slice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=UGqPkyYuVIsLsjIN-UaEkg1 sausage & Pepperchini slice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=AwEEKS68Y2WnPRDIJYzHNgSince we got there right after they opened, each slice was just coming out of the oven. After waiting a few minutes to let the huge slices cool, I remember my girl Michelle T's warning about burning my mouth, my wife and I dug in. All three slices were great. They had lots of cheese and toppings, flavorful sauce and a nice, crispy crust. At $5 a slice, this is a great spot for a quick, tasty meal. If you can find SP, you definitely need to check it out. Just look for this hallway http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=JHsPAfv3yu3RrFNFO9qzFgI don't care how good yelpers think this pizza is.As long as they have those dehumanizingly long lines to get food, they are odorus cow-dung to me.If I had this business, I'd realize that the demand outstrips the supply, and following basic economics 101, (which obviously the owner did not take in college, if he even WENT to college), would lead me to open a second restaurant, somewhere else, to take care of the overflow.Man, I hate stupidity!If the lines at 3:00am are any indication, Secret Pizza is THE WORST KEPT SECRET in Vegas.  If the first rule of Secret Pizza is to not talk about Secret Pizza (right Yvette??  Haha), someone definitely wasn't paying attention!  Not that I have a problem that they did...because now I can write my review without having to feel guilty about it.Tucked away on the third floor and with no signage to point it out, finding the entrance is to literally look for a hole in the wall.  Once you do though, it's just a short trip down a hallway until you find yourself in a small room and in front of their pizza counter inside.  They offer a variety of pizzas by the slice at any given time, as well as whole pies that you can customize.  Since there was about ten of us there, we opted for two large pizzas - one with pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom, while the second had mushrooms, sausage, and green peppers (I think...didn't try that one).All in all, the pizzas were pretty solid.  There was a generous amount of tasty toppings and I liked how there wasn't a ton of sauce.  I certainly wouldn't say it's the best pizza out there, but it was good and a lot better than I had expected.  The best part of all though was their prices - at about $4-5 a slice and $22 for a three topping pizza, they're comparable to what regular pizzerias would charge and definitely budget friendly for the Strip.  As far as late night/post-partying food options go, Secret Pizza is a solid bet.  BTW, a word of advice from my friend - in your potentially inebriated state, try to remember to wait before taking that first bite.  You might not feel all that hot oil burning your mouth when you're drunk, but you'll definitely feel it when you wake up the next day ("Dude, my tongue REALLY HURTS").Review #700!  I love NYC pizza with a deep, lustful passion.  It plagues my dreams, calls out to me through windows with its seductive aroma, and makes me yearn for the next cheesy slice.  Secret Pizza is a place in Las Vegas that serves it.  My friend Grace C. went last year when Cella R. told her about it.  Ever since then, I've been plotting my return to Vegas and partaking in this secretive pizza joint.  My fellow elite Yelpers and I made our way over to the Cosmopolitan after a YEE at the Cathouse and ordered 2 pizzas ($50 total): one white pizza and one half pepporoni/ half sausage & mushroom.  It came out to about $5 per person.  Secret Pizza is located up on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan food court next to the sushi restaurant down an unmarked hallway.  There are white tiles and picture frames welcoming you into this unremarkable looking pizza place.  We ordered our pizzas around midnight and got them about 30 minutes after.  It seemed like forever to a slightly inebriated and starving person such as myself.  I was hungry and watching others get their slices before I did, was excruciatingly painful.  Drew M. started to play Donkey Kong while waiting.  Watching his arcade game progression only made me hungrier.  Where was this pizza anyway?!  Why didn't I just order a damn slice?!  Oh wait, there it is.  We brought it outside to the sofas & coffee table.  We dug in.  Silence.  Everyone is chewing and gulping their pizza in a very methodical fashion.  Delicious garlicky white pizza with greasy pepperoni pizza.  I was in heaven.  Was it the best pizza I've ever had?  No, nothing compares to real NYC pizza in NYC, but it comes close.  Too bad the crust wasn't as crispy as I would have liked but the flavor of the white pizza still makes me drool as I write this.  Pizza is the perfect food in the wee hours of the morning when all you want is carbs.  Thanks for making my pizza dreams come true, if only for the night!Secret pizza is the shit. Sober or drunk, it's worth the wait and the ridiculous conversations and interactions from all the sloppy mcsloppersons standing in line for a slice makes it quite entertaining as well. I liked the pepperoni, but I loved the white pizza with ricotta, mushrooms (?) and pepperoni! Just get a whole pizza for your group instead of ordering individual slices, because they're like the Pringles of the pizza world, once you pop you can't stop.For months I have wanted to sample the pizza inside the not so secret back room at The Cosmopolitan, but just never got around to it before now.  But once Tropfest ended, the planets finally aligned, and Diane and I quickly left the Boulevard Pool via escalator and easily found our way to this highly touted haven of late-night pizza at last.  The line to order was fairly long even after 1:00 a.m. on a Monday.    And, I quickly learned that if pizza slices rather than a full pie are sought, what you are able to get totally depends on what comes out of the pizza ovens just before one's order is placed.  But luck was with us on this visit, for we were able to buy fresh hot slices of pepperoni, sausage, and cheese pizza, plus commandeer two adjoining seats at the counter to be able to eat while sitting down.  Although I might have preferred slices of pepperoni & mushroom pizza, no such combination was available when I reached the head of the line.  But getting to try three out of four flavors is pretty good!I was really pleased with this pizza.  My expectations were high going in, but they were exceeded.  The crust was nice and buttery, with no char on the bottom.  While the wide slices were relatively thin, they were not noticeably so, and the nicely finished crust was chewy, resilient, and foldable.  All slices were just saucy enough, and really cheesy and tasty.  Pepperoni was lightly spicy, and sausage was very mild, just as pizza maker Luigi had indicated when I asked him on my way through the line.  A small amount of grease was present, but to me that was a good thing for this New York style pizza.  Even though they had come out of the oven just a few minutes before I reached the cash register, each slice was given a little more fire before they were handed to me.  So they were hot and gooey, and a true treat to consume whether drunk or sober.  For, I loved this pizza, and unlike many other guests, had only water to drink all night.  In fact, the Secret Pizza establishment graciously offers free cold water out of a dispenser, with plastic cups and utensils provided as well.  Besides probably being the cheapest meal available inside a Strip hotel, IMHO the Secret Pizza likely serves the best pizza on The Strip, and is neck and neck with Biaggio's and Metro Pizza, and just a shade behind Dom DeMarco's, for the best pizza served in the entire Las Vegas valley.  Next time I will be ordering a whole pie!I'm going solely off slice standards here. Fast (if you're just buying by the slice, not if you're ordering a whole pie), decently priced (for Vegas standards) and pretty tasty.Go with the white slice.  I thought it was white sauce (cream) but it was actually no red sauce, cheese, ricotta. Pretty good. I liked being able to add stuff to it (additional 50 cents per topping) but I wish they had some bacon. Better than the traditional pepperoni w/ red sauce that's for sure. And yea, it's thin crust and ultra greasy. If you're going to complain about grease, don't bother eating pizza. Do the world a favor and eat a damn salad with no dressing okay? I don't get why people order an entire pie and then whine and moan that it takes up to an hour. IT'S A FREAKING ENTIRE PIZZA IT'S NOT GOING TO BE READY IN 5 MINUTES PEOPLE. USE YOUR BRAIN.BOMB.com right here!  When you find it that is...Follow the chandelier up and then take the escalator up one level from Marquee.  Then follow your nose to the scent of PIZZA!!!!!!  (look for the hallway of vinyl)F that! I never get just a slice here, I always buy a pie, a whole one at that!  That way you can get half red sauce and half white!  Add your appropriate toppings and voila!  Dine inside or grab a seat by the pool table outside and watch all these people looking at you eating your huge slices!  The pizza here is really good and I actually favor the white.HOLLA!Secret Pizza is one of those establishments that really needs no introduction. At first glance, it is quiet, discrete, and no frills. Yet when you dig deeper and get to know its personality you find something so much more. I am a firm believer that every establishment has room for improvement. However, when I think about it long and hard Secret Pizza really epitomizes all I would want or come to expect of a pizza establishment. I almost dare say that it was the best pizza I have ever had. Nestled in the Cosmopolitan, you would think it would be flashy and glitzy. Rather, it defies that convention and it sits in a nondescript hallway that you would easily bypass. Not that I am saying you should go down every service hallway at the Cosmopolitan, I'm just saying taking the Star Trek like elevator to the third floor above the Chandelier Bar and walk down the nondescript hallway till you find Secret Pizza. Note, the hallway has photos on it to give you some direction.Once there, you will be greeted by the beautiful smell of pizza. While slices are available in the showcase, full pizza's are available as well. I'd probably call ahead if that is the case just to avoid having to wait. Since we didn't know any better, we settled on a simple pepperoni pizza. However as we waited to order, the guy working the counter clearly could tell we wanted a white pizza as well and mentioned that we could have a half pepperoni/half white pizza and it came out to be one of the best decisions we made in Vegas. The pepperoni was really good, but the white pizza was much better. Both offered really great flavors that melded in a perfect harmony that would make angels sing. The pepperoni has just the right amount of salt and spice to counteract the fat and sweetness of the mozzarella. While at the same time the white pizza was an amazingly good blend of ricotta and mozzarella cheese. Both on a thin crust that was easy to work with, yet not being very greasy at all. Service was good with the staff clearly not only knowing their menu but also clearly having skill when it comes to making their pies. They keep the line moving at a carefully timed rate as if it were a well-made machine.Definitely a great place to grab a bite, while they may not have seating grab a glass of wine or beer with the pie and head on out to the main areas. It is definitely one bite you do not want to miss."Get fcuked up, and eat pizza" - Old Eugine ProverbSome old Chinese fool tried to jack that shit from me and use it as his own.I'm going to lay it down on how to get to this place.   Do not deviate from these directions.-Walk by all the squealing Asian girls coming out of the club that think they're cuter than they actually are.  Actually...thinking they're cute at all is wrong.-Five steps past the white girls riding the escalator barefoot.  -Make a right when you see the Latinas showing off their newly acquired neck art ... hickies.-And when you see an angry black chick....run the other way.  Fcuk the pizza.Was the pizza really that good?  I don't remember.  My buddy liked it. I guess I did too.  Not as much as the Reyka tonics I was guzzling down at a frantic pace earlier. Evidently I waxed two slices, made it back to the room, and gracefully blacked out.   I woke up in the middle of the night with a shivering case of mud butt.  That means two things:  1. It was greasy2. It was goodI do faintly recall burping up pepperoncinis while on the throne.  I love those things.  Both the pepperoncinis and the porcelain La-Z-Boy.4 gleaming stars might be a bit too generous, but hell, aren't you all generous and shit when you get shitfaced?  Yeah...thought so."Secret Pizza" is not the name of this pizzeria.  It actually has no name, but Secret Pizza will suffice for now.It should be obvious by now that Secret Pizza is probably the worst-kept secret in Las Vegas.  Since everyone knows where it is already, I'll just go ahead and spill the beans -- Cosmopolitan hotel, third floor, tucked between Jaleo and Blue Ribbon Sushi, down the short corridor lined with vintage album covers.Okay, now that I said it, don't kill me, please?  This isn't Fight Club, right?I wasn't joking when I said everyone knows about Secret Pizza already.  The lines to eat here are obscene.  It's most popular in the middle of the night, when the post-Marquee crowd drops by to feed their drunken munchies.  However, when a group of us dropped by at 2pm in the afternoon, we still had to wait over 30 minutes just to reach the cashier.  Not that I minded waiting.  I could spend hours looking at the collection of vintage albums.  There's also pinball.  The pizzeria itself is decked out in gleaming white subway tile, in fitting with the New York theme.We shared a variety of red slices, some plastic cups of PBR, and a slice of cheesecake.  While the pizza was fresh and delicious, it was doused in enough grease to make the paper plate translucent in no time.  (Remember that episode of the Simpsons when Bart rubs his pizza on the wall and then the wall turns clear?  Yeah, like that.)  There is barely any seating inside the pizzeria, so we carried all of the grub to the lounge area outside.At $5 a slice, it's expensive, but not unreasonably so.  A better deal is ordering a whole pie.  I recommend that if everyone in your group can agree on a single topping.All in all, Secret Pizza is a solid place to go -- if for no other reason than being able to help all the other confused tourists who are curious to find out where you got your pizza and beer from.  :-)The first rule of Secret Pizza is: YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT SECRET PIZZA.Seriously, guys, the wait is getting ridiculous.Tips:- For full pies, call in your order for pick up in 30 mins.- It may smell irresistible, but do fight the urge to eat immediately. Otherwise, suffer from pizza palate.- Best spot for drunk people watching.This place is amazing. I'm not sure if i loved it so much because of how much i drank or if it really is as good as i remember but either way it hit the spot! 4 friends and i were leaving a concert at the boulevard pool and decided to finally try this place out. We got a large cheese pizza with banana peppers and sun dried tomatoes as toppings. So good. It was a bit greasy but after blotting that away it was near perfect. some of the best pizza in Vegas for sure. I like the whole gimmick of it being a "secret" too.Shhhh! Let me tell you a Secret about Secret Pizza....Secrets**Their White Pizza is off the hook!*Crust? Crazy Crispy Crust! Crunch with every bite!*SP is located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo*SP is open till Mon, Fri-Sun 11 am - 5 am Tue-Thu 11 am - 4 am*IPA Beer in tap*SP is really small! But who the "f" cares when your hungry!*SP sell by whole or by the slice.Secret Pizza Rocks ! Great place to grab a quick bite!My LV Trip Bookmark #2Let me get the logic behind Secret Pizza.  They're opened to 4-5 a.m.  The drunk and partially drunk slur their way in to get that "sober me up munchies" on.  Wouldn't you want a sign up to attract more customers?  How passively cruel is that to the wobbly and incoherent?   Wandering like zombies seeking to feed, one could only chuckle at the priceless visual as they search for Secret Pizza.  Contrarians (sober people) would say signs would defeat the purpose of their marketing goal...it wouldn't be called SECRET PIZZA...logic is never logic if drunk.Through the corridor on the right of the Japanese restaurant within the Cosmopolitan, you'll find Secret Pizza.  There I said it.  If that's not enough, you're probably too drunk to even eat.  Within this hallway is a massive collection of interesting prints of musicians.  I think they were musicians.  The pizza aroma pulled my attention away from the pictures.    My monstrous hunger, which developed from searching the menu, told me to get two slices.  Give up looking for a poster board list menu or what have you.  Just ask, because there are none.  Peering down through the glass, I eventually chose the meat lovers and the cheese with white sauce.  Pizzas are the thin crust.  My crusts were a tad burnt on the edges after the oven warm up; each crispy bite was filled with a healthy (so to speak) dose of cheese and ingredients.  Both slices were delicious.  Both had surprisingly good taste considering since they were just thrown into an oven and reheated for a minute.  No time for a sit down dinner, want a quick slice (or whole pizza), or need some grease to relieve your drunkenness.  Secret Pizza can be a strong option.  That is, if you can find it.Everybody knows that I love Pizza!  I also love the Cosmopolitan.  So, when I heard they had a Secret Pizza joint, I couldn't wait to give it a try.  I resisted the temptation to ask for help to find it and spent a good 2 hours looking for this place.  I finally gave up and asked an employee who gave me directions....they're not supposed to do that, LOL.The setup is like the typical street-side quick Pizza joints you find in major city downtown areas.  The Pizzas are pre-cooked and warmed up to order by the Slice or by the Pie.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=Z-z_DCestFY90vmHPj-iSg#Z-z_DCestFY90vmHPj-iSghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=LXFr4Kgn5aUPTV8pxEqIzQ#LXFr4Kgn5aUPTV8pxEqIzQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=JFQEuBrHJcjMJ1lqP_1HHg#JFQEuBrHJcjMJ1lqP_1HHgI ordered a Slice of Pepperoni & Sausage, my 'go to' order.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=Fk3XJrpND-_-Bu0XGSCbug#Fk3XJrpND-_-Bu0XGSCbugThe Pizza was reheated to a very hot temp and served on a paper plate.  The flavor was very good.  The Sausage slightly overpowered the Pepperoni, but they complimented each other well.Overall, it was a good experience and the Pizza was above average.Return Factor - 100%For someone who thinks pizza is overrated, I really like this place. But then again I've never been here sober and I probably never will.This is my go-to spot after drinking and dancing all night on the strip. I love the not-so-secret-now location and telling my out of towner friends all about it. I really love any pizza with the meatballs and I always have them add some pepperoncini's (sp) to it.The line can be hit or miss, but I've never waited less than 10-15 minutes every time I go there. It's just a fact of life that you're gonna have to wait a while so don't come here expecting prompt service. At least they have record covers of Italian musicians for you to stare at if you don't feel like staring at the fellow patrons in line. I was reminded that Madonna is Italian and learned that Chuck Mangione is a real person and not just a recurring character on King of the Hill. I tell you hhhwhat.LOVE THIS PLACE but if you don't know where you're going you'll never find it.  Rule number one of secret pizza, TELL EVERYONE!  Start by looking for the pool tables on the third floor, then search for a dark corridor lined with framed records that leads to a pinball machine, walk down said corridor and voila you're there...or you can just ask someone. LOL!This pizza joint is down an unassuming hallway close to the Marquee Nightclub. After a night of drinking, this is definitely a place to go. I don't think you can go wrong with any pizza here especially if you are buzz. The pizza costs $5 per slice and it's worth it!There were plenty of seating and  a big lounge area outside of the parlor. If Marquee is not popping, the wait is minimal and you can feel a bit more relax while scarfing down the slices. If it is, be ready to wait a bit!There's no signage so look for a hallway covered with records!We lost a good one; Ms Winnie H...  Vanished, kaput, finito, so long wherever you may be.  Such good things never last where all traces have disappeared and have gone without merit.  Secrets are kept and reasons retained under lock and key.  Whatever it may be, I dedicate this one to thee.After seeing so many reviews of this worst kept Vegas secret, I finally ventured up two flights of escalators in the City of Sin, where whispers stay and never leave closed lips.  The Cosmopolitan hide-out comes to light as one ventures down a dingy hallway of framed magazine covers dimly lit by spotlight halogen lights (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#4bjZhYMwuBLPOZoW6DI9MA).  It's but a small 60'x60' room filled with a few pinball wizards and people patiently waiting for a slice of heavenly pie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=o7wcJPIoRt13Dx7coGNEtw#o7wcJPIoRt13Dx7coGNEtw).  Behind the counter, workers pound and toss their gooey dough (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#lW79LoJSUg1RwIPrp_kAKw), making sliced triangles ranging from $4.50 on up based on 50 cents a topping.  For those with a more voracious appetite a pie be available with prices ranging from $25 to a deluxe of $35.00.  Pie additions cost $2.50 each.  Quite expensive, but not on my "Lost Wages" radar, as I wanted it by the slice and by the slice I did receive.  The toppings looked plain and just nominally adequate as they sit in their aluminum bins just waiting to be tossed sporadically on round pie pans laid with golden flour.  The prices of drinks are on par with private Taoish bars:  Sodas 4 bucks, IPAs 7 bucks.  Good Ol' PBR sewer agua a ghastly 5 bucks.We asked the chef what be best in his opinion.  Although we weren't really impressed with what was presented, we opted to go with his picks of white, deluxe, and veggie-tar-e-yan (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#VpTrXV0-B3IXvr2iCQiTtQ) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#ns2AT1cd63Rihd8BiVwDqw) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#Kh_DKlGnEKPQcgDBnzmw2g) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#yYP2x9gRAHoDEx9R5E_1dw).   Various choices to choose:(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#qCog__OGMqN2fhJxaHZx7w)(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#q3VPFuV-SQjXhIab6f_9aQ)We paid and waited just as patiently as others, noticing everyone kept within their small cliques, or busily eying their mobiles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#c9cbpz6hdIG_qINg5huokg).  The slices returned to the broiler and there they sat, until our names were called and then it begat!No idea if I be drunk or needed to be buzzin' to enjoy these hot tempting pie slices, but whatever it was, it really worked for me.  It was but a warm slice of heaven that was on par with some of the best I've put in my mouth without worrying about spitting up some hairball.  The crust was just crisp enough with the flexibility of NY-stylin' that wrapped around my hand.  Just enough grease and just enough cheese, the deluxe was nothing but 5-star tasting'.  We ate at the small alcove bar to take in and enjoy the happening surroundings.  I actually think the re-heating is probably the key to getting the crust texture just right.It was such a pleasure to finally unravel your secret, and while the surroundings are a bit crewed, as long as you're with friends or loved ones this place can satisfy any of your late night whims.  I will loyally keep the secret of this unnamed hallway as faithfully as a yelper should.  The last buck stops here (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA)!This place totally IS a secret. I had no idea where they were. I knew they were in the COSMOPOLITAN but once I got in I couldn't find them. There are no signs that point to their location that I knew of. The establishment itself didn't even have a sign upon entering. I found out that they were LOCATED on the 3rd floor of the cosmo. There is an entrance hallway next to the pool table and escalators. I should have looked on the yelp reviews but I didn't so I just asked a hotel worker. The ENVIRONMENT was exactly what I expected, SMALL with no tables to sit. They have a counter and that's about it. They do have an arcade machine which kept my son entertained while we waited. This place gets really busy so you will have to take your food to go (Don't know where though) or eat standing up. The SERVICE was not a good experience.  We were the only ones there at the time we walked in and we had no greeting whatsoever. Then, it took about a couple minutes for someone to even take our order. Next came the over promising. Since I ordered an entire pie, I was told that there was a pie in the oven and it would be about 10 minutes. That pie that was in the oven...you know the one the guy said was for us...well, it did not go to us. Nor did the second pie. On the third pie, we had to go back to the counter and remind them we were still waiting.  Only then did finally we get it. No apology. That is my pet peeve.   The QUALITY of the PIZZA was such a disappointment.  Since there were 5 of us, we just ordered the entire pie because it was a better value. Each slice is about 5 dollars and the entire pie is about 27 dollars depending on which one you get.  Our choice was pepperoni.  I understand that sometimes people can order the wrong item but, in this case, I doubt it would have made any difference.  First, their pizza is thin crust which is fine. I like thin crust pizza but the crust is very soft and limp which made it hard to eat. Kinda like a new yorker but worse..almost uncooked.  It just kept flapping all over the place and going limp just prior to getting in my mouth. Second, it was very very oily. I'm talking about Pizza Hut type sprayed on oil dipped in more oil. I had pizza juice running all over my hands and mouth.  Some of you might like that, which is totally cool but not for me. I am going to give it two stars though because I don't think I can ever give any pizza joint 1 star. Plus, the employees did speak in a friendly manner. Even though they did not serve us well.  Bottom line is, the name matches perfectly. Nobody should know about this place.I love this place! When you're wandering through the Cosmo, feeling broke as a joke after a night of gambling and/or partying, what a sight for sore eyes this place will be... once you find it, of course! Once you make your way through the narrow corridor lined with record covers, you'll approach what may be the most deliciously crispy pizza crust in all of Las Vegas!The prices are dirt cheap, the people are friendly, and they're open til 4am. How can I keep something so wondrous a secret???While walking around the Cosmopolitan hotel after a long night of partying, clubbing, gambling or lounging around, chances are that you'd probably be hankering for something quick and that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. (And chances are, you may have already lost an arm and a leg at one of the tables).In probably the worst kept secret about the hotel, Secret Pizza (honestly, I think the place has no official name and "Secret Pizza" just sorta became the de facto name over time) offers people from all walks of life a slice of New York styled pizza at reasonable prices in one of the swankier hotels on the Strip.Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan and tucked away in the restaurant area (read, baller food court), you'll see a hallway that could pass as a restroom access area. If you smell pizza and you see some old vinyls decorating the walls, you're on the right track. Just keep going and you'll soon be in line for pizza, made available essentially all day. You can also tell you're in the area once you start seeing more people walking or sitting around with pizza on paper plates.Secret Pizza has a couple pinball machines to keep people preoccupied a bit, as they scarf down that 'za. The quality (particularly of the pepperoni) is pretty damn comparable to New York styled pizza (for all I know, they could have brought some of the water to Las Vegas).A big slice and a drink can run you just shy of $10 bucks, which isn't bad, considering where you're at. They also serve beer, served in red plastic cups, naturally. After all, you need to keep that party mentality going back at the suite, right?My only suggestion is that the place consider a wider beer selection and offer glasses to drink out of. There's a considerable difference in drinking beer out of a plastic cup versus drinking out of a glass. Outside of that, I realized that it's the place's secretive location in a nice resort and design that has made it one of the best known places for a late night slice.This place is too good to keep it a secret!! It is hidden on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, but just follow your nose and you'll find it. What makes Secret Pizza so good is the crust. It was a NY style thin crust, but it was so crispy and flaky, and not soggy at all. I wish I could have tried the Sicilian deep dish pizza, but they didn't have any cooked at the time. Next time I'm in Vegas I will absolutely be back!!This place really is a secret!Approaching my Vegas trip, a friend told me to check out this place in the Cosmopolitan hotel.  I don't know how he found out about it, but apparently this place had really good pizza and was hidden somewhere in the Cosmo.  Oh it was hidden all right.  When I jumped on the Cosmopolitan hotel website to find a list of their restaurants....no listing for this place.  Luckily I stumbled on it here on Yelp, listed as "Secret Pizza".I followed other reviewers' directions and hints for finding the place: it's down a sorta-hidden hallway next to the pool tables on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo.  We could smell pizzas in the oven once we got to the 3rd floor, so we knew we were in the right place.  Even in the hotel there was no mention of this pizza place and no signs pointing towards it.  Even the restaurant is unnamed!But my friend was right, the pizza was delicious (although I think its novelty partially adds to the taste, haha)!  Crispy crust, fresh-tasting dough, and a delicious blend of cheese/sauce as topping!  I got the white pizza (feta and mozzerella cheeses instead of tomato sauce) with mushrooms on it.  I guess because mushrooms aren't a super popular topping, the chef just put raw mushrooms on a slice of white pizza before sending it through the oven to heat it up.  It's okay; still super good!!White pizza with mushrooms - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=RcmzA0Mj4T73Ytmdtj-ByQ#RcmzA0Mj4T73Ytmdtj-ByQWe lucked out coming in at 2pm, which I guess isn't part of the lunch crowd, so there wasn't a line.  However, I've heard there can be a pretty long line for this place, especially in the wee hours of the morning when the nightclubbers come out of Marquee.Good luck! :)Secret pizza is delicious. Definitely a hidden gem... Although I don't know if it is really a secret anymore, as any time I go there there's a line around the block. I'll admit waiting in line can be fun. The late night line (the only kind I've been in) is usually filled with drunken out of Towners and club goers. Everyone is usually is fun spirits, don't expect to make laying friendships, but definitely a enjoyable way to wait for your turn. Staff is fun & friendly, major respect to them for that. I'd hate dealing with all the drunks, if I weren't drunk myself that is. The pizza speaks for itself, simply delicious. If you are at the Cosmo, hungry and have some time, this is the place for you.Went here on the recommendation of a couple of my Yelp friends (CD and Evelyn). It's located in the Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor, but unless you ask someone that works there, you may have difficulty finding it, since there are no signs indicating what it is, or where it is. The entrance is just a long hallway that looks like it may lead to a restroom, but surprise - at the end of the hallway is a small pizza kitchen. Seating can be sparse, so be prepared to eat while standing.  I don't know if it's my timing or what, but many times, when I visit an establishment, there are only a handful of people around. 10 minutes later, the place gets seemingly packed. That was the case here too. Got a slice of both the White Pizza, and the Sausage Pepperoni. I can't write too much about the White Pizza, because it's irresistable and now I feel compelled to drive all the way to the strip from Summerlin, just for a slice. It's that good! It's funny observing some of the people in line - the closer they get to the cash register, the more they seem like they are drooling, Lol! As I was leaving, I noticed one of the pizza cooks pulling a deep-dish white pizza out of the oven. Oh... I want that!!! must... delay... gratification...  :P~~Psst...over here, pal. Youz like da slices do youz? Well, here's a little secret just between youz and me pal ... Down a non-descript hallway lined with album covers in the Cosmopolitan Hotel youz can find Secret Pizza. No matter how much you lose in Vegas, save $5 for some 5-star pizza. Shanon Y. was right about the White Sauce Cheese Pizza. It's a pizzagasm in your mouth of grease, cheese, and crust. There is only enough room for a few places to stand and eat at Secret Pizza ... Lots of families and groups were buying whole pies and chowing down in the hallways and lounge areas. It has no sign. It has no name, but the secret is out about Secret Pizza.Located on the third floor by the pool table in the Cosmo, you'll find a long dark hallway flanked with vintage record covers leading to a small pizza joint serving freshly baked pizza pies. It's really no secret that the secret pizza puts out some of the best late night eats this side of the strip! But most importantly, if you're staying at the Cosmo, there's no need to trek out in inclement weather or battle the strip crowd for good grub either.  Thankfully, on the late night I stumbled in, the line wasn't too obnoxiously long. Be warned, on certain nights when the Marquee or Chelsea has an event, you could be waiting for quite awhile for your slice, so plan accordingly! Overall, the pizzas are very tasty. Thinly sliced NYC style (for you to fold and eat)with a variety of topping options. My personal favorites are the works and white pizzas. They've got loads of condiments like oregano, granulated garlic, cheese, chili flakes etc for you to customize your pies, well. Happy Eats!$5 a slice!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=X6KFkFPwPA8My53L3XTX4g#X6KFkFPwPA8My53L3XTX4gSure them be some damn good slices of NY style pie, but damn Gina, even in Vegas $5 felt a bit steep for cheese and bread. Just know that if you go on any busy night, it will be a long wait in a long hallway. Bring some drinks or something to kill the time. If the line is out of the hall, expect to wait almost an hour for above average $5 a slice pizza.Secret Pizza, you sneaky little devil. This pizza joint, if I recall, is located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan. Once you step off the escalator, look for a nondescript hallway, no signs, no nothing but  quite possibly a looong line of people. Congratulations, you've unlocked their "secret" venue, now prepare yourself for a good 30 minute wait. I won't lie. It's pretty much torture, especially if you've found yourself here after club hours like myself. You can try your best to entertain yourself with the semi-neato-skeeto album covers but who are we kidding, anytime you get a whiff of that delicious pizza or someone exits the venue and walks past you in that narrow hallway, you're reminded how you're STILL in line and STILL not stuffing your piehole with, well, pie.After you've managed to snake yourself to the end of the hallway, you can start eyeballing which pie is destined to be yours, individual slices or a whole pie? I opted for the latter and had to wait longer but it was worth it. I got half mushroom & pepperoni and the other half was ricotta and garlic. I enjoyed both types immensely but favored the white pizza and would gladly bathe in slices of this pizza - so good! Uber good!!Pizza had a nice chewiness and the cheese was cheesy goodness. Definitely hit the spot! I ordered a large pizza and ducked out to one of the open tables just to the left upon exiting the hallway and inhaled my little slice of heaven.Oh, by the way. You might see some unusual happenings while in line. For instance, one girl got to the cashier, turned around, lifted her dress and shook what her mama gave her. My friend and I turned to look at each other and mentally said, "Did you just see that?" while one other patron yelled out "Does that get you free toppings?" Hahah, we all laughed.Anyway, duty called (boyfriend back in hotel room patiently waiting) so I paraded out of The Cosmopolitan and made my way over to MGM. Unfortunately BF was passed out, sad story for him, but happy ending for me: I plopped down in our living room and helped myself to another slice :)So my verdict?Worth the wait? Unfortunately yes.Will I come back? Oh you betcha'Will I save pizza for the next morning? No, it's definitely better hot... unless you have access to a microwave!Authentic New York Pizza hidden in an uber modern, posh Las Vegas Hotel and Casino. Secret pizza is located on the third floor of the Cosmo. If you see a hallway with old, kitschy records (vinyl y'all) and what appears to be a pin ball machine, winner, winner chicken dinner! Follow your nose and prepare to drool. It's like the hole in the wall pizza by the slice places in NYC. There are no thrills. A pizza counter and guys making fresh dough and heating slices. A single slice is HUGE and is $4.50/$5.00 a slice. Trust me, you'll only need one.  They also sell whole pies, beer, soda, and 2 liters.My favorite is the White Pie is my favorite. Garlicky, creamy, gooey dough heaven. My second favorite is the plain cheese. How you know the pizza is good? My mama is a New Yorker. She taught me that when you pick a slice up, the bottom half is droopy and the slice can be folded in half (taco shape). Secret Pizza does alllllll of this.Pro Tip: If you don't want to brave the strip, the same delectable pizza is available on the West Side of town by Those Guys Pies.I haven't had pizza in the longest time ever because my diet's pretty low carb, but in vegas it completely went out the window! Anybody that personally knows me, knows that I'm one indecisive girl when it comes to food cause I wanna eat/sample everything. We were staying at Aria and they have Five/50 pizza bar there which I wanted to try, but I also wanted Secret pizza. Luckily, my bf was sweet enough to run to both places to buy slices and bring it back to the room at Aria for us :)Normally the line is crazy packed out the door, but luckily my bf didn't have to wait long. We ended up getting the white pizza w/ sausage and mushrooms. I was surprised the pizza was still nice and warm when he got back to the room. I was a bit scared at first because all the reviews kept saying it's super oily, but this definitely was NOT the case for us! Compared to Five/50 pizza in Aria, Secret Pizza was way better!!I've had really good pizza in NY and the pizza here was a NY style big slice (big, foldable, and not too much sauce). It held up the toppings and everything nicely. The crust had the perfect crunch and texture. They were also generous w/ the toppings here especially the sausage. I mean you can see the whole sausage link on my pizza. I really liked the cheese on here too, it didn't have the stinky cheese smell. The roasted garlic spread smothered on the white pizza was sooo robust and good!! The white pizza consisted of various cheeses as well, the ricotta stood out and tasted fresh.FYI: We came here once after clubbing and got lost trying to find it. No wonder it's called secret pizza lol.-It's located at the very top floor of cosmo (3rd) where all the fancy restaurants are. Look for a hallway w/ vinyl CD records and you'll find the hidden gem!-It's more of a go in & grab a quick slice place, there aren't chairs for you to sitThis place was super hard to find!  I was pretty tipsy and all I remember was going through different sets of elevators and escalators, past swanky lobbies and convention rooms, and suddenly I was walking down a hallway of vinyl records filled with other drunken people.  You'll smell the place before you see it...IF you see it!Was led to Secret Pizza by Mr. Dubs for some late-night munchies to soak up the booze that wouldn't leave my system.  I had a hankering and Pizza was calling my name.  Heeding Siren's call, this place was suggested to me after Mr. Dubs' own drunken adventures with his crew.  We ordered four slices and took it back to our room.  Eating pizza on the balcony of your Cosmopolitan suite is pretty amazingly epic when it's 4 in the morning.Maybe it was the alcohol but sinking my teeth for that first bite of cheesy meaty goodness was amazing.  New York style thin crust, some cheese drag action, and a generous helping of toppings.  I'm in Heaven.  It's not the best pizza ever or even the best slice on the Strip but it's pretty darn good and nicely priced!  At $5+ a slice, it was great.  The slices are gigantic and I only ate one slice out of the two that I ordered.  Passing out in a food and booze coma afterward resulted in the best sleep ever.  Hurray for Secret Pizza!Vegas just wouldn't be the same for me without multiple visits to Secret Pizza! It's been a good two years since my last trip to Sin City and I'm proud to say that it's still the real deal! I took a girlfriend here with me on our first night and at 3am it was still open and still in the same spot on the 4th floor of the Cosmo. She marveled at how there's no signage, no listing, and I replied "That's why it's a SECRET! Lol" Even at 3am there's a long line but thankfully everything moves pretty quickly. True to Vegas party scene everyone in line with us was pretty much wasted and the folks behind us were obnoxiously drunk. We finally got to the front and the pizza guy chit chatted with us about what slices they were offering at that time. I honestly marvel at how nice everyone is at Secret Pizza because if I had to deal with all the tomfoolery I don't think I'd be nearly as patient. We each got two slices and a Coke to go. The prices have gone up from $3.50 to $4.75 per slice with an additional $.50 per topping. Still not so bad when you consider that you're in a very touristy area and it is 3am. Overall still a really great experience and literally a "hidden" gem on the Las Vegas Strip. We came back the next night again for Secret Pizza as we were hanging out at the bar and my girlfriend came back a third time the next night because she wanted to make sure she got another slice before we headed back home! Now THAT is some gooooood pizza folks! May you be very lucky during your trip to Vegas and may your stomach be blessed with the deliciousness of Secret Pizza!!!Seems like every time I go to Vegas I end up at Secret Pizza. It could be months, even years, between Vegas trips and yet Secret Pizza is that go-to joint when you need great tasting grub that is cheap and will fill you up. Its especially the place to go late at night. First-timers in Vegas will ask you where you got that huge pizza slice. Its a nondescript shop with no signage so for anyone wanting to find this place you pretty much just take the Cosmopolitan escalator all the way to the top floor, spot the narrow entranceway where people are walking out with boxes of pizza.If you go before people are let out the clubs, its a brisk stroll up to the front of the line and the pizza comes out as soon as you put in your order. The combo deluxe slice is my favorite ($6.00) but I had the Veggie too and it was not bad. Seems like all their pie slices hit the spot. Plus, its always comforting to see the same dude in the New Era baseball cap working here every time I come. Not really a secret anymore but still churning out great pizza. This place is awesome.Except that one time Joe Thornton from the San Jose Sharks was a douchebag and tried to cut everyone. Thats a story for another time...Tip: There's a nice spot with couches around a pool table where you can enjoy your pizza away from the cramped close quarters of this narrow pizza joint.I've heard so much about Secret Pizza over the last year or two...everyone either loves it or hates it, and there doesn't seem to be much in between.I'm right in the middle on my decision...I arrived at Secret Pizza about 10pm last night with my tequila boyfriend (my best friend, since my fella is not a tequila fan) and some Yelp friends...and some new friends we had made at the AWESOME margarita festival at the pool.  We were very intoxicated, and in need of pizza!The wait wasn't bad, especially since we got a whole pizza.  Service was pretty standard...not overly friendly, but not super happy to have a room full of drunk guests.  At my level of drunkenness, I think the pizza was the BEST pizza I've ever eaten.  Now, you also have to keep in mind that I've been dieting for 8 weeks, and have been craving pizza, too, so I'm sure that figured in a bit.It was hot...it was greasy, it was smothered in garlic...(well, that was our fault...didn't realize the "Parmesan cheese" we were putting on the pizza was actually garlic salt!)...it was good!Now, I'm going to have to try it again stone sober to see how I feel about it...you know how everything tastes good when you're intoxicated...I'd like to make sure that I don't need to drink 26 margaritas again to enjoy it.The SECRET is out.Well, at least I'm not kept in the dark about the secret anymore.  Thanks to fellow yelper, Rod U, I was finally became aware of the secret location of this pizza mecca that everyone seemed to know of except me (at least until recently).I think the "secret" is more the location versus the actual pizza itself.  You'll find this small pizza parlor/station at the end of a very nondescript hallway in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  After walking past pictures and portraits of various people, you will soon reach the secret pizza.Order by the slice or the whole pizza.  Go big or go small, it's your choice.  For me personally, I chose a slice of pepperoni and that was it.  Was it the best pizza I've had?  Was it worth the all the wait to finally eat this slice of pizza from the mysterious and difficult-to-find pizza palor?  Well, let's just say when you're hungry any slice of pizza will satisfy your appetite.  NOTE:  Slice of pepperoni was $5.25.  Absence of seating.  Stand and eat at the available counter space or go find some tables and eclectic chairs within the Cosmo.SERVICE:  Quick, courteous, and efficient.BOTTOM LINE:  Secret no more!  I'll be back!After years of clubbing at Marquee and having Secret Pizza bookmarked, I finally got the chance to eat here during my last Vegas trip in October. We'd gotten our stamps at Marquee and with re-entry privileges, we decided we didn't want to wait in the club for Porter Robinson to go on and should grab some food 'cause we were starving.The entrance of Secret Pizza is through a tiny hallway on the 3rd level of Cosmopolitan, in between this restaurant and elevator outside the Marquee ticket holder entrance and re-entry line. There was a short line at 11:30 pm, which moved quickly. I got a slice of NY-style Cheese and Craig P. went with a slice of deep dish. Tasty and pretty standard in terms of what you'd expect. Way later in the evening (morning?), some of my friends brought back an entire Secret pizza to the hotel for some amazing drunchies. Cold, but still very good!There's no seating, only standing room with counter tops along the wall for you to stuff your face. However, you can eat in the resting area right outside; there are plenty of sofas and chairs, as well as a free pool table.Great option if you're clubbing and hungry during or after.This place should be called "incredibly packed pizza" because that's what it is. Secret pizza was a lot better when it was actually a fucking secret. The 1st time I came here I was able to walk right in at 4am, get my pizza, high 5 my friends & get my drunk ass back to my hotel. Now you walk up and wait in a line for 45 minutes. All that annoyance aside, the pizza is actually good but you're definitely getting ripped off as a slice will run you a cool $5+ depending on toppings.They should limit how many pizzas 1 person can buy. MFers be walking out with like 5 pizzas with a line out the door & then trying to sell it for double the price outside.Definitely a good place to go if you're just escaping Marquee. And I know you just got out from the horrendous stairway, so now you're suddenly starving. The sweet smell of cheese and tomato sauce isn't helping, just follow your nose and it will lead you to the secret hallway to the place they call Secret Pizza.If you found the secret because the line is a mile long, sorry it's going to feel like a century to get in. I would avoid it between 12-2am, but they close at 5, so get your timing right! You can always call for a whole pie. The prices are pretty cheap for Vegas.For those not staying at Cosmo, it's great because there is plenty of seating outside.I like to keep some of my beloved places a secret, but facing nostalgia at its best, saving Secret Pizza as my secret is cruel for pizza connoisseurs. The fanciest pizza I've ever tasted was anything of the ordinary from the countless pizza parlours of Italy. To me, margherita pizzas were a real treat, gently wrapped in parchment paper at 2€ a slice, and an additional 1,50€ for sea salted chips. However, there is something different about Secret Pizza. You can find this little gem on the third floor between the corners at the Cosmopolitan. Purchased by the slice or by whole, the open face kitchen allows you to choose your slice of heaven from white pizzas to red pizzas. When I first tasted Secret Pizza my friends purchased whole pies of everything pizza and a pepperoni pizza, and even at 2am, they were outstanding & melty, just the way I like my cheesy pies. On my last trip here I tried the white ricotta + sausage pizza which is now my only preference. Full of flavour with just the right strength of spice & herbs, this pizza was a winner on my taste buds. Keep in mind that the line to Secret Pizza is absurd; I think the best option is to telephone in your whole pie only. Although I am not a pizza aficionado like I used to be when I was under 10 years old, I love Secret Pizza so much that I would purchase a whole pie for myself, even if my companion didn't like Pizza Secret! xI was staying at the Cosmopolitan and heard about this place but, since I had meetings at most of my meals during my stay, it wasn't the sort of place that fit my schedule.But, on the day I was leaving Las Vegas I wanted something quick and filling to hold me over until I got back to Phoenix and I hunted this place down.I guess when The Cosmopolitan first opened it was fun finding this "hidden" place. But, the word it out and other yelpers have even posted photos of the hallway to look for.  However, if you aren't paying attention and maybe you're a bit hung over it would be possible to walk right past it.They mostly serve pizza by the slice with a number of selections available so you can go in, order, eat, and leave.  They'll also make you a pie but you'll have to wait for it.The pizza is NY style and it was excellent! By Las Vegas standards, not too expensive.Great spot for a good casual meal off the beaten path.Literally, THE best pizza I have ever had in my entire life! When's used to live in Las Vegas- I worked at Marquee day club. I would try and come here after every shift (pizza is not the food to eat to be in bikini shape btw)Sometimes there is a very long wait, and most of the time I would skip my way to the front of the line- and upset everyone. Every single pizza here is amazing. My favorite is the white pizza- but can never go wrong with a classic cheese or pepperoni. This is the must eat at place while in Vegas... If you can find itOf course this place hidden. Is there a sign that says the name? Of course there isn't. What about a listing on the directory? You won't find any. Of course.Open almost 24/7, late night grubbers should trek up on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel to find this gem. A dark hallway of record covers adorning the walls can be found near the pool table that will lead you to this tiny and very casual joint. Serving NY-style pizza, the crust is crisp-thin (eaten folded) and is piping hot from the oven with a good sizzle from the cheese. A slice will cost you about $5 and some change. I say it's a bit steep but for each bite I took, nostalgia overtook me only proving that these were the closest I've had (from the west side) to eating a good ol' NYC pizza. I got their PEPPERONI, a classic that I couldn't resist, and WHITE PIZZA which I think was mighty fantastic. If you only have room for one, I highly recommend the latter. Trust.I hear ordering a whole pizza can make you skip the line but lucky for us, there wasn't a crowd that one weekday afternoon we went. P.S. Secret Pizza, please refill your table napkin containers. All were empty when we went.The secret's out! Any place with long lines and mediocre food just isn't worthy of my time...Honestly there is nothing amazing about this pizza! It's too oily for my taste.I ended up coming to Secret Pizza as someone had recommended it to my cousin and he wanted to try the place out. Secret Pizza is on the third level of the Cosmopolitan inside a small alley sandwiched between two other places whose names I don't remember. Secret Pizza is more like a take away stand with a handful of barstool type seats along the wall to eat your pizza. The menu is simple, basically New York style thin crust pizza that is sold by the slice (~$6). There are basically two types of pies that you can get the regular peperoni pizza which has the regular red sauce or the white pizza which basically uses ricotta & mozzarella cheese as the base. We decided to get a whole three topping white pizza (~$40) and went with meatballs, half peperoni and half mushrooms. After this it was a 15 minute wait in which time the pie was freshly baked and come out piping hot.Upon receiving the pie the first thing I noticed is that it was pretty big but the toppings were sparse covering only 65% of the pizza leaving a large outer crust bare. As soon as I picked up the first slice it was clear that it was extremely oily. I've eaten pizza's in NY so I was expecting a little grease but this was way too oily and not in a good way. The pizza itself was great. I don't like super crispy crusts that result from overcooking thin crust pizza's so I was happy that this crust had the right amount of flexibility that allowed you to eat the slice by gently folding it. The ricotta & mozzarella cheese base was excellent and had the perfect amount of seasoning. Unfortunately a tiny amount is put on very much like the other toppings. Pricewise I felt that it was relatively more expensive when compared to other joints on the strip even after giving it the Vegas Strip plus large Casino handicap especially looking at the miniscule amount of toppings.One last comment would be that this place is super popular and is a testament to word of mouth that spreads by social media. In the 25 minutes that we spent eating the pie on the 3rd floor lobby we were approached by no less than 6 parties asking us for the precise location of secret pizza. Anyway I doubt that I will return for a super expensive slice of above average pizza.Nestled on the third floor of the charming Cosmopolitan, Secret Pizza is the food equivalent of Platform 9 3/4.  Slice for slice, Secret Pizza is probably my favorite Vegas institution (over the traditional staples such as Earl's, Pink's, etc.) to visit for all my late night fatty indulgences.  Secret Pizza delivers the quintessential New York style slice: a sparing amount of zesty sauce and cheese without an abundance of toppings. The crust is thin and crispy while the base holds up well for folded consumption rapidly.  You should probably order at least two slices.  I've gone so far as ordering 4 slices at once and even a whole pie.  The variety of slices differs by the day.  If you want something that isn't featured on the display, you'll need to go ahead and order a pie.  Always order it with a beer.My addiction is out of hand.  I once left Hakkasan early just so I could beat the lines and get my hands on these slices (wait times around 2-3 am are approximately 30-45 minutes). On most trips, I'll go at least once.  Other times, I'll venture here two or three times.  When I stayed at the Cosmopolitan for my birthday, I had it three times in one day.  I know - I'm one sick puppy.In need of some late night bomb pizza?  Look no further... well, you may have to search a little to find this sucker.  Secret Pizza is located on the third floor fairly close to the pool table.  There, you'll see a hallway that'll take you to your delicious pizza destination.The slices are ginormous!  If you're in a group, I'd recommend getting a whole pie for two reasons.  1 - Price!  It's cheaper to buy a whole pie rather than purchasing piece by piece.  Just be ready to agree on toppings.  2 - They cook it from scratch on the spot.  Although the pizza is still good when they take each slice from under the heat lamps, but it just tastes so much better when your pizza comes out fresh.  If you opt for a pie, get ready for a little wait (~30 minutes).If you're in the Cosmopolitan and in the mood to grub (nudge nudge, for those drunken nights after hitting up Marquee), definitely take the time to find this joint.  It's probably the most price conscious and tasty meal you'll find in this hotel.I remember coming to Secret Pizza like a year ago, so I decided to come here again to see if it was still as good as I remembered it to be. It's located in the Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor across the billiard tables and chandelier. There's an element of mystery when trying to find this place because the hallway leading up to the actual pizzeria has no signage or pizza advertisements. You can easily find it, though, when you see people walking out of the hallway carrying their food out... I felt like Alice going to Wonderland except there's pizza on the other side, and not talking flowers and such. It's kinda cool knowing that this place is literally a hole in the wall, especially since the NY style slices offered here are really good.The interior is pretty small and it can get packed so fast. There's very limited seating (I only saw like two or three chairs) and then the rest is standing area. There's a few arcade games in there as well. Overall, the pizza was slightly doughy and had a bit of crunch to the bottom of the slice. I had two slices of pizza: a white pizza slice and a mushroom one.The white pizza with ricotta was so good. I think the ricotta elevated the flavor of the slice because when I bit into it, my mouth was hit with the rich, cheesy goodness. The mushroom pizza didn't really have that strong of a mushroom taste, probably because the mushrooms were more like small bits scattered all over the pizza slice. It had a very subtle mushroom flavor going on. I ended up spending $11 on the two slices of pizza. I think the pizza is a little pricey (what isn't on the strip?), but so worth it. In my opinion, I'd say I believe in the hype this place has got. It can get crowded and you may bump elbows with other people if you dine-in, but this place definitely did not disappoint!The not-so-secret, Secret Pizza!  If you're a Vegas veteran, then you know that this place gets PACKED during the peak hours, aka after club hours. Secret Pizza is located on the 3rd level of Cosmopolitan and it's not hard to find since there always seems to be a line of people in a small hallway.Honestly, I don't even know what slices I've tried but I've enjoyed them all.  I have yet to try their popular White Pizza, but they're all really good.  1 huge slice will cost you about $5-$6. Not too bad considering it is Vegas... and the pizza is actually good! Its always served piping hot and I love how the cheese is all melted and stringy with each bite.  Yum.  No complaints here!I would say definitely hit this spot up if you're staying at the Cosmo of if you're leaving Marquee !Who hasn't heard about Secret Pizza at this point? Definitely lives up to the hype BUT I can't decide if inebriated me prefers pizza or the ever-so-comforting Earl's. However, if one is at Marquee, I don't see why not! Just look for the hallway! TIP: Just order a whole pizza in advance and pick it up. It's cheaper than buying individual slices &  you don't have to stand in line.Sorry not sorry! 3.5 stars in my book. I don't get what the hype is all about!!! Maybe people love it cuz they are drunk and just think it's so good but me I wasn't drunk and I had this place twice during my stay at the Cosmopolitian and both times it was good but it wasn't thay greatttt that people make it seem. Yes the pizza is thin and the cheese sauce is good but that's really all. It's good but not the best. The guys working here are super nice and $5.00-5.50 for one freaken slice of pizza is really not worth it. I wouldn't rush back I think there are plenty of other options for pizza on the strip. I do like that it does have a cool hidden secret look to it when entering but other than that nothing to rave about.White slice with tomato. Do it now! $6/slice may be a bit much, but I've been officially converted. The pepperoni is fine but the signature white pie is actually worth the hype: garlicky, cheesy, just a little bit gooey, and those tomatoes just make it extra special. Service is friendly, spot is bare-bones but in a good way, snag a stool if you see one available!Note: Some people take the "secret" part a little too literally- it's not on any maps or even the Cosmopolitan website. Go to the 3rd floor with all the other restaurants, and find the hallway between Blue Ribbon Sushi  and Jaleo.Yummy pizza that will satisfy you after a night of clubbing, drinking, or if you're looking for a snack. This is located upstairs in the Cosmo on the right side of where you'd enter for their club/pool parties. There isn't a name, but instead a long hall with pictures that you walk down in. Luckily every time I've come here there wasn't a line. You pick your slice, they warm it up, and you pay. Easy concept and quick bit to eat. Will run you about $5-$6 depending on what kind of slice you get. Good crunchy texture but a bit oily. Guess that's what your napkin is for!

Restaurant name  Reathrey Sekong
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I had lunch at Sekong by Night with a couple of foodnik friends on its second day of business.  Overall the experience was worthy of four-stars. First, the design - it appears to have formerly been a Mexican restaurant and an Italian eatery of sorts, and vestiges of both decors abound, though the owners have gone to great lengths to give it an Indochine feel. All around a pleasant dining atmosphere with spacious booths flanking a long table that would be suitable for a large group.The food was great; it was like Vietnamese food's understated cousin, which I guess it technically is.  The menu offered a handy guide to the meals, and often compared a dish to it's Vietnamese counterpart.  I had a spring roll, which was large and delicious. The fish sauce it came with appeared to be nuoc mam, but was a little sweeter than the nuoc mam at other places around town. Katheaw is the Cambodian cousin of pho, and in presentation looks exactly  like pho (vermicelli noodles in a broth with meats and vegetables); the broth, however, bore no taste resemblence to pho broth, and if anything tasted more like chicken noodle soup than pho. I opted for the Katheaw Phnom Pehn, and while I found it delicious, be aware that it is offal-heavy, and if you don't like the taste of liver, you won't like the amount they put in it.  My lunch companions' meals looked delicious, and I had a taste of one of their sandwiches.  Again, the sandwich was very similar to banh mi (those French made inroads on the local Southeast Asian cuisine, I'll tell you), but featuring beef rather than pork, and heavy with the taste of lemongrass, which I'd never noticed in the banh mi I've had.I'm a junkie for Pho Thanh, but I suspect I'm going to put Sekong by Night into the rotation.Over the past few years we've been fortunate enough to have so many tasty and diverse Asian restaurants open. Some of my personal favorites are Soi4 for up-scaled Thai street food, Northeaster Thailand delights at Thai-E and chewy hand pulled noodles at China Magic Noodle House just to name a few. Now there is one more specialty to add to the fold, Sekong by Night specializing in Cambodian fare.Sekong has taken home to the old Fellini's Pizza space at 13th Place and Indian School. They've taken the space and turned it into a charming dining room that's comfortable and tasteful. Cambodian artwork graces each table along with beautiful patterned table cloths. Family owned son Yutheana In runs the front of the house while his mom Lakhana In cooks all of the delicious Khmer style dishes.You'll quickly notice that many of the dishes might appear like Thai food, well reverse that, Thai food is heavily influenced by Cambodian cooking though the later is definitely not as spicy. However you'll also notice a Colonial and Vietnamese influence on the menu starting with their fresh Spring Rolls. Chewy rice paper is wrapped around a salad of vegetables and shrimp, complete with a delicately sweet flavored fish sauce.If you've ever heard of Banh Mi you'll know this famous Vietnamese style sandwich. Its Cambodia cousin called Num Pang, though simply labeled as "sandwiches" on the menu, is just as tasty. They take a large slab of crust French baguette, sourced from Lee's Sandwiches in Chandler, and pile it high with lemon grass flavored beef, pickled veggies, cilantro and a squirt of siracha chile sauce. I think once word gets out how good Sekong's sandwiches are; there could be a line out the door.Other hits included sweetened stir fried beef Lok Lak Beef and another dish called Loat Cha. The earthworm shaped rice noodles were so chewy and addictive Id order them every time.Service was on the slow side since they've only just opened but I assure you, it was worth the wait.What a great little spot! Off the beaten path and "off the hook" as well! I had seen some previous reviews on Yelp but hadn't thought to check the place out. My parents were in town today and saw a full-page feature in the New Times on this place, so my dad suggested trying it. By the time we arrived after our delightful yoga class at Urban Yoga (how very Central Phoenix - I know, I know), it was about 1:40 and the place was completely empty. Sometimes, that can result in a less-than-enthusiastic greeting from owners or waitstaff but the man who greeted us was friendly and seemed genuinely happy that we were there. I love that. He took our drink order right away. The sodas were a little under-carbonated but no big deal. Easily fixed, for sure. My mom raved about her iced tea, so no complaints there. The menu was a little smaller than I expected (the owner later explained that he wanted to start more minimal and then branch out after getting a customer base, which is a good strategy IMO), but several things stood out to me. My dad and I ordered loat chat, worm-shaped rice noodles, but substituted tofu for beef (not immediately obvious that we could do this but we were gracefully accommodated), and the stir-fried shrimp (came with white rice, pickled vegetables and an egg roll). My mom chose the chicken noodle soup and we also got some fresh spring rolls for the table. All of the food came out very quickly and was extremely flavorful and robust without being too greasy or salty. The shell-on shrimp were a particular favorite of mine - although they were very messy to eat, they were very tender and had a nice kick to them. The rice noodles were also great and the shredded egg on top was a delicious touch. All in all, our meal was great - and affordable, to boot. All of our drinks, entrees and the spring rolls came out to only $34 including tax and tip. The owner was also great and we all loved his passionate approach to his business. He even told us that he opened the place because he was told that a Cambodian restaurant wouldn't survive in this city.  A rebel after my own heart. And, after all, doesn't Phoenix need more rebels?You're probably asking yourself, what in the world does "Sekong by Night" mean? Well, the answer is, oooh just some classic, popular Cambodian song title that the owner is obsessed over. :)As previously mentioned by another fellow Yelper, Sekong does exude charm.  In fact, most of the artistic, decorative items that is seen in the dining room is a straight import from mainland Cambodia (ie. table cloths, paintings, sculptures, and other artworks).  Obviously, the owner wanted to not only deliver authenticity from a cuisine standpoint but also historically and culturally.  They did a magnificent job in creating a nice visual display to sort of educate first time consumers of Khmer cuisine.To get an idea of what Khmer dishes are like, I always say they're a cousin to Vietnamese and Thai cuisine.  Although, I think they just share ideas or possibly just steal from one another.One prime example of idea sharing that you might find in a Vietnamese menu is the Luc Lac.  And actually, this creation was French inspired.  It's basically steak meat that has been cut into cubes and sautéed to a tender perfection fused with caramelized onions and garlic to give a richer taste.  The dish usually comes with a side of white rice and a fresh salad that has been lightly soaked in a sweet, citrus, vinagry dressing.  Its fantastic when done right!  In fact, I really enjoy Sekong's version! Its a must try! [Recommend]http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ?select=yeZLfWYl0CMkhNM9T73i_wSekong also serves tasty sandwiches like the Vietnamese Banh Mi.  I have only tried their grilled beef.  From what I recollect tasting, it was meat marinated in a savory, lemon grass.  The baguette was very toasty and had a soft interior while the pickled veggies were fresh tasting. [Recommend]And the cultural similarity theme continues! They also serve a crispy crepe-like dish that encompasses pork, shrimp and bean sprouts called, Baynchaiv, traditionally a finger food.  You take your lettuce and create a wrap and dip it into home made fish sauce. [Recommend]http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ?select=dmpDwgYQUk68LqY3tGx3fwLoat Cha, my other go-to dish, are these 1-inch round rice noodles drenched lightly in soy sauce and then pan fried served with fresh, crispy bean sprouts, green onions, and sliced beef topped with one egg.  [Recommend]Now, the chicken wings with a side of rice is quite tasty.  Last time I ordered one, the chicken came out nicely crisped with a hint of peking flavor, which is a notorious marinade for Chinese roast ducks.As for snacks and specialty drinks, I've had their tempura sweet potato and banana, and grass jelly drink.  All were excellent.  The tempura snacks came out super crispy with a fresh tasting interior.  If you are unfamiliar with grass jelly, it is basically semi-bland jello with a slightly sweet, grassy flavor, but in creating a refreshing drink, jello are cut up into tiny cubes while adding ice, sugar and honey.The one item that has bothered me for awhile now is the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup, also the counter to Vietnamese Pho.  The only reason why I have hesitated for this long is, admittedly, due to the exotic-ness (ie. pork liver, heart, tripes, etc).  As soon as I can grow a third ball, I will attempt it! Just kidding, I will eventually.The menu is not as large but being new to the food scene, they are looking to start off small and expand as business blossom.  By now, you may have already read about the lengthy wait, awkward location, and whatever shenanigans have you not, they are still working out the kinks and are continually listening to feed backs.  Pricing is very reasonable and competitive with the other Southeastern Asian power houses in the Valley [$5 - 10 range].  I will continue to be a regular here and add more updates as I try more items.Having now got 2 people on my case I thought it would be best to clarify and explain perhaps in more detail.First off, I didn't mean any offense to Cambodian people as a whole and if they are upset I apologize for my tongue in cheek attitude. I don't know any and from this experience I'm not bothered by that in the slightest.Secondly, the selling off as Cambodian is an inaccurate statement which I'll happily retract here. It would be unfair to both Vietnamese and other Cambodian restaurants. I was more trying to make the point to those that were wondering what Cambodian food was like, that it is very much akin to Vietnamese food. It's not my fault there are more Vietnamese restaurants in the US and probably based on this I can see why.Generally I've found that places with a higher yelp rating are harder to get into which makes perfect sense to me. This place was NOT full (about half full when we came in) nor happening despite what the owner says! Funnily enough, he has the cheek to call me a liar?! Insensitive comments - yes. Liar - no. (More on the owner's lying later)The poor start relates to that and the poor service which the owner disputes (I have no idea why this fact is disputed). If you have to wait over 5 mins. in a restaurant before contact (not physical contact as the owner oddly suggests) then that's a poor sign. I've only been to 500 places so what would I know?!Then the owner decides that because the food is brought out that makes it excellent service? Are you kidding me?! That was the funniest comment so far. That comment alone is enough to confirm to me that they have no clue to the meaning of the word service. Bringing out dishes is a given! lol Nothing to do with service - I will say the plates were put down on the table nicely if that's what is being alluded to?The owner could just have asked where I'm coming from and I would have gladly responded with my opinion to which I am fully entitled as is the owner. Should probably think about "customer is always right" before launching a senseless tirade/defense of service! Try engaging your customers and explaining things if it is sooooo different?!!!I'd add that the menu has a good number of items on it and never did I suggest that they should be able to make or sere every single type of Cambodian dish? That was funny too.But by far the funniest is the comment about the egg roll coming at the end of the meal. Why would say that and then have a picture of the amok fish with an egg roll on yelp?! Yet the owner calls me a liar? Just own up - you forgot, had a bad day whatever. You think lying is going to make your place look better?!If I were only judging this place against against other restaurants in the Phoenix area then I would have given it 2.5 stars. Not trying to be generous, I tell it how I see it. I'm glad other people had such an amazing experience but unfortunately we did not. The blame for that must primarily lie with the owner. I'd have thought you would want to satisfy your customers, not like to them!I give it a 1 star because I am comparing this restaurant to the many others I have visited and base if off the entire experience from start to finish. Why wouldn't I compare it? That's how a rating can be generated! You have to know good to know bad, so that to me is the essence of rating a place, by comparing it to others. It's nothing to do with how fancy a place is or not. e.g. a hole in the wall restaurant with good food and service would get 5 stars to me, but a pricey steakhouse with amazing ambiance but ok food and good service would get 4. Lying to the customer gets 1 star.To finish (finally!) I apologize for the Cambodian references mentioned earlier, I meant no offense and hope to have cleared those up. However the service was appalling and the food lackluster. That was our experience. Nothing can change that now. Let's see if the owner can come clean or will they have to resort to more petty name calling like they are in the fourth grade!Reathrey Sekong (formerly known as Sekong by Night) is one of the true ethnic gems of central Phoenix. The cuisine is delicious, the service is very friendly, and the prices are great! I love their katheaw buoh, a really flavorful and hearty tofu vegetable noodle soup; I'm not a vegetarian, but I'll take this over any meat-based soup  any day. I also enjoyed their lok lak beef, a delightful mixture of bold and subtle flavors. Their jumbo grilled chicken wings have a very pleasant garlic-soy flavor; you have to wait for the wings to cool a bit after they are served so that they will attain the peak of crispness. I'm glad I ordered the delicious Cambodian iced coffee with my latest meal - the caffeine buzz kept me from slipping into a food coma. On a previous visit, though, I found the rather intriguing basil seed drink really pleasant and refreshing. I know I'll be making many return trips  here, by myself and also with friends ... share the goodness!What is up with the owner. If you're reading this, are you like the Sekong By Night Nazi? I reviewed 3 stars for this restaurant and I get a whole novel, back-sass reply.  "eventually you found us!  Your mom should be proud." What does my mom have to do with anything? What are you trying to imply? Your restaurant was extremely difficult to find. Maybe you should get a BIGGER sign up because as you can read, MANY yelpers have gotten lost/ or stated that couldn't find this place.The soup did lack quite a bit of flavor. It was BLAND. It was actually a bland version of a wannabe Vietnamese soup my MOM could make at home. The soup came out way before the dish. Sorry your butt-hurt because I don't like your bland wannabe Vietnamese soup. I said it, what are you gonna do about it? Few meats on a stick, a bowl of rice, vegetables, and a bland soup for 8 bucks is expensive. I really DID feel jipped. I didn't expect Cambodian food to be this "pricey," especially being in Central Phoenix. My bad, I AM comparing your prices to other asian restaurant in the area. Then again it was my first time actually at a cambodian restaurant and I wasn't satisfied. Again, don't be butt-hurt. About your sandwich, I can in fact get it somewhere else for cheaper. There are loads of Vietnamese restaurants in Central Phoenix that don't make their bread and also sell it for 2.00 plus tax. I don't know why you are still calling your sandwiches "Cambodian sandwiches," It may be called differently since it was sold at a Cambodian Restaurant but it's the exact same thing as a Banh Mi sold at a Vietnamese restaurant (my bad because I didn't call it whatever you named it on your menu) but except yours is over-sauced and very stingy on the meat. Why would I have to complain about my sandwich to you when I was there? Shouldn't the staff know how to prepare the sandwich? Am I a criminal for stating my opinion and experience on yelp? YOU make me feel like I am a criminal for yelping three stars which means "A-okay". What did you want? five stars? The food wasn't "As good as it gets."If you would reply saying "sorry for being cheap and stingy on the meats." Then maybe I would want to actually return. ATTENTION YELPERS:Do not yelp lower than 4 stars or the Sekong By Night Nazi will come and get you.Again, this is sarcasm. Don't get butt-hurt.Get a life that isn't so focused on the bad reviews you get on yelp. You have so many good reviews, be happy about it. Your reply ticked me off so I had to reply even if it's been months later.We have stopped in twice in the last month. A nice little friendly place. We enjoyed the spring rolls they were very flavorful, (some restaurants serve them bland) these were fresh and tasty. We ordered sandwiches to go and requested a slight change to the recipe that was meet with a pleasant attitude. The sandwiches were very nice, bread was great as were the fillings. We will come in again and try some other items. I do wonder why the owner is offended by the 3 star ratings. I reserve the four and five stars for when my sox are really knocked off and am suspicious of places that have all 4 and 5 stars. The first rule of Yelp for owners is not to be compatitive to the yelpers. All reviews are helpful good and bad.Well after discovering this place about a week ago by driving by it, I googled it and found it on yelp.Since I never had Cambodian food I was curious what their food is like.Reading all the 5 stars review I knew immediately that this is something I would love.Sure enough my first visit there today was everything I expected and more.The place is very clean. Our server was extremely friendly ( not sure if it was the Sekong By Night Nazi) And the food was fresh and very tasty.We had the Spring Rolls as appetizer and boy those are yummy.I ordered the Curry Chicken and my partner had the Shrimp Ling.Both dishes again were fresh and very tasty.I will be back for more and can't wait to explore the rest of their menu.BTW, I admire the owner brutal honesty, people who  give this place a 1 star are just naive and should stick to the McDonalds down the street.Why do you need to slander and business just because your taste buds are not used to freshly prepared food???Two thumbs up!!Before I get to the reason for the 1 star review let me give you a little bit of background.  I "Yelped" banh mi sandwiches for Phoenix last night because I was craving one and wanted to find out what Yelpers out there think are the best.  I was a bit surprised to see Reathrey on the list as they are not a Vietnamese restaurant, but having patronized the restaurant at least a half dozen times, I decided to read through the reviews.  My boyfriend and I originally went to the restaurant after reading the glowing article in Phoenix Magazine.  Our first visit there was pretty uneventful.  We ordered the Mi Keaw soup, spring rolls and the crepe (which by the way was served slightly burned with that side facing down- but I never complain about my food and ordered it again on later visits).  My only real complaint that first evening was the incredibly uncomfortable bench seating.  On subsequent visits we opted for the tables in the center of the space.  I have tried a number of different things on the menu and while having no other Cambodian food to compare it to I find it to be just meahhh.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves the Mi Keaw soup and has ordered it as take out a number of times and is the reason for our repeat business.  In my opinion the Pho at many valley Vietnamese restaurants is much tastier.Okay - back to the reason for the one star review.  So here I was reading through the reviews when I started coming across the owner's incredibly RUDE, SARCASTIC, CONDESCENDING, DISRESPECTFUL and downright UNACCEPTABLE responses to his less than stellar reviews.  I have three words for you GET OVER YOURSELF!!! I don't care if you are running a Michelan star rated restaurant (which CLEARLY you are not) that type of disgusting behavior will run your business into the ground.  I, for one, will be spreading the word and NOT in a good way.  Sincerely,A very disappointed EX-patronI admittedly don't know much about Cambodia. I know I want to see Angkor Wat at some point in my life, but that's about as far as my knowledge extends. When I saw there was a local Cambodian restaurant here in Phoenix, I was intrigued and wanted to stop by to broaden my knowledge base. We walked into Reathrey Sekong on a Friday evening at 6:30pm and were sat immediately. For a 4-1/2 star restaurant, that impressed me. Especially since we had just left another place after seeing a horde of people standing outside. The inside is small but charming to say the least. I ordered the Cambodian iced coffee which was recommended in other reviews. Greatness. I thought it was going to be too sweet, but it wasn't, the mix of coffee and condensed milk was perfect. I ordered the large serving of the Cambodian BBQ Platter for dinner. It was basically a big plate o' meat that consisted of sliced beef, grilled beef skewers and grilled chicken wings. It's also served with a bowl of white rice. Excellent. The two beef offerings were cooked so that they were still tender and the flavor was awesome. The wings were on another level. Probably in the top 5 of best wings I've ever eaten. The only issue I experienced was in the order the items were served. I waited for what I thought was a while before my coffee came out but it was okay. I figured they were just waiting for it to brew. My coffee came out, but my wife's drink (coconut smoothie with boba) didn't come out for a few minutes later.Then the same thing happened with our food. My food came out and hers didn't for about 3-5 minutes later. It wasn't a huge deal, but it's just awkward when you're sitting there with your food and your eating companion is sitting there watching you, twiddling their thumbs. She wasn't actually twiddling her thumbs. Does anyone do that anymore? Anyway... you get the point. That was my only qualm. Other than that, this place was excellent. If Reathrey Sekong is any indication of the deliciousness that awaits in Cambodia... I can't get there fast enough.Met up with the International Supper Club UYE at Reathrey Sekong for the monthly pick of November, we were a party of 12, and it was suggested to us that since we were a larger party that we should order dishes family style.  I get the reasoning behind it, 1 cook in the kitchen, not everyone would be eating at the same time, I'm just not that big on seafood dishes and eating family style wasn't going to work for me, so I broke the rules and ordered for myselfI have to say our waiter was amazing, he was working the entire place by himself, did an outstanding job! Everyone was also enjoying the dishes they were trying too. The restaurant is nicely decorated and cozy, I have to say I enjoyed out time where conversing with everyone.I don't remember the name of the item I ordered, but it was a beef sandwich on a french roll with like a carrot slaw pickles and cilantro, the sandwich itself was on the sweet side, which was shocking, I was thinking more savory since it was beef, but I did quite enjoy it!Another fun International Supper Club UYE meet up!The Honeydew Soba, Basil Seed Drink, BBQ Beef and Fresh Spring Rolls were super delicious!  I was very impressed with all if the food.  The clientele here were also very friendly the night we dined, as people shared their favorite dishes and talked to each other.  Extra friendly waiter as well!!!  I can't wait to return!!!!Wow.After our aborted trip to Two Hippies one Sunday (it was closed), we looked around on Yelp for another spot for lunch.  Cambodian food caught my wife's curiosity, so we dodged the roadwork in the quest to make it here.Decorated with antiques (some look like they were from 1950s Cambodia) this place was very pleasant inside.  Service was friendly and smiling.  The food was--quite unlike anything else I've ever had.The fried rice had chunks of perfectly seasoned, tender beef that gave it. . .dimension (for the lack of a better word) that I never realized that a fried rice could have.  I know that this sounds kind of strange, or even goofy, but the taste was simply phenomenal.  When I spoke to my wife about her lemongrass soup, I realized that I she was having a similar experience with her food.A previous reviewer referred to this restaurant as "one of the true ethnic gems of central Phoenix", and I can't put it any better.  If you're in the area and are thinking about Thai curry or a bowl of pho, may I suggest this alternative.  It's not the particular ethnicity that makes this place unique as much as its sheer outstanding quality.  It's something different, done deliciously.This place serves awesome food.A group of us went to savor the flavors on a Friday night at about 8 pm. The place was packed and there were two groups ahead of us. After a short wait we were seated in an adjacent room that felt a little like the family living room as it had great character.Because the restaurant was so busy and it is a small family-run establishment we did not expect to be served quickly. Fortunately we were there to enjoy the company as well as the food so the wait for our food passed quickly.We ordered five separate main dishes that were served in waves. We started with the noodle dish with beef that started our glands    palpitating in expectation of more succulent dishes to come. We then enjoyed a delightful barbecued pork dish and a fish dish with shredded mango (mmmmm).This was followed by another beef dish (loc lac) that was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.Finally we had the crepe dish that was a mixture of flavors and fillings. The crepe dish was served last because it required two of the six kitchen burners to prepare and the restaurant wanted the food to reach us in the quickest way.We were all very full by the end of our gastronomic feast. Definitely one of the best meals I have ever eaten.We took at least two hours enjoying our meal. Don't come here if you are in a hurry!

Restaurant name  Sauceman's
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
After reading all the great reviews of Sauceman's, I officially have major food envy. Maybe I chose the wrong item off the menu? Perhaps I walked in at an inopportune time? I'm not sure, but I will say that I had really high hopes for Sauceman's, especially because they're right down the street from me in South End. I always want to support local businesses, but Sauceman's really let me down yesterday afternoon...I drove up to Sauceman's looking for a tasty and affordable little lunch. I was quite excited to try out this new South End venture and perused the menu as the woman in front of me ordered. Well, the person taking her order was having some trouble so while he was yelling into the kitchen for assistance, I waited. And waited. Nearly 5 minutes went by until another staff member came and helped me. And there were at least 4 staff people hanging around just a few feet away from me. Not a good sign. However, I was there around 2 pm so perhaps shifts were changing, blah blah blah. I decided on the small size French Dip with fries. And this is after asking the woman behind the counter what she thought of that particular sandwich. I quote, "It's actually one of my favorites on the menu." Sweet, I'll have that, thank you. $6.50 and I sat down. Once seated, the folks who were finishing up their shifts (presumably) sat 5 feet away from me in the main dining area chatting away and chomping down their food. About 5-7 minutes went by and my sandwich came out with a boatload of fries. Most certainly a generous portion of fries. Since I'm really trying to be as fair as possible, let me break down my thoughts on my French Dip & Fries...The beef: Lackluster and fairly tasteless. I also garnered a few bites of chewy fat that were not so delicious. The cheese: I've had better mozzarella, 'twas a bit on the plasticky side.The bun: Chewy chewy and not in a pleasant way. Tasted like this bun was quite frozen not long ago. The au jus: Not too shabby here. Perhaps if the beef simmered longer in the au jus with a bit more spice, I would have enjoyed it much more.The fries: All were toasty and hot, yet many of them were dehydrated. Again, seems like the freezer got the best of them. So, yeah. For a girl who likes to eat I didn't even finish half of my meal. But the big kicker is that when my basket was placed in front of me up until I left 15 minutes later - no one asked me if I needed anything (and I was the only person in the restaurant besides the staff). Or how my food was. Or, frankly, how I was doing. And, no, I don't need to be catered to, I was just hoping for more of a local, caring and cool staff at my neighborhood eatery. I may come back to try the ribs, but I'm not rushing to do so.After getting out with some great friends of ours for the first time in a while, we decided to take them to Sauceman's. I'm a huge BBQ fan and Sauceman's was one of the places left on my list in town. Though this location doesn't seem to be much from the outside, it definitely holds a firm place in my BBQ-loving soul amongst the other varietals in town. I had passed by this little building so many times on my way in and out of Uptown and always wanted to stop in. It's pretty small inside with some tables and a walk-up counter to order at. We started with some fried pickles and onion rings. Fried Pickles are somewhat of a ubiquitous app in town. Throw a stone in any direction and there is a joint that serves em the same as a few others in town. They weren't really anything to write home about. I actually wasn't too thrilled with the flavor and only ate a couple. The onion rings were great. Thick, but battered cooked correctly so you don't end up pulling out the entire onion from the inside of the batter housing. Well done here, ladies and gents in the kitchen. I ordered the thick cut pork. Nice chunks of pork and a nice change of pace from my typical goings of the chopped variety. I really enjoyed the larger pieces and eating them with a fork and knife. The flavor was fantastic and their Carolina Mustard BBQ sauce was a stupendous addition. The hushpuppies they serve with each meal are some of the best I've had in town. Huge ones, too. Not small like others I've had, which was a nice change as well. I just freaking love hushpuppies all around. Very happy with my entree. Another big plus was the fact that they had Triple C's Smoked Amber on draught. Such an incredible brew and works rather well with BBQ. The service was great. One girl and a few people in the kitchen were holding down the entire operation. Next time, I might check out their wings as I've heard they are of note. Needless to say, I'm stoked about heading back to Sauceman's rather soon.I rarely get to review a restaurant's food because there are often bigger hangups to deal with at any restaurant I visit.Recently I was going to a show uptown and made a special trip to visit Sauceman's, knowing it was on the way.  Typically I have only come to Sauceman's for lunch, or on the weekend, so I am not familiar with their strange hours.  But even if I were, am I expected to keep them memorized forever?On a Thursday, this place closes at 6 PM.  Why?  Heck if I know.  But that's not really the point.  Point is, I got there at about 5:40 PM, and was excited to eat.  When I came in, I noticed all of the chairs were upturned on the tables, trashcans were empty, without bags, and there was one other customer waiting for a to-go order.  Seeing the chairs the way that they were, I just assumed they were cleaning the restaurant and mopping the floors after lunch, and were getting it ready to re-open for dinner.I told the female cashier (who I am almost certain is the poorly placed manager - she has been in supervisor mode every visit I have made) my order, and she specifically asked, "For here or To-Go?".  I said "for here" and she didn't argue.  She took my order, and I flipped the chairs back over at one table and went to the restroom.  When I came back, my food was waiting and I got ready to dig in.  I then noticed that there was no BBQ sauce on my sandwich, and no sauce bottles on the table.I rounded the corner to tell her there were no bottles on the table, and her response made me want to gag.  Rather than saying, "I'm sorry sir, that is my fault, here you are..." the smart mouth turned her back to me while mumbling to her coworker  "Yeah, that's 'cause we're closed".Am I wrong here, or is that how you are supposed to talk to customers that go out of their way to eat at your establishment?I was stunned.  She got the best of me.  I cannot tell you how hard my teeth were clenched to keep from getting back up and letting these people have it.Instead I quietly seethed and tried to enjoy the food, which was good, but irrelevant to the matter at hand.  While sitting there I watched a couple come in and ask if they could dine in.  The cashier told her they closed at 5 but they would still take to-go orders.  This was my first time hearing this - something I should have been told the second I walked in.  Maybe I am partially to blame for not questioning the upturned chairs, but again - it's 6:00 on a Thursday, and no normal person has ever looked at the door of a restaurant to say "Hmm, I wonder if they close early on this weekday?"The couple that came in after me waited on their to-go order, and I ate as fast as I could to get out of there and go write this review... and also to remove the incredible burden I had caused them by being there.I am fed up with people not appreciating the business they receive, and this restaurant can be added to the list.  I am sure the owners would love to know that the workers talk about the customers behind their backs like teenagers, but I cannot find out the owner(s) names to tell them.  That's probably just the way they want it to be.I can't explain how a once great bbq joint has slid so low so quickly. They have plenty of trophy's and awards on display, but what they didn't have when I visited was a great meal to offer. I picked my Wife up at work, and wanted to celebrate our 25th Anniversary with a nice lunch. Fortunately she picked Sauceman's, not me. The first warning sign was that they were out of most of the fountain drinks. There was a hand written sign that said to get a can from the cooler. Except the cooler was out of diet sodas. When I asked, the woman behind the counter suggested I drink water. That was strike 1.We received our meals quickly, but before the server could walk away, I asked her if what I received was the $9 pork plate. The portion of hush puppies outweighed the pork on my plate. She said "yes, they weigh the pork", then walked away. Wow! That was strike 2.My Wife ordered the brisket sandwich, her usual menu choice. At first glance, all looked good. There was so much brisket that she had to take some out of her sandwich so she could fit it in her mouth. Before she took a bite, I looked at the meat on her plate, and showed her how dry it was. When I posted the picture one of my fellow Yelpers commented that it looked like jerky, not brisket. Strike 3.I don't know what happened to them, hopefully they can turn things around again. If it was just some dry brisket, I could forgive them. But between the issues with the soda, and the terribly small portions, it looks to me like this could be the beginning of the end for Sauceman's.I've eaten at Sauceman's many times since they've been open. My last visit made me so angry that I deleted all my previous glowing reviews, and there were several of them.================================================When I first came here after they opened, their burnt ends pork BBQ was fantastic. Their barbecue sandwiches were massive and delicious.Their panko breaded onion rings were nothing short of amazing.Service was decent, but nothing to brag about.Their postage stamp size parking lot was horrendous then, and it has only gotten worse as the restaurant has grown in popularity.This restaurant was too small even on day one. They have added a ton of outside dining to try and compensate for the lack of seating, but what they really need is a much larger building and more parking.================================================My last visit.........the straw that broke the camel's back.The Rastafarian Brother who was running the cash register was slow as molasses. He couldn't get orders correct the first time around. He acted like he couldn't understand English. He had an attitude. Frankly, he acted like he was high on ganja. He was talking with people in the back of the line, laughing, and doing everything but his job. It took a good fifteen minutes - just to place my order, and I was third in line, because he was being such a Richard. (In retrospect, I wish that I had just left and gone anywhere else.) $#@&#@!!!After what seemed an eternity, I grabbed a spot at one of the few empty tables, laid down my receipt and order placard, and I went to go get some sweet tea. When I returned thirty seconds later, my receipt was gone, and my order placard was gone! $#@&#@!!!Luckily, I remembered my order number.It took a good twenty minutes for my food to be prepared, and the entire time I sat on pins and needles hoping to flag down the runner. When what I thought was my order went by, headed for the outside tables, I quickly asked the employee if that was order #61. He said, "yes, it is," and looked at my table for verification. I told him that someone had removed my order placard, but that was my food. No receipt. No order placard. He gave me a puzzled look, but luckily he believed me, and I got to eat the lunch that I paid for. {sigh}The food was not nearly as good as previous visits, in fact it was disappointingly mediocre. The portion sizes were smaller and the prices were higher. It just wasn't very good, and it certainly wasn't worth all the BS that I had to go through. I haven't been back since, and I have no plans to EVER return. Lexington 'Q kicks their rear end, and for that matter, every other BBQ restaurant in Charlotte. Midwood Smokehouse is waaaay better. McKoy's is better. So is Bill Spoons, Mac's Speed Shop, Shane's Rib Shack, Bubba's BBQ, and Bobbee O's. None of the aforementioned businesses are a pain in the rear to visit either. When I am in the Queen City, I just drive right past Sauceman's on the way to other restaurants that appreciate my business. Who needs that type of aggravation?

Review Text :
The food and ambiance were fantastic.  We all enjoyed our dinner of albacore, yellowtail and salmon sushi, chicken yakisoba, beef teriyaki, a spicy tuna and philly roll, and red snapper sashimi with olive oil, black pepper and green onions.  The friendly, helpful staff was also a plus.  I know this wasn't a very descriptive review, but I'm about to be called to a poker table!

Restaurant name  Tacos Atoyac
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The price is right for these street tacos, rolled tacos, tamales and Mexican hot dogs at newly-opened Tacos Atoyac. Sure, while taco shops are a dime a dozen in Phoenix, the price point and taste can't be beat. The decor is very casual and spartan for now, but the value for a typical family meal make Tacos Atoyac a steal.The lengua, cabeza and carne asada tacos were flavorful and at $1 each, quite the value.  The black beans came to our table topped with cotija cheese and the arroz was reminiscent of any you'd find at any abuelita's house.  The "Oaxacan-style" hot dog was colorful and topped with generous helpings of sliced tomatoes, bacon bits and avocado and so very delicious.Horchata and Mexican Coca Cola are plentiful, and the Coke priced at $1.50 is the cheapest I've seen yet at a taco shop.Overall dinner for two was about $13, which included six tacos, one soda a spicy chicken tamale, a rolled taco and a Oaxacan hot dog. Not bad...It's easy to find at the NE corner of Glendale Ave. and 19th Ave., next to 7-11. Can't wait to visit again, and am looking forward to having another lengua taco, hot dog and to trying the tortas!We went to Tacos Atoyac for lunch again and really enjoyed the food based on a recommendation from Iain B.  This is not border Mexican food but rather oaxaca or oaxaquena southern Mexico or what you might find in Mexico City.  Their prices are very easy on your pockets, but don't let that fool you.  Their food is extremely fresh, unique and delicious.  What a little "gem" of a place this is!  Restaurant ~ Tacos Atoyac is small and not very appealing on the outside (somewhat of a dive look) but it's what's on the inside that counts and this place is no exception.  This place is very clean with a simple design on the inside. The folks that work here are friendly and will make you feel very welcomed.  This was huge since for us since both of us speak very little Spanish.  Food ~ You order your food when you walk in and they bring you your delicious oaxacan-Mexican food to you accompanied with a side of cooked jalapenos, onions and salsa (you can choose green, red or a guacamole infused salsa).  The green chili salsa went exceptionally well with my fish and al pastor tacos.  No chips and salsa here, which I'm perfectly fine with.  On our first visit we sampled all of the tacos at $1 each.  The carne asada and al pastor were tender and delicious with with some chopped cilantro and onions on top. All of the tacos were very good, even the lengua and tripa o cabeza tacos. (yes I knew they were tongue and tripe~ but they were good!) I just added a little salsa which gave it just the right amount of heat to add to the flavor.  We also tried their spicy beef and chicken tamales at $1.75. Thy were very good as well but I preferred their tacos, so went back for few more.  Total bill with a few drinks was around $18 for us both.Second visit we had their fish tacos ~ they are delish!  We also had a couple of quesadilla's since they were making them fresh from scratch at $1.50. The corn quesadilla was tasty with some fresh green  epazote, cheese and a light spread of frijoles! We also tried their flour quesdilla's and a few burros with al pastor and carne asada.  They too were very good with a nice balance of fresh guacamole and loads of meat in their burros. We sampled a lot of food again this trip and left stuffed and happy with a bill of only $24.  We have really enjoyed most of the things we've tried so far and we are looking forward to coming back very soon.  Tacos Atoyac will leave you satisfied, happy and planning what to eat on your next visit.  They keep it simple with tons of flavor.  I hope to see you there.This may very well conclude my search for really, really good tacos. The place is inconspicuous, really easy to miss, especially with the rather small name sign outside. But you'll always see cars pulling into and out of the parking spaces in front. Inside, the atmosphere is pretty sparse but the friendliness of the people, the incredible prices (see the menu pics I posted), and the delicious food more than make up for it. I tried the carne asada, al pastor, tripa - I ordered it extra crunchy - and lengua ... all superb!  The tacos come with a side of sauteed onions and jalapenos, which very nicely complement the flavors of the tacos. This is definitely a place for many, many repeat visits.Oh my gooooood! Can you say bomb? Go ahead, try it. Okay come back. Yes. These tacos are that and more. Worth all the hype. Worth a little more from me. These are no sh*t, amazing tacos with great flavor. But, okay let me esplain something to you. Mexican food is usually the last thing I want to eat when I eat out. My parents are from the valley, born and raised and very Americanized. Still, I grew up with rice and beans with every meal, even steaks, even eggs, no joke. Every. Meal. Some things are like Bruce Willis, they Die Hard. But I love me some tacos man... And these are SOME tacos!I've been here a handful of times now and have had, I think, every taco of the menu at least once. The tacos de pescado are by far my favourite. Lightly breaded, perfectly seasoned, little pieces of white flaky fish wrapped up in soft warm corn tortillas smothered in a spicy crema. Yum! The tacos pastor are probably my second fav. Tasty marinated carnita covered in a sort of  pico and wrapped in those perfect soft tortillas. I love the tripas (never fear, they cook them way down!) and the carne asada also. And the sonny man always orders the quesadilla. So delicious and I am feenin for one with chorizo right now!Okay well I have to go get my fix since they were closed for the holidays. Laters baby.Quite possibly the best street style fish taco I have had in Phoenix. The generous portion of fish was heavily seasoned and lightly breaded, the result was pure heaven. I also ordered the flour quesadilla, refried pinto beans, carne asada and al pastor tacos. The refried beans were creamy and the queso in the quesadilla was awesome. I washed that all down with a bottled coke and rolled myself home. You may want to give yourself some time if you come here during lunch, by 11:30 the line was out the door. Apparently I am not the only one that knows how delicious this little dive is!Oh my, oh my, how I miss coming here for the best fish tacos.  The fish is seasoned and lightly breaded and there is a good portion on the taco.  I have tried the crispy quesidilla and al pastor tacos, but the fish tacos remain my all time favorite.  It's very simple inside and not in the greatest neighborhood, but the service is great, prices are cheap and the food is amazing. Come and get some authentic tacos!!Tacos Atoyac reinforces my belief that the more expensive your Mexican food is, and the fancier the establishment appears, the worse it's probably going to be. I mean, EVERYONE knows that the *good* stuff lies in plain, secluded little strip malls that are easily overlooked. Just pop in and get whatever you want. I am convinced Atoyac can do no wrong. I ordered a simple pastor burrito. Carne asada is easy to do, but the arduous process of choosing a marinade that's just-right is in my opinion the litmus test for whether or not a restaurant is legit. Part of me wanted to say it's too sweet, but as it disappeared fast, I realized it's unique, but really hits the spot. Sevice was fast, and all meals come with grilled onions and a grilled serrano, which is just the right amount of heat for me, and definitely too much for most people who will read this. Be careful, and have some delicious horchata ready just in case.The food here was very good, but I'd suggest you open your patio for more seating as this place is a claustrophobics worst nightmare.  I seriously wished I'd taken my food to go.   And if you are running the register and a customer shows you a picture of a plate of delicious tacos from your own restaurant on your own restaurant's Yelp page on the Yelp mobile app and asks you if you know what kind of tacos they are don't give them an annoyed glare and say "How am I supposed to know?!?!"   Uh, you are supposed to be able to identify your menu items because you are running the register, and because your menu doesn't exactly give a lot of description to your different offerings, and because it's just good customer service?   I'll be trying this place again because everything was tasty the last time (for basically ordering the items blind) but if I get treated like an idiot for a simple inquiry again I definitely won't be back.What happened?? I had the best tacos of my life here. I came back the other day... and its closed???Taco Gods why have you forsaken me!??!?Street tacos at its finest. It was like the real deal from Mexico minus the diarrhea. The fish tacos were second to none. I'm gonna miss you Taco Azoteca... Ayot... Atoyec... how do you say it?

There are several eating options at this terminal, and since I didn't have a bagel my entire time while in Montreal, I thought why not? This was my one and only chance to get one, as I was hankering for one, and well, it was a major disappointment. It was about 6:30am and was half asleep, and after going through security, and perusing my food options, I noticed a plethora of breakfast bagels on display. All were on sesame seed bagels, and were either egg and cheese; egg, ham, and cheese; or salmon and cream cheese. I opted for the egg and cheese, and anxiously anticipated eating one, as I needed a bagel fix (none for about 3 weeks).  Oh, I was so disappointed, as it was heated up by microwave, and was flat, chewy and dry. No flavor on the sesame bagel; and the egg was also bland and cheese was just way too much. Prices were fair, and not too pricey (thankfully)!As I mentioned in my quick tip, this is a very mediocre bagel, but the only place in the gate where you can get one. I'd skip and go find another place to eat in the terminal.Only positive side was that the coffee was really strong and robust, and there are a few tables next to Bagel Bar, where you can eat (quickly) and then board your plane!

Yay a new pub...my fav! Stumbled upon this joint while waiting for a table at Cabo that turned into waiting too long and eating at Solstice.  Anyways I had to circle back to make sure I checked this place out and I'm sure glad I did.  Besides falling off my chair after my delicious Allagash beer with the delightful aftertaste of Jim Beam I do actually mean it was delightful I had a great time.  They are serving food and will definitely check out some grub next time I return.. the beer selection is great and the staff is friendly.  Our waiter Tom was on top of it and very knowledgable about the beers and the menu...I will be returning soon. If your in NODA check this place out and add it to your pub crawl!Mike was handing out breakfast only Beagle Bucks Friday night when I stopped in for a beer.  So this morning, I took advantage of their opening at 7am on Saturdays and Sundays for breakfast and enjoyed a nice hearty meal.I had the Basic Beagle Breakfast.  Two eggs any style (scrambled), bacon or sausage (3 strips of tasty perfectly cooked bacon), breakfast potatoes or grits (potatoes since i am still unwilling to let go of my Yankee-ness to eat grits), and biscuits or toast (two great biscuits), all with a little fruit cup.They have breakfast wraps and tweaks to your standard breakfast fare.  Next time, I will venture for the Shit on a Shingle.  Up north, that is creamed chipped beef on toast.  There, it is more like your sausage biscuits and gravy only on texas toast.All of it is reasonably priced and a great breakfast option in the hood that is open early.  Just sucks waiting until noon to wash it down with a mimosa or bloody mary...

I wish I read the review by MG prior to going here.  I also ordered the Trofie for $22 and was surprised by the tiny size of the dish and the shrimp.  Overall my friends and I weren't impressed by the menu and thought about leaving.  The pizza oven was also broken.  We had to ask for free breadsticks since they didn't serve us any.This has to be the worst restaurant in Las Vegas! To start with, I think it's the only  italian restaurant I've ever been to  that charges you for mediocre bread. The portions are a joke and incredibly overpriced considering how small and uninteresting they are. I ordered the chicken which was the smallest chicken I've ever seen. It tasted average at best, and I was still hungry after dinner. The waiter was reluctant to give us breadsticks (made it sound like he did us a favor swiping them off the bar) and we paid $5 for "stromboli" bread which was average at best. Everyone who works there seems unhappy and look like they don't want to be there, and the overall experience was awful. If I could rate it a zero I would. The entire experience was unpleasant, food unsatisfying, terrible menu, broken pizza over and apathetic service. I would never return and suggest you don't go either.When visit the famous Las Vegas, the price for dinner at a restaurant mean at least over $100. However i think this newly open restaurant doesn't know that overrated prices must come with satisfactory service. Well this place had the most horrible service in a Restaurant in Vegas. It took 30 min to sit us down, 30 min to ask us for our order and another 30 min to bring the food. Not many options on the menu ( 6 options). We order the schiacciatta pizza, a medium size entree with a salad.  I think I would say that pizza from Costco Warehouse would taste better. I visit Las Vegas several times a year so I won't come back to that restaurant.I'm the first real person to review this place, let all other fake spammers be gone!  Yelp should really work that shizzle out.  Zack S...um this place closes at 11 so you couldn't have possibly hit the bar...so yeah if your gonna post fake reviews at least check your facts..This place has so much potential, yet the ridiculously bad service just overshadowed everything good they did.This is probably the worst service I have ever received in my life.  Do you guys remember in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts goes into the first store on Rodeo and the snooty lady acts like she's too good for this place?  Well that's what they did to us.Where's the hostess?  Oh she's chatting with her friend...*ignoring me*We finally get seated and then we sit and wait...and wait...and wait...finally I get up and ask one of the waiters at the cash register to send over someone...She treats us like we're a nuisance to her, she's singing along to the song that's playing...(WTF?)  I think they turned up the music louder as more people left because by the time it was near closing time it was blaring hip hop music...really weird considering it was a nice casual Italian restaurant.We order almost 200 bucks worth of food, and then she's like "is that it?"excuse me bitch...watch the attitude...Wait, wait, watch as all the waiters get together to talk about us...seriously I can see you whispering about us....this is so unprofessional right now....We seriously waited for like an hour and a half, it was ridiculous!  The place was practically empty!  The waiters were standing around and chatting with each other.  I took pictures as evidence!This place is supposed to be a nice place, for the prices they charge they should have a whole restaurant re-staffed because it was ridiculous!  I have never felt more uncomfortable and treated so rudely in my life!I also wanted to order take out for later and apparently they don't have take out boxes?  You're a restaurant?  You don't have boxes?  Seriously?This is the worst experience in a restaurant I have ever had.  I've gotten better service at Carls Jr in a shady neighborhood than this.  I won't hesitate to tell everyone to avoid this restaurant when you're in Vegas because this was outrageous!  No one treats me like that and gets away with it!  I wish I had a You've been yelped card so I could give them a piece of my mind.I'm like those crazy housewives who have nothing better to do...I won't stop calling to speak to management until someone is fired.  I'm serious, no one gets away with treating me like that without suffering repercussions.  We don't play that, I'm sorry I'm not one of those quiet asian people who take your shit...I will not be silenced... You best believe.  You're done..The end.*note I left for the manager*"This is probably the most unprofessional and ridiculous restaurant I have ever had the misfortune to experience, not just from the our waitress, but the waitstaff and blatant ignorance from most of the employees I had to encounter."                                                                   Anthony NguyenYou're kidding right.  As close to authentic Italian as I am (I'm Asian).  RANT:  Even in the black chip world of Las Vegas, charging twice as much as anyone else does not mean the food is twice as good.  $22 for a personal Margherita pizza?  $22???  The best example I had in Italy, from a widely acknowledged top pizzeria rated by professional food reviewers, €7 ($9).  And yes, it was more than twice as good.The menu reads well with dishes from Toscana, Lazio, and Campania.  Ordering done.  Anticipation builds, then WTF, bread served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar,  Italians would never commit such a culinary faux pas.  The producers of either great ingredient would sooner see it run down the street then mix them together.  Not a good sign.The springtime Roman classic, fried artichokes.  They should be well trimmed, fried golden brown.  The contrast between the bitter, crispy leaves and sweet tender heart makes the mouth all kinds of happy.  NOT HERE.  Half cooked, inedible leaves around an undercooked heart.  Bitter and vegetal in all the wrong ways.The pizzas hailing from Nappoli, decent ingredients, properly blistered, crust well seasoned with a decent chew.  So what's wrong?   Rustic is one thing, plain sloppy is another.  Margherita had 90 percent of the cheese on one side of the pizza.  The desiccated, burnt basil on the other.  The prosciutto with asparagus had all of it's ingredients centered in the middle with a two inch wide crust all around.Finally, the wines.  This is an enotecca right?  So Roman food, no wines from Lazio.  Limited selections from Campania (Nappoli), Tuscany well represented. Vegas resort prices.Euro contemporary ambiance.  Servers lack energy.  Italy, still half a world away.I knew I was eating here last night and had to do my pre-work.  First of all, what the heck does DOCG mean?  During dinner we asked and got the answer in English, which means "controlled designation of origin guaranteed". You should see DOCG on all fine Italian food labels, especially on wine.  I never knew this until last night.  By the way, within 5 minutes we forgot what DOCG meant, hah. I had to go back after dinner and ask again.  LolRegarding their food, where the heck do I start?  We tasted a lot during our dinner last night.  Present during dinner was Chad S, Roy E w/his gf, and of course, Terri R.  We shared the following dishes.Small Plates:-Their Bread-Roasted Bone Marrow (red beets & oxtail)-Grilled Octopus (chickpeas, tomatoes & basil)-Pancetta Wrapped Prawns (w/rosemary lentils)-Beef Carpaccio (caper aioli, parmesan & arugula)I wasn't a fan of the Roasted Bone Marrow and wished it had more taste to it. The Beef Carpaccio, however, was fantastic. Pizza's:-The "D.O.C.G" Pizza (fonduta, egg & truffles)-Margherita (mozzarella & tomato)The DOCG Pizza was a very tasty one over the Margherita.  This may not make sense at all, but the egg topped on it gave it a sweetness which combined very well with the pizza. Pastas:-Pici (braised duck sauce & black truffles)-Scialatielli ("arrabbiata" with lobster & shrimp)-Fettuccine (roasted garlic, escarole & mushrooms)My favorite of the three had to be the Pici.  The duck actually tasted like braised ribs, but had a small after taste to it.  Very lean and simply melts in your mouth. Sides:-Roasted Asparagus (w/lemon & egg vinaigrette)-Grilled Broccolini (w/garlic & chili)-Potato Puree (w/mascarpone & parmigiano)Their version of a mashed potato, just a lot creamier and full of butter.  Out of the three sides, this was my favorite with the asparagus as a close 2nd.  Dinners:-Diver's Scallops (My Entree - w/brussel sprouts & pancetta)-Braised Short Ribs (Terri R's Entree) - w/sweet potatoes & cippolini):  I had to add this on my review since I ate half of her entree. I thought that the scallops were just okay. I'm a little different than most. I prefer smaller pieces of scallops over these huge ones that are served here.  In my opinion, the large pieces are a little too fishy to me (I know, this isn't fish. Just saying).  I did enjoy Terri's Braised Short Ribs.  Even though there wasn't a bone, this was some "fall off the bone" meat. I wish I had her meal. It was phenominal. Desserts:-Salted Caramel Budino (pretzel toffee)-Tiramisu (kahlua soak & coffee gelato)-Marscarpone Cheesecake (w/fresh strawberries and strawberry sauce)-Tartufo (nutella malt gelato, chianti cherrycompote & hazelnuts)My favorite of the four desserts was the Salt Caramel Budino.  Served in layers, you have to dig your spoon deep in order to enjoy the magic of this dessert.  The Tartufo was magic as well with a combination of Nutella and dark chocolate.  The Tiramisu tasted like your normal Tiramisu.  As for the their cheesecake, I wasn't able to partake in the fun since I'm allergic to fruit. According to our group, this was a favorite too.  Sorry for the longer than average review, but we were here a long time and ate a lot. Can you say food coma?  Food baby? After dinner, we were given a special "behind the scenes" tour of both DOCG's and Scarpetta's kitchen.  I had a great time and with a great meal.  I originally came here expecting less and got more, a lot more.  Good job, DOCG!  Your service was fantastic and definitely appreciated.YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (055/366)What has taken us so long to dine at celebrity and award-winning Chef Scott Conant's D.O.C.G. Enoteca before? Since 2010, Chef Conant opened two Italian restaurants (D.O.C.G. and Scarpetta) in The Cosmopolitan Hotel, we've passed by numerous times on our way to other restaurants or boutiques. So this time, on our 2-day jaunt to Las Vegas, I decided to make reservations.  I chose D.O.C.G. over the sleek, sophisticated and earthy Scarpetta.  D.O.C.G. Enoteca is definitely more casual, rustic and yet modern.  Melissa was our fresh-faced, personable and attentive server. She was efficient without being rushy or obtrusive. Her friendliness matched the casual rustic restaurant as she brought out our selections in relaxed succession. We had an early dinner reservation because we were leaving Las Vegas in the next morning and we wanted to "squeeze" in a couple more hours of gambling. We started with the feature appetizer, a plate of 6 deep-fried semolina crusted oysters with Tabasco aioli.  We paired it with a bottle of 2013 Jermann Pinot Grigio that was crisp, citrusy and peachy with a smooth finish.  Melissa recommended some pasta and pizza but upon perusing the menu, we decided upon pasta. My husband chose Pici which was a bowlful of hand crafted short, thick spaghetti with braised duck sauce and black truffles. The duck sauce was chock-full of tender braised shredded duck meat. While I ordered Scialatielli that was composed of handcrafted tubular pasta with lobster and shrimp arrabbiata.  The arrabbiata wasn't overly spicy or tomatoey.  Both pastas were perfectly cooked and the sauces seemed to coat every nook and cranny of the pasta shapes. While dining, Melissa came by regularly to refill our water and wine glasses. We were considering ordering dessert wine but my "sweet tooth" chose the Salted Caramel Budino with pretzel toffee. The Budino was an intensely flavored salted caramel pudding that we paired with coffee. It was rich, sweet, creamy and rounded out our dinners. Our tastebuds and stomachs had been treated to authentic flavorful rustic Italian cuisine.  We ended our dining experience feeling full of energy and continued our evening by gambling until the "wee hours" of the next morning.

This is the place where the beer flows like wine.Sorry Lloyd and Harry, you should skip past Aspen and head here. With what looked to be 40+ beers to choose from on tap, grab yourself a cold and frothy one on a moments notice. Order yourself some of their Rockin' Chicken Nacho's, a fig and goat cheese pizza, the southwest burger topped with roasted green chiles and Monterrey Jack cheese, or what can only be described as "Pig" on their menu. A 1/2 lb of bacon served with a side of dipping maple syrup. I've been twice now on a Tuesday for their Open Mic' comedy line up "Laughs and Draughts". $3 Santan brews, $6 Chicken and Mac n Cheese, and other nice priced bar foods to choose from like wings. As much as I want to love this local joint for a mid-week night of comedic stylings; unfortunately, I don't think I'll be spending too many more Tuesday's here. There's just something that seems to be missing. No, not the food. It wasn't the drinks, not even the service itself. That's right, the comedy. I'm not sure I laughed but 2 or 3 times the entire hour and a half I stuck it out. The saving grace was that the Olympics were playing on the TV's in the background, but I could have got that same olympic sized entertainment at my own home, and the beer is cheaper there.If you're looking for a laugh on a Tuesday night, I'd try to stick it out til Wednesday and find your way over to Stand-Up Scottsdale; their open mic is usually worth the time and effort, and its put together in much better fashion - no run on comedians who don't seem to cut the mustard or know when to exit stage left. They do, from time to time, have live music or a DJ spinning records. Check out their main site for a calendar of events. While I can't speak on those particulars, I imagine you can't really mess up music too badly. I would like to leave you Yelpers with the following words of advice. If you're out for a great selection of tapped and bottled beer, wine, or liquor in a cool down town atmosphere. Race on down, cause you may have just won gold.Happy Yelping Phoenix!Food: quite delicious. Atmosphere: rockin'. Customer service? I'm disheartened to say that it's extremely disappointing! Therefore the three stars is only for the food and atmosphere. I've been to Copper Blues three times now and every time there's always been some sort of hiccup. However, the hiccups were short lived and soon forgotten. Unfortunately the hiccup during this last visit won't be so easily forgotten. This past Friday night, we went to see Bob Saget perform (he is absolutely hilarious by the way). Before the show, we wanted to grab dinner so we decided to make it easy and eat at Copper Blues. When we arrived, we were given a buzzer and quoted for a 10-minute wait. We asked if there was open seating anywhere and they directed us to the outdoor patio and said that was the only open seating. After about 10 minutes of waiting, we checked back with the hostess on the status and at that point, she said it was going to be a 35 minute wait. We said that we were told 10 minutes initially and then she said, "oh well, then it's 10 minutes I guess." It was all very confusing. So after about another 10 minutes, we checked back again and at this point they said that they never quote a wait time and when I told them that I had been quoted twice, she said again that they never quote a wait time. I felt like I was on crazy pills! It didnt seem like the staff knew what was going on that night! Well, the saga continues on... At this point, it's around 6:00 PM and we are hungry and eager to get some dinner before Saget. It was also freezing on the outdoor patio and we were hoping to sit inside. We decide to check out the inside portion of the restaurant (even though we were told initially that the only open seating was outside). Well, when we got inside, we realized that the entire bar area was also open seating. Now this is where the hiccup will forever stay with me and it will be hard to get over this next part. We find two high top tables and are told that one is in use, so we take the other one. It has three chairs and we need two more chairs. At this point, a waiter comes up and confronts us. I let him know that we are in need of two more chairs and do they have any (this is in the open seating bar, remember.) He turns to me, stares at me dead on and says "well are you even planning on eating here or are you just going to be using this table to wait?" Now regardless of whether we were going to order one drink or a whole meal, I don't think a waiter should ever question a customer and treat them the way I was treated. I proceed to tell him that we are wanting to eat dinner and we have been wanting to eat dinner there for a good thirty minutes! I was blown away by the treatment and I will admit that I've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before. Someone must have seen my anger and utter shock because about five minutes later they told us they found a table at the bar for us but sadly at that point, the experience at Copper Blues was ruined. We ordered several drinks and a couple appetizers (which were delicious) but after the treatment, decided to just eat dinner at Stand Up Live. I hate writing a disappointing review like this one. I visit restaurants wanting a good experience and wanting to enjoy the atmosphere. However, customer service can either make or badly break an experience.

I am a fan of the food trucks in Veagas, and I am glad to welcome Sloppi Jo's into the fold.The menu isn't the biggest in town, but everything is very well done. I have yet to have anything that I don't like on their menu.I attended both the soft opening and their opening joint with FUKUburger, and it was the best of both worlds...Fukuburgers and Sloppi Jo's Hatch Chile inspired menu.I'm including my review of their soft opening "Hatch Chile Cheese Burger- Burger Cooked to a perfect medium, served wrapped in a tortilla, with chilies.I was impressed with the burger the patty was decent sized and cooked to a perfect medium, there was a little heat from the chilies, but it could use a little more bite (and I'm not really a chili guy).Green Chicken Chile Stew- Chicken, peppers, potatoes, served with a tortilla on the sideThe stew had a noticeable heat, but it wasn't overbearing, the chicken pieces were big, and the stew was great, I will be getting this again.Next up was their Breakfast Burrito-It was bit of a mess, but a tasty tasty mess. Tortilla wrapped around eggs, bacon, chilies, and topped with 2 different sauces, and some crema. I am not a breakfast burrito guy but this was amazing...If I'm out in the morning and the truck is within a drive of my house...I'm having one of thesePork Taco-The Pork could be one of the best menu items at SloppiJo's it's featured in the taco and the sloppijo, the taco was good, it had avocado on it, and sadly I'm not really an avocado fan, other than that they were delish.The SloppiJo-There is nothing I can say that will do this dish any justice other than YUM. It featured the pork which was topped with a fried egg and served with a few veggies and a tortilla, it was delicious, it was messy, and I will be having more of these in the future.Sopapillas-A perfect end to the meal...sugary and delicious."My 2 favorite dishes are the Name Sake Sloppi Jo and the breakfast burrito.I look forward to eating at Sloppi Jo's more in the future.

Located in a small stripmall near the North East corner of Southern and Central Ave. Is this small buffet. When you enter, you have walk down a small walk way and then are met with a cashier who takes your drink order and counts the number of people in your party. You'll then claim your table and serve yourself. All the usual hits and misses of the average Chinese Buffet are here - none really stand out in all honesty. They are all pretty average and then came 'the incident'...I'm still traumatized by it. Seriously I am... I went there and it felt like any other time. I had gotten a chicken dish of somekind. i don't really recall. and I started eating it and it had a very odd taste. I didn't know what it was, it was like chicken... but not really. I then started to eat the rest of it and then I saw different bones that I have NEVER found in chickens before. I couldn't even identify which part of the chicken it was and the meat was very tough and then it hit me.... THAT WASN'T CHICKEN!!I almost threw up right then and there! I barely made it in time to go to the bathroom and vomit what I had eaten of my faux-chicken. Now I have NO idea what the hell it was that I ate. I tried to ask the cashier and she insisted it was chicken, but then she reluctantly said that it wasn't and when I demanded my money back she quit talking and wouldn't say exactly what the hell it was! The owner came out and started yelling at me and started yelling in Spanish (there is nothing quite like Spanish in a thick chinese accent!) and wouldn't stop even when I told her that I don't speak Spanish and then I realized she wasn't yelling to communicate with me, but with the other patrons who were starting to look at their own food with concern. I got my money back and bolted out of there and have NEVER gone back!!

OK I know I am spoiled, I am from SF area, I am a cook, a chef, in this food business for 2/3rds of my life.  I am telling you that I've been disappointed so many times in Montreal restaurants; I don't even write about the restaurants if I am disappointed that's why I don't have many reviews about Montreal restaurants but here I am now.  Try this one.  It's been opened for little more than a week.  The view from this restaurant isn't good at all - dreadful construction site you have to see while you are eating - but inside of this restaurant is cool and hip.  And of course you have to judge the restaurant with their food right?  OMG, ok the salmon burger and Bailey's cream brulee was fantastic.  It's not easy to find a "Salmon Burger" that you just bite a one and say WOW  so here we are.  :)  Have you ever tried MSG over load Poutine in QC and got disgusted?? If you've been disappointed, you should try their Poutine here.  I bet that they use real stock for the poutine!  Delicious!  Oh well, I have to go there again and try more times to say something very fair but the first impression?  Absolutely you should try.  Oh Oh Oh!  Did I tell you that there is nowhere to go around Place d'art?  so try it! :)Everytime I come back here, I eat something new!!!Carrots, whoever thought carrots were tasty, but it was!!! We had the carrot risotto, the lobster with almond sauce, ravioli, and sweet breads and octopus, yeah it's like this weird surf and turf and for dessert a banana cake with ice cream and chocolate sauce, it was weak and really not on par with the savory stuff. I find this place extremely interesting and original. They come up with the most unsual combinations of ingredients and when you think about it, it's not clearly obvious why someone would put these things together, then you eat it and you're like wow really this makes sense why didn't people think of this...Nothing is straightforward here, it's always an obtuse and oblique interpretation as usual!!! I'm not saying I've liked everything I ate here, but some of the stuff I didn't like, I can still see there was some thought put into it, what the chef was trying to do. That for me still gets points even if I didn't like the dish. When I eat here I can feel the intense passion for the food more so than most other places, I don't know who creates the menu at this place but I'm thinking it has to be someone so interesting!!! I know whatever, let me have my fantasy!!! lolexamples from previous visits:foie gras and rhubarbe, (foie gras is torchon not seared, I think the seared foie gras would have been better)seared shrimps with bone marrow and orange miso sauce !!! this one was amazingAnd this time carrot risotto with passion fruit, sweetbreads and octopus.The carrot risotto, carrot in the sauce, with carrot bits, seriously could be the best risotto I've had the past few years. Maybe there was too much sauce or too runny as they say, but I didn't mind, It tasted great. My one only caveat was the shrimps were kind of like those mini cocktail shrimps and they didn't add anything to the dish, maybe a sear could add more flavour. The dish was amazing never thought carrots could taste so good.The sweetbread and octopus. the sweetbreads was crispy and octopus was tender, garnished with peach slices, string beans and mushrooms. a pleasant dish fresh with contrasting textures colours and flavours. very nice, I promote this place to be my new favourite french resto in MTL.The ravioli was much better meat was better salted this time around huge improvement over last time, and the ravioli texture was perfect. The lobster was so so, didn't fly for me.FYI: they just expanded about 3 weeks ago, it is now twice as big, they took over the space next door.Quality food served with style, this is my short summary about the Bouillon Bilk experience. All the plates I managed to dig in were delicious. For everybody who will bother to read this review, the menu of the restaurant changes periodically and my descriptions below may not be valid in few months. The best of the appetizers:The risotto with white truffles was amazing, you won't find it on the menu and the portion won't fill you up, but the ingredients are perfect;Linguini with rabbit and snails, perfectly balanced, filling dish;The amuse bouche is not optional, you must have the bone marrow.  Mains were even better:I would definitely come back for my venison, it was perfectly medium rare cooked, surrounded by rich combination of side flavours; The cappelleti with parsnip, lobster and chestnut is absolutely the best alternative as a  main course for seafood lovers;Are you scallops addict, don't hesitate, the chef knows how to prepare them. The desserts are delicious and presented with imagination: parsnip ice-cream was my little discovery for the night. The wine list is long, rather then reading and pretending that we know what to choose we followed the sommelier's advice. He brought us three bottles that should match our predominately seafood choices and the two of them we picked were wonderful. Beware the restaurant will charge a deposit for big group of people, they accept reservations up to ten and the deposit will be reimbursed back to your credit card once you are at the restaurant. Fantastic restaurant for our first group dinner in 2015!My muse was probably watching over, since it placed me within walking distance of Bouillon Bilk...Simple urban design, endless bar seating, low ceilings and dimmed lights set my mood right from the start.It's packed. Always packed. So do make reservations. However - if you alone or do not mind eating at the bar, you can still score seat there.I asked sazerac as soon as I saw it on the list, but alas, it was not available that night, and my server (who was very helpful and nice, btw), recommended another drink of similar composition (name escapes me at the moment), which was incredibly well made.It's all started with perfect drink... Followed by bread and butter... Then, beautifully presented sweetbreads, veal tongue & celery root appetizer arrived. My eyes lit up, and my taste buds started singing. It was delicious. But it was not over yet - my cleaned to the original shine plate disappeared magically, and in it place came main course - perfectly seared scallops, cauliflower, shiitake mushrooms & watercress. I closed my eyes in joy and savored it piece by piece... I was not planning on dessert (ok, that's a bold fat lie if you know me. shhhh!), but I could not resist special that day - chocolate macaron, a scoop of ice cream & little cup of warmed wine, all together complimenting each other in taste pairing and in presentation.It was an amazing meal all together.For me, the class of Bouillon Bilk stands up there with Envy and Juni - with service, food and presentation being on the level that put it on the list of my forever favorites.I love the name of this restaurant, WOO for alliteration. Boullion Bilk - it's fun to say. I find the name attractive as well as everything inside - environment and cuisine. All appealing and cool and lovely. The decor is extremely simple and clean. Wooden floors, white walls, white tablecloths and napkins, big heavy wooden tables. No crazy artwork or light fixtures, just simple textures and clean lines. We started with the "Quebec Cheese Assortment" (5 cheeses for $20 or 3 for $15). Of course we got 5, and they were each local and incredible. I can't remember the exact names of each cheese, and I know they rotate depending on what's available, but they're five very different and beautiful options. We ate every single bite, of course. What's better than cheese?? I can't think of anything.For my entree, I ordered the scallop dish which comes with zucchini, shiitake mushrooms, pear, and watercress served in a brown butter. Oh my stars, you guys. These scallops were the most buttery, perfectly seared, velvety pieces of fish everrrr. The brown butter was rich and fantastic and the pear provided a really interesting sweetness. This particular dish was $31 which is a bit pricey considering the small portion. It's enough food for one person surely, a healthy size, but I was craving a bit more in the end. Wonderful wine menu here as well with some great local options.

Vegetarian burrito AND grilled Vegetarian burritos are both made with animal lard (in the beans).  One employee shrugged her shoulders, another said "that's the way it is", and a third said I'd just have to order it without the (lard) beans.  Why make this naive restaurant mistake?  Don't call it a vegetarian burrito if it isn't vegetarian.  Just call it a veggie burrito.   It's especially annoying because vegetarians tend to gravitate towards more gringo places like this one that are more likely to have vegetarian items than the more "traditional" Mexican places where lard and chicken stock is put in everything.Grilled veggie burrito had cold cheese inside.  Not melted, not lukewarm, but cold.  Tortilla wasn't the slightest bit warm either, just as if it was served raw.  So there's this cool to the touch tortilla with cold cheese inside, and then the grilled veggies.  Tables receive salsa which is nice, the hot is really more of a medium, but then a small portion of chips.  The one-top next to me had the same chips portion and we had 3 in our party.  Why do this to people?  You're going to hear a request for more chips within the first few minutes, and people are going to wonder why the table only had one little portion in the first place.Atmosphere is clean with huge mirrors on some of the walls, and a flat panel TV on the other showing a nature documentary.  A few fake Macaws hanging from the ceiling.  It still has a trace of the Pick Up Stix feel that used to be here but went out of business.  Ordering procedure is the same.Staff was entirely unlike most Mexican places - vast majority of people were caucasian, or gringo if you prefer, and that raises an eyebrow in an ethnic restaurant.  Maybe that matters to the reader here, maybe not.On a positive note, the employees did check on tables as folks were dining, and were over the top with politeness.   That's incredibly rare these days.

Review Text :
We stopped by the M Resort for some light bites and drinks. The oyster bar thats a part of Anthony's has and east/west motif to their menu. Half of the menu has Asian-inspired fare, while the other half has American fare. Three types of oysters were offered. We went with half a dozen of the smaller Kusshi oysters. Clean and mild tasting, they were a great start to our meal. Next up was a cucumber and watermelon salad ($10). I envisioned a beautifully composed, petite salad. What we got was the opposite. It was a large mound of lettuce, vegetables, and watermelon drowning in a kim chee vinaigrette. The flavors were somewhat bold and spicy but it was so heavy-handed that I could only eat a few bites.We moved over to a different bar closer to their main dining room to check out their menu. Yup, a completely different bar menu. Not sure why they felt it necessary to have a separate menu, but whatever. The beef tartare ($22) was another heavy-handed dish. The cylindrical stack of beef sat atop mixed greens. On top of the beef was a substantial pile of pickled red onions and a quail egg. The dish was way too acidic, drowning in a sauce that was probably masking inferior beef. There were two more sauces needlessly spread across the plate. Talk about overkill... there were about half a dozen ingredients that should have been left off the dish.The last item we tried were the lobster tacos ($24). Surprise, surprise... it was another heavy-handed dish with an excessive amount of ingredients. They used so much chipotle aioli and avocado mousse that I couldn't even taste lobster. Sauce was oozing out in every direction.Anthony's has a menu -- or menus, plural -- that sound appetizing, but unfortunately the execution is lacking.2.5 Stars

Review Text :
With all that Las Vegas has to offer on the culinary scene, one of its weakest categories is Barbeque. Barbeque in Las Vegas has been a joke that just doesn't get funnier with each telling. It's apparent that Vegas needs Barbeque, because there is always another joint being opened up by someone who has no idea how to make Barbeque.The few places that do Barbeque right in this town get everything else wrong. Remember, Barbeque is working man's food. It is supposed to be affordable and in large quantities that satisfy the hungriest cowboy - an idea that Lucille's has completely forgotten. It is also supposed to be rustic and down-home, served in off-the-wall joints with billows of smoke flavoring the neighborhood - something you won't get at the Wisconsin based Dave's.Then comes Big Paul's BBQ. You've never heard of it, it not a chain. You've probably never seen it, it sits quietly on a simple strip mall corner of western Flamingo Ave. It's rustic, it's understated, it down-home - in-other-words - it's almost perfect.Ribs, Chicken, Links, Brisket, Pulled Pork and Catfish are just a few of the menu items to choose from. I had the Brisket and Ribs combo - 3 full pounds of deliciously smoke meat a couple of sides and bread.The brisket was perfectly tender, with a beautiful ring of pink on the outside as proof its slow-smoked preparation. You could tell that Paul left the fat on the brisket during the smoking process. The ribs were equally well smoked and fall-off-the-bone tender just like the brisket. I got both without the sauce, because I like to taste the Barbeque itself before the sauce has its affect. The BBQ Beans were definitely delicious, the green beans were canned and one of the few detractions to the rest of the meal. The dry ribs were evidence that Paul doesn't do much to season the Barbeque during the smoking process. Although some prefer their Barbeque this way, I have always been a bigger fan of a dry rub or a vinegar wash during smoking.All-in-all, the meat was delicious and the spicy BBQ Sauce was pretty good (next time I will try the regular BBQ Sauce). Big Paul is from the Houston area and he holds true to the region's Barbeque roots. I think with time, Big Paul's BBQ could definitely evolve into a local gem. It gets 3 stars now, but I can see it moving up to 4 in no time.The second BBQ restaurant at this location post Shish Kabob House.  I was a fan of the last place and the only person to ever write a review on it :(  The menu seems to be about the same as the last with a couple of additions to the sides menu and some pretty good food combos for 2 or more.  It was July 4th.  I left work late and we didn't feel like firing up the grill.  My initial plan was to just go pick up Famous Dave's but ended up taking a quick right while driving west on Flamingo due to this overpowering smell of barbecued meat!  What the heck right?  Better off supporting a local mom and pop place than a megachain anyways.  I ordered the combo of baby back ribs slab, 20 hot wings and 2 large sides for $24.99.  The slab of ribs with 2 small sides was almost $20 so this was a no brainer for $5 more.  The ribs were pretty awesome.  They had a fantastic smokey flavor to them that one could only get by slow cooking those babies all day.  Wings were pretty standard.  About the same as any other pizza joint in town but good enough.  The cashier recommended the red beans and rice along with the macaroni salad for sides which were both spot on.Already planning on getting the brisket and pulled pork for my next order!Honestly, I'd give this place negative stars if I could. The food was ok, but as a paying customer, I expect to be treated with courtesy and not like a criminal.I live very close (less than 5 minutes by car) to this place and was very excited to have a bbq place in the neighborhood; so excited that when my cousin came to visit, I recommended we give it a try. We drive up there and place our order with who we later found out was the owner (yes, Big Paul himself). He was not the friendliest of guys, but the prices were reasonable, we were hungry, and the place smelled great so I overlooked it.We brought our food home and I was ready to sink my teeth in to a juicy smoked rib, only to bite down in to a tough, rubbery piece of meat that I literally could not chew. But the sauce was pretty tasty and we'd ordered other items so though I was disappointed by the ribs, I moved on to the brisket and pulled pork. Neither was anything to write home about, but the meat was at least chewable and as I said before the sauce was good. We finished eating and my pregnant cousin reached in to her bag for dessert, only to find that they had forgotten to include her peach cobbler. No big deal, we lived close and they deliver. She called the restaurant to inform them of the mistake. They did not offer to deliver it to us, but agreed when asked. My cousin also asked if she could be upgraded to a large as compensation for the mistake. The girl on the other end said "that shouldn't be a problem." The delivery guy shows up at the house with a small peach cobbler. My cousin asks about the large and the driver knows nothing about it. She repeated what the girl on the phone had told her and he said he would call and find out what happened. The delivery guy gets in his car to use the phone and a minute later we hear his car drive away, assuming he was going to get the large cobbler. We wait half an hour and then my cousin calls again. This time the owner gets on the phone. My cousin politely explains what happened to him and we were both STUNNED when the owner begins shouting at her and saying that he "waisted gas" sending his driver to her and if she didn't want a small, that was "her problem." Still in shock, my cousin explains that there must have been a misunderstanding. Still rude, the owner says that she can come pick up her money (which was only $2.99 by the way) but he was done with the whole situation. He would not even listen to her speak.  At this point my cousin is becoming upset (not to mention hormonal, because she is pregnant). She tries voicing how displeased she is with the way she is being treated and the owner asks her is she BELIEVES IN GOD!!! WTF?!?!? What did that have to do with anything? How unprofessional can you be?!  Incredibly annoyed by now, I accompany my cousin back to the restaurant. Again, it was only $3 but she still wanted the peach cobbler (again, pregnant).  We walk in and she says to the owner, "Sir I ordered a peach cobbler and..." Before she could finish speaking he opens the register and cuts her off to say "There's your money, now you can go." Shocked again, my cousin says "I would just like to say that I am very disappointed with..." He cuts her off again, "You made your point, now get out. If you don't leave now, I'll call the cops. I've got you on camera and I know your address." (Which was actually MY address because she doesn't live here in Vegas). By now, my cousin is PISSED. "Call the cops." She tells him, "I've done nothing wrong. All I wanted was to upgrade a small peach cobbler to a large, no one even bothered to ask me if I was willing to pay the additional money for an upgrade! I'm a paying customer!" He gets on the phone and dials the police. To avoid any trouble, we left the restaurant both disappointed and confused. As we are getting in to the car, the owner follows us outside to read off the license plate number to my cousin's rental car to the police (supposedly) on the phone. My experience here was so horrible and so disappointing, I will NEVER eat here again. I wish the opposite were true, but in my opinion bad service out weighs good bbq sauce. Never in my life have I been so disrespected and treated like a criminal just for ordering dessert. Especially when it was THEM who made the mistake in the first place. They really need to learn how to do business with people or they surely will not last long.

Review Text :
I have been to Bite Bistro several times... living in Bellevue, then moving to neighboring Avalon, it's rare that I have a chance to brag about culinary attractions in the area.For those unsure about where Bellevue is, Bite Bistro is worth the extra work to figure it out and make the trip (it's really only a few minutes outside of the city!).  Bite Bistro is a welcoming restaurant, stylish and modern but comfortable and casual.  There is usually a nice mix of older fine dining patrons and younger couples and groups.  It's BYOB and they offer a lot of tasty mixers for liquor.  Many of the ones I've tried are a bit too sweet for me, so I usually settle with a bottle of wine or beer.  This particular trip to Bite I was concerned because nothing on the menu immediately jumped out as an easy choice.  They recently removed my go-to Prosciutto Sandwich (with St. Andres cheese, amazing sandwich), so I was desperate to find my next fave dish.  My husband ordered the Hanger Steak, which is a delicious mix of juicy flavorful steak and Bite's unbeatable fries.  Can't go wrong with that, but I was looking for something a little less heavy.  I settled on the Duck Breast and squash.  I don't remember ever having duck, so this was a leap.  It came out medium rare, sliced over top of tenderly sauteed squash, brussel sprouts, and fresh cranberries.  The duck was so juicy it was unbelievable.  I'm not usually a fan of fat on meat, but the thin edge of fat on one of the pieces was like butter mixed with the delicious duck.  The bitter crunchy cranberries and rich flavors of the squash and brussels was perfectly balanced.  My husband even liked the duck more than the steak (and the steak was good, people).  One thing I love about Bite is that I always have room for dessert, and they always have something that is interesting.  Tonight we treated ourselves to the goat cheese and warm cider dessert.  The goat cheese was so creamy and rich that I could have eaten a bucket of it.  Served with little pieces of bread and apples this was a great fall/winter dessert idea.  The warm cider was a nice finishing touch.  I have had dishes I like more than others at Bite, but I've never had any dish there that was not thoughtfully cooked, carefully presented, and creative.  I couldn't ask for more than that from a restaurant.  The service is always fantastic.  I would come here every night if I could!  Next time I'm there I'd love to experience a chef's tasting.  Keep up the great work, Bite Bistro!

Delicious and creative taco's, although in Montreal we have a lack of taco trucks so everyone may have flipped out on this one and lost all perspective. Friends of mine recently booked the taco truck to cater their wedding and have been thrilled with the kind service and tasty sampling options, so the great reputation comes with a dose of good-people-ness that puts me up to 5 stars.

We came in on Saturday night.  We had a reservation, but it would not have been necessary on this particular evening.  Got got one of the tiny round marble tables along the banquet.Our server Brent checked in with us right away.  We thought his service was superior through out our visit.  BJ opted for a Butternuts Pork Slap and I got a Ronaldo which was house made raspberry vodka, grenadine, and citrus sparkling.  Loved my drink and BJ loved his beer!While we pondered the menu, we decided to get an appetizer and share a Wedge salad.  They were thoughtful enough to divide the salad for us.  I was surprised at the size of my half portion.  It was huge.  The wedge was baby iceberg, super crisp bacon, roasted tomatoes-yum!!, croutons, ramps-my first experience, and the most incredible house made blue cheese with nice chunks of blue cheese.  The Yukon Skins appetizer was the perfect size for two.  This was my first experience with pork belly pastrami and I liked it.  After some debate, BJ got the smoked pork chop with pastrami, baked beans and  spicy apple slaw.  I tried his meal.  The chop was incredible, as was the beans and slaw.  I loved the kick from the jalapenos.  Best slaw ever!  And the portion size was big.  It's the first time that BJ didn't finish this meal.  I am usually the one with the carry out bag.  I got the lobster risotto for my meal.  The portion size was fairly small, which was good because there were so many other things that I wanted to eat!  The risotto was not my favorite, it was a little too watery for my taste and the lobster was a little stringy.  Not bad, but not that great, either.For dessert, we shared the blueberry pana cotta.  It was cute that they served it in a mason jar, but not so great when it came to eating it.  We had to use our small coffee spoons to be able to get a nice mix of the cream with the blueberries.  Also, the texture was a bit rubbery, but we still loved the flavor.  For those of you parking in the Theater Square garage, M & P is able to offer a reduced rate parking.  Just ask your server.  Loved our dinner!The BEST brunch in the 'Burgh, hands down!  For starters, FINALLY a Pittsburgh establishment has an honest to God Bloody Mary bar!  And, if you sit at the bar during Saturday or Sunday brunch, Bloody Mary's are all you can drink for $15.  That, my friend, is a deal.Now on to the food.  Wow.  Here I go with superlatives again, but the shortrib hash with poached eggs drizzled with horseradish hollandaise was, without a doubt, absolutely stellar!  Rich, melt-in-your-mouth, succulent shredded shortribs melded together with creamy potato cubes.  Perched atop were two perfectly poached eggs whose yolks, when pierced by a fork, enveloped the hash in creaminess only surpassed by the final crowning glory of a zippy housemade horseradish hollandise.  Superb....I've been fantasizing about them ever since.  The hubby enjoyed a plate of chicken and waffles.  You may recall he ordered the same thing at Alchemy & Ale recently...Meat & Potatoes makes chicken and waffles the way they SHOULD be made!  Crisp, crunchy, JUICY, ON THE BONE chicken pieces piled atop a crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside cheddar jalapeno waffle kissed with bacon bourbon maple syrup.  Ooooooo....maple. Bacon. Bourbon.  We each had a specialty drink - me the Bacon & Egg - a blend of bacon vodka, orange juice, sugar and egg white.  The bacon vodka was a house infusion that packed more bacon punch than the Bakon brand I have in my bar.  I am going to try my own bacon infusion again!  The drink was interesting, but next time I want all that bacon-y goodness in a Bloody Mary!  Fond memories of San Remo and Monte Carlo meals always ending with Fernet Branca enticed the hubster to order a Kingston which included Drambuie and Fernet Branca along with pineapple juice.  He enjoyed it, but enjoyed his Shock Top Pumpkin Wheat Ale even more!  He IS a pumkin ale fan.The brunch prices here are amazingly reasonable!  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, professional and efficient.  The kitchen is top notch!  Meat & Potatoes is a PERFECT way to start a weekend morning!I know what you're thinking... Seriously, another 5 star review? Why so? Here's the deal folks. This place has consistently been awesome. Dinner: awesome! Brunch: awesome! And drumroll please... Lunch: AWESOME!There's not many places I can say that about, but they find a way to be creative and deliscious with every meal. I do hope you read all my other reviews on this place for tips on what I thought were gear choice (poutine, cough cough) but for lunch I probably had thee best fish sandwich I've ever had! They just opened for lunch today and are running a special Lentin menu with fish, fish and more fish... And one burger (seriously, if you don't like fish or a burger you might be screwed till Easter.). I had the Parmesan fish sammie, which was a generous portion of perfectly battered fish, a VERY generous portion of provolone and tomato sauce. But the crown jewel was the smoked potato salad side dish. Again, generous portion of some of the most delectable and inventive potato salad I've ever had! The smoked taste stayed with me for a while after, but rather than garlic breathe, it was actual a reminder how, oh. My. Gawd. Amazing it was! To be continued....My review in one word - disappointing. How about two words? Very disappointing. We were so excited to try this place after strong yelp reviews and friends' recommendations so we saved our first visit for my birthday. 6:15 Saturday night reservations started off great. Seated right away, asked if we had theater plans so they could make sure they tended us in a timely manner. Seemed like a great beginning. That was when it went downhill. The two of us were seated along the wall where the " tables" for two are located. These tables are woefully small and completely inadequate for any dinner setting. And they are so close together!! They are essentially thigh width apart!! There should be a minimum state requirement of butt width for goodness sake! Even the skinny busboys couldn't wedge themselves in there. When your chair is wider than the table, you know it's bad. Makes for a very disruptive dining experience when your neighbor leaves. Plus, I think the fire marshall should have a look at this. Can't be safe. When I say close together, I mean the plates of the diners on either side of me were just as close to me as my wife's across the table! Everything was in arms reach. I wanted a table for two, not a party of six. I am not that interested in your life, trust me. Beer served in cans is not my style but I did one anyway. Arrived warm. Wanted to try the smoked wings we'd heard about so we started with those and the curry mussels. Both came out together and we literally had to stack them on top of each other on the table since it was so tiny. Ridiculous. The wings were the best thing all night - good, not great. I'm a huge mussels fan and was excited when they arrived looking fresh and delish. They were large but not delish. There was NO flavor. Bland with a capital B. No curry flavor at all - I think the steaming liquid would have tasted better.  Did the spice cabinet turn out to be empty? Nice quantity though. Just not what I would have expected. Frankly I could have stopped eating here - and wish I had. We had placed our entire order at one time. I ordered the brisket sandwich and my wife the short rib flatbread. Between appetizers and entree was at least 50 minutes. At one point I was finally able to grab our server ( where DOES she does disappear to?) and told her, if it's not out now, just cancel the order. She had stopped by 25 minutes prior and said they'd be out in one minute. Wrong.Amazingly, mine came out but she dropped the flat bread in the kitchen.  Service disaster. Let's just say 2 1/2 hours is way too long for what we had. One hour waits between courses? Absurd. Service was among the worst I've ever experienced. And the brisket? After 3 bites I put my utensils down. Not good at all. Another flavorless serving. Flatbread? Awful. Short rib my eye. If there was more than an ounce of short rib on there I'll buy your next meal. I feel bad giving it two stars but that was what my experience calls for. Oh, and the very limited draft beer menu? No Oktoberfest at all. Instead, a summer session ale? I mean, come on guys - this is October! There's no excuse for that. And at $7 and $10 each for our drafts, this is not a place I'd even want to drink.We were very excited to try this restaurant and went there on Saturday night for my husband's birthday. After reading a lot of the Yelp reviews, I was looking forward to the food and was concerned about the poor service many before us reviewed.Well as you may guess by the rating, neither the food or the service was up to par. In my opinion, one of the very best things a restaurant can do to ensure its success is to make sure their servers are knowledgeable, gracious, super efficient & personable. If I'd had that, I'd probably give the food another chance. The most glaring failure during order taking was asking if we wanted bread or frites with our mussels and failing to mention when my husband said frites that he would again be served French fries with his brisket sandwich. Who seriously needs 2 orders of fries during 1 service? Our first beers we ordered off the bar menu were served in cans - that's an inexcusable restaurant decision that I wish they had made more obvious on that bar menu. Seriously, it's a gastropub not a tailgate!  Draft beers were not mentioned by our server and had we not read the board on the other side of the bar and done an online search for the beer's description, we wouldn't have known they existed or what they were. She had no idea about any of the drafts when we asked.So many things on the menu were appealing we decided to order 4 items. We started with the smoked wings (recommended highly by other Yelpers) and the curry mussels. I got the feeling if we hadn't specified to our server that we considered the final 2 items to be our entrees, that all 4 items would have shown up at our ridiculously tiny table for 2 at once. When the 2 appetizers arrived at once we had to pile everything on top of each other because the table didn't have room for 2 appetizers plus 2 small appetizer plates. The wings were actually really delicious with a nice smokey flavor and turned out to be  the highlight of the meal. The mussels were nicely sized and plentiful but the curry sauce was sorely lacking in flavor. Then our server disappeared for 20 minutes, stopped by to tell us she was sorry about our wait but our food would be up in 1 minute, then disappeared for 25 additional minutes. My husband found her scurrying by long enough to tell her to please cancel the rest of our food if it wasn't already sitting in the back. She disappeared for another 5 minutes and appeared with only my husband's brisket sandwich which came with more frites. She squeezed into the tiny space between us & the next table and informed me that my short rib flatbread had hit the floor as she was racing it to our table but that they had started another one and it would be done in 7 minutes. Not sure why the first one couldn't come out in 45 if it only took 7 to cook. Neither the brisket nor the flatbread were very good and unfortunately our attitudes toward Meat & Potatoes weren't either by the end of the evening.Rachel C and I feasted like champion eaters at Meat & Potatoes. We started with the mussels, which were a very generous portion. They were served in a peppery curry sauce and we received some bread for dipping. Then the kitchen sent out some fried pickles and brussels on the house - both were great! Next up was the mac and cheese with chorizo and pulled pork (!!!). The cheese was definitely very Velveeta-esque (pretty sure it was Velveeta). Delish. I was so stuffed at this point that I really couldn't eat much of my main course. A shame because it was also awesome. Hanger steak with all kinds of veggies and potatoes. Our server was great and very knowledgeable about the menu. When she brought over my slightly-dirty martini, she immediately asked me to let her know if it was too dirty. It was, and I appreciated that she recognized that right away. My replacement martini was just right. Next time I find myself in Pittsburgh, Meat and Potatoes is definitely on the agenda!I have to say that since moving from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, I've been disappointed with the restaurants I've tried so far. Philly made me a total food snob, which happens easily when you can eat any cuisine at any time on any street corner and have a great meal, whether it's $10 or $50. I know, I know there are great places in Pittsburgh and everyone tells me I just haven't been to the "right" places yet.Meat & Potatoes was one of those places! My faith in Pittsburgh food is restored. This was easily the best meal I've had here and definitely up there for one of the best meals I've had anywhere. From my phone call making reservations to dessert, we had an amazing experience here.I called to make reservations and was connected with Matthew, who was extremely helpful and very pleasant! I had to call back soon after to make changes due to a change in our party number and he was overall very accommodating.  We arrived a bit before our reservation and got drinks at the bar. They have a nice selection of beers, some drafts and then an extensive bottle selection. It was quite crowded, so we took our drinks out to the lobby where there are large, comfy couches and tables to wait for our table. When we were seated, we were introduced to Josh, who was a magnificent server and made our meal very enjoyable! He took great care of us throughout the night, from making sure we had everything we needed to making menu suggestions at our request.Everything was delicious. We started with the Curry Mussels and Wild Mushroom Risotto. They were a great indication of the quality of the food we were going to have and we could not stop raving about it. The risotto was creamy and cooked perfectly. I am a huge fan of Mussels and loved something other than the traditional red or white sauce. Curry, coconut milk, lemongrass...YUM!Each of us ordered a different entree and shared so we could sample everything. I could not have been happier with my selection. I ordered the Agnolotti pasta. It had pecorino romano cheese, greens, sweet potatoes and a maple bourbon foam. I was intrigued right away. A sweet, savory pasta dish that was definitely one of the most delicious and unique I had ever tasted. I am to stop myself from devouring it just so I could savor the leftovers!The other dishes were equally as delicious! (Some of the best steak I've ever had.)Pappardelle pasta with bolognese sauce, short rib, pancetta and pork shoulderWagyu Flat Iron with heirloom cherry tomatoes, pickled jicama, wasabi mashed potatoesHanger Steak with pulled potatoes, romesco,  water cress, green onions, jalapeno vinaigretteOh and it didn't stop there. We decided to indulge in dessert because we knew it would be amazing. We shared an Eggnog pot de creme and a chocolate mousse that were both out of this world!!I will definitely be going back because there were other menu items such as the Korean Reuban and  Lamb Burger that definitely caught my eye as well!I have been wanting to go to Meat & Potatoes for a long time. I have heard such good things so this was a place I really needed to go to. Lo and behold I was asked to a late night birthday celebration! It was held on Monday after 10. We were presented with two menus. A late night menu and the regular menu.  I was torn. The late night menu was $5!!! And the menu looked amazing, mussels, oyster, patty melt, shake and bake chicken, and an assortment of flat breads! Wow, what a great menu and a great deal.  But would the portions be enough? Or was this a sampling menu. I was hungry. I didn't want this $5 menu to turn out to be some sliders and a chicken leg. So I asked the waitress about the portion size. She said that they were small, but still good and made a shape with her hands that looked like a slider sized bun.OK, I thought to myself, better go with the big girl menu.  I ordered the Kimchi Ruben from the regular menu. The rest of the party went with the late night menu, and ordered two of each of the $5 plates. My food came first, and it was delicious. The bread was thick and crusty, and did not get soggy even the next day. The corned beef was cut to perfection and the kimchi (brussels sprouts) was spot on. Just enough spice and heat to make me want to try it again. But, then the rest of the food came out. And let me tell you, that  $5 menu was no joke. The flat breads were so good. I got to try the greens and chilies flatbread. OH MY. The greens were cooked to sweet perfection and when you took a bite it was heaven, with that kick of chilies mixed in. Just enough to make you go, "WOW" but not overwhelming. The Patty Melt was amazing. Juicy, cheesy, and the bread was thick and toasted just right. The mussels were marinating in this amazing buttery garlic sauce that made you dip your crusts of bread in it, just to get another bite. So good.(Can you tell we shared plates?)My only complaint is that if the waitress wouldn't have told me that the sizes were small I would have saved some money and just ordered off the late night menu. But I was not disappointed with my order or all of the other dishes I tried at all. And it makes me want to go back soon. This time, I will focus on the late night menu!!If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck & looks like a duck, then it's duck so please send it to Meat and Potatoes promptly as I will be over to eat it shortly.  Just thinking about it gets me all quacked up.  First time there but definitely not our last trip to M&P.  We arranged reservations almost 2 weeks in advance and when we arrived the waiting area was packed with other reservation holders so reservations are a must.  I did see a table or two that was not occupied during our early dinner but I chuck that up to the hours we were dining, 5pm on a Saturday.  Well it worked out perfect since we were coming from an afternoon show.I studied the menu for two weeks looking it over and over and wondering what I would order.  I had thought of the fried pickles as these are one of my favorites, or the pork belly taco's because come on pork belly in a taco!  Yum, but no.  My recent love affair with duck had me swooning for it...  I also saw so many wonderful pictures of the bone marrow I had to give that a shot too.  I can say confidently that I picked wisely.  This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.As I looked to my H who I convinced to order the Wagyu, I stated, "Welcome to my new favorite restaurant".  He absolutely loved the wagya, he said I wish there was just one more piece of it.  I think he could have had two... Lucky for me my plate filled me and though I could have eaten more I didn't have to, the portion was perfect.  I could've done without the pierogies.   I love pierogies but this one wasn't my thing.  All is fine I gladly gave them to my H to eat and he happily did so.  The atmosphere here seems casual with an upscale feel at the same time and the seats were like sitting on your overstuffed couch.  I melted in.  I will be back M&P you really got all your ducks in a row.The thing that I really want to talk about when it comes to Meat & Potatos is the seating. If you want a food review you can read one of the many others. I want to say something about the seating. I really don't like sitting really closely to other people. There are many 2 person tables that pretty much line the border of the restaurant. So you are basically eating with the people on your left and right so it makes for a poor experience when you sit next to overly chatty people who want to talk to you and or when you're sitting next to drunk people. Also I don't know what the waiter looked like because he was literally standing directly behind me the entire meal, because I was facing the wall and there is no room to take the order from the side of the table because the waiter's butt would be in the faces of the table next to you. That is a little annoying to me. I wish the seating was better but over all it was a good experience and the food was delicious.Impressive...so impressive. Another place that makes me gloat about how cool Pittsburgh is. There was a bit of a mix up with reservations, and the room we'd requested wasn't available. Because of this mistake, though, the manager made sure we were seated, and our party was comped appetizers. Good business! Those apps were divine: mushroom flatbread, tuna tartare tacos, fries...we passed them around again and again, our eyes telling the story of our love for them. I had never eaten dinner here before, so I was really excited, and I ordered the pot roast. It's meat and potatoes, people. I'm not leaving here without some mash! While I was waiting on the dinner, I tried the 25th hour cocktail, a blend of gin and citrus that I would love to recreate at home. M&P is well-known for their creativity behind the bar, and tonight did not disappoint. Now for the meal! OMG. Meat was tender and juicy, and it sat on a bed of the most perfect consistency of mashed potatoes one could ask for. The plate was adorned  with a gravy that brought the whole dish together, and I was in glutton heaven. It was a special occasion, and I hit the gym the next day :)Of course, we didn't stop there. To complete the celebration of the evening, the table ordered each of the three desserts to share: panacotta, Heath bar, and chocolate Oreo. Each of these desserts comes in a mason jar and is packed with deliciousness. Everyone had a different fav. Service was outstanding!Five stars, well-deserved.One of my favorite dinner spots downtown with dishes that are a bit pricey (for the Pittsburgh market) but well-executed. Never really have been let down with food options here plus they have a reasonable selection of beers. Always busy so make sure to make a reservation beforehand! I haven't had the brunch here so all my comments are for dinner but I will say I've heard good things about the brunch. It's on my to do list...On a side note, Monday nights after 10 PM they have industry night for the folks who are in the restaurant industry. They offer $8 bites and drink specials- definitely worth checking out if you're out late on a Monday. Food:I've eaten a number of dishes here and quite frankly have never been disappointed. It is, in true Pittsburgh fashion, rather decadent so don't go if you're on a diet. My favorites:Snacks/Apps- fried taters with black truffle mayo (the mayo really sells it in my opinion), Mac n cheese (a generous serving of mixed in chorizo packs in a nice punch of flavor; eat and expect an impending nap), fried brussels (my favorite but again, not the healthy kind your mom made you eat as a kid)Entrees- lamb burger (just all-in-all well executed burger), pork chop Also if you're there for industry night on Monday, I believe the menu may rotate each time but if poutines are on the menu (see picture) go for Asian Persuasion and Southern Pride. Three poutine dishes was more than plenty for 4 of us following an appetizer or two. Drinks:Had a mixed experience with cocktails here. Not all that impressed with them so if you're on the fence about a cocktail or draft beer, I'd steer towards the latter. They seem to always have a few interesting ones on tap. If you're looking for a place for a quick drink with friends downtown and are willing to stand at the bar, it's a worthwhile stop. Ambience:Matches the food- lots of wood, warm and dimly lit. As I alluded to before, it's a nice way to prep you for the food coma to come. The place seems busy often do not a quiet romantic date spot but certainly trendy and interesting enough for a date or with a few friends. Large groups would probably be difficult to seat here- haven't tried before. Service:Generally good although can be a bit slower when things are busy. Never had issues so far.We went again over the summer on my birthday. We started off with the Mac N Cheese appetizer (chorizo, pulled pork and loads of cheese!) So so good! A definite must try!This time for our entree the wife and I shared the 34 oz rib eye for two. It comes with confit steak fries, house made steak sauce and bone marrow gratin. It is AMAZING and a bargain at $59 as we ate off of it for days!!Our daughter had the Plain Jane burger with white cheddar cheese and loved it. I'm glad I made reservations as the place was packed the whole time we were there.Service was exceptional as our waitress Ashlee S was great and took good care of us.I've said before and I'll say it again. THIS PLACE IS A MUST TRY!!!Meat & Potatoes is practically legendary in Pittsburgh.  This restaurant is within the Cultural Trust building that contains a parking garage, the backstage bar, and the Cabaret Theater.  It is usually crowded so definitely make a reservation if possible.My friend and I came here as a celebration, and we ordered quite a bit of food.  We started with the Tartare ($16) and Short Rib Flatbread ($12).  We needed some instructions with the Tartare because we had no idea how to eat it.  We ended up ordering pita to it with it, but the server could have done a bit more explaining when asked.  The flatbread, however, was unique and delicious.  It had the rib meat, bleu cheese, and a sweetness to it.For dinner, I ordered the Parpadelle ($18), which was FANTASTIC.  I eat very little meat in general, but the meat here is flawless.  It is so perfectly tender and amazing.  The pasta and sauce were delicious as well.  Absolutely recommend.  My friend ordered the duck breast ($18), which was also delicious!  I know most people come here and get the giant cow thing, but I am not into meat enough to order that. We finished off our meal with some kind of Creme Brule dessert thing.  It was served in a mason jar and also had hints of chocolate.  It was just ok and really lacked any distinct flavor.  We did not even eat half of the dessert between two of us.So why is this place not perfect?  The lovely ambiance is ruined by tables that are too close together.  You can barely move and forget having much of a conversation with anyone you are out to dinner with.  The worst part is that you are so close that the people next to you will try to jump into your conversation.  It's basically family style seating, which is so not my scene.  While the food is fantastic, I am unlikely to return unless I want to sit alone at the bar.Roses are redmy steaks is tooI ordered an extra sideAnd there's none for you! (~o~)Soooo yummy ...this might be the best restaurant Iv been to during my stay in Pittsburgh!! the bar is just really inviting!! might be one of my favorite things about this restaurant! -Appetizers ----fried pickles! thinkin bout dat bikini body but also thinkin bout dem fried pickles...Fried pickles Strips ...Thin, crispy and savory, popular as an appetizer! -----mushroom truffle Risotto!! delectable Italian risotto with lots of mushrooms served with rich truffle oil and cheese..delish! -entrees------porterhouse for two...can feed like four people! holy shit! bone marrowCooked in butter...oven ed..served with toasted butter bread! there's other flavorings depending on the creativity and tradition of the cook!porterhouse steaksOne of the most famous thing to order here!  This meat seasoned and cooked perfectly! im impressed! potatoeswell seasoned as well...oven crispy on the outside and soft on the inside the biggest "french fries" i have ever seen! there was one thing i didn't like about this was the waiter serving me two teaspoons of ketchup when i have a full plates of potatoes..i kept asking for more but he just kept on giving me teaspoons... that was pretty irritating! just give me a dame ketchup  bottle...gosh!  champagnelove it! ;Dthe decor and atmosphere of this restaurant is nice.. however....didn't like how the tables were so connected to each other...i actually felt like i dining with other people just because the tables and chairs were so close to each other...

Review Text :
This place would've gotten 5 stars, but the customer service skills here suck. This isn't Dick's.You line up and let the person behind the counter know what kind of pizza you want. We had choices in front of us like meat lovers, cheese, veggie... we didn't see pepperoni, so when I asked, the guy was snooty and said yea.... like of course, it's a pizza place... but it was not in the window, so I asked. I also ordered a garlic knot. 6 for $3.95 was too many, so we got the 1 for $.95It only took a few minutes, but it was the longest few minutes in the world because it was so uncomfortable. They didn't talk to you or welcome you. They had sad looks on their faces and it felt like asking them for ranch was like pulling teeth. We sat just outside of the establishment and the pizza was great. Thin sliced New York style, of course. Sauce was good, not too sweet. The crust was not bland. It was a good slice. The garlic knot was good, too. Fluffy bread, not much garlic, just enough and it is served with hot marinara.The pizza here was decent. The hubby and I shared a slice of cheese pizza. He also got two garlic knots with marinara sauce. We washed everything down with a  Dr. Brown's root beer.For $5.45, the slice wasn't that huge and it was thin crust. Since it was thin crust, I was hoping that it would be crispy, but it wasn't. The pizza wasn't overly salty. The sauce had a nice seasoning to it. The garlic knots were awesome. They were just buttery, garlicky, and soft. I dipped it into the marinara sauce and stuffed it into my mouth. It made my tastebuds happy. The guy working there was cool. They were having this promotion with this mug. It was $10 but you could get free refills at any of their restaurants with a purchase. Without a purchase, it was $1 or something like that. He wasn't trying to sell it to me or anything. I noticed it and asked him about it. He took his time explaining it to me.

Restaurant name  Hot N Juicy Crawfish

Review Text :
We came to the new location last night to avoid the long wait at the original location. It still smells like construction in here. I love the decor. We get seated and our server asks us what we would like to drink. I order a Blue Moon and she tells me they don't have their alcohol permit yet. WTF?!!What we ordered:2 Calamari1 Fried Catfish Basket2 lbs Shrimp Hot N Juicy medium1 lb Shrimp Garlic Butter mild1 Chicken Nuggets Basket2 Chicken Wings Basket1 Fried Shrimp4 Bowls of RiceThe food was just as good as the original location. This is the first time I tried the Catfish and Calamari and they were both very good. My only other complaint is that the chicken wings for the kids took a long time and were brought out a few minutes apart. They should have just brought out the orders together, cause one kid had to watch the other kid eat. I will mos def come back to this location since there is no wait to be seated. Next time I will call first to make sure they have their alcohol permit.I told one of my coworkers about a new business that is having a grand opening today, and to meet us there after work.  I didn't know the exact address, so I told him to just search for the Hot N Juicy by name and go to the one closest to the Wynn.  He immediately thought I was trying to steer him to some other type of establishments hidden in plain sight throughout Las Vegas.At Hot N Juicy, where the girls on average are pretty, the service is very friendly and attentive, Hot n Juicy Special is always on the menu, individual experiences can be customized from Mild to Extra Spicy, you can definitely treat your mouth to a messy but happy ending.  And today only, you can enjoy it with a 2-for-1 special*.Come early and expect to wait at least 40 minutes, or take up the offer of a free limo shuttle service to Hot n Juicy (original location) where the food is the same, but without the wait and the services of the Hot N Juicy All-Star waitresses.  Again, the limo is presumably for the Grand Opening promotion only.Spicy level is supposedly a little higher than other places, so customize accordingly.  1 pound of crawfish may sound like a lot, but it really is not, as most of the weight is contributed by the lobster-mini-me shells.  If crawfish is not your thing, shrimp, lobster, clams, and various crabs (Dungeness, Blue, Snow and King), and raw oysters can be ordered.You can add the following sides to your above orders:Corn, potato, sausage, Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, bowl of rice, rolls and even extra seasoning sauce.Appetizers include Fried Shrimp, Fried Catfish, Soft Shell Crab, Calamari, Chicken Wings and Etouffee.What I like about this place?  "It is bigger on the inside".  The waitresses remind me of Suicide Girls.  Perfect place to visit to satisfy your spicy food craving. In case there is a wait for the use of the restrooms or you have a tendency to stare at the waitresses, you have portraits of the lovely Hot N Juicy Girls to check out.  Or you can just pretend there is a line for the lavatory.What I don't like or care for:  Shrimp are not de-veined.  The parking here can be a pain, as it can be rather scarce during peak hours.  Not to mention some less than proficient drivers to deal with.Overall, I enjoyed my Hot N Juicy dining experience.  The food was pretty good, but dining here is more of a social activity for me. And if you have a problem with eating with your hands and getting messy, it is best to patronize a different establishment, otherwise enjoy!Ambiance:  4/5  Roomy, with fishing theme decor adorning the walls and pictures of the Hot N Juicy waitresses on the hallway wall leading to the restrooms.Cleanliness:  5/5  It is new, but I hope they keep it looking that way.Food:  4/5  Nothing extraordinary, but it is enjoyable and fun.Price: 3/5  About what you expect.  The main items are all priced at "Market or Seasonal Price", which for shrimp and crawfish are around the $10 mark.Location:  4/5  Definitely close enough to the Strip for the out-of-towners to take a cab here.Pretty solid 4 Yelp stars.*Buy 1 pound of crawfish get the 2nd pound free, all day until it is sold out.I am a hot & juicy fan.. Even before it was on the travel channel and became so widely popular. I have preached the wonders of shrimp and crawfish to all my friends and will even choose H&J over The BoilingCrab. I have had many wonderful dinners at the original location and the servers are always so attentive. So why the low rating for this new location you ask? Its not the food that lacks at this location, it's the service. We tried out this place on a Thursday night around 9:00.. It wasn't too busy so when we arrived the hostess sat us right after she cleared up a booth. After a while a not so enthusiastic nor friendly server took our drink order. Then when she came back we ordered 2 lbs of shrimp + potatoes, rice, rolls and sweet potato fries. Slowly our order started to arrive one by one delivered by a food runner.. Soon we received everything except the sweet potato fries. Over half way through our dinner still no fries.. And no sign of our server.. So we have to flag someone down & ask and we find out that they ran out of SP fries a while a go and our server was supposed to tell us.. Then we are told not to worry it will immediately be taken off our check..At this point our server has yet to once check up on us.. I spot her bottle blonde pig tails numerous times chit chatting with her co workers and horsing around.. Then we have to flag someone down again to place a Togo order but then we're told the kitchen is closed...  Finally our server shows up only to plop acheckbook down on the table.. Peeved, we want to leave so we give her our card., when it comes back we realize they didn't take off the fries after all.. So we go to the front and the girl apologizes and says she needs to swipe the card again but we should be rest assured it will only be charged once because they settle all the transactions at the end of the night. So there goes another 5 minutes of waiting around due to bad service all the while food is still being brought out to tables.. "kitchen closed" my a$$.. ..The next day sure enough the card got charged twice from hot and juicy. Now I'm sorry, I honestly don't mean to be rude and I am a pretty patient person but seriously how hard is it to be a server at a restaurant that only has plastic silverware, paper towels and serves their food from a plastic bag.. ? Had the server just done her job adequately my experience would have been great.Went for a 2lb. lunch yesterday just to 'check in' on the classic. I went in with an open mind, but my suspicions were right:The most inconsistently-sized shrimp and crawfish of it's kind in Vegas. If you order a bag of shrimp here you WILL get some tiny runts, and over half of my shrimp's heads had fallen off by themselves in the bag, a telltale sign of non-freshness. And, this place serves up consistently stingy portions - I'm convinced that they weigh the sauce when they weigh your 1lb. bag of food. The sauce is not as good as I remember, and though I have fond memories of this chain from years past, I feel like Hot N Juicy has become the Pho Kim Long / Lotus Of Siam of seafood-in-a-bag joints. Popular because of public relations, not because the food is great. Hot N Juicy's food is no longer made with love. You get a sense that the bottom line is king here. More profits = more PR budget = more TV exposure = more first-time customers = more profits. Sad. One day Robin Leach will be Hot N Juicy's only customer, and he'll expect to eat for free, because that's how he rolls.So, where to go for cajun seafood-in-a-bag?Cravin' Cajun is SO much more consistent, the crawfish are huge and the shrimp are ALL 10-15 count (and you get 16-20 in a 1lb. bag!). All of your shrimp heads will be intact, and the sauce at Cravin' Cajun is straight-up tastier. Please, if you only have time for one of these joints, try Cravin' Cajun. If you have time for two, try Hot N Juicy so you can make your own judgement. If you can't already tell, I am passionate about this subject.Well one of my friends insisted on coming here. So this place isn't flashy or apart of the strip, it's in I guess the Chinatown section of Vegas.  It was pretty busy for a Friday at 3pm. There was a 30 minute wait so we went next door and all got 30 minute massages lol(awesome). So we come back and get seated at our table.  Waitress was super sweet and attentive Took our order,  put on those garbage bag bibs lol, and gloves.Food came out and man it was hott, like spicy hot.  Which is great but i had a runny nose after the first 2 bites but I didn't mind lol just caught me off guard.All the food was just below great. The cajun fries were way to oily for my liking. The cajun calamari was good, but portion was small, the softshell crab was surprisingly good even thou I am not a fan of crab.Overall I'd enjoyed the experience with cause of my great friends, great service,  good food, and a break from the strip.I think the most fascinating part of this experience was looking around at how everyone sat there with tables packed with food and then nothing was left. So it's definitely an experience I'd recommedyummmmmmmmmm always a hit never a miss.. well so far.. they def are the best ive ever had.. the hollywood spot just isnt the same.. this place..fresh or frozen.. the sauce is just amazing.. i need to remember that i should get the hot instead of medium.. the hot is already super spicy but the medium is not .. they need something inbetween.. the fries were amazing.. so were the oysters.. we were seated right away.. so glad that there's no wait..

Review Text :
Big statement coming at ya. You ready for this Madison? Baldwin Street Grille has the best... THE BEST food I've ever eaten at a hole in the wall type townie feeling pub. And I'm not talking about just Madison! Are they going to be Michelin rated? No. But what they're doing works. It's just solid, and for me that gets 5 stars. I ate. And ate. And ATE, so I feel safe saying something so strong having had their hand breaded deep fried mushrooms, Carolina Burger with sweet potato fries, mixed greens salad and hot wings. I don't know why I was so ravenous, but I'm glad Robin knows a thing or two about cooking because everything rocked, and it's amazing that he by himself is able to turn things out so quick. Ryan behind the bar is always up for some convo and will want to know your name. Don't be scurrr'd. Shake the guy's hand and get chatting. Although your "bar burger" is going to be on a real plate, like a ceramic one, these two gents are anything but fancy. The place is super chill, has enough TVs so everyone will be happy watching whatever it is that gets them going, and the equivalent of an ipod looking juke on the wall plays decent tunes on the cheap. I had it in mind to grab a beer and maybe some fries but drank 3 and ate a third of the menu. It's just a cool place to be and I hear their fish fry on Friday is bomb!Another fish fry update, from 9/26/14.This could be one of the best fish frys in Madison proper. Service is consistently slow, absent, and absent-minded, but if it's a quality fish fry you're after, look no further.+ Group of 7 met for fish on Friday, 9/26/14 at around 8:15pm- Not much by way of accommodating groups; the pool table takes up a ton of room- A/C was *insane* - we all wore our coats, begged the bartenders to turn off the A/C, and continued to freeze- Loud. Very, very loud.- Slow service; two bartenders serve as libations-makers, servers, bussers, cashiers, and everything in-between. This makes for many forgotten items and really slow service in between visits.+ Appetizers. Yum. The curds appear to now be homemade, and they were solid. The sweet potato fries are always outstanding, and the tater tots can't be beat. The wide variety of optional dipping sauces compliment everything nicely.+ The cod. Don't make the mistake that I've made in past visits by choosing the perch. Perch is fine and dandy, but the cod here is the star. We visited with my Alaskan fisherman friend (who supplies numerous Madison establishments with line-caught cod, walleye, halibut, and sablefish), and he was floored, as were the rest of us. BSG uses cod loin, which is a thicker, meatier, more tender cut of fish. It's delicate, yet can hold its own while in the fryer. The batter was perfectly applied, nicely flavored, and expertly fried. We all inhaled our fish in record time.So... bring a coat (even in the summer), prepare to be crammed-in to place, don't expect super awesome service (they forgot several of our beers as well as my fish, and I had to stand at the bar for a bit to get things corrected), but prepare to be wowed by the fish fry.Note: all options are fried - no baked fish is available.This place looks pretty unassuming from outside. I went there on a Friday night. Had trouble finding the door, was worried it wasn't even open. Started to be concerned that I invited my friends out for dinner to a place that wasn't open and that I would find them outside, grumpy in the neg. degree weather. But I shouldn't have fretted! Finally found the door and walked into a happening, inviting place.It was Friday, so I had to go with the fish fry. They had both cod and perch available. The perch is sort of a flaky crust on the outside but the cod has a beer battered crust . So if you are looking for a that crunchy layer of goodness surrounding your fish. Go with the cod!! it was delicious. They use the loin which is a nice piece of meat.They have drink specials and specials every night of the week in terms of food. 50 cent wings on Mondays! I'm definitely going to be coming back. Such great food at such a chill place. Definitely a great place to come to if you are a sports fan they have a TV for practically every customer in the place. The service that night was great I thought even though some other reviewers said it was a hit or miss. I thought with it being pretty crowded we were waited on in a timely fashion.

An off day.The West Valley has had its share of  Mexican restaurants.  However, I get tired off the typical version of Mexican food drowned in sauce,  rice, and heavy beans. Today, I decided to give Raul and Theresa's a try. The dishes at Raul and Theresa's looked really good. That's why I feel bad saying that my meal today just wasn't very good. Today, I had the chorizo, eggs, beans, and tortilla breakfast. The chorizo was somewhat over cooked and just wasn't very flavorful, as were the beans.  I was disappointed with my meal. It wasn't the worst meal nor the best. Maybe it was an off day.

Review Text :
We came here after the ASU football game. Tired and hungry, we were looking for a place to eat but all the restaurants in the Scottsdale Quarter had a waiting line except Stingray. I dropped my family off and parked. Walking around Stingray, I couldn't find the entrance. My son had to do a search and rescue and open the front door for me. The front door looks like a wooden wall. Very deceptive. The inside was very modern looking and spacious. I had a really hard time with the menu cause I couldn't really decide. We always get sushi but nothing else seemed intriguing. So we started off with the rainbow roll and the dragon roll. I would have to say outstanding sushi. Very fresh just like it should be. Really good. For dinner, I just ordered the Vegetable Udon   It had yellow opinions, green onions, carrots, and mushrooms with of course udon noodles in a really dark soup. It was okay but salty. Nothing special about it. My wife, daughter, and mom all ordered the seafood udon. It was basically the same as my vegetable udon except it had seafood and tempura shrimp. Seafood was okay. Not great. So my wife wasn't too impressed. My son had the teriyaki chicken on a bed of vegetables. He liked the chicken and was satisfied. So overall, the food was okay. The sushi was very good. Another issue was their service. Our waitress came right away and brought us our drinks. We told her we weren't ready to order. The problem was trying to get her back. It took forever to track her down again. Poor service. Then after we ordered, the food took forever to get to our table. They had three sushi chefs and would assume our sushi would come out fast but it didn't.  Poor service. So I would have to say that their dinner menu (besides the sushi) is lacking. They should open up the menu and allow the bento boxes to be ordered during dinner. So great sushi, okay dinner, weak dinner menu, and down right poor service. No wonder this place is the only place not as busy in the Scottsdale Quarter in a Saturday night. Will we be back? I can say hands down probably not.

"Oh.My.God" -says I"what?!" -replies friend"What in God's name is a Brulee burger!?!"I quickly grabbed a paper menu off of the clean counter near the cash register and flipped open to the burgers.  I know what brulee means, burnt sugar, but how could this relate to a burger.  In my wildest sugary dreams I could have never dreamt of this.  A burger, delicious and meaty, on a very nice toasty bun, with Havarti cheese, Havarti people(!), bacon, porky crispy salty bacon, a fried egg, runny and delicious, and yes, BURNT SUGAR!"Two please...wait, no no, one, two would be silly.....(but if my friend wasn't here to witness this I would probably get 7)  and sweet potato tots please"What saint, what angel, what GOD could create this masterpiece?  What twisted sugary mind could come up with this concoction?  If ever I meet the mad scientist who put together this beautiful monster I am liable to leave my husband and marry them.  And their shakes looked really good too, I'll get one next time.Family Owned and Operated hole in the wall restaurant that makes Tasty Burgers, Sandwiches, Tacos, and Taco Salads. Inside is clean and tidy with cool pictures of some of his specialties on the wall. Service is Friendly and Fast. They were in Phoenix Magazine back in July 2012 for Cheap Eats for $12 or less.Specialty Burgers include: Country fried burger smothered in gravy topped with crispy onions. The Beach House burger with roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella and pico de gallo. The Burger Brulee with a fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar and havarti cheese. The Burger Parmesana with marinara, mozzarella, parmesan and basil. They also have your basic versions as well as a Grilled Portabella. You can substitute chicken breast on any burger if you like.Sandwiches include: Grilled cheese, Breakfast club, B.L.T, Sloppy joe, Pulled Pork, Chicken club, Pulled vegetarian, and a Shrimp club on a choice of white, 9 grain, or a brioche bun.Today I went with the Paradise Bacon CHZ with an extra patty and a side of seasoned fries. It was very good. The wife had the Chicken Club on 9 grain with a side of sweet potato tater tots which I got to help finish.Definitely going back to try some of the other menu choices like the tacos, some carnival corn grilled on the cob and maybe some DEEP FRIED Ice Cream with honey, strawberry and whipped cream.Keep it Local when you can. ENJOY!Even though I've been eating burgers like it's my job lately, I stopped in Paradise Valley Burger Co. for lunch after a recommendation from a client. I was in their neck of the woods, so I took their word. Well, forget the diet! I'd eat a burger every day if I'd known about this place!A delicious, buttery burger bun, a juicy, seasoned burger with Havarti cheese and lots of ketchup! MMMMMmmmmm. It was so amazing. I also had a side of sweet potato tots, which quickly disappeared into my belly! I've heard ALL of their burgers are amazing, so I'll have to pay them another visit very soon! Also if you are nearby, check out the local scuba shop, Academy of Scuba!I love businesses that don't mind a little hand-to-hand combat.  In the case of Paradise Valley Burger Company, there is a Burger King a stones throw away in the same parking lot, a pizza place a few doors down, and a Jack in the Box across the street.  You better be good if your competition is that close.They are.The Princess and I had to check this place out after it was highlighted on the review of the day last Friday, 3/7/14.  Easy to find, just off the 51 at Bell.  Kind of  a non-descript strip mall.  Nice vibe, lots of foot traffic and yet enough room to grab a table and not be elbow to elbow with your neighbor.We both had the Beach House burger, two patties, smoked mozzella, and pico on an incredible homemade bun.  Loved the burger, very, very good.  You could taste the grill marks on the meat.  Complimented the meal with the sweet potato tots.  These were fantastic!  Some of the best I've had in the valley! (a little pricey but worth it!).  Also had a maple-bacon milkshake.  Wow!  Absolutely incredible.  Real bacon and maple with tasty ice cream, it was delicious!  Can't wait to go back and try other burgers and some of their tacos.  Service was fantastic, very quick and friendly.  Great prices and excellent food!The creativity of this ambitious menu helps PV Burger stand out in the difficult terrain between the fast food and gourmet burger price point. A slight upgrade in their ingredients and this place will quickly outgrow the strip mall in which it resides and move to the upper echelon of the Phoenix burger scene.Ok, that was delicious :) If this was any closer I'd be in serious trouble. Out with Jennifer O. (who hit the 1000 review mark today!) a group of us visited Paradise Valley Burger Co. The burgers are creative, delicious and ridiculously affordable. The Burger Brulee is served with a perfectly cooked over easy egg, bacon (who doesn't love bacon?), onion, burnt sugar and havarti cheese. The sides and shakes are great comfort food. It may sound strange, but, french toast fries are divine. It's actually what you're (perhaps secretly) hoping will be served. Fried egg bread with a side of maple syrup. (I had one! JUST one fry.) The grilled corn on the cob is lightly buttered and a surprising addition to enjoy with a burger.And in other strange (yet satisfying) fare are the shakes. Bacon and maple syrup? Yup. Hot damn that's good. (Made with legit chunks of bacon.)The setup is simple. You order at the register, pay and food is delivered to your table. The space is medium sized, sprinkled largely with 2-top round tables, which can easily be pulled together. A casual place to eat.Alas, no booze. They do have fun stuff like YelloMello and Fanta tho! The menu is kid friendly with options for the little ones.Don't drive too fast or you might pass it by. (If I hadn't been looking for the place I wouldn't have noticed it. It's to the left of a liquor store. A *drive thru* liquor store.) Pricing in PV Burger is slightly higher than their online menu. (My Brulee burger was $8, it is listed as $7 online.)Definitely a place worth checking out!Average of 4.5 stars?  Eh.....I unfortunately disagree.  This is like barely 2 stars.In honor of National Cheeseburger Day, I decided to go and get one.  I had this place bookmarked and it was close enough to work that I decided to have my cheeseburger here.  I should have gone somewhere else :-(.  It wasn't horrible,  but it was far from great.I rolled in the joint and placed my order for a Paradise Valley Cheeseburger with an extra patty, sweet potato tots and a Diet Coke.   After I placed my order, the cashier dude started talking baseball with me (I wear my St. Louis Cardinal hat all the time) and started asking how the Cardinals were doing etc.  That was cool and the best part about the visit.   I paid the man my money, $11.60 something and then took a seat.I noticed that the place was a little bit dirty.  The trash was overflowing, flies were on the windows and a lot of tables were dirty.  I hoped for the best............. A few minutes later, my food came out.  Here is how it was....................Double Cheeseburger-  Um....it was just alright.  It was presented nicely with a toasted bun and some fancy toppings, but it lacked "goodness".  This thing came with 2 small burgers, cheddar cheese, thousand island and then it was topped with veggies.  Not sure if they are trying to be fancy, but the veggies didn't really work.  They had a tomato, pickled onions which were tasteless and 3 cucumbers....not pickles...didnt taste any vinegar.  I tasted cucumber.  The burgers didn't have much flavor, the cheese was ok, the thousand island was runny.  The bun was alright.  I was not impressed.  I ate the whole thing but did not really enjoy it at all.Sweet Potato Tots-  Meh...frozen, not really crispy, no flavor, semi small portion.  I used the ketchup on the table and it was runny too (just like the thousand island).  I only ate a few of them and tossed 75%.  Meh.Diet Coke-  Even this tasted a little off.  Not enough carbonation or something.Overall I was sadly not impressed at all!  $12.00 for my meal, the burger was kind of small and tasteless and the tots were just plain boring.  The only good thing about the meal was my chat about baseball.  That is kind of sad.  I will not be coming back.I seldom dream about burgers but when I do, the Brûlée Burger is definitely one that comes to mind. Combining savory and sweet is often a daunting task because the result ends up with one of the two extremes dominating. It reminds me of those days I lay victim to endless handfuls of kettle corn popped fresh at a stand and the sweet smell paraded through the air like some jerk, "Buy me! Eat me!" The taste was and is still both salty and sweet and satisfying.      Well hello again friend. Except this time, you are disguised as an incredible rich tasting burger. Thank goodness I took pictures of you dear Brûlée Burger because I ate you all too quickly. Fried egg, bacon, onion, burned sugar, and havarti.. Ugh! Your buddies, the sweet potato tots, did their fare share of damage as well, since they too quickly disappeared in my tummy along with the chipotle ketchup!     My hubby ate a special called New Year's Burger, which was crazy spicy but delicious as well. How could you go wrong with a deep fried bun? The caramelized onions, peppers, and cheese were an unlikely but welcome trio with the burger hugged by deep fried goodness.      Don't expect a fancy pants trendy burger joint here. The food speaks for itself and will leave you smiling and very happy!What to add when Yelpers have already faithfully posted 500 reviews? I scanned through the mass of comments about Paradise Valley Burger Company and I have a half dozen observations to share. First, the counter staff is amazingly helpful and friendly, ready to explain their offerings at the slightest hint of uncertainty. You should have no fear about coming here for the first time. Second, the burgers are just the right size. Two beef patties, but not a massive weight gainer. Not a walk away hungry burger either. Just right. Third, all those reviewers who rave about the Brulee burger, the burgers of the week, the French toast fries, the sweet potato tots... Everything they say is true. Fourth, the pricing is not what you'd call cheap, but it's very reasonable, with a basic PV Burger coming in at $5.25 and more elaborate choices listed at $7 or $8. No sides are included, but I'd rather order just what I want and share anyway. Fifth, it is a small neighborhood restaurant that just happens to be  a foodie paradise. You would never find it without Yelp's help. The dining room is small, although not quite as tiny as the storefront would indicate. Simple, clean and comfy. Perfect.Sixth, kids are welcome. Space is sometimes in short supply, but there is still plenty of room for the kids. A $5 kids menu features, among other things, small versions of basic burgers (one patty instead of two) complete with a side of fries. Oddly, the menu says these meals are only for kids age seven and under?!? I assume they don't enforce that age limit.My suggestion would be that you drop your anti-DDD bias and reward yourself by giving the Paradise Valley Burger Company a try.I saw this place on the Food Network and since my wife and I were nearby, heck yeah we were going to stop in. This place is no frills, simple menu. Burgers and a handful of other options. They are known for the Brulee Burger. The concept is interesting. The place was filthy though. Staff was nice and patient. Burgers were overhyped but a fun stop. Less than desirable area.

This is a difficult review to write.  My family started eating here when they first opened. We were a once a week customer. Very happy with the food and service, pizza is delicious. Then one evening, we placed our order asking for the special we always get, a 2 pizza deal.When we received our order, they placed 2 medium pizzas on our table. I immediately asked about the pizza size as we had always received 2 large pizzas as advertised.  It turns out they have 2 specials, a 2 medium pizza deal and a 2 large pizza deal.The employee never asked which deal and the fact that we were there with 5 people should have prompted them to ask me to specify which deal.I spoke to the owner of this location he agreed to make us another medium pizza to make up the size difference to which I agreed to.Nearly 10 minutes later, the owner came to our table and told us that if he made us another pizza, he was going to have to charge us for it.I refused and now nearly 2 years later, we have chosen not to return to this establishment. My money is important to me and it should be as important to any business, especially a small local business...I now choose a place slightly further away, but one that appreciates its customers.Pizza - deliciousCustomer appreciation - needs improvementHope some changes have been made over the last couple of yearsSadly, I have to give a 2-star review to 5-star tasting pizza because the owner is rude and has no customer service skills at all! I am so angry that a place that serves such delicious pizza is run by a man with a nasty attitude that does not know how to appreciate his customers. A word to the wise for the owner: Have your wife or son take care of the front of house and please stay in the back, away from customers. You are going to end up out of business and it will be your own fault. The pizza is hands down the best pizza I have ever eaten but I would rather gag down some frozen pizza than to be treated like garbage by someone who is making money off of me. Without us (your customers) you do not have a business! Remember that and adjust your attitude accordingly or you will be out of business and flipping burgers in short order!

Restaurant name  Tsom Vegetarian Flavors

Review Text :
I have to be honest; Tsom really reminded me of college cafeteria food. Based on that assessment, it seems they are in a good location being close to ASU, but as a non-college student, I was incredibly underwhelmed. While I think the idea of a salad bar is cool, especially when it is all veggie and filled with a variety of things like hummus and bean salads, the actual meals like pasta and falaffel are pretty uneventful.Sorry Tsom, I don't plan on coming back.I came in here on a Saturday around 2 pm and there was absolutely no one in the place.  I checked out the menu for a solid TEN MINUTES before a woman came out from the back.  She didn't say anything, just went to her register and stared at me.  Way to make a girl feel welcome.I ordered food to go-a veggie wrap and some spicy falafel sandwich with kale chips.  She retreats to the back of the store and I fought the temptation to eat all of the cupcakes in the platter on the counter to show my dissatisfaction.  But then I remembered that I am a "grown-up", so I decided to walk away.Twenty minutes later she hands me my food, no thank you or anything, but whatevs.  She tells me I can help myself to pickles and such on the bar.  When I open the falafel sandwich it is clear that it is the wrong thing.  When I ask her she just lies and says it is what I ordered.  I was too hungry and annoyed to argue so I said fine.  I walked over to the other food station because there was NO HUMMUS ON THE SANDWICH.  She said, oh we charge extra for hummus.  Lady, no one charges extra for hummus on a falafel.  My people didn't wander through the desert, schvitzing and kvetching so that they could pay extra for hummus.  Hummus and Falafel are like french fries and ketchup, like oreos and milk...they just go together.With all that said, if you are hungry enough that you don't care and you have your own personal supply of hummus, go there between 11-2 for their lunch special.  You get fries, a drink and a falafel sandwich for 7 $.  Just don't expect any hummus... :)

Review Text :
Update: Still no Butter Chicken in the lunch buffet :/However, I did find a new item that I enjoyed quite a bit - Methi Chicken. The sign says the dish contains spinach. If that's true, then it's not Methi Chicken. Maybe they just figure it's easier to write "spinach" than to explain what "methi" is. In any case, it was good.I've also discovered Kheer. It's an Indian rice pudding finished with nuts, raisins, and cardamom. For some reason, I've never had this dessert before, but it is absolutely delicious.Despite Butter Chicken still being MIA, I think a star upgrade is in order.As badly as I want to try new Indian restaurants in town, I always end up leaving utterly disappointed and regretting my decision for not just going to Mint (my never-fails-me staple).  Taj Palace was no exception.Things had started off well with a nice interior and friendly service.  But then everything started to go downhill from there with a total blowup to end our meal.-Food took much too long to come out.-Free papadums were nice, but the tamarind and mint chutneys tasted old.-The garlic naan had no traceable amounts of garlic, plus it was super crunchy and almost burnt.-$5 for a bowl of plain rice.-The aloo gobi (or gobi aloo as they call it) was completely flavorless (at an Indian restaurant??).  It was just boiled potatoes, cauliflower, and tomatoes sitting in some liquid.  Not edible.I will give credit where credit is due and say that the Paneer Tiki Masala was very good.  It was flavorful and had a generous portion of paneer.The kicker was at the end when we went to pay for our meal and we were told they wouldn't accept our coupon.  It would have been one thing if there was a sign posted on the door stating this or if we hadn't shown the servers the coupon until the end of our meal.  However, there is no sign saying they don't accept coupons AND we had the coupon out at the edge of the table from the minute we sat down.  FOUR servers never once said anything about it before we ordered, despite the fact that I saw all of them look at it.I'm tired of restaurants offering coupons and then deciding they don't feel like it anymore and won't make good on the ones that are still out there.  But to wait until after we are done eating to tell us, when you know that we have a coupon waiting, is shady to me.  It's times like these I wish my mom didn't raise me to be polite and just walk away from the situation.  The paneer was their saving grace that brought them up to two stars.I'd like to amend my review a little now that I've been back so many timesI've tried the lunch buffet twice in two days. I'm officially hooked!The service is pretty attentive. Vimil (Vick) is very friendly. He makes an extra effort to remember his customers and takes pride in his job. He's remembered my name ever since I paid with a credit card. Him and other staff always keep my water glass quite full, a definite necessity in an Indian restaurant. We got there by about 2pm and the lunch buffet closes at 3pm. At exactly 3:06pm the server came over and informed us that they were closed and it was time for us to go. I thought this was a little abrupt, but we were mostly finished, so we left.I really like the varied options depending on the day. The Samosa's were really good, filled with spicy potato. These were a little spicy, but very tasty. I poured a little bit of mint chutney over the top and it was perfect. I actually wished they would have had them the second day. I also really liked the Chicken Tikka Masala, because I love the red sauce that it comes in, perfect for dipping Naan. There was also a white cream based chicken dish that was really tender. On my first visit I didn't have room to try the Tandoori chicken on the bone. But on my 2nd visit there was Tandoori chicken pieces and they were pretty tender. I like my stuff super saucy, so I dipped my Tandoori chicken in the Raita (spiced yogurt) and it was delicious. Garlic naan is the way to go. I love me some garlic!! The naan has came out piping hot... super fresh on every visit. Also on my first trip I brought my vegan friend and she had a lot of options to choose from and was very happy with the selections. I would definitely recommend telling the server if you are vegan because one of the labels above the food was inaccurate. For my second visit I brought two Indian food experts, they both agreed that it was a pretty good buffet, especially for the price. They seemed to enjoy the food, but one of them felt that the dishes could have used a little more spices. Both of them agreed they would rather have the dishes spicier, but realize that with a buffet it's usually going to be mild to medium.  I would definitely like to come back during dinner and try some of the menu items. Although I think I'll have a hard time staying away from this buffet. I love having tons of options and you can't beat the price... about $11 per person.HENDERTUCKY'S INDIAN RESTAURANTNot a food cart or truck behind a grocery store or a converted gasoline station, it's a real dedicated Indian restaurant with real Indian decor. I understand it been under new ownership for two years plus. It's our first visit under the present ownership.We came for the lunch buffet around 2 pm this Friday. There were still a few occupied tables and the buffet carts were filled with food. Of course I ordered their garlic naan plus a Kashmiri naan. (it was most disappointing).Yu-go chauffeur always eats the veggies first and saves the meats for the second plate. He loved the spiciness of the veggies but he thought the meats were a little underseasoned... but not  a problem, he dunks everything in their green, white and red sauces anyway.It's a charming place to relax and enjoy which we certainly can attest to.After a hike yesterday, we stopped here for their lunch buffet.  It was almost empty when we arrived but we must have been a draw because business picked up while we were there.They brought us ice water and we ordered garlic naan.  In fact, we ordered a second basket of garlic naan before we even started with the first.  It was quite good.The first part of the buffet had all vegetarian dishes.  Some of the standouts here were the  pakoras, large triangles filled with a spicy mix of vegetables, and the saag.  The saag had excellent flavorings and was very tasty.  I also tried some of the lentils and they were also good.In the second section, I had some goat curry, chicken tikka masala, and tandoori chicken.  The chicken tikka masala was standard as was the goat curry.  The tandoori chicken was a bit dry.A couple of things I noted that were different.  There is no silverware on the table.  You pick up utensils at the buffet when you're there or you go back and get if you forget.  I was expecting some kind of MTV India music playing or video,  but they had their TV off which was quite OK.  But instead, we had pop music which just didn't seem to fit the place.The room is pleasant, service was OK, and the lunch buffet was good.  There are a few standout items as mentioned.  I didn't have dessert, not even kheer, which almost unheard of for me.  The naan filled me up quite nicely along with two plates of food.My first time trying Indian food! What a great place to try something for the first time!When walking into an Indian restaurant for the first time, the smell of the spices and herbs they use hits you pretty hard. It was very surprising. It grows on you though.With my lack of knowledge with Indian food, I just let Nieves D. & Carl I. Take the wheel and order the food.For starters they bring out their version of Chips & salsa. it's a very thin seasoned chip that you can break.. and for the dips it includes a green spicy dip and a sweet tangy dip. Both quite Delish. Tikka Masala Saucy chicken- I can't even explain how delicious this was. The sauce had the right amount of spices to give a good kick. The chicken in it just melted in my mouth it was so good. Was not dry at all. Tandoori sizzling chicken- we got a whole chicken and it was more than enough for us. The most moist chicken I ever had! Again, the spices used give the chicken so much flavor. Spices that I have never tasted before. Chicken was cooked above perfection. Lamb spicy coconut curry- I'm not really a fan of lamb so I just took a bite and decided to stick with the chicken. But the sauce the lamb was swimming in was pretty damn good. If it had a different meat in it, I'd probably devour it. Garlic Naan- Their version of garlic bread. You can dip the bread in the sauces of the dishes you order and it pairs up quite well. You get this mango shake when you check in. The service was good, the food just took forever to com out. But it was defiantly worth the wait! They even brought out mango ice cream with a candle for my birthday! What a great birthday dinner!Great little Indian joint tucked away in one of the many plaza and business centers on Eastern. This one in particular you can find in the same plaza at BJs!I met up with some friends here for lunch on the weekend to take advantage of their AYCE buffet. We got there around 1pm on a Saturday and there was ample seating despite the restaurant itself being pretty tiny. But hey, not complaining! (I hate waiting, but who doesn't?)Anyway, it's good to note that the buffet is only available for lunch and dinner menu becomes ala carte style so if you want to indulge in the buffet like me, come during lunch hours which I believe are until 3pm. Onto the juicy stuff, the food! It's not a huge selection but it was pretty tasty. The first section by the plates are the vegetarian entrees and that includes samosas! I love samosas and these were great. I had to force myself not to grab more than one each time I went back for another round. I also enjoyed the coconut curry chicken and the tikka masala. I was a little bummed not to see any lamb dishes or butter chicken but you can't win them all. You also get naan for the table and we opted for garlic naan. Came out fresh and hot!And one of the most surprising parts of the meal was the check! The lunch buffet costs a whopping $11. I don't know about you, but that's a steal for me.Lots of parking throughout the plaza is available as well so nothing much else to report on that front.This is a good, decent, clean, strip mall Indian restaurant buffet experience.Recognizable foods on the buffet include sag paneer (high quality!), tandoori chicken, curries and chickens and such. Achaar (mixed pickle) is decent and passable. Beer is available (probably wine too). The place has a modest decor, very generic but good tables and linens. Although I  would like to complain about the size of the buffet, it is no smaller than most other Indian restaurants in Las Vegas.Always seems to be 4 or more people on staff at any given time, usually 5. That's a good sign: quality focus, managerial oversight, customer attention.This restaurant is off Eastern, in Hendo-tucky. There are fewer more heavily-trafficked thoroughfares than this stretch of Eastern, but this restaurant earns its 4 stars.This restaurant is not West-End London , or Silicon Valley California competitive, but for Las Vegas it's pretty good and they should be proud of their business. They have a right to be proud.Taj Palace was delicious. I haven't had Indian food in years, so maybe I'm biased. And hunger and good company can further sway me. I will also state right now that I'm not well versed with Indian cuisine, so I'll do my best to describe the food. Apologies in advance for the ignorance that will ensue. We came here for dinner and were starving after a long day, so we opted for the non-vegetarian meal for 2 ($50). It was definitely not a meal for 2. It was more like a meal for 5, despite both of us having very healthy appetites. We had leftovers for days.  While you try to figure out what to order, you get to munch on (I have no idea what it's called) crunchy "chips" with 2 different types of sauces. One of the sauces was really good. One was red/brown, the other green. Go for the red/brown.So the meal for 2: (There's so much it'll be a novel). appetizer - you get to choose between samosas or pakoras. We both have had samosas before so we decided to try something new. The pakoras are like little crunchy chicken nuggets shaped liked mini egg rolls on a bed of lettuce. Yea, I know that's an awful description, but it's really the best I can do. So now that I know what pakoras are, in the future, if I was given the option between that or a samosa, it'd really depend on my mood. If i wanted little snacks that you can haphazardly pop into your mouth, then I'd go with the pakoras. But if I wanted something more filling and like the size of an empanada or large cha siu bao, I'd go with the samosa.  soup/salad - we went with salad. The salad was nothing out of the ordinary, but it was very refreshing next to the fried appetizer. It was also well seasoned. entree - you get to choose ONE entree from the chicken or lamb section. This was confusing to us because we thought each person got to choose an entree. Nonetheless, we went with the mango chicken curry, which was spectacular. The only reason why I wouldn't get it again would be because I'd want to try other dishes. The flavors were so good, the chicken in large chunks, etc. I loved it. Another entree that comes with (you don't get to decide) is tandoori chicken. This is a classic dish that comes off as like bbq chicken seasoned with unique spices served on a skillet with grilled onions. There was so much food in front of us, I actually didn't try this one. I was still adjusting to the array of flavors before me. rice - the rice was so good. I wasn't expecting that. It had chicken, vegetables, and all sorts of spices. I don't think I've ever had Indian rice before. I loved it. garlic naan - The naan was not bad. This is probably the only thing I had that night that I've had before at other places. So because I have comparison, I can say this isn't the best naan I've ever had, but it was still good. I've had other naans that are more flavorful and garlicky (I'm pretty sure that's not a word). Those other naans are so good they can be a stand alone snack. The naan here was much more muted. But maybe that's just as well because if it were too strong, it might overpower the other dishes. dal of the day - Honestly, neither one of us knew what this was. We just nodded as if we knew when the waiter was talking to us. It was served in a bowl, and it went well with the naan is all I can say. It was a bit spicy. Edit: I just looked it up. Apparently dal is a dish of dried lentils, peas, or beans split and boiled. Its rich in protein and is a good source of nutrition for vegetarians. Learn something new every day. There was also a yogurt-like dipping sauce served, which was refreshing and cooling for the spicy flavors. It was a nice palette cleanser. dessert - I didn't choose it, so I have no clue what it was called. We each got a little goblet with what appeared to be 2 soggy donuts swimming in a pool of sweet liquid with coconut flakes. It was too much for me. I don't think I'd want this dessert again, but for those who like really sweet, they may like it. To give context, I find baklava too sweet but I know many people who like it. The decor of the place is very nice. I'm not sure if it was decorated more than usual though because it was Valentine's day; there was a lot of red in the restaurant. But like many eastern restaurants whose target population is often of western origin, there may be more trinkets and ornaments than what is normally found at such establishments. Yet it's pleasing to the eye and adds to the ambiance of the place. Plus, with a name like "Taj Palace," I'd expect something of the grandiose nature. So I'm not complaining, I liked it. The staff were also very friendly. Overall, I would come here again. Taj Palace has made me want to explore the world of Indian cuisine. With more knowledge, I won't have to name dishes "soggy donuts" and what not.I've only dined here for the lunch buffet a few times. It's a pretty good deal to sample several Indian dishes for $10.95. You get a choice of fresh, warm, traditional naan or garlic naan with the lunch buffet. A lot of the buffet items are vegetarian, some vegan, several types of curry - (vegetarian, chicken, goat), basmati rice, salad bar, and a few desserts.I usually stick to the dishes I'm familiar with - tandoori chicken, tikka masala, saag, basmati rice, samosa, etc. but I'm always willing to try new dishes. I tried some potato & cabbage side, rice with almonds and raisins, vegetable curry, chicken curry in a tomato based sauce, etc. This is probably my least descriptive Yelp review. Forgive me. I'm not too familiar with Indian food. I wanted to take pics of the descriptions at the buffet station but I didn't want to be that dorky Yelper who takes pics. Even though I didn't know some of the dishes I was eating, I enjoyed my buffet. I think some of the curries could have been spicier but they were still fine and tasty. The restaurant is well decorated & charming with the traditional Indian decor & vibrant colors. The service was very attentive & welcoming. I think 4 or 5 different servers helped me. One guy suggested I use two different sauces for my samosa when he saw that I just grabbed it without a sauce. It was a minty sauce and a tamarind glazed sauce?I was full off 2.5 plates, garlic naan, and kheer for dessert. I'll be back and hopefully I'll remember the names of the dishes I've had. If you happen to know what I had from my weak descriptions & food pics, please educate me. ;)

Restaurant name  Rice Paper
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I never would have thought a Vietnamese restaurant would put me in the holiday mood, but it did! I will get to my reasoning, but first let me say why I'm giving Rice Paper five stars. It's because they have an adorable restaurant with a perfect atmosphere, they have delicious food and they have friendly staff. Rice Paper is situated on a busy Phoenix road but once inside the adorable little historic house, it feels like you've been transformed into a home away from home. They restored a historic house and adapted it into a restaurant that can accommodate those looking for a meal or those looking for some cocktails alike. The atmosphere is very modern zen-like with each table places perfectly apart from each other, quaint light fixtures warming up the restaurant and a long bar with seating and plenty of drinks to choose from.Most importantly is the food. The food here is delicious. It's the perfect combination of filling yet light. We started with the spring rolls and here I must warn you that if you order one that has "spice" mentioned at all in the description, be warned that they do not go light on the Sriracha. The spring roll was delicious but so spicy, my mouth burned for a good 20 minutes following. I think I also made the mistake of drinking diet coke in attempt to ease the burning but it really only made it worse. The burn from Sriracha seems to only disappear if you power through it. Rice Paper is know for their Pho so it's a must to order it! I went with the chicken Pho and this is where I entered into the holiday spirit. The Pho is warm and filled with wintry spices that remind me of Christmas with each warm sip. If I closed my eyes I could have imagined looking outside to see a crisp snow-filled day (instead of busy 7th street on a 70 degree day). I actually ordered the vegetarian Pho and added chicken in order to get all the vegetables. It was the perfect meal. It was filling but felt light and didn't put me into an afternoon food coma. I can see Rice Paper being the perfect spot for a date night or lunchtime meeting. It's great to stop by for an appetizer and cocktails before heading out for the night, or making this your main stop for the night and staying for a meal.I'm going to try to sound as professional and as objective as possible.+ Luke Warm Broth: "Ohhhh hell naw!"+ Brown Sprouts and Wrinkly Basil Leaves: "You're kidding, right?!"+ Stale Rice Noodles: "Can my lunch get any worse?"+ Dried up Lime that had no more Juice: "Definitely ohh hell naw!!!"+ Wait time for the Pho: "Beyond ridiculous."Hi Owner, I hope you are reading this.  Pho at any V-nese is absolutely the numero uno dish that must have no flaws if you want a repeat customer as myself.  I'm sorry, but the dried up lime was just blatant! There's no excuse for not having fresh limes on hand! I've had my share of cutting up limes and I know how much juice I can extract.The standard for broth temperature should always be hotter than the sun! I should be able to finish my pho with some hot soup remaining.  Brown sprouts and wrinkly basil leaves?! Inexcusable.Considering the place was below half full, the time for Pho to come out should be fairly quick, not 30 minutes that felt like an eternity.Its a big time shame.  Your awesome decor can never make up for the quality of food I had last time here.  Its by far the most modern, trendiest V-nese joint I've stepped foot it in.  I respect your Crate and Barrel-like furnishings and high-end bar with TVs, but at the end of the day, it comes down to the food that I expected to shine if we are going to pay a leg and arm for.  $10 Pho? Enough said.I've never been a huge Vietnamese fan, but Rice Paper has shown me the light! This little joint is run by two sassy sisters who are a hoot to be around and make delicious food. The spring rolls here are amazing - I think its the best thing on their menu - and they are so cheap that you can order several of them, tapas style!  They are always made with fresh ingredients and are packed with flavor.I also love the vegetarian pho.  It may seem expensive but it is HUGE and comes with a number of ingredients - tofu, lime, mint, jalapenos, sprouts, onions.  Whenever I am in a soup mood I turn to that pho.If only they would have put the same amount of time and energy into training the servers, and working on the food itself, as they did on the styling of the restaurant, this place could have been great.  Value is way out of line. $4.50 for ONE below average spring roll. We tried three types and all had only one sliver of the ingredients listed.We were given only  one menu when we were seated, WTF?  Another table near by saw that we had not been helped after about 5-10 minutes and notified the manager who was working the bar, and he didn't do much at just send some kid over to us.Was not given a drink menu until I asked for one AFTER we ordered food. WTF?Summary: Super trendy/hip/stylish place with a least double overpriced food, inexperienced  wait staff, and  management who doesn't have a clue about customer service.It's rare that I have a date with my husband on a Monday afternoon/evening, but this past Memorial Day, we did just that.  After a quick visit to the Science Center (the Van Gogh alive exhibit is a must-see by the way), we were hungry so we headed over to Rice Paper.  Neither of us had ever been before, and we were pleased with our experience.It was a tad bit too hot to sit outside, although they do have a covered patio with misters.  We walked in and were seated and greeted promptly by Al, our server.  He's quite the character.  He made us laugh quite a bit in addition to being attentive and making some recommendations.  We enjoyed the stylish renovated house / hip colorful atmosphere as well.We ended up ordering a few things and sharing.  Highlights included the firecracker shrimp. a spider roll, a shrimp roll, and a zen salad.  Everything was light and tasted fresh.  We really enjoyed the dipping sauces that came with the spring rolls.  They've got such a huge selection of the spring rolls, that I can't wait to return to try some of the others.  They don't have a huge selection of Vietnamese entrees, but it appears that they will custom create a bit upon request.I highly recommend going for the "food happy hour."  It's from 3pm - 6:30pm and includes $6 appetizers & $1 off all spring rolls.  Such a deal!  We didn't take advantage of it, but the "drinks happy hour" is actually 11am - 6:30pm and specialty drinks are $6, house wine by the glass is $5, well drinks are $4, and draft beer is just $2.75.If only Rice Paper was a tad bit closer to home, I could see myself being a regular... Instead, I'll keep it high on my list of spots to return to when I find myself heading downtown!Where are the owners? When was the last time you have been in your restaurant? You are failing big time and here's why...This is the 5th time I have reluctantly been to your establishment due to my love of pho however it will be my last. First off when you arrive to the parking lot there is trash and broken down heaters piled up for all to see. This is your first impression to rice paper...trash. You walk in and there is a leaking ac unit in the entrance where water is standing which speaks to another issue I will mention shortly. You walk in and your not greeted you are ignored by an obviously  untrained wait staff who appear to have better shit to deal with then customers who pay their salaries. We sat at the bar while the bartender talked endlessly to her friends and texted. Looking around the dining room you see junk everywhere. You have things on shelves that have no purpose nor appear to have been used or cleaned in years. The place is just dirty. You have wait staff bussing to the bar right were we are sitting. Putting dirty dishes next to where I'm eating is gross and unprofessional. Also get rid of the televisions if your not going to have something worth looking at on. It would be cute if you had romantic movies playing or something of that regard. Infomercials or sports is not the way to go if you considering your self fine dining. Further if you are going to be this run down and not care then lower your prices so that we are paying for what we're getting. I have experienced bugs at your location twice. A small roach walked out on the counter once while I was eating. Absolutely disgusting. This place needs an overhaul. If your the owner I challenge you to eat at your restaurant and consider this feedback. Clean it up and start caring about the customer experience. There is no sense of urgency to the customer experiance. I asked for my pho to be hot, super hot as it is always Luke warm. Sure enough it came out Luke warm which makes me think that you guys just have soup stock sitting to which you add ingredients into. Take the message not the tone. Clean it up. Train your staff.

Is this place actually supposed to be . .  . you know. . . . a business?We showed up at about 7 on a Tuesday, putting us in the no-mans land between happy hours. That part didn't matter much to me, but as we seated ourselves I wondered if we might be catching them in a dead spot. Maybe that explains the rest of the review. I'm not anxious to try again. At any time.We chose to sit in the bar area where more of the tables were full than in the restaurant area. We were just there for a couple drinks and some apps.  The waitress shows up and my friend asks what they have on tap. The waitress recites a voluminous list from memory, blandly. However, neither of us could hear her well enough over the Brian Adams or some other droning shit they had playing too loudly in the background. My friend asks to see a printed beer list. The waitress--a bit perplexed--explains that they don't have printed beer lists. My friend settles for water and starts searching "Zipps Phoenix Beers" on her iPhone. On the other hand,  I--determined to get my drink on--order up a vodka tonic and throw in an order of some wings.We wait.I get my drink. The tonic water is flat as a stretch of Nebraska Interstate. Waitress comes back around. I tell her that it's not working for me and since I suspect that their tonic has gone flat, I order a vodka Diet Coke instead. She apologizes and takes the drink away. A few minutes later she's back with the Diet Coke and vodka. Which is also flat. And apparently made with "vodka" made from straining Sterno through gym socks. Waitress is now off in the distance carting around dishes. I try to wave her down. No response. I take it to the bar. Bartender not paying attention. I look back to our table. The waitress is back, but empty-handed. My friend is now searching various blog entries from 2007 looking for hints of which beers they offer besides . . . y'know . . . fuckin' Bud Light, which might be all they usually sell.I decide to have a beer instead, taking the time to walk back to the bar to look at the taps. I order an IPA.  My friend says "oh, that sounds  . . . ok . . . ". Ok then: Two. Make it two IPA's. The waitress slowly walks off, carting with her the last abortive attempt at a cocktail and our inspired beer order.We wait. I look over at the kitchen and was reminded of an order for some wings placed way back . . . oh. . . .a couple of screwed-up drink orders before. Seems like sometime back during the days of Weimar Republic by this point.  I notice that although the bar area is well-occupied, the restaurant area is basically empty. I don't see any orders up on the kitchen window. Servers and the cooks are standing around talking. I look at my friend across the table. We look at the bar, and back at the kitchen. No beers. No wings. The taste of two lousy drinks still on my tongue. A gradually-accumulating wave of bitter resentment rising within me.We got up and left. The Garage was right across the street and was everything that Zipps wasn't this night.In a word: A business.

After spending two hours looking at (and listening to) some wonderful instruments, Violeta and I decided to meet up at the cafe.The place was hoppin'!  It was 1pm, and there were actually two sections in this room.  While they had the same furniture, one area felt like a coffee shop, with the rounded counter adorned with cookies and deli cases filled with bottles of water and juices, and I don't know what else, since we decided to sit in the other section, which had a more "open" feel to it.  Large glass windows that allowed nature to envelope you, at least a little bit, and, I would have to say, it felt like a bustling bistro.  A bustling tree-hugging green bistro (and I type this in a loving, respectful way).  Wished there was more than just one busser, though.  If there were more, it certainly looked like there was only the one.  Waited for awhile for tables to be cleared.  Finally, I had to walk up to him to ask if he'd clean up ours.  If I hadn't felt rushed to sit and relax while waiting for the food to arrive before leaving for school, I wouldn't have minded the wait so much.  I liked the organic, high-end feel to the place, and the busyness of the line cooks, who looked more like they should be cooking at a fancy steakhouse, and the presentations of the menus and food make you feel like you're really paying for quality here.  The menus allude to the usage of local produce and the occasional organic item, but I'd like to see higher-quality oils being used-- say no to GM soybean, canola, cottonseed, and corn oils!  I enjoyed my 6 oz. grass-fed burger and perfectly-crisped and seasoned sweet potato fries.  Next time, I'm going to have to check out the desserts.  Some looked absolutely devilish!p.s.  Didn't like having to retrieve my own cutlery or napkins.  The atmosphere calls for cutlery enfolded in cloth, and on the table, not sitting in metal holders, like you're at a buffet or at the cafeteria at work.  The paper napkins were of high-quality super-absorbent material, though, I must say.Ever since MIM opened in 2010, I come to their cafeteria for lunch a few times a year. I am always pleased with lunch I get from here.  Limited menu. Local, Global or some sandwiches.  I always get "local". Menu changes not sure how often and I won't know what is served until I get there.Local menu is made from ingredients they source within 150 miles of MIM. All fresh and some organic. I like the food when I can actually taste the ingredients.Today's local dish was chicken salad.  Chicken was so juicy and tender, chicken and blue cheese was a perfect combination, Brussels Sprouts was cooked to perfection, salad was fresh, beets tasted like beets should taste.  I also had a side of tomato soup today.  Again, I really like the food when I can actually taste the ingredients and the soup was no exception.  While the salad looks small on the picture, they are actually large.  Some beans on the salad, I became full before I finished a half of the salad.It's cafeteria style but serves very fresh food.  Cost more than average cafeteria.  You have to carry your own tray to the table.  Staff here is always friendly and efficient.  Did I mention I really like the food when I can actually taste the ingredients?

Review Text :
I was on a quest...BBQ and smoked goodness that could meet or beat the standard set by my favorite BBQ place, Rudy's, which is a Texas based chain with locations in Albuquerque. I rarely give 5 stars on first visit and this was pretty darn close...by PHX standards this is easily 5 stars!Fate delivered an article in a local food Blog, It was touted as being like Rudy's as a result I took that as a challenge. Via Yelp I bookmarked it to try.  The locations is clean and casual. Just enough booths and tables and a small outside patio. The employees and the owner/manager were very friendly and helpful. He gave me a sample of their brisket. While not as smoked as I like was super tender and delicious. I decided on their Yelp Check In special (which is also a regular daily special) of 1/3# Brisket, side, bread and drink for $7.99. Here you buy the items a la carte and the meat by the pound. Like Rudy's there are no plates as they serve and you eat on Butcher paper. For my side I choose Creamed Corn...he gave me a sample first and dare I say this was better than Rudy's.  What I love that other places lack is the little bar with sliced onions, dill pickle slices and pickled whole jalapeños. The bread offered is your simple sliced loaf bread, his is traditional and typical of Texas style BBQ joints. You put a little meat onions, pickle and sauce o keep a slice of bread fold in half/eat taco style and enjoy.The sauce is a hint sweeter than I like, but the smoked flavor was what I enjoyed most. I didn't see smoked baked potatoes on the menu, nor did I see the cobblers that Rudy's carries but that may come later. They do have have pecan pie, banana pudding to satisfy your sweet tooth. I already am planning my next trip so I can try more items on the menu.  They also have a nice small selection of bottled beer. What's BBQ without beer or fresh brewed sweet tea which they have as well.I was too full to dig into my homemade banana pudding. Rudy's...you've found your match and I have found my go to BBQ in the valley.[It's CASH ONLY. They do have an ATM on site.]Sweet baby Jesus. All of my prayers have been answered. I left the Great State of Texas three years ago and have been disappointed by so many bbq restaurants throughout the state of Arizona. I was saddened by the "best bbq" in Tucson and decided that, until I lived in Texas again, I would just live a meaningless bbq free existence. As I moped through another day in the hottest place on the planet, my very thoughtful partner suggested that we try the best bbq in Phoenix, according to the Phoenix New Times. I resisted. I said I was tired, I made up lame excuses, I feigned heat sickness. When I had no more excuses I finally relented and joined him in what would be the most delicious dinner I have had in three f*in years. Highlights of the meal:Brisket- Tender, delicious, excellent rub and crustRibs- Fall of the bone meat with great flavorSauce- Just enough tang and sweet. Balanced like a god damned ballerinaColeslaw- Sweet, sour, crunchy, yummyPotato salad-  Oh how I love theeI will be back again. I will blog about them. I will tell my friends. You will not be disappointed. If you don't believe me, go anyway. They offer free samples. If you don't cream your jeans, you can just walk out the door.Granted it was my first visit but I don't get down that way often, but i was underwhelmed. The building looked good from outside but it sort of went down hill after that. The deli style, by the lb, served in cartons, butcher paper, cash only, one sauce thing was overload...negativly. I ordered the "cutters choice" brisket, side and drink for 7.99.  I was given a 3.5 cuts of dry brisket on was paper, a small side of beans in a styo cup with a lid, a plate which is another section of wax paper all folded, two slices of WALMART white bread, on wax paper served in a huge 2 liter pepsi container used to carry 10 or more bottle at a time with more wax paper under it all. The drink was a styro cup, with an individually wrapped straw, individually wrapped fork, knife and spoon and more styro cups or paper trays for the pickles, onions and peppers. The entire thing was a freakin mess. I had more trash to throw away the a family of four in a normal place. Yet they only take cash because they want to keep costs down...WHAT?The brisket was ok, the sauce was ok (one type yet there are buckets under the cooler of beer that say HOT SAUCE on them?) The beans were ok. Really nothing to bring me back which sucks because they are better then my review and I know it.Unlike most of the folks who wrote real reviews down below, I'm not from TX and I've never tried TX BBQ.  I can't compare it to any place in Austin, Dallas or Lubbock.  But I have taste buds.  And they liked it.  They liked it a lot.  I love BBQ.  Sure, there's better and worse BBQ around town based on where ya go, but generally speaking if I go to a BBQ place, I'm going to enjoy myself.  But that doesn't mean I'm going to recommend the place, or come back again, and it really doesn't mean that I'm going to write a review on it.  But as I sit here wondering how I ate that whole freaking sandwich, I know that I have just had one of the best BBQ nights in a long, long time.  And once my stomach isn't full (say, tomorrow afternoon?) I'll be calling friends to plan our next trip there.  OM-frickin-G it is awesome!  As has been mentioned in other reviews they hooked us up with some samples when we said we hadn't been there before.  Sure, their brisket leaves this taste of buttery meat in your mouth (if you don't understand that, I'm sorry for you) and makes you want much much more - but why has no one mentioned the turkey?  We only got a sample of it, but DANG I could eat a lot of that!  One day when I'm trying to be "healthy" I'll get that but today was not that day.I got what I believe was called the Big ol' Boy sandwich.  When he called back for the guys to make it he said to make a BIg ol' Girl.  Nice touch dude.  So the sandwich is 1/3 pound each of BBQ chopped pork, brisket and hot links.  I am not a fan of hot links, but figured I'd give it a shot as I liked the general concept (It actually comes out as a sandwich vs. it being a make your own thing...).  I LOVED the hotlinks.  That casing had an awesome "pop" as you bit into it, had a black pepper-y hint that I loved, and was good enough that I would almost contemplate trying one solo.  And I have NEVER felt that way about a hot link before.Between our samples and our meals I got to try all 3 kinds of brisket and I don't know that I'll be able to tell you my favorite.  Like picking a favorite child.  Sure, Bobby is the juiciest, but Jimmy tastes intense and smokey...well, you know what I mean...Not sure how new this is - but they now have 2 BBQ sauces for your eating pleasure.  Normal and HOT.  Hot won't burn your lip, but definitely makes the tongue to a double take.And the service.  Clap... Clap... Clap..Clap..Clap.Clap.Clap.Clap!!!  Right on point.  By the end of the end of our introduction to the food we knew what things were made fresh that day, what things were made every other day or weekly, and which ones came from his Grandma's kitchen.  Thank you Grandma - for both the recipes and raising folks right.  Folks were just as sweet as that tea.  I was also happy to see that even though we got there around 6:20pm and they close at 7pm, there were 3 big parties and 1 to go order that came after us.  Please folks - keep these people busy!  Don't you dare let this place go out of business because I have found my new BBQ heaven.  Review done.  Tummy still full.  Texting friends to make our next trip...*A desert landscape at midnight. A few men gather around a campfire seeking its warmth and the rare company of a passing stranger. One man, equally ravaged by the sands of time and the desolate landscape began to speak with just the smallest glimmer of contentment in his voice.*I had heard for years the ever-so-tantalizing cry of "melt-in-your-mouth brisket" sung to me by oh so many men who had come before....men far more accomplished than I. I remember them telling me as a young boy, "Son, some day you will find your brisket." I stared up at them with a gleam in my eyes. An innocent and naive sense of hopefulness filled me to the brink and then poured over the edges of my soul as I thought to myself, "Yes! I will find my brisket."Many years have come and gone since that time. The months like an ever strengthening gale storm pushing me further and further from my deepest, darkest desire: to find my lost brisket. Lo, the days were long; the minutes past like decades. Soon my cynicism began to take the best of me. A crusade of the mind against the heart ensued as brisket after brisket entered my gullet and filled my disposition with neglect. Some were flavorful, sure. But none would fulfill the promise my elders had made to me as a young boy.None, that was, until I found the Texas BBQ House of south central Phoenix. I knew the moment I walked through their doors that I was in for something special, but just what, I could not have told you. I watched a man behind the counter wield his blade flawlessly as a woman kindly prepared a basket with bread and cheesy macaroni. She had potato salad and and sausage and all sorts of other wondrous items. And then the brisket was placed before me. I could see the tenderness of the meat as its juices glistened in the daylight. I saw burnt ends that I could swear were calling for me by name. I thought, "Could it be? Have all my dreams come true?!" My heart went aflutter with the still unfulfilled promise of my forefathers.Finally, the moment had arrived. I prepared a slice of bread with a few slivers of meat, and a helping of barbeque sauce. I slowly bit down as my eyes closed, hoping and preying that the day had finally come. It was like I had died and gone to heaven. I saw Jim Morrison. I went towards the light. Only...when I walked through it, there I was. Sitting at my table, across from my father, with some brisket in a slice of bread that now had a single bite taken from it. I was happy. Down to my core, I was filled with contentment. And I realized at that moment, that I hadn't been searching for that "melt-in-your-mouth" brisket all along...I had been searching for myself. And now, I had found it. I had found...me.*hold for applause*This is the Q I have been waiting for!!!! Awesome brisket, both the lean and juicy are fantastic. The sausage was the next big winner, followed by the potato salad and then the mac, but actually everything was fantastic. The hot bbq sauce has quite a kick to it, but its a whole-mouth warmth kind of thing so its quite pleasant. Without a doubt the best bbq I've had to date, and I will be back.I've been here several times and have always left happily satisfied.  On this particular visit my friend and I had an amazon deal where we got a pound of brisket and two drinks.  We also ordered Texas cream corn, coleslaw and mac n cheese to share.  We got the small portions for all of them and the size was just enough to try everything and be satisfied.  Brisket was amazing without the sauce, but even better with it.  Super tender.  Coleslaw and cream corn were great and I'll definitely have those again.  I absolutely LOVE the cream corn.  I could have a big ol' container of just that.  The mac n cheese was good.  Not great, but good.  The sweet tea was AWESOME.  They should bottle that up and sell it.  The staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and offered suggestions.  I loved the little boys that were working and hanging out.  From the look of things it seemed like their dad owns or runs the place.  One of them was so sweet and polite.  We would ask for things and he would say, "yes mam, no mam, thank you mam".  He even asked how everything was.  I'd go back just to hang out with him.  The only thing I noticed different from when I visited over a year ago was that they no longer sell beer and while I'd like a Shiner to add to my Texas bbq experience, the food and the staff are enough to make me come back.I love TX BBQ and always go out of my way to find it. This was my second visit here. The first was with my wife and friends. Nice little restaurant that reminds me of what we would get along the train tracks in the poorer areas of TX.Menu has your basic items that you would expect at a BBQ joint. The meats are all served by the pound and you can get as much or as little as you want. They also have several side dishes that go great with the Q. The Texas Cream Corn was a treat.Normally get the Brisket and some Jalapeno Sausage. They have a small area off to the side with onions, pickles, jalapenos and some hot sauces. There are two different house sauces that they make and serve. One is mild and the other hotter.Food is pretty good but not super great. My Brisket and Sausage seemed to be at room temperature and not very warm. The Sausage was dry and could of had more fat in it. The white bread was not very fresh and tasted like it had been sitting out too long.Be careful where you sit down. I tried one of the red booths and about killed myself. Apparently the springs are shot and you end up lower than your body was expecting. Play it safe and go with the chair.Definitely better than a lot of the sweeter styles that are offered around town. Give them a try and see what you think. Located south of the river in an area of town that could use some urban renewal. SMOKIN A-OK!3.25 STARS

Review Text :
It's not very often that the owner of the restaurant is your server. It was kind of funny. At first I thought he was the chef since he was wearing a white chef jacket, but then he came up to us and said, "My name is Carlos and this is my kitchen." He introduced himself AND explained the name of his restaurant.I kept reading about how specials are posted on a board, but I couldn't find it at first and I didn't want to just get a regular sandwich or burger. I eventually noticed it behind the bar area and for today they had Enchiladas, a Southwestern burger, and a turkey ruben. I asked Carlos what was in the Southwestern burger and he said it had Pepper Jack Cheese,Roasted Peppers Grilled Onion, Lettuce,& Tomato with Chipotle Ranch. I was going to order it, but my mom jumped on that before I did, so I went with the Enchiladas. We both got iced tea that was always refilled once it hit the halfway mark. While waiting, I took a look around the place. It's definitely Arizona Charlie themed, as Lucy E stated and it doesn't have the best ambiance. When we first walked in, we were greeted by a strong smell of smoke, but we just sat at one of the tables farthest from the bar area and it was fine. The furniture is pretty outdated with some old looking floral print fabric and our table cloth kept trying to fall off. Normally I would knock off some stars for that, but the food + service was outstanding. It seemed like everyone working at Charlie's Saloon was involved in the restaurant. The bartender in the saloon went up to us a few times to see how we were doing, gave us our menus when we just sat down, and asked how the Enchiladas were. When I told him they were great, he said, "That's what I'll be having for lunch. Everything in Carlos' Kitchen is amazing. You could probably throw a dart to pick anything on the menu and it'll come out awesome." Before we even ordered the burger, Carlos said all their burgers are very good. You can tell that Carlos and everyone that works here is very proud of the food. Carlos came out with our plates. The first thing I noticed was that the Enchilada plate looked a lot smaller than the ones you'd get at Mexican restaurants, but it was the perfect portion. Normally other places will just fill the plate with a bunch of sauce and watery beans, but this plate just had the two Enchiladas in the center and a small portion of beans and rice on the right and left. At first I thought the sauce was going to be overbearing because it looked like there was a lot of it, but it actually had a nice subtle flavor that complemented the Enchiladas perfectly. I'll be honest, I scraped my plate clean. I don't even remember the last time I ever did that, but I couldn't help it. The Enchilada plate was just so yummy and the portion was perfect. It didn't leave me overly full and I didn't have to waste any of it.I took a bite of my mom's burger and it was good. The patty was very juicy and I actually really liked the Chipotle ranch that was inside. When I took a pic of the burger, it looked like there was A LOT of cheese in it, but the piece I ate didn't have any cheese on it, so I can't really comment on it ruining the burger (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w3pRWx5xOnPmmuZL7c9Pvw/l.jpg). My favorite part about that dish was the beer battered french fries. They are soo long, so crisp, and perfectly breaded (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ie6f7x2-KBkbpdbxKJAuRA/l.jpg). I absolutely love their fries!When we were done with our meals, Carlos talked to us for a while. He told us about how everything they make is from scratch including their soups. They always have a different soup and they just create it from whatever vegetable is in abundance at the grocery store or whatever is in season. He also told us about the New Years Eve Feast they're having for $20.12 (clever, right?). It includes: Mixed Greens with Poached Pears, Bleu Cheese and Champagne Vinaigrette,Grilled Filet Mignon topped with Two Sauteed Prawns, Eggnog Pannacotta with Brandy Caramel Sauce and fresh Whipped Cream. It's an awesome deal and it's served from 4pm-midnight.Everything about our experience here today was excellent an I'll definitely be coming back to try out some more of their daily deals and definitely some of their soup!Tips:*Carlos' Kitchen has an app that you can download for free! It shows you their daily specials, menus, and restaurant info*Daily specials are posted on a board on the left side of the bar area. It's next to the kitchen doorI read about this place in Las Vegas Weekly a while back and learned that the chef used to be an instructor at Le Cordon Bleu. Gaming taverns aren't exactly known for their food, but this one might challenge others for having the best bar food around.Looking at the menu there's a lot of typical bar fare -- burgers, wraps, salads, nachos, wings, etc. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted because nothing stood out. It all sounded pretty average... nothing unique. But the execution, at least with the one item I got, was excellent.The buffalo chicken wrap ($8.99) was about the size of a Chipotle burrito, filled with plenty of crispy chicken tossed in a wing sauce (your choice of mild or hot) with blue cheese dressing, lettuce, and tomatoes. It was accompanied by some delicious fries that were both light and crispy.I'm willing to go back for more, I just wish the menu had more personality... more items that differentiated the place from other bars... unique dishes that you couldn't get anywhere else.To all previous Yelp friends who reviewed Carlos' Kitchen--THANK YOU!  I was aware of Chef Carlos when he was at the other place a few blocks away but never went there.  After being reminded of him by Susie H.'s recent review, this was on my to try list ASAP.We arrived early last night (Sunday) after the Ribbon of Life show at the Smith Center.  We were the only ones in the place.  The server told us to sit anywhere we liked and she handed us the menus after we were seated.  Before leaving, she read the specials of the day.  There were two dinners, a wrap, and I believe a salad special.  She had me hooked with the first thing she read--bleu cheese pasta with steak!  I ordered that and my wife ordered Chicken Angelina.The bleu cheese pasta was made with penne rigate and the steak was grilled, sliced, and placed in strips on top of the pasta.  The bleu cheese sauce was exceptional.  A great bleu cheese bite with every taste and there was extra bleu cheese crumbles spread on the pasta.  My wife chicken Angelina was a seared chicken breast served on top of garlic spinach and mashed potatoes with large pieces of mushroom.  It was topped with artichoke and there was a dijon cream sauce.  She enjoyed it a lot!Although we were both full, we had our minds set on having dessert we had looked at online earlier in the day.  She got a chocolate molten lava cake and I got the chef's indulgence.  Both were outstanding!!!  The menu describes the indulgence this way:  A Cheesecake Spring Roll, Crunchy Bites of Brownie and Mini Banana's Foster Cheesecakes, served with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Fresh Strawberries and House Made Berry, Caramel & Fudge Sauces.  For the single version there's one brownie bite and one mini bananas Foster, but that's more than enough.  There are sweetened tortilla strips on the bottom of the plate.  This is one of the most creative desserts I've seen.  Chef Carlos came to the table twice to check on us and we chatted about the food and what he'd done since he moved to this newer spot.  The restaurant is almost completely closed from the VP bar so there's almost no smoke smell from the bar coming into the restaurant.  I can really see this place coming onto our rotation list of places to go again and again.  I'll call and ask the specials before I go.  What a wonderful gem hidden away in this video poker bar!  And, what a fantastic and creative chef Carlos is.  He cares about his food and his customers.Okay, Mr Carlos, you got my attention with your 4 1/2 star average. Now lets put it to the test.When I pulled up to the building, it says Carlos's Kitchen but when you stick your head in the door, (which happens to be two of them. One on the right for the bar and one on the left for the restaurant) you can get really confused as to where to go if the server is not there to greet you. So I stood there for a bit wondering if I should play video poker at the bar or just sit down and wait.So the waitress finally sits me down after she sees me just standing there like a statue. At first I didn't know where she came from but then realized there was no hostess for she was both. I assumed she came out of the kitchen because like I said, it is kind of confusing where to go.So while im looking at the menu, she is going on about the daily specials but I had my mind made up on the Spicy Chicken from the tip I saw off the Yelp business listing. I gotta say it was a good choice. The sandwich is decent size, the chicken breast was juicy, and the sauce that was on it had that extra kick to wake up you taste buds. Also the french fries that came with it deserves some attention as well. There is some kind of breading on it that gives it a certain crunch and extra flavor. I cant put my finger on what it is, but it is definitely good to the point that you want to finish your fries.Service was, let's just say a bit slow. I don't know if it was because there was only one server or the cook takes his time or what. I noticed there only 3 other tables being served so im not sure if this was your typical lunch crowd. As for the prices, they are comparable to Denny's or Chili's. A typical meal will run you 10 to 15 dollars per person. Lastly, since the bar is right next door and there is no barrier that segways from there, you will have secondhand smoke coming in from there, which is quite a negative if you ask me. My suggestion would be to put a swinging door there of some type and that should stop most if not some of the smoke from coming in.So Mr Carlos, what other Yelp peeps are saying are legit. It's just that I cant really spend more than 45 minutes for lunch and eat without having to think about lung cancer. Your restaurant is definitely worthy of good quality time spent with friends and/or family.While waiting for my daughter to finish a magic the gathering tournament at the nearby Little Shop of Magic, I wandered into Carlos' Kitchen and the connected Spectator's bar  I will review Specator's separately.The menu in both locations is supplied by Carlos.  Carlos is a former instructor at Le Cordon Bleu and I am glad he came out to discuss Burger philosophy and general cooking techniques with me.  He truly loves the art of cooking and I enjoyed meeting him.I started with onion rings which were lightly battered and fried to a golden glow.  The batter was unlike other batters as it had a sweetness to it.  I followed the rings with a bacon cheddar burger.  Now I have been searching for a truly great burger since I moved here.  I ordered the burger medium (I knew I was in for a treat as most places don't even ask).  The burger was perfectly cooked Angus beef with just the right amount of pink without being undercooked.  Carlos takes pride in the quality and flavor of the meat and it shows.  The bun was crisp on the outside and soft inside and the cheese was melted so it covered the top and sides but didn't fall out onto your hands.This is one of the best burgers in the area and the price is right.  Burger, fries and onion ring appetizer cost me only $17.00.I can't wait to come back and sample some of Carlos' other creations.  This is a diamond in the rough.  Don't miss your chance to meet Carlos!

UPDATE:  Looks like the health department can confirm my personal experience.  5 negative findings on their most recent inspection (http://phoenix.about.com/library/blrestinspectbad0613.htm). Meanwhile, the owners keep messaging me to get me to delete my review.Oh Curry Corner.  I loved you since the day I met you.Your takeout orders were usually wrong.  But I forgave you, for each time I came inside, my food was just right.I was wierded out by your self-service beverages, and your water always tasted so awful that I drank tea or soda.  I figured it was a ploy to sell drinks, and I was OK with that, because your food was so cheap and so delicious.I was excited to come in last week to find Guy Fieri's visit (can't stand the dude...wtf is with his hair...SERIOUSLY) prompted a major renovation.  Gone were the mostly disgusting and crappy booths near the kitchen.  Hardly an improvement to remove booths and replace with tables and chairs, but this was.  They cleaned it up. And it looked great!Well, I was pumped that my friend, who is mostly an Indian food virgin, enjoyed this place and his first foray to the cuisine.  So much so, that (well, until he reads this review) I couldn't bear to tell him what I saw when we checked out.A roach.  Not a dead one.  One still clinging to it's life.  Legs in the air like he just didn't care.I immediately bugged (ha!) my friend who had originally turned me on to the place to tell him my woeful tale of a roach at Curry Corner.  OH, he said?  I saw one the last time I was there, but I assumed it was just a fluke.No.  It was not.  And no thanks, CC.  I'm over you.Seriously, am I missing something??? I seem to be the only person who has had better Indian food.  The fam and I decided to give this place a try, even though it is very far from home, but with a recommendation like DDD, what could go wrong?  Well, first off, it's a bit chaotic when you walk in.  No real system to be seated and the tables are weirdly situated.  Once we were seated we were rushed to order... thankfully we mostly knew what we wanted.I tryed the marsala fries, which were BY FAR the best thing we ate.  Those, I must say are amazing.  I also had a bite of the samosas, which were ok... not really that favorful, and the chicken tikka masala.  Honestly, it was ok, but I've had better... even from Trader Joes.  We also had the goat... this too was ok... better than the masala, but so fatty it was hard to eat.So, long story short... if you live near here then perhaps hit it up.  Otherwise, check out some Indian food closer to home... that is my recommendation.  You're welcome.I am very disappointed by this place. I eat Indian food at-least once every couple weeks. I decided to go here based on the show Triple D (Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives). Well let me say this place is high up on the dive end of scale and I will never go back.I placed an order for take-out and ordered the Chicken Tikks Masala (my favorite), Matar Paneer, and Cheese Naan. I walked into the restaurant and there were only two tables taken. That should have been my warning to leave, but no... I said I will give it a try based on Triple D. I pay for my order and head back to my hotel. No issue with service, I only walked in and picked up my order. I get back and sit down ready to partake on what I am expecting to be some good/great Indian food. This is where the disappointment starts setting in... :-(I open up the soup container of Chicken Tikka Masala, and I notice something isn't right.. The Masala sauce is very loose, almost like they used skim milk vs heavy cream. So I opened the container of rice to add to it and I took a bite... no seasoning. Just bland white rice. No flavor of cumin, clove or cardamom, not even salt. I taste Tikka Masala sauce and it wasn't good, almost seemed like they left some important spices out.I then proceeded to open the soup container of Matar Paneer. This was loose as well. I am really getting frustrated now. I take a spoon and search for the peas and a chunk of the Paneer (homemade cheese). Instead of Paneer, it tasted and had the mouth feel of tofu. Very disappointed. I closed up the containers of Chicken Tiki Masala, Matar Paneer, and rice and threw them straight into the trash. The only thing that was good was the cheese naan.I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, in fact in my opinion, it is a disgrace to Indian Food. I have ate at one other Indian restaurant; Indian Place (Indian Delhi Palace - http://www.yelp.com/biz/indian-delhi-palace-phoenix?hrid=vLH0tzET4aC02gSgEAWkMw) in the Phoenix area, and I should have just went back there.

Review Text :
The omakase, like Holly C had mentioned in her review, is indeed insane.  We ordered 3 $100 omakase and watched teh sushi chefs prepared it while we sat at the sushi bar.  The experience alone is something that can't be quantify in dollars, especially if you are a foodie and enjoy seeing food prepared artistically, as well as enjoying the delicious edible works of art.The starting price for omakase here is $100, and can go up from there.  Seeing the results of the $300 omakse platter as we were exiting the restaurant, kind of reminds me of the feeling of watching the Food Network Challenges (I would love to be one of the tasting judges if they ever do an extreme sushi challenge).  And in my opinion is an interesting and extravagant way of splitting a meal with friends or impressing potential clients.  After the meal, you will definitely have something to talk about.The sushi here is good. Granted all the fish is trucked or flown in to the restaurant, just like for any other sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. But thus far the volume of customers that seemed to be served every time I walk past Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill (BRSBG) is pretty high, so the inventory of fish must be pretty fresh. The rolls here are good too, even though you will be paying a premium for it.  The sushi chefs here are not too talkative.  But we also didn't buy them sakes or beers, so that might have been a contributing factor. But they are skillful bunch and what they served up reminds me of the sushi I used to eat when I was much younger (presentation is still very much an important component of the food served).Our servers were good.  As the food was served, they identify them so you don't have to guess what they are (especially since we really have no idea what is going to be served with the omakase order).Desserts is probably the only uninteresting part of the meal, as the selection was uninteresting and expensive (I'd rather walk to Bellagio or Aria and get some Jean Philippe Patisserie pastries or dessert crepes, and still pay less).I posted the pictures I took from the dinner, so if you want to get an idea of what you might expect from ordering the $100 omakase, please check them out.Decor: 4/5 Very nicely decorated.Price: 3/5  Expensive, but you do get what you pay for.  Can't really compare the price to AYCE sushi restaurants.Food:  4/5  Very good.  The uni and the amaebi are both very fresh (the shrimp was still swimming moments before it was plucked from the tank, prepped and served. Service:  4/5  Fine dining style of service.Parking:  3/5  Cosmopolitan is getting busier every time I go,so finding a good parking space seems to be harder and harder.  But there is always the valet option.Location:  5/5  Right on the Strip.  Perfect for tourists and locals having a fabulous night out on the Strip.Overall, a solid 4 stars from me.Make no mistake, this place is pricey. Unless you're a serious baller (like the Green Bay Packer players we saw rolling out of here) you're going to feel the hurt when paying your bill. With that little detail out of the way, Blue Ribbon is worth checking out.The place has a modern Japanese feel and is divided up into three areas. When you first enter there's a small sushi bar to the right. Past that is a spacious lounge and bar area. Beyond that is the main dining area with a larger, U-shaped sushi bar. The tables in the main dining area are rather intimate, with many booths lining the walls and tables that are separated by thin wood dividers. So, if you're looking for a place where you can have some personal space and are more than 6 inches away from the nearest diner, then this is the place for you.Service was spotty. Our server was nice enough, he just didn't seem to know what was on the menu and couldn't recommend anything. Luckily, one of the managers came by to suggest a few items. Although he was casually dressed in jeans and a polo shirt so when he first came up to chat I thought it was just some random dude wanting to talk about the menu.Here's what we ended up ordering:Tuna sashimi. 2 pieces. Pricey, but deliciously fatty and silky smooth. Possibly some of the best tuna sashimi I've had in the city.Kanpachi - Amberjack with yuzu pepper. The order came with eight slices of fish with the yuzu sauce poured tableside. Smoked pork belly kushi yaki with pickled onions and baby watercress. Two decent cuts of pork with a nice amount of fat that added to the richness of the flavor.Negimaki - broiled beef with scallions and enoki mushrooms. It was a cute looking dish with eight slices of beef wrapped around the scallions and mushrooms. It was a good, savory dish with a hint of sweetness from its sauce, but probably not something I would order again.Miso marinated black cod. Two sizable pieces of fish per order. You usually can't go wrong with miso black cod, but I've had better. The piece that I had had a slight fishy taste and smell.Crab and truffle fried rice. The menu says it's $55 per order. That's ridiculous for any type of fried rice, but since everyone seems to rave about Blue Ribbon's fried rice we gave it a try. The manager said we could get a half order. Perfect! There were plenty of chunks of crab and mushrooms and slices of truffle. Definitely the best fried rice I've had, just don't tell my mom that (sorry mom, your fried rice has been bumped down to number two).I thought this would make a great place when my friends staying at Vdara wanted to do sushi. But when we sat down and were handed menus...they were asking where the pencil and checklist were. Realizing these guys were not sushi connoisseurs whatsover we almost bailed and went to Sushi Mon. The ambiance was great though and the cocktails convinced us to stay. Glad we did. I am so anti getting edamame at restaurants it's not even funny. Why would you pay $4+ for a little bowl when you can buy a whole bag for less and eat it at home? But that's the first thing my buddy orders...go knock yourself out man..for $8! I had a couple of them and it was ridiculous. If I'm paying that much for edamame..it should be at least served cold like in real Japanese restaurants and not straight out of a boiling pot. Give me a break. AYCE places whatever...I always assume it'll be served hot but $8 in a place like this?!? Its just the principal itself goddamit!! Anyways...the quality of fish was outstanding. The maguro served had that really deep red color I sometimes dream about. I savored every single piece of sushi and sashimi I had. I was also eyeballing some really cool items I plan on ordering in the future with sushi snobs like the lobster sashimi. I will certainly be doing the omakase next time I'm here.Excellent rating only because of the trendiness of the ambiance and excellent service.  The food is only OK.I'm from Hawaii where we have some of the freshest and best sushi in the world.  I have also traveled to Tokyo and Kyoto where sushi rules.  Sadly Blue Ribbon charges the high prices but misses the mark on quality.The ultimate test of a sushi chef is the Tamago Nigiri.  Sad to say, the rice was overly packed and on 3/5 occasions, the tamago was overcooked.Other sushi items are very fresh but portions are very small.  The fish to rice ratio is nowhere near Tokyo standards.Hot entree items are very good to OK.  The tempura is perfectly cooked but the broiled fish is consistently over cooked.If you want a perfect dining experience, order the Blue Ribbon Special.  Its basically omakase. Its near perfect.  Only problem for less adventurous diners is that you leave yourself in the hands of the chef.  Well worth the risk but at $200, very pricey.The sake list is good, the wine list is OK.Prices are high.Service is excellent.I'm not someone who blows a lot of dough on these overpriced restaurants in the strip hotels, but this time, it was a paid meal for a business meeting with only 3 people, so I jumped at the opportunity to try this place out as the Cosmo's restaurants seem to maintain high quality although overpriced as expected.  I would usually sit at the counter and talk to the chef, but my party was 3 and they were already seated at the table, so I went with the flow.  When I first read about the blue ribbon restaurants originating in NYC opened by a couple of jewish restauranteurs...I wasn't so sure about this place.  Besides, no authentic sushi chef would ever name their sushi restaurant "blue ribbon".  However, my worries were whisked away as soon as I opened the menu filled with mostly old school sushi and appetizers.  Yeah, there were a few fru-fru rolls and wagyu just so that non-sushi eating americans can still enjoy the meal, but the menu was appealing and mouthwatering for the most part.  When going to a sushi restaurant, it's always best to go with "omakase".  I talked to the waiter who really couldn't tell me that much about the omakase, so I asked who the Japanese sushi chefs were, and 3 out of the 4 chefs at the tsukeba were Japanese (a good sign), and the waiter led me to the head sushi chef.  So I asked what his recommendations were today, which were botan-ebi, uni, aji, and sakuradai...very good, and when I asked him if those would be included in the omakase and he confirmed, so I went with the $100 omakase.  He seemed a bit surprised that I spoke to him in Japanese as I was in a group with 2 caucasians, but it's always good to talk to the chef in Japanese to: 1) make sure that the chef is Japanese and 2) to let them know that you are Japanese because really... you can't screw around with Japanese customers who know their stuff.  We started out with some Kumamoto oysters on the half shell with ponzu....excellent (not part of omakase), and then we got a HUGE plate of sashimi consisting of: uni, ikura,, scallops, sakura-dai, aji, hirame, seared salmon, blue fin tuna, isaki, hamachi, and botan-ebi (I may have missed a couple).  This was pretty impressively presented on a plate that must have been about 2 feet long.  It was an omakase order for 2 people.  The waiter actually asked us if we wanted two identical plates or one big plate with more varieties and I was glad that we went with the latter.  It was truly a HUGE spread and every sashimi was impressively fresh and delicious.  I was especially surprised that they had a quite a bit of white fish, which is more of an acquired taste as you are tasting more of the amino acid/protein rather than fat.   I feel that talking to the chef beforehand had something to do with that, as most Americans would not know what they were eating and probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.  Then we had a large sushi plate with blue fin tuna, kanpachi, salmon, giant clam, king crab legs, spicy crab roll and some other fancy roll.  Overall, excellent sushi/sashimi with a quality that surpassed my expectations.  I would have preferred to have had a few more nigiri's instead of those Americanized rolls, but I would say that it was an excellent meal overall  As for pricing...$100+tax+tip seems a bit on the expensive side.  Would I go back on my own dime?  Hmmm.....that's hard to say, but I'd rather spend $100 on what I ate today than $100 on an overpriced steak restaurant on every other big casino on the strip.  If there is a next time, I would sit at the counter and have my nigiri made one at a time while talking with the chef.  That's how sushi should be eaten.LVRW2012: Restaurant Week, if for anything other than charity, is lightly considered an opportunity for people to experience a restaurant they wouldn't normally enjoy in their everyday life--usually for the first time. Diners often need an "excuse" to eat out and spend money frivolously; I am one of those diners. Because eating at a fine dining restaurant a few times a week, just because, is a ton of empty calories and quite time consuming. At first glance, Blue Ribbon's prix-fixed restaurant week menu stands out as "a good one." You have the choice of two apps for your first course, a taste of sushi, three entrees of which only one looks good, and a dessert. But that excitement is let down soon after the third course.The bisque was exceptional with large chunks of sweet, tender meat. The heat warmed the cloud of wasabi crème on the surface; when combined with the soup, it really complimented the lobster flavor. Upon further investigation, I found this is not on the regular menu. Generally, I'm against non-menu items on LVRW menus, but I was satisfied by this course.The spicy tuna roll was by the book. No disappointment, no intrigue. And as a pleasant surprise it was served alongside a piece of chutoro and hamachi. I'm not fond of amberjack but the tuna was pretty good. The pork cheek and trout entrees are not on the regular menu and everyone swoons over the "Blue Ribbon Style" fried chicken. At $26, this luxury fried chicken had the potential to be great. Its coated lightly with matzo meal and flour, then seasoned with a spice mix of togarashi, paprika, cayenne, and sea salt. Whatever unique, stand-out flavor I was searching for was overtaken by a vat of old oil. It was served with a dipping sauce made with--supposedly 'real'--wasabi and honey specially-imported from Mexico. Now that I would pour on just about anything but it just can't make-up for that stale oil taste.The chocolate bruno is rich, dense, and extremely chocolate-laden and was supposed to be served alongside a green tea ice cream. They were out of green tea and substituted chocolate ice cream without letting us know first. Just what I wanted, more chocolate. I sampled a bit of the gingerbread pudding. The clear winner of the two. Am I impressed? No. Would I go back? Yes, but only to settle the rumors that their oxtail fried rice is really the magnificent creature they say it is. After the fried chicken fail, I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't worth the $30.Loved it. Probably more so because we had like 5 bottles of hot sake but I promise the sushi we had before we were intoxicated was still wonderful. Racked up a bill way over the norm and ordered just about everything on the menu, but it's Vegas, you can't really hold back in Vegas. (Normally this might be 4 stars for the price but it's sushi in Vegas, what do you expect)Had like 48 Oysters - they were awesome. I kept ordering... 1 more dozen, 1 more dozen. I felt bad for our server but he was SO cool. Totally didn't care that we kept ordering more and he was always checking in and making sure we were doing okay even though the restaurant was packed.Had all my favorite sashimi and sushi and was definitely happy with the fresh-melt in your mouth fish.The black Cod was sweet and extremely tender. Perfectly cooked. As were the scallops. Oxtail Rice was recommended, I wouldn't think to order this at a sushi restaurant but wow, so delicious and totally worth trying! Had so much more food but this was after the first couple bottles of sake.... so yea... it was good? Hah. Only my third time at Blue Ribbon but I haven't been disappointed yet!As a sushi bar, meh.  As a high end, contemporary Japanese eatery, win!Gaijin sushi.  Purist understand.  The seafood, exceptional.  The rice, very sticky, over seasoned and poorly handled, misshapen and sticking to the hands of the chef.In all other areas, ultra high quality ingredients, controlled creativity, a respectful nod to Japanese culinary traditions equals outstanding dishes.Order family style and in courses.The beef marrow with teriyaki sauce and bonito flakes served with a simple piece of toast is mind blowing.  Rich, unctuous, the roasted marrow perfectly carries the teriyaki sauce as it coats the palate with comforting flavors.  The "Blue Ribbon" style fried chicken, very good.  A crisp coating surrounds a juicy, wasabi and honey seasoned morsels of chicken.  Add some togarashi powder for the perfect spice kick.Very creative fried rice.  The standouts; braised oxtail, bone marrow, fresh shitake, and crispy daikon (great blend of flavors coddled in the melting fat of the marrow) and the king crab, shaved truffle and egg (a flavor explosion with sweet crab and umame from the truffles).Ready to splurge?  How about A4 Wagyu from Kagoshima Japan. The real deal.  Three exceptional preparations.  (1) Seared as thin cut sashimi served with either ponzu or sea salt (the barely warmed surface releases fat that mixes so well with the ponzu increasing it's sweetness).  (2) Seared with miso butter (the fermented back taste of the miso sets off all kind of flavors in the beef), (3) Grilled New York steak (4oz / 8oz - $104 / $198 simple and good eats).Raw seafood is the best of he best.  The chu toro tartare with bits of scallion mixed with light soy and sesame oil topped with quail egg is a real treat.  Mix it all up for the best flavor.  The sashimi plates of kampachi dressed with yuzu pepper and hamachi with jalapeño and ponzu are both very good.Very good selection of sake.  Excellent service.  Contemporary vibeA pity they can't get the sushi right.  Oh well...I fell in love with the oxtail bone marrow fried rice when I visited the NYC location. You can only imagine the smile on my face when they told me they served it here in Vegas, as well!Score!We started the evening with a bottle of nigori, that drink gets me buzzing from the get go and at 19% alcohol on the Genshu Sake I knew I was in for a treat!Our first dish was one of the restaurant's signature dishes kanpachi Yuzu which was delicate with a soft supple texture but with a nice acidic finish from the yuzu. Great start!King crab truffle fried rice - dare I say I found a new favorite?!? I think I died and went to fried rice heaven!! The truffle added just the right amount of fragrant aroma to this drool worthy dish to make my mouth water and the moist and flaky king crab took it up to whole new level! AMAZEBALLS!!!Oxtail bone marrow fried rice with egg - as deliciously magnificent as I remembered! Rich, flavorful and marvelous!!!!Bone marrow - Rich, smooth with deep flavors enhanced by the accompanying sauce! You really don't need the accompanying bread but the contrast in textures are inviting!Fried chicken - served nice & hot! Perfectly crisp on the outside and beautifully juicy on the inside! Finger lickin gooooood!We were running late for a show so the thoughtful staff had us sign sealed and delivered before we could even say "check please!"Overall, great food, courteous staff and cool hip ambiance! The prices are a bit high but what do expect? IMO, this a great place to dine if you're into Japanese cuisine/Asian fusion. Happy Eats!This restaurant really has it going! Not only is it situated in the Cosmopolitan Hotel but, it's created a unique entrance that really makes it stand out from the other restaurants surrounding it. With a variety of seating arrangements it has a dim, classy feel to it but, everyone is super down to earth and they were playing Salsa music when we arrived! Sushi restaurant playing salsa music that was a first for me. Talk about over the top hospitality. They must have rotating floor managers aside from your waiter. We were asked by three different people if we needed anything, like nothing I've ever seen! Hospitality reached another level. Let's talk about the food (prices were not bad, but on the expensive side) they definitely had dishes that were "different". We wanted to try some of those and did. The Duck was amazing! Honestly, everything tasted great. There were no complaints on that end at all. You can see that the food was fresh and prepped right in front of you. Definitely a nice romantic dinner in the cosmopolitan this is the place to be.

Update Number Two.Another rave review!I have a hunchyou might just love the brunch!I love this place.  No apologies (well, except for the lame poetry (?) above). It might sound like I'm an A & A cheerleader, but the cheers are well-deserved.  Oh, the brunch!  It was everything I'd hoped it would be!Let's start at the beginning.  The hub, the kid and I were seated at the sunny table in the window overlooking the goings on outside.  Immediately Brittany came and took our drink order.  The pre fixe menu was $20 INCLUDING a choice of a mimosa, sangria or a bloody Mary.  Helllooooo...you know my choice!  And apparently the bloody Mary fixation runs in the family...make that three, please.  While we looked over the menu, Britaney brought us a basket of pastries including croissants and sweet rolls and a plate with housemade blackberry jalapeno jam and a lovely fresh strawberry jam.  Butter, too, of course.  I tasted the jams, delightful.  My fave was the blackberry jalapeno.  Let's see....the choices were (as I recall) a frittata with potatoes and choice of bacon or sausage, drunken stuffed French toast with the same sides, housemade lemongrass ginger granola, pork belly with redeye gravy , poached eggs and those same crispy potatoes, bloody Mary crab and shrimp ceviche, espresso cured salmon and country fried chicken and biscuits with white gravy and a side of spinach.  You'd guess I got the bloody Mary ceviche and you'd be....wrong.  I can't resist the pork belly.This pork belly was one very lean piggy belly!  More like a crispy pork roast than the bellies I've had in the past.  Oh, before I go on anymore about the food, let me tell you about Patrick, the chef.  Having advised our waitress about my gluten issue, she came back to tell me Patrick would do the pork belly for me without the redeye gravy and make potatoes that hadn't been fried in the same oil as breaded items.  Now THAT'S a chef I can love.  He understands not only WHAT gluten-free issues are, he cares!  Thanks, Patrick...mmmwaahhh!  Okay, back to the food.  The pork belly, eggs and potatoes melted together into a dish I swooned over.  I can only imagine what it would have been with the redeye gravy.  Mmmmm.The hubster had the French toast.  Browned and beautiful, he enjoyed it very much - but raved over the sausage!  I don't know if the sausage is housemade or not, but it isn't Bob Evans!  Yum.The kid had the frittata with bacon and potatoes.  She loved it.  She loved Alchemy and Ale.  She loved the vibe.  She lives in Cleveland which has, probably, the best array of Sunday brunch spots anywhere - so impressing the kid is no easy task.I forgot to tell you about the bloody Mary.  THE BEST in Pittsburgh because  A & A has the BEST bartenders in Pittsburgh.  Richie was working and crafted those beautiful red libations with some mad btending skills!Not only was the inaugural Sunday brunch at Alchemy and Ale a success, it was a bargain.  We'll be back.  I can't wait.We went in today for Brunch.  Without a reservation, we were concerned about a wait.  But getting a table was no worry.  We were greeted right away by Brittany.  BJ got his favorite Bloody Mary and I got a Mimosa.  My drink was one of the best I have ever had.  We also loved the pastry basket.  My fav was the cute little sweet roll covered with almonds.  So good.  The spicy jams were also a very nice touch.  BJ had a difficult time with his choice, but ended up picking the Chicken and Biscuits.  I was anxious to try that much Yelped about Drunken Stuffed French Toast.   I have to say, I was very disappointed.  I did not like it at all.  Not good.  Didn't like the combination of flavors, didn't like the crispy crap it was dunked in.  I couldn't even eat more than two bits.   I believe that even if I was the drunken one, I still would not have liked it.  Also, my eggs tasted weird.  The sausage was the only edible thing on my plate and even it was a bit hard and not moist at all.  Strange.  BJ's meal on the other hand, was good.  He finished up every bite.  I even had a couple.  The chicken was good and so were his potatoes. The best part of our meal were the drinks and the service.  So, we are still on the search for the perfect brunch.  Boy, we didn't find it here!This place is great.  I had brunch here with a few of my girlfriends on a Sunday.  We started our brunch with some great drinks: mamosa's, sangria, and bloody mary's.  The sangria was one of the best I have ever had.We were seated at a charming table that was meant for a king & queen.  The large seats and table were all made of wood and went perfectly with teh brick walls.We were treated with delicious pastries while looking at our brunch menus.  You could tell the pastries were fresh and there were a variety of them.The menu for brunch had a variety of delicious items such as drunken french toast, chicken and biscuits, crab & shrimp ceviche, and fruit and yogurt.  The food was delicious and served timely.  The group ordered a variety of things with the drunken french toast as the most popular item.  Everyone seem to enjoy their food.The service was great and the people were very friendly.  The bartenders and waitresses seemed to love what they did and created a laid back atmosphere.One item to note is that there is no air conditioning.  It was warm on the day I went and the room was not uncomfortable but it could be if the place was packed.I would reccomend the brunch to anyone.  It is completely worth the $20 for the food, friendly service, and decor.

Review Text :
I've been here a few times (not by my choice) and this place is mediocre at best, so I have no idea why so many people are giving them raving reviews. Let me go through my phoanalysis...Pho:The broth is nothing to write home about. It's not terrible nor bland, but it's certainly not memorable. The meat, noodles, and vegs were fresh.Spring rolls:Decent, but once again, not amazing. There weren't any mint in the rolls I had and the peanut sauce is disappointing. Where the restaurant lost huge points with me was the inflated over-priced menu. The small bowls of pho are $7-8 and $8-9 for large, depending on which one you order. The bahn mis were $5-6, are you kidding me? And $5 for two spring rolls. It defeats the whole purpose of eating pho which is supposed to be cheap and convenient. Saigon Kitchen has more of a modern lounge feel to it, and that's not what I want in Vietnamese food. Focus on the food, not the decor.Some bonus points for the bar. They have variety of beers on draft: Sapporo, Kilt Lifter, Blue Moon, Coors Light, and some type of pale ale I couldn't make out. There's a small selection of liquor available also.Overall, I'm not a fan of SK. But my friend who lives nearby drags me there once in a while. I'd much rather make the trip to Central King Eggroll who has the best pho in the valley, so far, from my experience.Came here to try their much talked about Pho but settled on something else.  Nonetheless, this place was Pho-nomenal!Location & Aesthetics - located on Bell Road (corner of Bell and Litchfield) between Longhorn Steakhouse and Carrabba's.It might be easy to miss from Bell Road because what you see from Bell Road is the rear of some (not all) of the restaurants as their facades face south.  The sign to the restaurant is large enough from Bell Road so I'm thinking you won't miss it. Even if you miss it while traveling west, it's not a problem and very easy to make a U-turn on Bell as there are enough U-turn options available on the road.Lots of parking in the rear, and the parking lot was well lit.The interior of the restaurant is well-lit if you're dining in the evening as we were, and I'm guessing if you're dining in for lunch too, you won't have a problem as the restaurant is surrounded with glass windows.  There is also the option to dine alfresco at the side of the restaurant.Normally I would minus a point here as the restaurant was on the small side and felt cramped however the owner - Dennis did come around and happened to introduce himself to us, asked how we knew of the place and picked it (told him Yelp of course!), as well as indulged in some small talk, and did mention that he was expanding the place by taking over the space next door which will be occurring mid-December to sometime in January, and even extended a personal invitation for us to attend the grand re-openinging.The place was also exceptionally clean.  The noise level was average as it was a Friday evening but wasn't overly loud that I couldn't hear anyone in my party.Despite the place being really busy for a Friday evening, I didn't notice anyone having to wait for seating.Service/Menus - menus were provided to us as by our waitress soon as we were seated.  Very easy to read and understand.  Even our questions were answered promptly.  Our waitress took our drink orders immediately and gave us time to think about what we wanted to order.  Drinks came promptly and our waitress even saved us some money.  We came in a minute before happy hour was finished (3-6 PM).  Thankfully our waitress put in our drink and appetizer orders just in time so we ended up paying a little less (Happy Hour prices) for those items.Food/Drinks - For libations, I ordered the orange martini which was delicious and not too tart.  For appetizers, we ordered the shrimp & pork spring rolls (2 and its cut in half so you end up having 4 bites) - lettuce, bean sprouts, rice vermicelli, and mint served with a peanut sauce dip - very tasty particularly the ingredients added to the rolls like the mint and bean sprouts which served to enhance the tastiness of the shrimp and pork.  The rice vermicelli also gave the rolls a particularly nice transparent appearance.  For the main course, I thought I was going to have the Pho but instead settled for the Filet Mignon Shaken Beef - which is seared cubed beef tenderloin marinated in their house special soy, and served on a sizzling skillet with onions.  When this part of the dish, came out, it was sizzling and I even had folks who were passing by asking me if I ever had this dish and commenting on how great it is, and it's the only thing they order when they're there.  By itself, the beef was tender, moist, juicy, and very flavorful.  The soy wasn't overpowering or too salty, and the onions were sautéed beautifully and not burnt at all.  They will ask you how you want the beef cooked, and for me it was medium, and it was done exactly like that!  It was also recommended by the wait staff to mix the lime and salt and pepper that comes with the dish first, then use that to dip the beef in (as an option) to enhance its flavor.  I tried it and they were correct in that it did seem to multiple the flavor(s) tenfold!This dish is also served with jasmine rice which was warm, fresh, sticky (as rice should be in my opinion) and very tasty; a side salad; and a scallion broth which was hot and just the right thing to clear those sinuses (though mine wasn't in need of clearing).Well, my intentions were to come here to sample their Pho and despite that not happening, I don't have any regrets coming here at all.  As promised to the owner, I will return to try their Pho!

Review Text :
Dear Tanzy,Today you sadly disappointed in the service you provided. I spoke so very highly of your brunch buffet with unlimited mimosas, but sadly things did not go as planned. Let me start by saying that although the day ended not as planned, all of your staff were quite nice, very friendly, and extremely apologetic. I arrived on time and checked in, and I let the hostess know that my dining companions were running late but I still wanted let them know that I was there since I had made the reservation ( which by the way was cancelled on opentable after I checked in but that is another story) .  5 mins later another dining companion arrived and we were seated while we waited for others.  (FYI there was a total of 8 of us including my friend's daughter) Kevin our waiter introduced himself and let us know that he along with another waiter would be taking care of us. Score!  We get to fabulous men to take care of us. We were offered the endless mimosas but were SADLY informed that the brunch buffet that was once before offered was no more and that a new menu for brunch was being introduced.  I was so disappointed as that was the main reason why I had picked Tanzy as I had raved about the brunch buffet and how good it was.  This should have been our queue as to what was to come.Fast forward to around 11:30 and the rest of our party finally arrived. Everyone was happy to so each other and Kevin came by to offer the unlimited mimosas and again let us know that he and another waiter would be taking care of us. Cool. 10 mins later we are ready to order and regretfully our waiters are no where to be found. 20 mins go by and we are still waiting for our waiters so my friend went to the hostess desk  to ask where our waiters were and the hostess herself graciously came over to take our orders. But then we wait, and wait, and wait. We see other tables that came in after we did, get served there meal, eat, and leave. We even asked a party that was across from us, who came in at the same time that we did, if they had even ordered yet as they appeared to be waiting just as long as were were. An hour and 15 mins later ( not kidding) we finally say we are done. I go and look for our waiter and say please cancel our order because we are leaving. The manager comes out and apologies and comps our drinks but we were still disappointed. I am not sure what happened today but after speaking your praises   you let me down as well as all my girlfriends. Will I be back? Maybe but it will be awhile. Seriously  Tanzy, you dropped the ball today.Love, EbonyPS Bring back that yummy buffet please!Update 11.12.12: I received a phone call and an email from the General Manager Michael  today. WOW! Thank you for both the call and email. You went above and beyond what I expected. For that I give you 5 stars ( but I won't change the stars on this particular review) But again just wow, thank you!!! See I told you guys that the staff was great! :)Wow, what can you say about this place that has not been said.It is awesome in every area. There is so much going on here that I will just review for today the Restaurant of Tanzy itself.The beautiful setting is amazing. Plus free parking in the covered Garages.The staff is lovely and all the Managers really care about this place and your dining experience.  Which makes all the difference.We had a lovely table and the wine here is so nice, spectacular actually.The food is really good , The Braised Beef Short Rib is simply the best to me.I am not really a huge fan of Red meat either but, this is awesome. The Gnocchi they serve with it is unreal. Even though I know I am packing on the pounds I cannot stop eating it.Next time I think I will try the Muscovy Duck Breast and candied Fig.  It too looked wonderful. The Risotto is very good as well , and my boyfriend had the Mediterranean Chicken Penne.There is something here for everyone's taste. Plus the chef will totally make something in your direction if you are a vegetarian. A flour less Chocolate cake is my absolute to die for. Second time I have had it, and I love it.  I could come in again just for that.The restrooms are beautiful and clean.High end price but, good for a fancy night out. Dress up, because, you just feel better when you do.HAPPY NEW YEAR!High praises for the attentive service and friendly staff, but that's about it.The experience began with cocktails; a fruit martini tasting almost clinical due its unbalanced high vodka, low fruit ratio, and a Manhattan ordered with 'only one or two rocks' served up in a full glass of ice. Two for two thus far.The lobster salad, (Valentine's Day menu) a mountainous pile of frisee with a few small chunks of lobster buried deep within, made for a nice game of hide and seek as I watched my date feverishly pick through the lettuce in search of what little lobster was embedded within.The cedar planked salmon entree was another huge disappointment. A good cedar planked salmon should have the aroma, smoke coloring and caramelization of, well, cedar planked salmon. This was anything but. This salmon, while cooked properly, was tasteless, other than its normal salmon flavor.Now, plop it onto a flat, (non-fluffy pile) wet, soggy serving of cous cous and you've really got a plateful of disappointment.We also ordered the duck, which was delivered roasted and rare. So rare, it was like cutting raw chicken due to it being so flubbery. But again, as I mentioned, the staff was extremely helpful in bringing out a new plate of duck, this instead of the kitchen simply heating up the unwanted serving.After this level of disappointment, desserts were out of the question, but interestingly enough, our server never even offered us to see a dessert menu. How weird is that?It was like he had ESP.Throughout dinner, a woman, (we surmised a floor manager) paced the dining area as if overseeing the staff. Too bad she didn't stop by to inquire how our meal was or if everything was alright. Another disappointment.Ironically, if you read other Yelp reviews of Tanzy, nearly all of them feature a management response, either praising Yelpers for their high marks, or, apologizing for their less than stellar experience. Tanzy, please, there's no need to respond.I don't want an apology, or some lame reason why things weren't the way they should've been. I'm afraid that would be much too little, too late.The time for that was while we were still captive within your domain.What you should do instead is:Gordon Ramsey your Executive Chef.Make the mixologist sample his / her creations until they bleed vodka out of their eyes.And finally, have the person frantically pacing the aisles put a smile on her face and actually interface with the patrons, asking about their experience... seemingly pretending to give a poo.I really like this place.  This is a great place to have lunch or happy hour drinks.  It's located at the Scottsdale Quarter right next to a very nice iPic movie theater, so it's convenient for pre/post movie cocktails as well.Lunch is my favorite time to come.  The Prosciutto di Parma Ciabatta and the Turkey Panini are two of my favorite dishes.  They're both only $10 ea and comes with Parmesan Fries, which are addicting...yum!The lunch crowd here is relatively light for Scottsdale, which means you'll get in/out pretty fast.  Service here is always very good.Return Factor - 90%For August Breakfast Club the place picked was Tanzy, I for one was pretty excited about it! I didn't even know they were opened for bunch so when I got a look at the bunch menu I knew I was sold!  Tanzy does offer a prix fixe bunch menu for $22 that comes with a lot of options, but they also have a breakfast menu too. After checking out both menus I knew what I wanted. I went with the traditional eggs benedict. It was the perfect dish, with the right amount of hollandaise sauce; I just love that golden yellow tangy sauce! Yum! The eggs were cooked perfectly, the smoked Canadian ham was tender and moist, not dry and the English muffin was cooked perfectly too, firm and yet able to be cut when taking bite.  This was a great dish, can't wait to come back and try it again! The only down side to this breakfast was I wasn't able to get a order of the crispy Brussels sprouts, as it was too early to order them. Service was great; the restaurant is an opened lay out and nice, it even has great views of the valley. If you are in the area, regardless if it's for breakfast or dinner, give Tanzy a try! And if it's for dinner, do the crispy Brussels sprouts, man they are delish!Met a friend here yesterday before a movie.  I actually arrived first, around 5:50 pm, told the bartender I was waiting for a friend who was going to join me at a 6:15 pm movie and asked if I could order the Table-side Mozzarella For Two to take with us.  He said there wouldn't be enough time to order the app, but that we could order apps on the happy hour menu list and take those, so I chose the calamari and the meatballs, which were $8 each.  The calamari smelled fishy (not the sea-fresh scent) and had terrible texture, as if it was undercooked. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tanzy-scottsdale?start=100&select=Kdc4C3svJf6R7QmXrGo5ZQ#Kdc4C3svJf6R7QmXrGo5ZQ  The meatballs were good, albeit on the smallish side**, with a nice dollop of ricotta cheese, but the dish wasn't accompanied by any crostini, unlike my previous orders, which were admittedly a year, or more ago. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tanzy-scottsdale?start=100&select=nNFXqb2B8vN8envJcgRl7g#nNFXqb2B8vN8envJcgRl7gI  I asked for a little bread, but didn't have time to wait for it as we had to leave for the movie.  Don't know if I'd order the meatballs again, especially since the crostini were omitted, but my friend and I will be back to try the Mozzarella for two soon.**This is what the meatball crostini app looked like in March 2013! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tanzy-scottsdale?select=9aiYhoNUaF_nJWOkYu-yjg#9aiYhoNUaF_nJWOkYu-yjgA perfectly safe corporate restaurant incorporating recent trends in Italian and making them palatable to the trend following yet unadventurous Scottsdale majority.  Solid mozzarella and seafood options.  Not destination by any means but a solid pairing with a movie next door.Five stars for the AMAZING interior architecture and sexy ambiance! Negative stars for the taste of food and quality. My pasta sauce was sour in taste, and our desert was freezer burned. Our server was sweet and made a great effort to communicate in a seasoned, well versed manor, but overall a rookie at luxury service. The restaurant is so beautiful inside but lacks the quality in experience and flavors.

Review Text :
Finally! Real soul food has come to Pittsburgh! Carmi is a welcome addition to the poor and much in need of help selection of soul food restaurants in Pittsburgh. They are located next to the Shamrock Inn on Western Avenue. They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner. Breakfast items include pancakes, Belgian waffles, french toast, eggs, cheese grits, bacon, sweet and hot sausage, turkey sausage, home fries and Italian, wheat or rye toast. Lunch and dinner entrees are the same. Lunch is served from 11am to 3pm and dinner in served from 3pm to close. Entrees include fried chicken, fried fish, grilled or blackened Salmon, spare ribs, 9oz New York Strip, BBQ grilled chicken breast, meatloaf and blackened Tilapia. Lunch entrees come with two sides. Dinner entrees come with two sides, soup of salad and cornbread. Sides include baked macaroni and cheese, candied yams, mashed potatoes, southern mixed greens, seasonal grilled veggies, side salad, potato salad, red beans & rice, soup, fries and sweet potato fries. Soups include southern fish stew, chicken & dumpling and the soup of the day. Salads offered are garden, grilled chicken, steak, blackened chicken and grilled or blackened Salmon. They also offer sandwiches including burgers, clubs, grilled reubens, blackened Cajun chicken, shrimp po' boys and fried fish. They even have chicken & waffles and shrimp & grits! We went on Sunday after church. As we walked to the door to enter the restaurant we were greeted by a very nice girl who must of been leaving at the end of her shift as she was wearing a black Carmi t shirt. We seated ourselves and were quickly greeted and our drink order was immediately taken. F.Y.I. The sweet tea is delicious! My wife and I both ordered the Southern Fried Chicken meal which consisted of a thigh and a drumstick. For our sides we both choose the southern mixed greens (greens, cabbage and ham hock) I choose the baked mac & cheese and she got the potato salad. The chicken was seasoned to perfection! The skin was crispy and crunchy, The chicken was tender and juicy! It reminds me of the chicken at Busy Bee Cafe in Atlanta. The southern mixed greens were a little spicy but still very good. The mac & cheese was amazing as well. I prefer stove cooked mac & cheese but, let me tell you, this was just as good! My wife and I really liked the potato salad as it was almost as good as her's. You get a lot of food for the money and the portion sizes are just right. Our daughter got the burger and fries. Big surprise! If you follow my reviews you know that she always gets that! I must say that they serve some of the best fries I have ever tasted. They are fresh cut and really, really good. She loved her burger also. Carmi seems to be a family business as their children, grand children? are the wait staff. I must say that it is very refreshing to see such polite, well mannered teenagers today. Service was very good and my glass never got more than half empty. My only complaints are that there is no kids menu. They don't deliver and the decor is dated as others have said but, who cares?! The food is outstanding and we well be back often!Better than ever!We hadn't be in a while so we decided to visit Carmi again after church on Sunday. After we parked and were walking to the door we all noticed the new sign outside. Upon entering we were greeting by Gospel Music playing and were all pleasantly surprised by the updated decor. The walls are now two different shades of brown and a dark red. The ceiling is chocolate brown and there are new table coverings, lighting and even new menus with the husband and wife team on the cover. Keionna was our waitress and she took good care of us.We started out with Sweet Tea for our drinks. My wife and I both went with the Fried Chicken dinner which comes with soup or salad, two sides and cornbread. For sides I had fried corn and mac & cheese and she had mac & cheese and greens. Our daughter got the chicken and waffles.I went with the chicken and dumpling soap and the wife got a salad. The soap was simply delicious. The last time I got it, it was way too peppery. This time it was perfect.Now let me tell you about that chicken. I don't know what they changed but it was better than ever! The skin was nice and crispy and the chicken was hot and tender. The mac & cheese was also better then I remembered. My only complaint was that the fried corn could have been fried for a few more minutes. It wasn't cooked quite long enough for my liking. My wife loved her chicken, greens and mac & cheese as well. And of course our daughter was pleased with her meal as she tried to save half of her food for later but, just couldn't resist finishing it off. My wife and I could only finish half of our food and took the rest home.All and all our food was very, very good and better than ever. I won't wait so long  before we return. I must say after this visit I can honestly say that Carmi Family Restaurant is THE BEST SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT IN PITTSBURGH!!!

BIG news for East Valley Thai Lovers! The daughter the famed Thai Basil (Phoenix location) proprietor is all grown up and has opened up her own shop. Let me tell you, the apple does not fall far from the tree - she is on a solid path to out-do her Dad's culinary greatness in no time. Besides that, Thai Patio is an overdue and  sure to be welcomed surprise to Thai deprived north east Mesa dwellers. I went in for lunch with a group of co-workers today and each of us fell instantly in love. The amazing smells that greet you when you walk through the door are enough to make you want to come back, but the food itself is just epic. One member of our group (I won't name names) actually could not resist finger licking the remaining green curry remnants off his plate. Thai Patio is just that good. Can't wait for the work week to come around again so I can go back and try another of their super yum (and super affordable - $6.95) lunch specials! Yay!

Oh, Dragonfly Cafe, why did you have to be closed for breakfast today?  I was almost at DC's doorstep when I decided to use my Yelp app to check on the cafe's hours, and darn it, it was closed!  So, I ended up at Butters, instead.  I arrived at around 10:30a, a bit of a late start since I had to switch venue plans, but no worries, as I would only have to wait about five minutes before being seated outdoors (and it was such a beautiful morning, too!).  I'd have enjoyed listening to the water fountain across from my table a lot more if traffic sounds didn't intrude, but what can I do?  I quickly got over it.I knew to stay away from the sweeter French toast concoctions, since the pumpkin bread variety I chose for my first visit was too sweet for my taste.  It took me awhile to decide what to have- blueberry pancakes or strawberry cheesecake French toast?  In the end, the write up on the "house strawberry-mascarpone blend" made the decision for me.  Ooh, I was looking forward to this!I wish I had more time to order a cup of coffee from the coffee shop next door, since Butters' drip coffee isn't a fave of mine (or of my Mom's).  I gave it a second try today, and I still don't like it.  The wait for the French toast wasn't long, about ten minutes.  I found my first three or so bites to be delightful, but then I got bored.  I don't think I'd order the dish again, unless I were to share it with someone else knowing that I had another dish to look forward to.  I suppose not all breakfast sweets can be as great as that of the Herb Box's Red velvet pancakes, or even that of Dragonfly Cafe's Bananas foster French toast...  Perhaps I should just stick to the savory items on the menu, such as that salmon/lox omelet we enjoyed on our first trip here.2.5 stars, but the service was OK, so rounding up to 3.  A shout-out for Rafael and the busser today.  You guys did a great job!The Butterfield's brothers have done it again! Butters is everything I look for in a breakfast or lunch spot. It's open and airy, the staff is friendly and fast and the food is fantastic. Oh and did I mention that the patio is dog-friendly? All pluses in my book! Since so many of the reviews are about breakfast, I am going to talk about lunch!Their wraps are amazing. The tortilla bread is soft and fresh and the combinations are mouthwatering. I ordered the Southwest Veggie Wrap with the addition of turkey. The wrap has Black beans, jalapeño cheese, corn, red bell pepper, avocado, scallion, lettuce, tomato & chipotle mayo. Every bite is better then the one before it. For my side, I splurged and ordered the sweet potato fries. Oh sweet happiness, I am so glad I did! The lunch was heartier than I typically opt for in the middle of the day, but when the food is this good, it doesn't quiet matter as much! The server was friendly and efficient. In fact, I had only had 1/3 of my Diet Coke and she brought me out a new one! That's service. This is definitely a eatery that shouldn't be missed.Wow! I absolutely loved eating breakfast here!  The Wild Berry Bliss pancakes were truly amazing! I guess you can't go wrong with fluffy marscapone filled vanilla cream pancakes. We read other Yelp reviews and found this to be a fan favorite! If you ever want a true taste of happiness in your mouth, then I urge you to order this!Irish Benny - For some reason, I've always loved the Irish fare of corned beef hash, but Butters restaurant decided to combine it ingeniously with eggs benedict, and voila! A match made in heaven! The hollandaise sauce covering eggs benedict with corned beef with a side of scalloped breakfast potatoes harmoniously complemented each other well, and I would not hesitate to order this dish again!My hubby ordered the Mexicana omelet and the chorizo had just the right amount of spice. He couldn't stop talking about the right texture and fluffiness of his omelet either. He's always picky about how his omelets are prepared and they really hit the mark here!Don't sweat the wait here, it is far worth it to experience breakfast here! I just wish it was a lot closer or at least had a branch on the northwest side of the valley because we would come here a lot  more if they did!OMG....The Wildberry Bliss Pancakes are absolutely wonderful. The name of the pancakes did not lie! The pancakes are blissfully fluffy and buttery on the outside that just melts in your mouth with all that fruit goodness and mascarpone. These are the best dang pancakes I have ever had!!! If I ever come back to visit AZ I will be coming back here for brunch.Also had the Irish Benny which was delicious as well! It's a eggs benedict (My favorite breakfast item) with corned beef hash. I have never had an eggs benny this way but it was super flavorful. The eggs were poached perfectly. Must get the OJ! Freshly squeezed! Ohh so refreshing!"This vanilla latte is the best coffee I've had all year." It wasn't the artistic foam on top that sold me. The coffee was robust without a hint of bitterness. My table companion's regular cup of coffee was delivered with thick, heavy cream. (So thick watching it pour was entertainment.)I'm sorry I didn't grab the name of our amazing server. But I did very much enjoy breakfast during a late lunch hour on a Sunday. Overwhelmed by the breakfast menu I selected a skillet. Why? They are served with a side of pancakes. (Or toast. But really, if you're going all in - GO ALL IN.)The New Mexico skillet offered a spicy chorizo, avocado, peppers and potatoes. If heat is not your thing perhaps this dish is not for you. I luuuurved it. No need to sprinkle a dot of hot sauce anywhere! Shhh! We used bank parking as it was Sunday. (The signage is clear. But it was Sunday!) This can be a popular joint for good reason.That's one helluva pancake! Dang delicious, melt in your mouth butter! Yummmm not to mention the fresh squeezed orange juice is so amazing! Great service, but expect a wait for a table any day of the week!With a name like this, you know it's got to be good. There are also zero illusions as to what ingredients may be in your delicious breakfast delights. Get out margarine, you don't even go here!This is a favorite breakfast stop for my Phoenix friends, so on my second day in town we came here to partake. The wait was substantial, but we didn't call ahead. The food, it turned out, was well worth the wait. Let's talk for a minute about these life-changing pancakes. You know when places offer "specialty hotcakes" and they're usually regular batter with junk dumped on top? That is not how it's done at Butters. Every pancake has its own signature batter recipe, in all these amazing flavors. Oreo? They bake the oreo into the pancake. They shove cream filling into the pancake. Whatever toppings you want are baked in and sprinkled on top. Like, what is this even? Heaven? That's right. Hashbrowns were sliced up seasoned potatoes cooked to perfection, and the Irish Eggs Benny was such a brilliant idea. Nothing like corn beef on my eggs. Mmm-mmm good! Hollandaise sauce was one of the best I've ever tried, slathered liberally all over the top.  Three cheers for Butters. It's like breakfast at Grandma's house. Don't bring the diabetic grandkids. Portions are huge. Sugar and Butter reign.

Well I can say I am a frequent diner and very happy to say I will continue to eat here again. For a while I had been passing by now wishing i would have taken a chance on dropping in sooner. Groupon is what sold me. I got a killer meal deal which drove me to come in. I am surprised by the reviews as I have not had anything but great experience every time I have visit this location along with quality food. I don't eat Shrimp or Lamb so my reviews are on everything else. The meat is seasoned very well. The salad is amazing. It is not your typical mixed green salad they actually make it pretty loading it with the color veggies that make a mixed green salad taste well. I typically just eat there Champagne Vinegarate but they offer many other salad dressings. Along with the grilled tomato and pita bread make the meal even more enjoyable. My last order was #19 the Chicken Kaboob Meal. This was Grilled Chicken, Rice, Salad, Pita Bread and a Grilled Tomato. Everything was perfect. Fresh flavorful and hot. They cook everything to order so be prepared to wait at least 15 mins but it is worth it for good food.All the staff on deck are welcoming. It is a small little place with plenty of seating. Stop on in grab a drink and be prepared to enjoy.

Restaurant name  Five Guys Burgers and Fries

Review Text :
I -had- to try Five Guys tonite, and well....I'm glad I did, for many reasons.Yes, I'm an In-N-Out gal, there's nothing better than a Double-Double, animal style, no tomato and the fries WELL done. HEAVEN.Pros: Five Guys had -one thing I liked: The cajun seasoning for the fries. Mainly hot paprika, and salt, but it was a very enjoyable flavor. It all went downhill from there, sadly.Cons: A -greasy- burger, no matter how much the propaganga on the walls tells you otherwise. (the little reviews/write-up from mags, all along the walls. The one i'm referring to it the article nearest the bathroom.) The meat has very little flavor. The "juiciness" they brag about was just oozy grease, so be warned! The toppings I chose: grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce, pickles and mustard. I ordered the bacon cheseburger, for those of you curious. The mushrooms? They use -canned- button mushrooms; those godawful slimy, discusting things with little flavor but of what I like to think of as ASS. A BIIIGGG thumbs-down for using such a gross item; it took away from any potential tastiness of the burger, and I ended picking them all off, after 2 bites.The fries: Wow. TOTAL let-down, but for the seasoning. They were soggy, limpy, greasy, PARTIALLY UNCOOKED, and the worst french fries i've EVER had in my life. They also cook them in peanut oil, so they have a unique 'tang' to them that I did not care for in the least.In-N-Out has NOTHING to worry about, this place isn't even -close- to being a contender for a good burger joint!I'm not going to waste time comparing this place to In-n-Out. They are completely different. period. I prefer a bigger meatier burger with mushrooms and bacon but everyone has their own personal preferences. The fries both here and at In-n-out dont' compare to the industrially-engineered unnatural (yet perfect) fries at Mcdonald's, but they are both natural fries and that's the way it is. They aren't great, the fries at in-n-out aren't great. I dont really eat many french fries so I don't care. My burger was perfection (I actually LOVE canned mushrooms so I'm so pumped they give me these included in the price), and the bacon and cheese and meat was all delicious. As an added plus, they have 100% beef Hebrew National hotdogs. You can get cheese melted on them too, or cheese and bacon. I split a yummy cheesy hot dog with my husband in lieu of fries ! So I'm taking a star off because I used their online ordering system so I could skip the lines. I pulled up to the extremely crowded, busy restaurant (they had 17 people working in the kitchen so they definitely weren't understaffed!), and told the order guy "I'm Blair, I have a web order, do you know how I pick that up". He gave me a clueless look then asked the manager. She fiddled around a bit and then said "uh yeah, it's being made". Ok, fair enough. The problem is even though i told him my name and that I ordered online, they only call the orders out by number. After he called "43" a whopping 5x, I asked him "any chance that's for me". He shrugged and handed me the bag- sure enough it said "WEB ORDER - BLAIR" in huge letters on top. Hey clown, when I tell you "I'm blair, waiting for a web order" maybe don't call it out by  number??!?!? How are web orders supposed to know we are order "43"??? Call web orders out by name, idiot!Anyways, despite my little web pick up mishap, the food was delicious and wonderful and I will be returning many times. I'm hoping because I went on their 2nd day of business they will iron out the issues (like internet orders) and when I return this week they will be better.Here we go again. Another overrated burger joint. Five Guys was everything I dislike in a restaurant!!! 5 Gripes about 5 Guys Burger and Fries: 1. The lighting- Did you gain inspiration from an operating room? Who wants to eat under a spotlight? Disturbingly too bright! It actually made me uncomfortable. The music was also way too loud to have a conversation. That's when the peanuts came in handy... 2. The Peanuts- We aren't elephants or at the circus, stadium or bar so I don't get it! Just made me thirsty. 3. The staff- There were entirely too many employees standing behind the counter goofing off and doing nothing. You would think between the six of them as a team they could have managed to get my order right. FAIL. 4. The burger-  A backyard BBQ burger at best. Unoriginal. While that's not a bad thing it was just missing the WOW factor for me. It was good, but nothing I can't recreate in the comfort of my own home. 5. So I lied. I only have 4 gripes about 5 Guys Burgers=) Overall there was nothing appealing at all about this place. The combination of the bright lights, loud music and mediocre food was very disappointing. 5 Guys has officially been voted off of my island and out of the circle of trust. Sashay away.The first time I've heard of this place was in New York. It was my brother's first year of school, and we were talking about In N Out, and his roommate had no idea what we were talking about, so I asked him what their In N Out equivalent is, and he said Five Guys was their east coast burger joint.  Ever since then, I've been waiting to try the so-called best burgers in town!! I didn't have time to actually try it in New York, and I did not have the time to try it in CA either, so my friend and I went on a whim to the Las Vegas location!!We were excited due to long overdue curiosity. So when we finally get in, I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and small cajun fries. When I took my first bite, the first thing that came to mind was In N Out and how the burgers are wayyy better there. The burgers were good, but not great!! This place has just been overly hyped, I believe.What a waste of $20. Seriously?! This place caught my eye because its only 2 miles from my house, and the area really needs a good burger place. In my husband's words, "If you've ever eaten a Wendy's burger, you've already been here". For $5.99 for a burger (yikes!) and $2.99 for fries I was expecting at LEAST In-N-Out or SmashBuger quality. Dry, small, and just....lacking flavor. Wayyyyy too loud music, you literally have to yell to give your order or talk while you sit and eat. Not going to start on their horrible lighting. Surface of the sun anyone?! Their burgers are made to order....right?  You tell them the toppings you want. I'm simple. Ketchup, Mustard, Lettuce. .....and they STILL got it WRONG. With 13 ...YES, THIRTEEN people behind the counter they still managed to mess up my order. When I see the tomatoes, (which I did not order, and made a point to tell them I was allergic to) they roll their eyes, take 10 mins to remake it, without an apology. $20 for 2 burgers and 1 Fry and 1 Small Drink is not bad if it was AMAZING or in a nice restaurant, but for a fast food type of place, they need In-N-Out prices. No Military Discount either :(I don't understand how this place is in business. I heard all the hype and we tried it last week for the first time. Well, it will be our last time. It was so over priced! for 2 burgers, drinks and fries it was almost $25! They didn't even get my order right. They seem like a wanna be In-N-Out Burger. I don't know what the hype is about this place   but the West Coast knows not good but great burgers and I don't see this place cutting it for much longer. I don't even recommend giving it a try just go across the street to In-N-Out where you will get great tasting fresh food on the cheap!good burgers and fries with generous portions!Came to this location for the first time this afternoon. I was impressed ,nice red,white, and black decor.Food was about $20.94 ,for 2 Burgers, one fry and one drink.We ate it there,but outside. It was a beautiful day, so good to sit outside.They even provide Peanuts on the table so while you are waiting for your food to be cooked you can enjoy cracking peanuts and eating them. Bathrooms were nice and clean, as I went to wash my hands before I ate.Place was clean, even outside.Food was fantastic!  the bun should be toasted it would not fall apart so easily.Free refills on drinks. Their drink machine is very different in looks, but works great!Fries were fantastic, we were going to get 2 but, the girl working said one was enough for 2 people. It was the regular size and it was enough for 2.We enjoyed it and will go back again for sure.This is the best burger I've had for under $10.I think In N Out is one of the most overrated things in life.  I don't get it!  My wife loves it and could eat there twice a week no problem and I've had my fair share of bites.  I just don't see what the hype is about.  No doubt the price is better along with their fries but I'm not coming here for that.In my world, a great burger always has a ton of toppings and ordering your burger "all the way" is the only way to go.  These patties are super juicy and taste fantastic.  I also love the melty, oozy greatness of the cheese is put in between the 2 patties.  On a side note, the soda fountain machine is tremendous.  It's truly straight out of a Jetsons (automatically dating myself bigtime!) episode.  I've never had that many choices for beverages at a burger joint with quite a few flavors I've never seen like raspberry diet coke.  Now I have 2 unhealthy vices that I might have to indulge in once a month.  This and Nothing Bundt Cakes!Five Guys Burgers and FriesFive Guys Burgers and Fries Five Guys Burgers and FriesTry saying that three times really fast. It just rolls of the tongue. I have always admired this place since my days in Florida. Honestly the only thing that I would change is the noise level. The burgers are cooked in 100% pure peanut oil. The ground beef taste fresh as well. They have a plethora of peanuts in multiple places. At the entrance and near the cashier looks like they have stacks and stacks everywhere, plus they are free.Over all the burger was very good. Grade  A The employees are super friendly.I was truly excited to try Five Guys because of all the wonderful things I've heard and basically, the hype around it. My brother and I ventured one afternoon and I was less than pleased. I did enjoy the fact that everyone was extremely friendly and not being charged for extra patties! Plus, the restaurant itself is nice and I was mesmerized by the high-tech soda machine (I wish I were able to utilize it, but no soda for me!). Our cashier, also really nice and friendly, was clueless about their ingredients! Their menu states one of the toppings to be "green peppers" and since I was unfamiliar with their burgers, I asked her what type of green peppers the menu was referring. Confusion. I continued, "Are they green BELL peppers, green CHILI peppers..?" The cashier responded, "Oh yeah, they're peppers, but, uh, I don't think they're spicy." All right...so I thought, okay some roasted or marinated green peppers? That sounds good on a burger. So I ordered two patties with green peppers, onions, lettuce, and tomato. My brother and I shared regular fries and cajun fries.You can imagine my disappointment when I opened my wrapper and realized that my first assumption of green bell peppers was right, but the cashier failed, not only to acknowledge that thought, but told me otherwise. How can you not know that your restaurant serves green bell peppers?? I amounted this to, hopefully, ignorance. It didn't add to a good experience for me because had I known they were bell peppers, I wouldn't have ordered it. Who wants raw bell peppers on their burger? It was so awkward. Plus, my burger was absolutely flavorless. I actually had to season my own burger with salt and pepper. I probably should have ordered cheese and condiments, but a good burger shouldn't have to rely on those accompaniments. The burger was tender and cooked well though. The fries were also good. I love handcut fries, so this was no exception. The cajun fries though, I will pass. I love cajun seasoning, but I felt like I was inside their shaker of cajun. It was SO overwhelming that it took away from the pleasantry of the fries.I don't know; my brother really enjoyed his burger and I take partial blame for not ordering my burger with cheese and other condiments to add flavor (I was trying to be healthier), but the burger shouldn't be flavorless alone! The fries are really great though (without the cajun drowning). So, I may take another stab at Five Guys - get a completely different burger and enjoy the fries..we'll see.

Last night I was in the mood for a burger, but wanted to try someplace different.  Did a search on yelp, and found that Two Hippies just opened a location here in my hood!  I've heard such good things about them from thier Phoenix location that I had to give them a try.The place is small, but warmly decorated hippie style.  Family friendly, with plenty of games on the tables for adults and kids to play.  They have a nice menu of Breakfast items, Tacos, burgers and a few homemade desserts as well.The gal at the counter was wonderful! So friendly and helpful.  She checked on me to make sure my food was good throughout the meal.  I went with a hamburger, fries and a drink.  They seem to have an awesome lemonade selection here, but I stuck with a Sprite myself.I will be back in the future, as i was happy overall with the food and experience here.  Next time I will probably try the tacos.

Restaurant name  The Great Greek
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Who needs a Fat or Mad Greek when you can have a Great Greek. The Great Greek really does hit the nail on the head. What was so great about my meal? Everything, start to finish. It was a completely enjoyable experience. Dinner with fellow Yelpers, Judd and Lynn L., put this place on my bookmarks and it was about time to pay them a visit. With two other Greek food lovers in toe, we came out to try as much as possible. One Mezze Plate, Two Beef Slouvaki Plates, two fountain drink, one bottled water, Rice Pudding, a Baklava, and two secret Greek Coffees (explanation later on) cost a little under $50. There was even left over after I tried to cram as much in as possible. As I write, I lay in bed in a semi-comatose state. The Mezze Plate is a combination of vegetarian favorites; spanakopita, two dolmas, hummus, pita bread, tsaziki sauce, and two falafels. The puffed pastry was flaky, buttery, and filled with spinach and cheese. The falafels were crispy on the outside and light inside creating the perfect combination. The Slouvaki Plate boasted the most tender and juicy beef. They were drool worthy at medium rare and the juices oozed into the rice. Taste bud overload! With the second plate there is an option to pick between three different sides; rice, fries, and Greek salad. The gentleman behind the register gave us all salads on top of one rice and one order fries. The guest service is amazingly friendly. We were continuously checked upon during dinner as well. After our meal, one of my friends pushed me to ask about coffee. It is not listed on the menu, but it could not hurt to ask. The same guy who took our order made a joke that it was on their secret menu and it was no problem to make. Now to desserts! The Rice Pudding is thick and rich. The Baklava had great depth and not too sweet. They are definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in town. On the way out, we even got a warm farewell. Thorough is a good way to describe the service.I came late to the party because I didn't know Gyros could be this good!!I was so used to going to that other Gyro place on Eastern, but now I realized I settled for mediocre food there.Well Thank you Great Greek and my Yelpers for opening my eyes to what a Gyro should be. The presentation was wrapped in a pretty and neat package.Tender seasoned meat sliced perfect, with a tzatziki sauce that actually has taste (I always thought tzatziki was a bland yogurt sauce) and the freshest feta cheese, lettuce & tomato. Nice touch with the pepperocini on top to add a little zing. Bite then drizzle juice on the gyro. The bread was soft and allowed the gyro meat to shine without getting in the way. The perfect vessle to hold this delicious creation.OPA!! I can't wait to come back!Sadly, my knowledge of Greek food comes from My Big Fat Greek Wedding and a killer hangover from a few too many shots of cheap ouzo and pine sap Retsina to wash down "Greek" takeout in Hawaii. With those credentials to back me, here goes.  The Great Greek makes very good, tasty Greek food.  Simply put, proteins are juicy and properly cooked, breads are fresh, everything is flavored with fresh herbs and well seasoned.  Dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with rice dill and other herbs) a real surprise.  Dense, moist and herbaceous, the leaves so tender you can eat them.Lamb and beef gyro and grilled chicken gyro are real standout.  Juicy, well seasoned, sliced beef and lamb or chunks of chicken , atop simple veg, bathed in a zesty tzaziki, piled with a tart goat milk ricotta all enveloped by a fresh, warm, fluffy pita.Grilled steak souvlaki, no complaints.  Deeply flavored, juicy tenderloin on skewers over a fluffy rice pilaf.  A squeeze of fresh lemon to brighten up the dish.   Done.  Finally, desert; baklava.  What's not to love, flaky filo, butter, sugar, walnuts, cinnamon all bathed in honey.Friendly counter service.  Clean dining area.  Reasonable prices.Poker Pro Tip:  Give a bud who lives in the area a ride to the WSOP. On the way stop for lunch.  For days after "hey, you want me to stop at that Greek place and get you something?"  Heck yeah!Ponder if you must, is the food so good because it's different from our norm or is it the difference from its norm that makes it delicious?  It's all Greek to me.There are a lot of good Greek restaurants in Henderson.  From my house to this place is like climbing Mt. Olympus but it's soooo worth the drive.  Holy Michael Bolton, this is my favorite Greek restaurant in all the land!  It's a small but very clean restaurant.  This may be irrelevant to most people but for somebody who freaks out a lot when the battery on my phone is less than 90%,  the high top tables against the wall with outlets was a great plus! Oh yeah, the service is great too.  It's quick, to-go orders are quicker and phone-in orders are quickest.The steak souvlaki is tender and has great flavor.  It comes with Greek salad and you can get it with either rice pilaf or fries.  What I always get is the beef and lamb gyro and feta fries.  Soft and warm pita bread hugging slices of meat topped with melted feta cheese and tzatziki...underneath lettuce, tomatoes and red onions.  It's heavy yet portable and non-messy.  I can eat their gyro hot or cold.  Raw onions give me a headache but theirs is sliced rather than chopped so it's easy for me to just pick them out.  The feta fries are amazing.  Each fry is lightly breaded for that extra crisp.  Hot fries topped with feta cheese = cheesy goodness!"I'll be there someday, I can go the distanceI will find my way, if I can be strongI know ev'ry mile, will be worth my whileWhen I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong" - Michael BoltonI don't come to this side of town often, but as soon as I decided to meet my friend with the big fat greek appetite I knew we would be coming here.  Great Greek is certainly where it's at for gyros! A hearty portion of wonderfully flavored beef/lamb meat is sliced thick and surrounded by a warm fluffy pita (the kind you'd feel comfortable resting your head upon if you weren't ready to devour it) in this truly special gyro!  I'm not sure if I would bestow it with the title of best gyro in the valley, but it is certainly one of the best. ... add some Feta Fries and a Greek Salad if you brought your beast appetite... or just want to save some for later because both are great options here. I tried some of my friends Avgolemono Soup...another great addition!I haven't had the opportunity to try any of their other dishes, but I would order whatever I was in the mood for with confidence based on the quality of what I had.Came here for dinner the other night and I was glad to finally check this place out. Inside isn't huge, but it was clean and there was a girl constantly cleaning tables and the floor under them. The woman at the counter who took our order was nice and gave us a number to put on the table. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out, but the place was busy and they claimed to be making everything fresh so I didn't mind.I ordered a side "Classic Greek Salad" priced at $4.95 with house made Greek vinaigrette. The salad had crisp greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, kalamata olives (has pits...be careful!) and feta cheese. The salad tasted fresh and the dressing was delicious. The salad also came with some grilled pita bread that I put some cucumber and tomato on and folded it up to grub on. Yum! Hubby got a burger (said the patty seemed frozen) and made it a combo with "Feta Fries" for us to share. The fries were excellent! Especially dipped in some of their tzaziki. I will be back to try a gyro and baklava. They also have tables outside if eating inside isn't your thing or you can call ahead and place your order to-go. Ask about their family meal deals, they have a couple to choose from.This place should be renamed "cucumber heaven" in my opinion lol. I haven't had this type of food before so when I saw a lot of things with cucumber and tzaziki onthe menu I knew my order would be customised. The lady who took my order seemed friendly but she might need a q-tip because my order was eff-ed up. I ordered the Athenian Burger and when the lady said it had the tomatoes, salad, and cheese would all be mixed together in tzaziki I told her to leave all of that salad stuff off and just put feta cheese on my burger. The wait for my burger was long and that was okay but when you bring me a burger that is obviously a frozen patty and put the salad on it that I asked you to leave off something is wrong. I did say something but it would have been a 15 minute wait for a new burger so I just said I would take the salad mixture off of my burger and deal with it. The burger was terrible. Then I tried the Feta Fries that I ordered and hot damn they were good! The fries were great but the gross burger and my lack of taste for cucumbers will not bring me back here.It was my turn to pick lunch and The Great Greek had been on my bookmarks for a long time.  The location is small inside and seemed to be busy the entire time we were there.  There is also patio seating that will accommodate once the weather warms up a bit.  I had excellent service.  The gentleman helping us was very helpful since we told him it was our first time in.  I had ordered the grilled garlic shrimp plate.  It was accompanied with feta fries and pita bread.   Delicious!  There were 2 skewers of shrimp with 4 on each.   This was definitely plenty to fill my stomach.  Not to mention the outstanding fries.  This was my first time having these and I love feta cheese.  Yum.   My plate also came with a side salad which I didn't finish.  The dressing was a little bit much and overpowering.  But overall it was great.   I had asked the gentlemen if they had lemon potatoes since they weren't on the menu.   They do!  You just have to ask them to make them.  I might just have to go back soon to try those out! So the business name fits the review - Great Greek! Opa!I really don't know why I see so many 5 star reviews, where are people's taste buds? I think its because it's the most decent "Greek" you can find in Henderson. I got suckered into the hype but I have had way better. I called in an order for pick-up. The guy put me on hold but I hung up after hearing him chat the whole time with another customer about irrelevant stuff. Second time I called the guy took my order and I liked how fast he turned around my order, said it would be ready in 15 minutes. The restaurant is a bit small but it's really cute. It has an outdoor seating area with shades and a water fountain. The inside looks very clean and organized. I ordered two gyro sandwiches and a combo which comes drink and fries. The guy that took my order was a lot nicer in person and very cute I must say. When I got home I chowed down and it was satisfying but not out of this world. The amount of meat was good, how gyros should be, but it was not that marinated it was bland. The tzatziki sauce did not taste much like cucumber or the fresh dill it's described as but it had a lot of feta which made it taste better. The fries were ok.I want to give the greek bowl a chance. Place is convenient for Hendersonians but I rather drive and use my gas tank to Las Vegas and go to The Fat Greek on the corner of Flamingo and Decatur. My review is from 2011, check it out but my thoughts have not changed. Maybe I held my standards high for this place in comparison but I'll update this review if my mind changes.We came on a Thursday for lunch and ordered1. Athenian burger combo with fries, 7.50+2.95- Grilled Angus Beef, Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions, Feta Cheese, Tzaziki2. Great Greek gyro combo with rice, 7.95+2.95- Chicken or Lamb. Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions, Feta Cheese, Tzazikifor $23.08Side choices include: French Fries, Rice, Greek Salad, Avolemono Soup,Feta Fries (50c more)- Nice patio seating. Food delivered to us. - Wait time around 15 min. Fast food style but wait time like a dine in restaurant.- Big portioned burger. Fresh and crispy fries. - Packed Gyro. Lame rice.- Good taste. A bit pricey for what it's worth. Worth it for 1 try. - Hard to compete when there are so many around for about the same taste with coupons for cheaper. - Uncertain if I'd return.Two weeks ago on Tuesday evening 10/27th, my son and I participated in a search and rescue mission for the best gyros in Henderson. We may have found the place!The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill is located south of Sunset Station on Warm Springs at the corner of Julia Street, 1 block east of Stephanie.3 words describe this restaurant:*simply.**delicious.***Greek.Elegant outdoor patio dining was packed with people, so we went inside and ordered at the counter and sat down with our #10 sign awaiting our food that came out within 15 minutes or less. The Great Greek was definitely worth waiting for. This is certainly not fast food, although takeout and catering is available from this fine establishment.The seating area inside is about the size of a 2 car garage or 400SF and does not feel small at all. This A Graded restaurant has large mirrors intermittently placed along one entire wall that gives the illusion of more open space, very smart decorating idea!*Flowers and wall photos of Greece!**Pretty sounding Greek background music!***Cute little Greek statue on the front counter next to the Parthenon.****Wine offered by the glass or by the bottle. We enjoyed our sodas w/ Free refills! We also enjoyed our gyros, salad and baklava! Quite possibly the best gyros in Henderson, maybe even the Las Vegas Valley. The pita bread was soft, warm and fresh out of the oven, embracing a perfectly prepared combination of savory beef and lamb, mixed with fresh tomatoes, red onions and flavorful tzatziki sauce. Good size traditional gyro for $6.95.The $11.95 gyro plate offered a generous portion of tender sliced gyro on pita with a choice of rice pilaf or french fries. My son chose the french fries and they were also delicious. I want to come back and try their rice pilaf!I devoured their large classic Greek salad containing crisp Romaine hearts, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, Kalamata olives (watch the pits), Greek Feta, and a variety of fresh herbs. Decent size portion (large) at $7.95.No Great Greek restaurant patron should ever leave without trying their baklava.....amazingly delicious! Possibly the best I ever had besides homemade from Greek friends. This classic Greek dessert had layers of filo dough, walnuts and honey syrup. See photo below!  Honestly, I would come here for any of the above....a single trip in just for the gyro, just for the gyro plate, just for the Greek salad, just for the baklava......I also would come in here just to admire the very friendly ladies that work here who are very service oriented asking "How is everything?", "Can I get you anything?", Thank you for coming in!", "Please come back again!", etc. We will return soon for more delicious food and friendly hospitality :-)See 10 photos below...YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #244It's almost comical how often I've eaten their food without actually making a visit. Now that I have, it's time to review.My friend and I were going to try another Greek restaurant closer to my place, but they had already closed on Christmas Eve. Luckily, we had a plan B that was still open: Yelp and Las Vegas Weekly "Best of Las Vegas" darling The Great Greek.It's tougher than expected to reach it because whoever designed the plaza inexplicably didn't add enough entrances or even paths. Even though you can see the restaurant from Warm Springs, you'll have to make several turns to arrive at the parking area. It's welcoming enough once you finally enter, with indoor seating for around 20 and a TV with ESPNEWS in HD.The Great Greek Gyro ($7.95) with a beef and lamb mixture (or chicken if you really, truly must) is a solid lunch option. In addition to the tomatoes, red onions, and tzatziki of the "Traditional Gyro" ($6.95), this pita comes with lettuce and feta. I had experienced this in an assemble-it-yourself form many times with trays ordered for group events, and while it was certainly fresher and warmer at the restaurant, it still didn't truly tantalize my taste buds.That said, it's at least on par with if not better than any other recent gyro that I've experienced. And it's really cool that they cut it in advance per request so that I could share it with a friend.I also split one of the "traditional plate" menu items. The Grilled Garlic Shrimp ($12.95) has two skewers of four marinated shrimp a piece. The shrimp was cooked properly and had that juicy bite to it. I can't say that the stated garlic, and oregano were particularly prominent flavors, but I liked squeezing the lemon wedge for acidity. The pita was good, the tzatziki was fine, but... the fries.Specifically, the feta fries, which I think was a slight upcharge (maybe I'll back-calculate from credit card records) from the regular fries. But it was worth it for the rich feta and its creamier partner in crime. Sure, the fries alone are the fairly thick, floured kind that I enjoy the most, but do the feta fries if you can.There was also a small salad included in the plate, with a simple vinaigrette not really contributing as much as that ever-present feta. It's cool though. I mean, what are you doing here anyway if you don't like feta?I'll probably be back, but not in a huge hurry or anything. My first visit bore out my past perceptions that the food is really solid, but not the be-all and end-all of Greek cuisine.

Restaurant name  Kyara Japanese Tapas
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Excitement soon turned to disappointment after the first bite.  Everything we tried seemed more middle of the road flavor and we tried a lot of stuff.  Perhaps, I'm comparing the "wow" factor that I get from Ichiza, but Kyara isn't there, yet.  The only wow items were actually the two desserts.What we ate....1.  Daikon Salad - visually appealing but just tasted like it was dunked in regular soy sauce.2.  Maguro and Ume Madai sashimi - Not so fresh3.Maguro Yukke - Tasty because it was slathered with spicy ponzu concoction4.  Albacore w/Drew Special - Similar dish from what Naked Fish has to offer over there.  It has ponzu and jalapeno.  One of the better tasting dishes, but only because you can't go wrong with ponzu5.  (Sunomono) Abalone sashimi - fresh, but bad choice on our part.  Abalone sashimi is kinda crunchy.. hmmmm6.  Gyutan (beef tongue) - just a tad too salty7.  Beef tataki - ponzu sauce to save the day again8.  Spicy tuna and rice crackers - enjoyable crunchy texture with spicy/sweet tuna9.  Dashi Maki Tamago Yaki - Sweet egg omelet, meh10.  Age nasu - fried eggplant, meh11.  Deep fried skewered fish - fluffy fish, but i'm not sure about the cheese imbeded with it.DESSERT... wowsers1.  Vanilla Tofu Mousse - The tofu was so smooth and creamy and wasn't too sweet.  perfect compliment with the raspberry sorbet2.  Chocolate Fondant (a.k.a. Chocolate souffle) - The server failed to mention during the meal that this particular dessert takes 10-15 minutes to make.  Definitely remember to order before you're done with your main meal if you don't want to wait.  .... but.... WORTH THE WAIT!!  This rivals the best souffles out there!   Ooey gooey warm and sweet.Conclusion:  Through so many dishes, I couldn't help but feel that there was something missing.  I won't give up, yet, Kyara.  I know that you're trying to break out and do something different than your sister Naked Fish.  I hope you shine soon.Now this was the visit I was wanting from my previous visit.  Flavors were delicate, yummy and textures were there!  For the first time, I thought that the bomb items would naturally come from the "special" menu, but this time, we went with the gut feeling and ordered more instinctively from the main menu.  This time is was truly good.Bonus appetizer:*Deep fried yamaimo (Mountain Potato) - It was like eating delicate fries.  The potato had tempura batter and very lightly salted.  Crispy and delicious!*Albacore w/Drew Special and Tuna Carpaccio- I'm going to group this dish with the Tuna Carpaccio in terms of flavor.  Both had tangy sauce that complimented the tuna.                                *Agedashi Tofu - Kyara makes a slighty darker and saltier sauce, but I appreciated the delicately fried tofu cubes.*Eggplant Steak - This was on the saltier side, but I enjoyed it overall*Butabara - Bacon slices on a stick!!!!  Being the piggies that we are, we ordered one order each of the salt and soy sauce/terikyaki-ish versions.  I'm a lover of most things greasy and bacon. This was a winner and the soy sauce version was the overall winner of the two.*Kaisen Chawanmushi (steamed egg custard with seafood) - This was probably our favorite of the evening.  The steamed egg custard was perfectly salty infused with the essences of the seafood within it.  Slurped it all up.*Chicken Garlic Ponzu - This is basically a super tender pice of chicken cutlet with my fav flavors of garlic and ponzu.*Tori Meshi - soboro (seasoned ground chicken) with rice, hearty rice and seasoned chicken.  Good!Conclusion:  I am warming up to Kyara.  It's definitely not Raku caliber Japanese tapas, but it will do if you forget to make a reservation for Raku.With the sudden and sad departure of SHIN Yakitori House in the Spring Valley area, Kyara comes as a welcome addition in this neighborhood.Call it a cross between Ichiza and Raku, this town has plenty of room for another izakaya type of establishment and many hungry customers waiting in the wings.Kyara is located in an unassuming and relatively quiet area along Jones and Sunset next to a Tropical Smoothie Cafe.  The mood is set when you enter what feels like a upscale restaurant.  Chaos is not what this place is about.There are plenty of counter seats where you can watch the kitchen in action, but with the Baby in tow, we sat at a table. The restaurant is set up in sections making private parties a great possibility.Once we were seated, there was a slight lapse where we thought we had been forgotten. Instead, they were deep frying a fresh taste of their mountain potato to get your taste buds working.The menu is easily broken up with their daily specials being the star. It's very much a revolving menu as items available two months ago aren't offered now.Our dinner items:* Deep fried Yamaimo - This mountain potato was lightly fried with a sprinkling of furikake.  The delicate flavor surprisingly impressed us and had us wanting more of this complimentary offering.  As someone asked, was it gooey...and not at all!* Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad ($7.50) - Five slices of salmon along with greens makes this a tasty dish.  Assembled quite simply but satisfyingly.* Albacore Jalapeno ($7.50) - Seven slices of albacore that had a sauce that we enjoyed.* Spicy Tuna Dip ($5) - A generous ball of spicy tuna alongside crispy rice crackers.  We spread the tuna onto the cracker and enjoyed the crunch along with the spice.* Agedashi Tofu ($4.30) - Good, but not quite my favorite although I still enjoyed it.* Negi Ma ($1.90) - The chicken and green onion we chose to have sauce on it, our mistake.  Skip the sauce next time.* Enoki Bacon ($2.30) - Anything wrapped in bacon tastes good!* Kawa ($2.20) - Grilled chicken skin...a dash of salt and togorashi is all you need.* Butabara ($2.20) The pork belly was a rather disappointing since it was dried out and not fatty enough for me. * Daikon Salad ($4.20) - I'm not usually a fan of daikon salad but the simple additions to their version makes it a nice and subtle dish.* Gyutan ($5.50) - The beef tongue was good, but not as tender as I would have hoped.* Kaisen Chawanmushi ($5) - Their version of a steamed custard was the real winner of the night.  It was super super smooth and luxurious and probably among the best chawanmushis I have ever experienced.  It also came with a decent amount of seafood inside and the Husband and I were both thoroughly impressed.  Worth getting your own and not sharing.* Koro Steak ($9.50) - We were told it was quite tender and that is the very truth.  We both loved the steak, but could have done without the beansprouts...something else would have been better.* Soft Shell Crab Appetizer ($5.80) - My only real complaint was that it lacked something...a dipping sauce of maybe ponzu, tempura sauce, or Japanese mayo would have been nice.  But then again, maybe that's how I usually get it elsewhere and that's how I'm used to having it.* Tofu Mousse ($4.80) "Homemade Vanilla Tofu Mousse" - We're all about homemade tofu and definitely wanted to try their sweet version.  It was accompanied by a raspberry(?) sorbet-like granita that could have been broken down a bit more.  It arrived in chunks that made it   difficult to get into with the wooden spoons provided.  Nonetheless, we still enjoyed this sweet ending to our dinner.  Overall, it was a lovely Mother's Day dinner.  Service was polite and what you would expect from a real Japanese restaurant.  We were impressed by the number of Japanese diners there along with the families as well.  It brings a different ambiance and we liked it.  There are a few things that are a bit more costly than what I'd expect, so be prepared.  We'll be going back again to see what other specials come up!* * Update! We returned on 06.24.  Additional items we tried included:* Beef Tataki ($9.50) - * Homemade Tofu ($4.80) - We love the simplicity of homemade tofu.  Here it is accompanied with wasabi, bonito shavings, finely grated ginger, and scallions.* Tofu Miso Kushi ($1.50) - Three pieces on a skewer, grilled with some miso sauce.  Simple and tasty.* Wakasagi Age "Deep Fried Surf Smelt" ($4.50) * Ayu Shio Yaki "Grilled seasonal sweet fish from Japan" ($9.50) * Hirame Carpaccio "Halibut - South Korea" ($6.50)* Gyu Shabu Salad "Sliced Beef & Spinach" ($6.50)* Chocolate Fondant "Homemade Chocolate Fondant with Vanilla Ice Cream" ($6.50)We were offered a different complimentary taster, but we craved the deep fried yamaimo.  They were nice enough to fry us up a batch!  Love it! Dessert was free because it was the Husband's birthday! 4.5 stars from 4 stars!Without ever having been to Ichiza or Raku I can't say where Kyara fits in the hierarchy of Las Vegas izakayas. But, I can tell you that I'm a fan. Not only is the food delicious, but the layout of the restaurant is inviting yet intimate, with it's small, separate dining areas surrounding its open kitchen. The look of the place is that of a modern japanese motif without being heavyhanded and over-adorned with unnecessary flair.But, what you really want to hear about is the food, right? Here are the hits and misses that we ordered:HITS:+ Maguro carpaccio ($7.50) - brilliant, brightly colored tuna, thinly sliced. Wonderful flavors. So good we had a second order. Loved the garlic chips atop each slice of fish.+ Albacore with jalapeno ($7.50) - delicious, fresh. Another dish we had to order seconds of.+ Veggie spring rolls ($2.50) - light, crispy, not the largest spring rolls, but delicious nontheless+ Veggie tempura mix ($4.50)+ Cheese tempura ($6.50) - three slices of fairly mild cheeses (mozzarella, havarti, brie) accompanied by a fig jam. I liked it but it's a difficult dish to share if you want to split each piece of cheese.Misses: - Spicy tuna dip with rice crackers ($5) - not my favorite. I wasn't a fan of the paste-like texture of the tuna and it had little heat to it.- Pork belly ($2.20) - 3 per skewer. They were ok, but after having the pork belly at Sushi House Goyemon a couple days earlier I was disappointed. The biggest turnoff was the tiny bits of cartilage in two of the pieces of pork.I thought everything was reasonably priced. Expect to pay anywhere from $20-40 per person depending on how hungry you are. And, they have some good wines by the glass for around $5. That's tough to beat in this town. Good food + good prices = I'll be back often.If you want to travel in style, hang out with royalty!My last minute Kyara UYE gave me the opportunity to dine with Kyara's duchess, Debbie N.  We sat at the bar, where we could see a clean and active kitchen, and a nice view of the small establishment.  While waiting for Debbie I ordered "iced green tea" and ended up with a can of  green tea over ice - fine, but probably not worth $2.50.  The rest of the experience was well worth the cost, which was very fair for what we ate!We started off by ordering homemade tofu, which I was hopeful for after reading David S.'s review, but they were out.  We got the rice crackers with kabocha dip.  It was sweet and velvety.  Debbie sensed a vanilla flavor, and it was topped with chopped peanuts.  Next, the agedashi nasu (eggplant) topped with shishito pepper.  I loved the broth, and the eggplant was only lightly fried.  The broth was so flavorful!Then, the magical yuzu chili salmon.  Delicious!  Debbie N. loves salmon so I made sure she got more, and I ate more of the greens in the yuzu dressing.  Delightful!  Then my pick, the seared mackerel with ginger, daikon and ponzu.  It had a grill/smoky flavor but yet the perfect cross between firm and delicate texture that I love about mackerel.  This was a winner and the portion was very generous.  The man next to us was the Kaeru Kid, a west-coast travel writer who had been all over the world.  He let us sample his tofu steak with bean sprout dish, and it was hearty!!!Debbie N. said I must try the kaisen chawanmushi since I never had it.  It was so delicious!  It had a sort of egg-drop flavor to me, but the texture was unique and it was so full of seafood - bay scallops, shrimp, kamaboko fish cake, oyster or mussel, calamari...wow!We decided to get one more dish.  Our waitress had sang the praises of the beef tongue stew and said it was on special tonight, so we opted for it...only to find out it was sold out too!!!  Two strikeouts for us.  We decided to get the soft shell crab appetizer and it came with ponzu.  We missed Teri C. here by 4 hours apparently, and Debbie mentioned how the restaurant must pay attention to reviews and make changes (like adding a sauce to the crab as Teri C. suggested).  Two of the chefs behind the counter recognized Debbie and greeted her personally.  I like the atmosphere, the prices are very reasonable, and there are a lot of unique options to try.  We didn't try any skewers this trip, so I need to return for some of those.  We leisurely dined and relaxed for two hours, and our waitress brought me water when my can of tea ran out.  Good service, lots of yelling irrashaimase and gozaimas as people are in and out, and the food speaks for itself!By far the nicest setting for an izakaya in town. So cool how everything is set up. We took a couple of seats at the bar to watch the chefs do their magic while we ate.Definitely over-ordered based on our initial excitement over the menu choices and prices but no big deal. Stand outs included the best chawamushi in LV, yuzu chili salmon and grilled squid. The only thing we weren't into was the ika no shiokara (fermented squid guts). I never liked that dish but even my Japanese wife who normally likes it thought it was too creamy and a bit off. Aside from that, the whole dining experience was great. The staff was super friendly, very helpful and accommodating. Just what you'd expect from a high end izakaya!**Summary**       - Flavor - Everything we had was either good or great. It was definitely a treat for the taste buds.       - Authentic - From the decor to the staff to the food, this is truly an authentic Japanese Izakaya place.       - Skewers - The sauce they use for the skewers is phenomenal. If you sit at the bar you can see them watch over the skewers the whole time. They take care to cook them perfectly.       - Value - You'll probably pay more here than getting a bento box elsewhere, but the portion size and flavor is well worth the price.       - Ichiza - I finally found a place closer to my house that's like Ichiza but better. Now, if only they had honey toast, I'd never have to go to Ichiza again.**Appetizers**       - $7.50 Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad - Five pieces of slightly seared salmon with arugula on the side. Salmon was fresh, texture was great, and the sauce gave it a little kick. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=IoNSnP5EADvdByH5lc0Okg).       - $3.50 Garlic Potato - An interesting dish. Simple and good (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=5SVXlhiZh5wVmGDmIkbIQw).       - $3.80 Ikageso - Fried squid legs. If you like squid, it's pretty good. If you're expecting calamari, you might be disappointed.       - $5.50 Gyutan - 6 thin slices of beef tongue. It's ok, but a little pricy for the amount you get (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=KTEPF6K1bZ2ettteQdBPug).**Skewers**       - $1.90 Shoniku - Chicken thigh & leg skewer. The sauce they use for this was awesome. A must try (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=NEgW0jgTSRdEKcLsyZaiaw).       - $1.90 Negi Ma - Chicken with onion skewer. I preferred the shoniku (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=XEcS2FIyQQh0N-oZ0iJQbw).       - $2.20 Butabara - Pork belly. It has just the right amount of pork to fat ratio.       - $1.90 Sunagimo - Chicken Gizzard skewer. The gf said this was good. I don't really like gizzards.**Mini Meals**       - $5.00 Tori Meshi - Seasoned ground chicken on rice. Wasn't enough chicken. Nothing special.       - $6.50 Maguro Zuke Don - Marinated tuna and rice. The marinade on the pieces of tuna sashimi was fantastic. You get about 7 pieces. They give you too much rice though.       - $3.50 Mini Udon - A pretty decent sized portion for the price. The udon broth is better than most places (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=RMx6mzBzs9eaE6ljMWJEPQ).       - $9.50 Koro Steak - A hefty portion of bite sized steak (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=2y854wHXS3PICcqGLHVOcA).**Misc**       - $5.00 Chawan Mushi - Steamed egg custard (with shrimp, scallops, squid, and clams). It's pretty hard to find in Vegas. The only other place in Vegas I've seen it is at Ichiza. The one they serve here is better and they put a lot more seafood in it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=WEMCUr8IfnhZjTl91hYI-Q).       - $6.50 Yamaimo Teppan - I expected deep fried potatoes and got potato paste. Needless to say, it wasn't good and pretty salty.       - $6.50 Chocolate Fondant - Chocolate Souffle with a size of ice cream. Takes 15 minutes to make and is well worth it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=nmJILyCSEzADl7xQzVmmEA).**Recommendations**       - I'd recommend this place for anyone looking to treat themselves to some delicious non-sushi Japanese.It took a few visits, but once Kyara grew on me, it's become a favorite!  Every time I eat here I try something new that I really enjoy.  Which is more than I can say about that other place that starts with an "I."  In-N-Out?  Island Style?  Anyways.  Point is, it's rare to visit a place multiple times and discover a great dish during each visit.  So what are the hits at Kyara?Curry rice with Chicken Katsu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=87dospmcjfGzayBR-YnztQ): This is one of the lunch specials, and makes me wish I worked nearby!  The curry has a great balance of heat and flavor, while the katsu is lightly breaded and not burnt at all.  Highly recommended if you're in the area.Garlic Chicken Ponzu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=80gTRDZO6f20tLoWDYQY7w): At $5.80, this is a great portion for a tapas place if you ask me.  Garlic is delicious, ponzu is delicious, put them together and it's double delicious.Aburi Shime Saba: Seared Mackerel with yuzu ponzu sauce.  Mmm mmm good!  You get a good serving of mackerel with this dish.  It's also very lightly seared.  Like maybe the chef prepared the dish within view of a flame; that lightly seared.Tsukune: Ground Chicken and pork skewer.  Tasty and freshly prepared.  A bit crisp on the outside with a hot and juicy interior.  Service here has been consistently good, along with food quality.  If you're headed to Kyara, be sure to invite me along!Excellent little tucked away corner of Japanese styled paradise. The bill tends to add up as you're tempted by low prices and a variety of tasty treats so be sure to take advantage of any specials or deals they have going on. Aburi Shime SabaSeared Mackerel with yuzu ponzu sauce  - Absolutely amazing the natural flavors of the mackerel that's been lightly touched by a blue flame then served with a side of tangy ponzu sauce. Absolutely amazing Chicken Garlic PonzuStir fried chicken with Garlic Ponzu - When Anthony M recommended this i wondered why. Who goes to a Japanese place and gets stir-fried chicken?? Holy Moley  this breast is divinity served with am amazing sauce. The chicken breast is still juicy and tender while the dry rub and garlic ponzu sauce just kick it up a few notches. NICE! Salmon Ikura DonSalmon and Ikura (Salmon raw) on bowl of rice - Our waitress put this order in when all i wanted was a salmon rice ball. In the end i just decided to eat it anyway seeing as i was a bit hungry that night. Not exactly what i ordered but hell i didnt complain. Only thing i can point out is based on personal preference, would have been nice of the salmon slices were chilled a bit more.SKEWERS!!Negi MaChicken Meat with Onion- Think it's hunks of breast meat but man when you bite into that grilled onion wooo makes it all worth it.SasamiChicken breast- Very nice, nicely seasoned with a bit of salt but grilled to perfection. Still juicy on the inside and perfectly tender. KawaChicken skin - Good thing Tony T was also with us to point out a few techniques and methods. According to him the chicken skins had the fat rendered out so it's just all skin. If you're going to order this be sure to get it sauced (Shio). Sauced makes it so much better than salted.TsukuneGround Chicken and pork (Tare/Shio) - Ground meat reformed on a stick! Good stuff couldnt identify what kind of herb was used to add additional flavor but sure glad they did it. Anything Wrapped in Bacon- The asparagus wrapped in bacon was good. Very high quality bacon they use and they sure know how to grill it. Perfectly cooked and nice and crispy. The bacon wrapped Enoki mushrooms on the other hand was perfect. ShishitoJapanese pepper - If you havent had these yet give them a try. Wonderful flavor and Jin C's favorite. Who else orders 6 skewers?!Depending on your perspective, Kyara is either the poor man's Raku or the rich man's Ichiza when it comes to Japanese izakayas in Las Vegas.    With Raku, there are potential issues with time constraints and difficulty in making reservations on short notice along with the hefty bill whereas with Ichiza, it is always crowded/noisy and service can be shoddy along with variations in quality across the spectrum of items offered.  The dining experience here is laid back and refined, prices are reasonable (and even a steal if you come during happy hour), and the food is consistently delicious and served with impeccable timing.  Having recently gone with 3 friends visiting from out of town, we were able to explore a wide spectrum of the menu, and I was very impressed with the range of offerings as well as the consistency in flavors.   Some notable highlights include the following:Yuzu chili salmon salad- fresh thin slices of salmon sashimi drizzled in a yuzu vinaigrette, the slightest dollop of japanese mayo and ring of jalapeno served alongside a well-dressed bed of arugula, a nice combo of punchy bold flavors that do not overpower the palate.  Ika Geso Age (Deep fried squid tentacles)-  flash fried tender morsels dredged with the slightest bit of batter served immediately out of the deep fryer; add a fresh squeeze of lemon, and you may not ever crave (Italian)calamari ever again.Chicken Karaage (japanese fried chicken)-  an izakaya staple, the most common slip-up is that the chicken is overcooked or under-seasoned, but both pitfalls were avoided so I was unduly impressedSeafood chawanmushi-  velvety egg custard intertwined with fresh scallops and shrimp, you will want to get your own cup to savor every bite all to yourself without sharing.Motsu Ni (pork intestine stew)-  the wild card order that was offal-ly good.  Unctuous simmered broth with tender strands of intestine, nice cubes of yam cake, a wonderful warm soup for a cold day.Yamaimo Teppan (mountain yam on hot plate)-  a sure crowd pleaser both in terms of presentation and taste;  a thin bed of grated mountain yam served on a hotplate covered with bonito shavings and seaweed, it's fun to see the bonito curling in the heat as though the dish were alive, and one is also given a long spoon to scrape the yam off from the hot plate.  The best way I can describe the beautiful synergy of textures is akin to biting into an omelette, grilled cheese sandwich and mashed potatoes all at the same time...culinary magic.Other notables include the seared mackerel, grilled squid, and chicken garlic ponzu, and other yelpers have complimented their dessert selection as well.  Perhaps the only criticism may be that some dishes were a bit on the saltier side, but I think this may be intentional since much like the salty American bar staples of hot wings and nachos, these Japanese pub offerings are all meant to be enjoyed with ice cold beer, sake, or even single malt Japanese whiskey alongside the company of good friends.Solid izakaya.  Good food, reasonable prices, with just the right amount of  culinary weirdness to remind you this is Vegas.As a fellow yeep stated, "Kyara is either he poor man's Raku or the rich man's Ichiza"  So true.  Dishes do not deliver the authenticity or finesse of Raku but nor do the prices.  A good thing for the izakaya noob.For starters, top props to the spicy tuna dip served with rice crackers.  Clean tuna flavor without the cloying mayo.  Great textural contrast when eaten on the rice crackers.  Other sashimi dishes are less successful, swimming in sauces that quickly "cooks" the fish (ceviche) and overpowers the subtle fish flavors.  Deep fried items deliver great flavor but do not order too many at once.  Maybe it was busy on my visits but the oil is not hot enough, so the food gets soggy fast.  Items with cheese; yes cheese, take on a very greasy, cloying mouth feel.  Not good eats. Stick to simple items.  The squid tentacles are absolutely delicious.  Ranging from tender to tough with a salty finish.  The gobo chips simple and earthy.Finally, skewered and grilled items are all very good and averaging $2 a skewer, dirt cheap.  Chicken and pork options moist, veg barely cooked exuding freshness, both with a delicious hibachi char.  Great tasting marinades and sauces that give them all a flavor punch deserving of any beer.  The enoki clusters wrapped in bacon is a must try. Special note:  Yamaimo is offered in many preparations on the menu.  If you have never tried it before, it is very challenging texturally.  Slimy and starchy.  You either like it or you don't.  Just sayin.Friendly and efficient service.  Very reasonable prices.Had this placed bookmarked for months & my experience today w/ my bf was a complete disaster. First, when we walked in, it took awhile for anyone to acknowledge us because there was no hostess at the wait area. Finally, when a server did, she said that it'll be a a few minutes. We basically stood up the whole time since the small couch was occupied by 2 people and there was no way we can squeeze in.  12-15 minutes later, we were finally able to sit down. Walking in the dining area, i noticed there was plenty of seats at the bar area and she didnt bother offering that to us. We went there around noon-ish for the lunch special. I ordered the Salmon Miso combo and my bf ordered the Spicy Salmon bowl combo. When they brought out the entrees, they forgot to bring out my Salmon Miso entree and the waitress stated "it will be ready in a few minutes." First of all, why would you bring food when one of them is not ready??...6 minutes goes by until i can finally catch someone's attention (only 2 waitresses working there at the time). My bf had to start eating his food without me. When i asked her, "where's my salmon?" She said, "oh, i'll get it right now"...So basically, my salmon was ready & she totally forgot about it.When we saw my bf's Spicy Salmon bowl combo, we were totally shocked at what it looked like. We thought they made a mistake. It looked like grounded up bright orange paste (i thought it was pureed smelt egg for a second). The bowl was 90% rice, 10% fish. My bf stated "it's more mild than spicy and all i can taste is rice). My salmon miso was good, miso soup was ok and veggie tempura was typical. The waitress assured us the food was the spicy salmon.The 2 waitresses that interchangeably served us never once checked on us. I have to keep flagging them down to even get their attention. We were both still starving after our meals. It looked plenty but it wasnt satisfying. For the price, I was happier and fuller with a bento box at Sumo sushi. I asked for a check and waited about 8 minutes. Finally, i had to flag the OTHER waitress down to bring me my check. When i gave her my credit card, she stated "oh, our POS service is down. We have to make a carbon copy of your card." Really??? That was just the icing on the cake. She noticed my bf and I did not look happy. She asked us if our food was ok. I was happy with my Salmon Miso but told her about my bf's Spicy Salmon bowl. My bf told her he was expecting it to actually look like a fish, kind of like the same form as my Salmon Miso. The waitress then stated "Oh, the other waitress FORGOT to tell you it was RAW". They didnt bother stating it was raw on the menu, yet alone explained it to us!!! My bf expressed his unhappiness with his food and all she can say was "I'm sorry".The waitress, (one of their names was Yumi) didnt bother giving us a discount, yet alone comp my bf's entree. What kind of place does not state or even write that a particular entree is raw??? Some people do not like raw fish. I told my bf, "maybe the food will be better for dinner", but he was so turned off that he stated, "I dont ever want to come back here." Service makes a huge difference as well! I had such high hopes due to the glowing yelp reviews!!!Kyara has been on my to try list for awhile and tonight was the night I got the chance to go.  Having read many of the reviews from friends, I had some good tips to follow when dining here.I sat at the sushi bar a place I like because it's always fun to watch the chefs working their magic and you see a kitchen at work.I started by ordering three items, Gobo chips (fried burdock root), Iko Geso Age (deep fried squid tentacles), and Enoki with bacon (thin Japanese mushrooms wrapped in bacon and grilled on a skewer.)  The Gobo chips reminded me of very thin French fries with a bit different texture and a different flavor.  It's the root of the burdock so it has some of the flavor from where it grew.  The seasoning on the Gobo was excellent.Iko Geso Age, deep fried squid tentacles, were uniformly cooked and seasoned with some salt.  The squid was very flavorful and almost every bite was tender.Next was the enoki with bacon.  I think most people have seen enoki, either on TV or in the produce section of a market.  Enoki is a very thin stemmed mushroom, white in color, and in this preparation, a number of the mushrooms are gathered together something like a sheaf of wheat and carefully held together by being wrapped by the bacon and placed on a skewer.  It's then grilled.  It is a very tasty dish!This is what I like about tapas style restaurants, I've eaten three dishes, well actually four, and I still have room to try one more thing.  I asked about their mountain potato on a hot plate.  One of the chefs explained to me that it might not be pleasant to my palate that it was slimy and it had a taste that you either loved or hated at first bite.  He also said the dish was too much for one person in size.  OK, next time I go, I have to go with a group of Yelp friends.  Instead, I ordered a butabara (pork belly)  skewer with salt.  They'll do it unsalted, salted, or with salt on the side.  What tasty pork!  This is reason to return although there' still so much to explore on the menu.I mention and extra dish but didn't explain it.  When you check in on Yelp, it brings up a screen that gives you a free appetizer.  It was small and had some fish and other items.  It was a good starter and a nice perk for a check in.Dinner wouldn't be complete without dessert.  I've had my share of chocolate recently, so I went with the green tea waffle dessert.  You get two waffles, vanilla ice cream, and two small containers--one with warm honey and one with melted butter.  I used a bit of the butter and only a small amount of the honey.  The dessert was very good.  And as one person's review stated, it is very filling.Service was great.  I was there when Kyara opened so there wasn't a crowd there.  I was served twice by one of two servers and I received some of the other dishes over the bar from one of the chefs.  They allowed me to stand and peer over the side of the counter so I could see them making sushi and one of the chefs was trying a new dressing for a salad.  Dinner was very tasty, service was excellent, and I will be back.It's sad that I didn't give Kyara a try earlier, as it is merely a few minutes from where I live. Japanese Tapas has always been a little intimidating to me, as I don't really know what I'm ordering a lot of the time. I've been missing out -The food at Kyara is excellent, as far as I can tell. There is time and effort put into a lot of their dishes, along with quality ingredients. I've now tried nearly a dozen of their different items, though there are still many more to be tried. My favorite at this point was a simple chicken and rice bowl called Tori Meshi. Uncomplicated to say the least, but still very delicious.The Chicken Garlic Ponzu is also truly tasty. It has strong flavors that jump out at you, but is unique enough that it is intriguing. Another excellent dish was the Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad. The salmon is very lightly seared and the texture of the dish is amazing, as well as the presentation.Some other highlights so far have been the deep fried cheese, which while straight forward, was tasty and had some nice variety of cheese. Their pork belly skewer is average, while the Negi Ma (chicken and green onion)  skewer was very tasty. The sasami (chicken breast) was not as good, as it really was just a piece of chicken on a skewer. I also tried the bacon mochi skewer, which, while interesting, wasn't necessarily that strong of a combination.I would probably pass on the potato salad, which really was just that, and the Niku Jaga was good but also just seemed like sukiyaki. Still, there are many dishes that I would like to try.It is definitely worth noting that their desserts are extremely good and priced very cheaply, in my opinion. The Yuzu Fromage Mousse is really quite amazing, as is the Green Tea Waffle, which is enough for 3-4 people and only costs around 5 dollars.Service here is a little on the slow side, which is really my only knock on the place. A table was ready and we were asked to sit for a good 5 minutes for no real reason other than they had some trouble keeping up with the crowd. I'm not sure if that's a normal situation, or if they are short one or two servers during the busy hours.All in all, Kyara is a very good and reasonably priced option for those desiring to try a multitude of Japanese-influenced flavors, and I see myself returning here many times for it's convenience to my location as well as its excellent food.The best 4 star place I know of, Kyara has plethora of great items...really, really great items!What they are:One of the best options in town for Japanese Tapas / Izakaya.What they aren't:The best sushi spot in the southwestA high-end Izakaya joint...although the value you get here is something special!My favorites include:Yuzu Chili Salmon w/ ArugulaCabbage Ra-Yu--this is one of the tastiest raw cabbage dishes I've encountered!Inaniwa UdonHealthy Kushi Mori (Bonus tip--we always keep the Ra-Yu oil left over from the cabbage and used it to dress these veggies.)I always make a point to check out their monthly specials as many of these items have been quite good.  They recently had a Tomato Nabe that was UNBELIEVABLY GOOD!  Another of my favorites was a Stuffed Shishito Pepper they were doing for a while.Lots of friends are really into their lunch specials, but I don't ever make it in for lunch.  I am all about their small plates and skewers! I wouldn't argue with anyone that wanted to give Kyara 5 stars.  I just think that they are not as good as it gets on multiple items that they serve.In closing, please note that Japan has over 50,000 people who are over 100years old...widespread debate abounds as to the reason why.  Most assume that it is due to the use of toilet slippers to keep the rest of the house clean. Others point to Kancho on the playground, KFC on Christmas Eve, Yaeba, or Inemuri.  I have scientifically eliminated these ideas and narrowed it down to two possibilities: Soine-ya & Hadaka Matsuri.  I'll let you come up with your own conclusion though.Kyara is a pretty awesome restaurant. Over the years of attending this place, there has been a consistently solid experience from a service, food, and ambiance standpoint. I would chose this spot over any other yakitori in the valley (still haven't tried Raku). I personally like the location of Kyara. Sometimes, SMR can get overwhelming. That's why I like being away from the hustle and the bustle, occasionally. The inside is small, but very intimate, with lots of Japanese aesthetics going from wall to wall. The open kitchen is immaculate, and due to great ventilation, you can hardly smell the meat wafting through the air.The main reason to come here is for the yakitori, or "meat on a stick". But not really because they also have a wide variety of items that they skewer, such as, vegetables, poultry, seafood, etc. I think what separates this place from other similar locations is due to the smokiness of the cooked items. Kyara does a great job of imparting that flavor onto them. They use high quality and fresh items, and you can really tell while savoring the food. They also carry other items such as appetizers and entrees, which most of them are very good as well. I particularly like the takoyaki balls.One of my favorite spots, I like about 90% of the things I've enjoyed here. I think the skewers are a good deal, but, I do hope they bring back their $1 skewer nights, that was the shiznit! This spot gets 4.5 stars from me.

Review Text :
I want to love this place, I reeeeeally really do. My boyfriend lives in the Optima so when I saw this little cafe open up, with its little patio by the fountains, I had visions of warm evenings with a glass of wine & appetizers or grabbing a late night latte or cup of gelato. They even have a small market with a little produce, some personal products...even pet supplies! On paper, this place sounds awesome.However, Divine continues to disappoint me, my boyfriend & our friends...even though we all CONTINUE to give them chance after chance after chance. Sad face.I have worked in different restaurants for over five years. I understand a little of what it takes to make an establishment work. Customer service is HUGE. It is obvious to me that this place has no real management & barely any training for any of their staff. The service is so terrible. No one seems to know what they are doing. The employees are usually friendly, but totally, utterly clueless. Actually had to grab a bag of cat food this morning...apparently $18 for a small bag of food, according to the cashier. When we reconsidered (obviously), she said, "Ohhhh wait, well...how 'bout $6.50?"  WHAT? This is not the first time prices have been negotiated for something from their market.I have waited for a turkey sandwich for over half an hour. We waited for a pizza for an hour+...& while a man who I assume maybe was the owner? came out to apologize a few times, that was all he did. He seemed totally frazzled & out of it. They had three other tables in the restaurant at that time - COME ON. Most of the time they seem to be out of at least half of what is on their menu. I'm 99% sure their "soup" is canned Campbell's. Their hours vary...I think depending on when (or maybe if) someone decides to show up. We went by & thought they had finally closed up for good...but the next night it was open with someone playing live music? So confusing.I keep going back because their food isn't bad, once you get it. & they have an awesome selection of teas & a pretty nice wine list. & it is just so gosh darn convenient!I hate to be so negative about a place that has sooo much potential, but seriously. They need to get their shit together. I think their concept is a great idea, but Divine is just falling SO far short.

Finally! Somewhere in Las Vegas that I can get brunch, besides my own kitchen!  Now, I know what you're thinking: Jen - isn't brunch mainly an excuse to swig bloody Mary's and/or Mimosas and be drunk before 2pm? doesn't being vegan and not able to eat anything besides dry toast and fruit make that easier?  Well, yes.  You got me there.  But sometimes, I actually want a little protein or maybe a waffle too/instead.  Is that so much to ask? Apparently so.Until now.  I'm gonna be honest.  I had tried some of Chef Mayra's catered food before at events and had not been blown away.  They were fine, always just a bit bland.  Not so with the brunch! Fortunately I went with three friends, so we just got one of everything on the brunch menu and shared.  I'm usually not a big fan of sweet/carb-y breakfast food, but the waffles and french toast were outstanding.  OMFG, that chocolate waffle.  It was like the most delicate delicious brownie... I don't know if I could eat a whole one, but 1/4 was the perfect breakfast dessert.  I also loved the regular waffle and the sausage with peppers that came with the French toast! The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the breakfast burrito.  It was a bit cold, with unmelted Daiya cheese, and the flavor profile just didn't hit me right.  But the side of beans that came with ..... damn.  One of the best things I've tasted in awhile!  I admit I probably took more than my fair share... Great coffee, with lots of different flavors of coconut milk creamer.  And the ultimate in refreshment - citrus cucumber water. Yum.We had very attentive service, the chef even came out and spoke to us personally.  Our total bill for 4 with coffees, an entree and fancy waters was under $60.  We all left completely stuffed and quite happy.Can't wait to come back and try the lunch menu; if it's as good as my favorites on the brunch menu, I'll probably round this up to 5 stars.  So thrilled to have an organic, all vegan place that's close to home!Chile Relleno = BOMB. COMFirst off, let it be known that I am neither Vegan nor Vegetarian, so I'm a bit standoffish at dining in a restaurant whenever it's 100% vegetarian due to bad experiences in the past, but I have NO complaints about the food or service at Pura AT ALL. The food was VERY Delectable, Luscious & Flavorful, a great dining experience overall!. Will definitely be returning for breakfast or lunch in the near future.Thanks again Chef Mayra for the Culinary Orgasmic Experience!.As I stated in my Red Velvet Cafe review, I think it's essential for me to point out that I'm not Vegan, nor in my wildest or tamest dreams could I ever become Vegan.  My love for the flesh of cows, pigs and chickens rivals that of Romeo and Juliet, McAdams and Gosling, and Kim Kardashian and (insert current boyfriend here).  In seeing the great reviews for this place here and on John Curtas' blog, I was skeptical to say the least.  Upon seeing more and more pictures of the My Love burrito though, my skepticism began to fade, enough so that I decided to call in an order.I'd read here about the wait and their website made mention to give plenty of time for an order to be prepared, so I placed it accordingly and was told it'd be ready in 35 minutes.  The location isn't the greatest and neither is the parking lot for a parking challenged individual for myself.  The food came out from the kitchen right when I arrived (perfect timing!) and the woman running the front of the house graciously allowed me to try some of the flavored waters they had available that day.  Wasn't too crazy about any of those but got some blended tea drink they had that was tasty.Upon getting back to the office and finally getting a chance to see the food, it looked as remarkable as the pictures I'd seen of it online.  It was one of those things that I could almost tell was going to taste amazing before even having a bite, vegan cheese notwithstanding.   The following bites confirmed this, and the medley of tofu, beans, veggies, potatoes and yes, fear in my heart striking vegan cheese tasted blissful.  I wont get into my vegan cheese exploits of the past, but this experience erased those past experiences quickly.  The My Love burrito is quite simply the best vegan meal I've ever had, and I'd put it toe to toe against most meat filled burritos I've had.At $11, it's pricier than your average burrito, but then again this is no average burrito.What a unique cafe...Unless you've been here before, you don't know why. But it's true. Unique is the best word to describe it. So here's the rundown:- 100% vegan (animal-free)- 100% cruelty-free kitchen- All gluten-free options are prepared separately in their gluten-free kitchen area. So awesome!!!- GMO free, organic, & fair trade whenever available I know you meat-lovers & non-vegans out there are thinking. How can this food be delicious? It is. Trust me. In my quest for better health & attempt to be vegan (ok, I'm probably vegan 95% of the time, I can't lay off dairy! Err!) I am saddened by the fact that Pura Vida is not in my neighborhood. Far from it, but I still attempt to come whenever I can.What's on their menu? Waffles, French toast, pancakes, scrambles. Their newest items this week: PB + Banana + Chocolate + Raspberry Mini Pancakes. Or Cinnamon Walnut French Toast. In the mood for lunch? You can have sandwiches, quesadillas, create-your-own wraps, chili, & empanadas. They make daily bakery items, chocolate cakes, muffins, etc. I tried their chili, empanadas, & one of their gluten-free Latin'tude (posted pics). Yum :)Pros:Service - incredible. Their servers are very knowledgeable about the menu & will try to accommodate any dietary requests or allergies. Very friendly & helpful.Yumminess - I love the efforts they make to provide great tasting food, using organic whenever possible. They prove that you don't need to eat any animal products to have a fulfilling meal. Portions - huge! Took home leftovers every time!Cons:Location - not the most convenient wholesome neighborhood. I think Cheetah's is right down the street. I'm glad I'm here during daylight hours.Timeliness - this isn't fast food. It's good wholesome food made to order. They ask customers to give them 40 minutes for take-out orders, and it seems to be the same when you eat there. That's why they urge you to call in ahead of time. You could even call a day before (I can imagine most people can't plan that well like me, but I love that they offer the option) They will reserve a seat for you if you give them notice. They did for me, table for one.Price - good ingredients comes at a cost. Most complete meals are $11-18. I'm more than happy to pay for quality, but I understand some people want to spend less on breakfast or lunch. The portions are well worth your money, in my opinion. One dish has always lasted me for two sittings or more. And I don't know about you, but knowing you're eating a great healthy meal, feeling good about what you ate is worth the extra dollars. Consistency - availability changes daily. So do the specials. The gluten-free chocolate cake you got one day is not there the next time you visit. Bakery items sell out fast. They've informed me though that anything can be available if you call. You want vegan pumpkin pie? I called a couple days before Thanksgiving & they made it. Plus, she'll prepare it to any dietary specifications you want. Planning my next return to Pura Vida. Soon!Disclaimer: I am not a vegetarian or vegan. I love meat and I cannot deny my usual distaste for vegan eateries because of my experience with foods that lack of flavor and have strange textures. Having said that, the meal I had at Pure Vida today was one of the best and freshest lunches I have had in a long, long time!I read through their menu and website prior to arriving, so I was well aware that everything is prepared fresh and can take 30-45 minutes to prepare. No problem for me, because I enjoy long and quiet lunches. When I walked in, Cindy directed me to a table and gave me an abundance of information as well as about 5 different menus that had specials and drinks and other specials and lunch and breakfast and dessert, etc. I immediately ordered a lime-mint blended essential oils water ($3: NOTE: they no longer offer free refills as of Jan 13, 2013). It is free of sugar and home made and unbelievably refreshing! For food, I settled on the lunch special (a little pricey at $14.99, but it came with so much food that I cannot complain at all!) and chose a salad with creamy garlic dressing and the "My Love" burrito. The "salad" was a GIGANTIC plate of fresh veggies including spinach, sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, etc. and the dressing came on the side, which was great. About 20 minutes later (it wasn't very crowded), my burrito was served: sun dried tomatoes, cuban black beans, vegan cheese, spinach, roasted garlic potatoes, avocado, chipotle peppers. Let me tell you, it was one of the best burritos I have ever had (AND I LOVE MEAT, AND IT CONTAINED NO MEAT!). There was a little kick to it, but nothing that made my mouth burn or detracted from the wonderful flavors of the fresh veggies and toasted tortilla. If you aren't a vegetarian or vegan, who cares? Support this little gem because it supports chemical free, organic, healthy dining options that do NOT skimp in flavor or portion size. Absolutely wonderful. The ambiance is also very relaxing and peaceful. Cindy, my waitress, was extremely helpful and friendly and made me feel like we were old friends. She even gave me a sample of one of their apple cookies and made some recommendations for my next visit (which will likely be tomorrow, lol). I cannot recommend this place enough. It is my new favorite lunch spot!First of all, this is a generous 1 star only because there is no option for no stars.I have nothing to say about Pura Vida's food because we never got to try it since this supposed community-friendly small business would not serve us at 1:45 because their clock said 1:50 when their hours clearly state they close at 2 pm.Here's the story... my vegan friend is visiting so i bought the Groupon deal. On Saturday we planned to go for lunch and thankfully we called first and they said they close at 2. So on Sunday we tried to look at their menu online and were going to call in an order to pickup but their site had a bandwidth error message and so we could not see the menu.  As of right now you still can't see their website.So we drove all the way across town and arrived at 1:45. As soon as we walked in the woman called out while we were still standing in the doorway that they were closed with an obvious grateful tone to turn us away. We tried to explain that we had tried to come for two days and it was a special treat for my vegan friend. She carelessly dismissed everything we said saying that they take the last order at 1:45 and that it is "the policy of the kitchen because the food takes so long." We practically begged to be served by this place and the woman had no care in the world.  I wanted to talk to someone else in charge but then I thought why bother this woman obviously doesn't want our business. So, I told her I would NEVER come back and she is very bad for business. Of course she couldn't care less. As we left I was further annoyed as I noticed a flashing open sign in the window. UGH!Between my friend and I we have lived and worked in the service industry in Las Vegas, Miami, LA and Portland and have never experienced a small business having such audacity to turn away wold be happy customers. It was such a bad business move in these modern times of such high competition among businesses and the great opportunity for online reviews and word-of-mouth. Shame on you, Pura Vida.It seems this place has good reviews and good food, but we will never know since we refuse to go back. We are all in favor of supporting local businesses, I am a Las Vegas native. In Las Vegas where the competition against big corporations is so great. We should all be supporting our community establishments, but when they make it clear they do not need our business what are we to do? Dominos pizza got our money today, again, Pura Vida, shame on you.We will be refunding our Groupon and telling everyone we know to not bother going to Pura Vida before 1:45 pm, or ever.I got fooled by Yelp reviews!My boyfriend, his mom, and I had not only the WORST experience at this restaurant, but also the most UNCOMFORTABLE experience!We decided to dine here for breakfast when we saw the great reviews and noticed that the location was walking distance away from the outlet. We took a taxi from our hotel and arrived to the restaurant at 9:20 AM on Saturday. The restaurant looked closed. My boyfriend tried the door and it was locked. I decided to be resourceful and call the restaurant to see if they were open. (I wish I never made this call! We should've left and eaten elsewhere!) They answered and said they were open and had forgotten to unlock the doors.The restaurant looked dirty (typical whole-in-the-wall type of place). We were seated and menus were distributed. When we rummaged through 3 different menus, we were horrified at how haphazardly the items were placed and completely confused on how to even order. To make matters worst, the server tried to explain the menu to us - even more OVERWHELMING and EXHAUSTING! Items that had fruits and avocados listed will now only come with bananas since avocados and other fruits were "not in season" for the restaurant. Some items would take over 45 minutes and other items you can't even order unless you made a reservation ahead of time.Crap, we're stuck here. The taxi driver already left. So we decided to order a WOW, french toast with a side of WOW, and Tha' Waffle. However, we asked for the WOW to be made without potatoes (my boyfriend's mom is severely allergic). The server was completely confused on how to place the order. Apparently, the cook can't make that dish without the potatoes. So she suggested to order the items that come on that plate as a la carte. Fine, we ordered as a la carte. We were tired of looking at that puzzling menu.15 minutes later the "Chef" decides to come talk to us about how the WOW plate would be prepared. (Wait, she didn't even start on the food yet?) She said she wouldn't be replacing the potatoes for something else since the potatoes are the bed of the plate and everything else goes on top, but rather she would be removing the potatoes and adding extra bit of this and that. So she was trying to UP-SELL us because my boyfriend's mom is allergic to potatoes? My boyfriend had to clarify to her that we are not going to pay extra. We don't care if she adds more of whatever she wants or doesn't add anything at all, just take out the potatoes! She continued talking and moving her hands and flailing her arms trying to describe us the plate. She kept emphasizing how she WOULD NOT REPLACE the potatoes but would be REMOVING them and adding other stuff. What in the world? Does this person know what the word "replace" means?We say fine and she finally goes back to the kitchen. A table near us receives their food in a timely manner (15 minutes after ordering). We've been waiting 30 minutes now. The server says "THEIR FOOD CAME OUT FIRST BECAUSE THEY ORDERED YESTERDAY." What in the world?!?? After 45 minutes of this grueling wait, my boyfriend's mom's food comes out. The chef comes out, too! (Not again, stay in the kitchen please!) My boyfriend's mom is displeased and when the chef asks how her dish is, she says "So-so" (my boyfriend's mom's English is very limited, I'm surprised she didn't spit out what was in her mouth back on to the plate). Then the chef says, "All I want is a smile from her!" The audacity of this lady!!There was a yellow flower placed on top of her plate of food. She took the flower off the plate and placed it on the table. When my waffle came out a few minutes later, the chef came out again! Then she takes the flower off the table and places it on top of my waffle and says, "You get a flower too!" Is this place that cheap that they have to reuse garnishing?!??Overall, our experience was horrifying! I've never had vegan food before and if this is the best that a vegan restaurant can offer, then I can never be a vegan.If you still want to dine there, here are some tips:1. Order your food the day before you plan on actually eating it2. Be ready to wait for at least 45 minutes for your food if you didn't order yesterday3. Don't get an explanation of the menu4. Stay away from talking to the chefThe bill was $49 before tip - we ordered only three plates and no drinks. A little pricey for disgusting food and even worse service.TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.  Do not waste your time or money and...Possibly the meanest thing I can say about a local business in this city. I'm counting the days till this place goes out of business...and it will, here's why;- Disorganized; menu, kitchen, and staff.- Poor customer service.- Consistently poor customer experiences (Most of the 1 star reviews are consistent and accurate, I should have read them before)- Overpriced specialty menu.These people obviously have ZERO clue how to run a kitchen or a business. I don't know if they are out back harvesting the wheat and soybeans for their tofu but seriously, I could have birthed, raised, slaughtered, and cooked a cow in the time it takes them to make a goddamn waffle!We (2 of us) were the 3rd table sat. NO ONE had food. The other two tables had already placed their orders. We placed our order on what appeared to be a menu designed by epileptic 9 yr old with a sever case of Aspergers syndrome (note: As someone w/epilepsy, I find this menu design  VERY insulting).  We attempt to order Tha' Waffle and their  insanely overpriced breakfast burrito. 15 mins later 4th table fills, then eventual the remaining tables slowly fill.  25 mins later the 4th table gets all their food. The 3 original tables are still without. Some polite banter between us the waitress to see what the hold up is and never a clear response.The waitresses are now telling people who are slowly filing in that there is an hour wait and that, "we're closing at 2:00...that will only leave 15 mins, so don't bother waiting." (yes, this is an actual quote)  "They all just came at once" (which is total bullshit, I've been sitting here for over an hour.) At this point it had been an hour SINCE we placed our order. We walked out Went up the street to Omelet house. We were seated, orders placed, and served in 20 mins and spent $20. If I had actually paid for what we order, bill would have been about $32. running a vegetarian or vegan restaurant is not super expensive unless you are a complete f*ing moron.  If I could rate them on a CFM scale, 5 Stars!*le sigh* I really didn't want it to come to this because well, as a vegan there are very few places I can go to eat, but after disappointment after disappointment I'm sorry to say I will not be coming back to Pura Vida any time soon. This was my letter to Chef Mayra after the Titanic x Hindenburg disaster that was their Valentine's Day dinner. "I hate to say it but I am livid and a bit appalled after tonight's Valentine's dinner. We paid $75 for 15 courses; you gave up after 12, and a couple of the courses were thrown & plated together last minute instead of being the separate courses they were advertised as. When you pay for something, you should receive it. Not only were we denied the extra courses, but it took forever to get them - you asked us to come early and that dinner would be served 6-9 PM; the first course wasn't even served until 6:40 PM. We left at 10 PM (we had plans at 9:30 - oh well!) confused as to where the rest of the courses were. There was very little explanation or communication and definitely poor planning. As a vegan I was excited for this opportunity and have eaten at your establishment many times, as well as referred you to others, but this will most likely be my last time. My husband really wanted this year to be special, but it was a huge headache. If you do this next year I hope you severely edit the menu and the prices so everyone leaves satisfied and at the designated time. You knew how many people were coming well in advance and should have had a test run of some sort. The only semblance of apology came from your servers when the food was not being served in the beginning. My husband is now even complaining he's still hungry as we didn't eat earlier in the day to fit this event in! This is one of the worst of not the absolute worst restaurant experiences I have ever been privy to and I hope to never repeat this episode of Vegan Survivor ever again."I appreciate that everything is made ready-to-order, but when you're serving FIFTEEN courses to 40 guests who you asked to arrive early and did actually have a definitive ending time of 9 PM, you have to make sure it goes smoothly which it did not. My husband and I were starved for over an hour before the food started coming. We estimated our time of exit by how "quickly" the food was coming out and it should have ended past midnight! Completely awful. A bunch of people left (and I wish I were one of them), and I'm pretty sure every single person left unsatisfied. This establishment has absolutely 0 business acumen and it is going to hurt them. You don't even have to watch a couple episodes of Kitchen Nightmares to realize Pura Vida is doing it wrong. If you have to come out and explain every menu item as well as feel the need to put pictures of the food in the convoluted menu, as a diner you should run immediately. Now I was going to give Pura Vida the benefit of the doubt since they did email the patrons and offered the rest of the courses, we just had to email & give the time we're coming in. Which my husband did. And apparently he had to confirm back which was not explained whatsoever. So he is currently at Pura Vida waiting for them to make the final meal we will enjoy from there. I sincerely wish Chef Mayra luck (she's going to need it!) but I will not be back. P.S. To the servers - good luck, you were the best part of the place, always trying to make it work when you are as confused as the customer, and I hope she supplies plenty of aspirin for the hourly headaches you have to have from working there.I like to eat at Pura and I bring all my non vegan friends/family all the time... I don't mind the 1 hour wait for the food... I even think the waitresses are nice.   I want to support a restaurant that is cruelty free.But something happened today when i went to eat there... I ordered pancakes, and the table next to me ordered pancakes too.  Now, I was there before that table sat down and ordered.  So i'm waiting very patiently for my food ( i am waiting an hour)  when finally the waitress put my pancakes on my table.  As soon as I was gonna dig in, the other waitress comes and takes it off my table and says it's for the table next to me.  My waitress asked me if I had that same order and i said yes.  She then came back to tell me that since a kid ordered pancakes.. they want to get food out to the kids first.  I just thought that was the stupidest reason ever!!! I was like WTF.  What restaurant does that?  I don't care who ordered pancakes... i ordered first!  I'm grouchy when I'm hungry :)  (Imagine waiting an hour for your food, only to have the table next you who order after you.. get your food)   This just turned me off!!!!!!!!!!!!!I don't know what to say about this incident.  I think I'm going to take a break from Pura for awhile. :(This place is pretty awful. The decor is all over the place. Random crap on the ways, pictures of turkeys, bad pics of what I presume is the chefs mom, and a weird slide show on a random monitor. Four or five really unorganized menus that are explained to every detail. Many items are unavailable or don't have all the ingredients. Food takes forever to get to the table and when it did it was cold. I got the tofu scramble which comes with cheesy potatoes, sausage, and random cucumbers.  I have never heard of cucumbers with food that is supposed to be hot. Anyway, as I said before the food arrived cold. The potatoes and sausage were cold and not to mention the sausage tasted like rubber. The hold plate looked like they just threw everything on the plate. No technique and no real concept of an actual meal.  I could only manage a few bites until I had to tell the waitress that the food was cold and quite frankly, not very good. Before taking it back she mentions the window might have made it cold. This shit was cold when it arrived.  I've eaten vegan food plenty of times and this place is no where the other places I've been.  I eat at Native Foods in Southern California often. Their food has never been cold even when I'm actually outside.But I digress, the chef comes out and makes some passive aggressive comment about the window.  Bitch it has nothing to do with the damn window.  She tells me," everyone else loves that meal. Next time I see your face I will make sure I cook your food at a 160 degrees and bring it right out to you." She continues with excuses like I don't know shit about food. She says," we don't use a microwave and the food gets cold at the pass."  A few minutes later she brings my girlfriend's food at and says some other bullshit as she sets it down," let me make sure it's out of the way of the window." It's not the window!! You gave me cold ass food which was also disgusting. The food is all over the place. Well I know I will never be back. The food was shit and as soon as I let them know that I was served bad/cold food the service became bad as well.I wish this place would was chosen for Gordon Ramsey's kitchen nightmares. He is the only who could save that place.I strongly advise against going there.Recap: pretty bad quality, unorganized menus and way too expensive.Just don't go there.Here's a list of things I could hypothetically do in the amount of time it takes Pura Vida to make lunch:- Read a few books on the subject of restaurant ownership- Build an organic  farm in my backyard- Grow an entire crop of fruits and vegetables- Learn to cook an entire menu's worth of vegetarian recipes- Get a restaurant business license- Get a small business loan and lease a suitable property- Grow a full, luxurious beardI had a lunch reservation at 1:45. At 2:30 they called me up to tell me that they could not have my food ready until 3:15. I ordered a quesadilla and some soup, not The Great Pyramids of Egypt. Instead of apologizing for wasting my time, the chef immediately got defensive and indignant with me. The whole restaurant got to watch a soap opera moment unfold as she blamed her employee for poor time management, then she blamed me for not being flexible. Dinner and a show! I do not recommend you to go to Pura Vida Bakery & Bystro.Very poor customer service!Went to try with the family after hearing a lot of good things about the food.  We arrived exactly an hour before they closed and after waiting a few minutes(although we were seen by employees upon entry) at the front were asked if we had a reservation by someone running helplessly back and forth behind the counter.  We replied  that we did not and she stated that they would not be able to serve us then because they were " way backed up and would be closing in a few minutes" (even though we were there an hour before listed closing and there were at least five tables open).  We advised the lady that we had a Groupon that was expiring that day and maybe we could use it for take out or at least the bakery.  She declined but did inform us that THEY would still allow us to use it for the original value we paid.  I told her that this was Groupon's policy already and not the restaurants and she just shrugged and said "sorry".This poor example of customer service unfortunately cannot change my mind about this place no matter how good the food is supposed to be.  If this is how this establishment chooses to operate they shouldn't be in the sit down restaurant business.  Because of this experience, I will be sure to STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST ANYONE TRYING THIS PLACE.I have been eating at Pura Vida since they initially opened. As a matter of fact, I have been a customer of Chef Mayra's since BEFORE this restaurant opened-- my father hired her to bake me a vegan cake for my 21st birthday.In terms of Pura Vida, the food at this establishment has been consistently good. Yes, the wait is long; yes, the menus are all over the place; yes, the place is run in a discombobulated fashion; yes, sometimes the staff is short with customers. But the food has always been tasty. My visit earlier today, though, will mark the last time that I patronize them. Ever. Please read of my experience below:My friend and I walked in around 11AM and were briskly told to "read the sign!" Looking around, we were unsure of what sign to read. When it was pointed out to us, it stated plainly that no Groupons would be accepted this weekend following the 4th of July, and that if we have a Groupon we can come back tomorrow. [This immediately gave me a flashback to Father's Day weekend '13 when I came in with a different friend and, upon attempting to redeem her Groupon, were told that they would not accept it due to the holiday weekend. Even though it expired that weekend, and no where on the Groupon did it say that it was void on holiday weekends]. Continuing on... Not having a Groupon on this visit, my friend and I didn't worry about the sign. We were then asked, rather shortly, "So do you still want to eat here?!" I could barely get the 'yes' out of my mouth before we were then asked, "Well, do you have a reservation?!" Having not EVER made a reservation, save for Mother's Day '13, I said 'no'. We were then met, pretty much, with a, "Let me see if we have room for you". Thankfully, after a brief time, we were seated. Upon choosing our meals, our orders were taken. I decided on 'Tha Frenchie', which is a french toast dish with syrup, bananas, fresh berries [when they are in season], and "A DRIZZLING" of chocolate syrup. Having ordered this dish on Mother's Day and not able to eat more than two bites because it was absolutely DRENCHED in chocolate syrup [and had no berries, since they were not in season], I politely asked three questions this time: 1) Are berries in season? (yes) 2) So there will be berries on my french toast? (yes) 3) Can I please order the dish with no chocolate syrup? (yes)After some great conversation with my friend, our meals arrived. My french toast had no chocolate syrup on it, but neither did it have any berries. Before the waitress walked away I said, "Oh! It looks like the berries are missing. May I please have my berries?" to which she replied, "Let me check".Puzzled by this response, my friend and I exchanged looks.Chef Mayra, the owner, then walked abrasively up to our table and lectured me on how my choosing to get no chocolate syrup messed up the flavor profile and, essentially, how dare I think that I could further ruin the flavor profile by enjoying berries on the dish with no chocolate syrup (?). It really made no sense at all, so I then said, "Well, the menu says that the dish comes with fresh berries...I just didn't want the chocolate..." Chef Mayra then continued and stated that I am "lucky" that she is here today, else her chefs would not have even altered her "Signature Dish" to the extent of not putting chocolate syrup on it because they are trained to not alter the Signature Dishes. Oh, but this is a special day--- so she then handed me one large strawberry, sliced up on a plate. "Here is your berry this time. But we won't be able to do this next time".Wow. I felt like that was a huge slap in the face. And the whole deal still doesn't make much sense to me. Why was she in such a bad mood? Why was she so offended that I didn't want chocolate syrup? To be sure, I didn't mention the thirteen wasted dollars on Mother's Day due to the french toast being ruined by a gallon of chocolatey goodness. Maybe I should have? In any case, I felt like a very undervalued customer today. In the time since Pura Vida opened its doors, I have brought A LOT of varied business to them-- business that would have, initially, never even considered this restaurant less I suggested  it.It really is too bad to see such a good restaurant idea not live up to its potential because of bad customer service. As a vegan, I loved to eat here. But my money (and my partner's, and my friends', and my family members') money will be spent elsewhere. At restaurants where we aren't treated like annoyances.These folks don't understand that good service makes up at least 50% of the equation if you want to run a successful restaurant. Good food alone doesn't cut it. Hubby and I went here on the reco of some friends. Food was tasty, but service and most importantly, the staff's attitude, was unbelievably poor. Do yourself a favor and pass on Pura Vida.

Restaurant name  TastyBunz

This thought was running through my mind as I ate these buns, "Why haven't I had dim sum that offered buns as tasty as this?"  Sure, you could argue that you're not going to find spaghetti filled buns while eating dim sum, but that's beside the point!  Here's a breakdown of the menu: (pictured here http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=MZ000fT2g5Ww9Tw8OkCtYg)Bacon Bird - cheese dough w/ creamy chicken & bacon filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=UB2iCvcS_b-gaEbgQ1K1Gw)  Probably my second favorite.  I'd probably like it with more cream sauce and bacon, but that's the glutton in me talking.McCheesy - mushroom dough w/ truffle mac-n-cheese filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=TJH2HWSRDAAnawTsC3QSJQ) Dominant truffle flavor, not as cheesy as I would have hoped, but still tasty with that mushroom bun.Sloppy Bun - thyme dough w/ spaghetti filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=ZcKOhk0T89Of2_HxyR2JXg)  This was my favorite!  Maria L. was spot on with her comparison to scooping up the last bit of spaghetti with your bread.BBQ Rib - cilantro dough w/ Mom's BBQ beef filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=M21vsLD4RpfI6WtqpzNLCw)  I was surprised at how moist the beef was inside the bun.The Dilly - green onion dough w/ Pop's ground beef filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=IEV7U49flzyc4QKdInZnpA)  Not my preference, it was okay.Hot Pig -  jalapeno dough w/ spicy pork filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=bXvr9e0_TQ83RI3nZwDdsg)  I didn't really get any spice.The Sloppy Bun, Bacon Bird and McCheesy were my favorites; you could eat these blindfolded and know what they were easily.  The other three didn't seem to have a distinctive flavor profile; yes, I knew that the main meat was (shredded beef/ground beef/pork) but it didn't excite the taste buds.  On my next trip I'll have to try the truffle tator tots and some dessert!My one suggestion for eating at TastyBunz is this: don't come here on an empty stomach.  I ordered six buns for $11, and ended up eating them all!  In the end I was satisfied, and not overly full.  TastyBunz seems like the perfect spot to hit up with a couple of friends when you want a snack.  Split the cost, get the tots, try some desserts; I think it's more economical than spending $11 on one meal!I'll be sure to try the sides and desserts on my next visit!I was really excited about this food truck.  The concept is definitely unique and who wouldn't like a bun stuffed with mac and cheese.  The staff is really nice and I really like the sides.  The truffle tater tots are to die for and the Frisco garlic fries are also great.  But the buns are pretty bland.I came to the grand opening at Costco and I've tried to visit every time they are at Costco so I could try all the buns.  I've tried everything except the sloppy bun, a bun stuffed with spaghetti, which I am eager to try but they've been out.The pork special (now called Hot Pig?) is ok but not spicy.  Dad's picadilly is interesting, but not very tasty.  Like taco meat with some vegetables in it.  There is dill in the bun, but I couldn't really taste it.Mac and cheese bun (now McCheesy, I think) is mac and cheese in a bun.  There is supposed to be mushrooms and/or truffle in the bun but I could not taste either.  But the second time I tried it, I got more truffle flavor in the mac and cheese. But I think I built this one up too much in my head and it just disappointed me in the end.BBQ rib bun was ok.  There is cilantro in the bun, but I can't really taste it.The bacon bird bun is probably my favorite so far.  Nice bacon flavor and very creamy.  But again, not getting much flavor from the bun.I also tried the Me fries but they are a little overwhelming with the egg.  I could not finish it all.  I'll probably stick with the Frisco fries.The dessert potstickers are super sweet.  So sweet they hurt my teeth somehow.  Unfortunately I just can't deal with the sweetness, but I've only tried the smores potstickers, which are fried pastry potstickers stuffed with chocolate and covered with condensed milk and graham crackers. Maybe others are less sweet.  You can try all three if you order the happy ending.  Cute.This is the only food truck I've encountered anywhere that does not include tax in the price.  So bring change or expect to get a lot back.  3 buns are $6 without tax but $6.49 with tax, if that helps.That being said, it's a new truck and has a lot of potential.  It looks like they are changing up the menu and making new items.  So I'll likely be back for the sloppy bun and other menu items. If something strikes my fancy, I'll definitely re-review.I have a new love for Tots... as I walked over each Food Truck to see what they offered outside Tommy Rocker's.. I came across TastyBunz. It was hard as hail to read their marker writings for the menu selections on their see through windows, but I came across the word.. Tots and a photo of it on the truck. What got my undivided attention, which people with A.D.D indeed are less prone in having... a Truffle flavored Tots with fancy Truffle Sauce... Hmmm Veeery Interesting I told myself. Something else caught my eyes, but that's something left to my imagination. Ordered one and it was steaming hot.. all packed up in a sturdy white box and had the utensils inside all ready for chow down. I thought just that was appealing to see.As I received my Truffle Tatter Tots, the aroma filled my nose with deep heavy scent of Truffles. It even made me salivate from inhaling this flavored Tots. The portion and size was beyond generous... amazing outer crust crunch. Crisp and light... the center was soft and steamy. I literally made the Oh face hot look. I like the fact that even when 20 mins. went by.. those Tots were still packed with steam. The flavor was sexy, fun, jammin'!!! Absolutely the best Truffle Tatter Tots to date. It was the perfect blend without the crazy salt or spice. I loved it!The service was exceptional. He was ready to take my order right when I walked up. Very attentive and made sure that's all I wanted. If the service is warm and welcoming... it can bring Anybody back. Big winner with my new love for Tots. This is on my Hot List... for more reasons than one.

Review Text :
"If there's such a thing as "food for thought" then it's close cousin must be the "food for the soul"." - Aljamin Santos (c)We dress our Sunday's best every Sunday to Church because we want to be presentable to a Higher Power. Whether or not you believe in such as a Higher Power aka God, we will find common grounds in Harold's Chicken and Fish. Tracy at HC&F's beliefs are parallel and very evident that she believes in dressing the great food served here in it's best and highly presentable in her very new location on West Cheyenne. Barely a Las Vegas local, Tracy came here about a month and half ago from Southside Chicago taking along with her the deep and fresh tastes from Chicago with her version of Chicago's soul food! Don't be fooled-- the other Harold's are owned by different folks!A few of my friends and I planned to get sandwiches, but when we were waiting to turn into the plaza, my gf mentioned that HC&F has a sign saying "NOW OPEN". I honked at my brother and with all my knowledge of sign language, I frantically tried to signal him to look at HC&F's sign! Little did Tracy know, that the reputation of HC&F precedes them and we've been waiting for them to open for quite a bit of time already. We walked in and started to take in the place. The entire restaurant is likened to a very large dining room with 2 flat screen televisions, sofas, chairs, plenty of tables, and jazz decor. The menu is self-explanatory but if you have questions, Tracy would be very happy to answer them. When we walked up, I asked what "perch" was. I've never heard of it and Tracy was so kind and generous to give me an explanation and offer a sample for me to try it! That's hospitality! :)After we ordered, we sat for no more than 7 minutes until our food arrived. We were the only customers, but 7 minutes for all the food we ordered came out to us brought by Tracy herself in pretty good time! We ordered the catfish and dark meat chicken combo. The combo came with 3 catfish filets, 1 leg, 1 drumstick and some fries. It didn't come with a drink though. That'd be nice if it did :) The catfish was fried in a corn meal kind of crust and had just the right amount of that fish-y taste and flakiness. Tasty, indeed! The fried chicken wasn't very different, but reminiscent of Popeye's. Popeye's is one of my favorite chicken places, so for me to say it's like Popeye's is a good thing. Fries are fries so there isn't much to mention about that. However, the perch, is something I'm new to and am probably going to replace catfish with it! Tracy's description of the perch was spot on: more meaty and a little bit saltier. Prepared the same as the catfish, the perch's flavor really broke through and collided with my taste buds!Tracy was very hospitable to let us try some of the perch already, but just when you though that was it, she came through with some freshly cooked shrimp that were te size of prawns! She told us to give them a try and let her know how they were. So, this goes out to Tracy: "The shrimp and perch was the BOMB!" :D This particular HC&F has potential to become something exceptional and definitely a local favorite! The space inside is large enough to host a live band on Friday or Satirday nights! Just a few ideas! :) Not only did the food have soul, but Tracy and her crew straight from Chicago had the spirit in them today too! I look forward to out next trip. Next time, we're bringing the whole crew down!A couple of weeks ago, I passed by this shopping center in my neighborhood and saw the sign "Harold's Chicken, Now Open!".  I thought to myself "That place sounds familiar, where do I know it from?"......a couple of weeks go by and I forgot about it.  Then, the other day I was starving and looking for a new joint to check out.  I looked on my Droid Yelp App and started doing a search for places....that's when I saw a review from Aljamin S on this place.  As soon as I read it, I remembered where I saw Harold's Chicken before.....in Southeast Chicago a couple of years ago.  I get really excited and call my friend in Vegas that's from Chicago who took me there.....he got excited and told me to get over there ASAP to check it out.When I pulled up, I saw a sign that mentioned they were from Chicago...I got excited.  I asked the cook who was standing next to the cashier if they were the same Harold's Chicken from Chicago...he said yes....JACKPOT!I eagerly ordered the 1/4 Chicken Dinner w/White Meat & Hot Sauce (2 Wings, 1 Breast, Fries, on top of a slice of White Bread, $5.99) and a Pizza Puff ($3.15).  After a short wait, they brought out my meal.....I opened up the bag with the Chicken and the smell of the Hot Sauce burned my sinuses....yes!  I couldn't wait to take a bite.  The Chicken and Fries drenched in Hot Sauce with the White Bread on the bottom to soak in the flavors was just as I remembered it in Chicago.  The Chicken was delicious and full of flavor.....my Hot Sauce tolerance has elevated since the last time I ate at Harold's, so the Hot Sauce tasted more mild to me than I remember....but it was good!  The Fries were soggy with the Hot Sauce....I forgot they did that and would have preferred them dry, my bad  I should have asked them to do that.  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!Next was the Pizza Puff....if you've been reading my reviews for a while, you'll know I love Pizza Puffs and will order one any time I can find it.  They serve the Il Taco brand Pizza Puffs here....which is what I'm familiar with from Chicago.  mmmm......Pizza Puff goodness, yes!  If you are unfamiliar with a Pizza Puff, imagine a wallet sized pocket of Pizza Dough, with Pizza Sauce, Cheese, and Sausage in the middle.....it's not a Calzone because the crust is much thinner and it has a distinctive taste and flavor to it.  It's also deep fried....although you can bake it as well.  Anyway, I suggest you try one if given the opportunity.Overall, it was an exciting day.  I called all of my Chicagoland friends who are transplants in Vegas to tell them about this place.Will I return?  Oh yeah!"Medicinal Fried Chicken"Sounds kinda funny, but I've been sick and the antibiotics made me even more crappy and the first thing I could think about was I want some fried chicken. It did hit the spot.The BF and I shared:A combo of white meat fried chicken & fried perch which was 3 big filets of fish, a breast and wing, 2 slices of white bread, and a handful of fries- plenty big portion. I was happy to find perch since I don't really see it often. It was pretty noms- fresh tasting and was juicy. Fried chicken was tasty with a good crisp and seasoned batter. Fries are pretty standard. We were curious of the pizza puff so we got also a pizza puff w/ fries. I've heard of it and finally got to try one.... it's like having a meat lasagna baked into a puff pastry crust. I'm not necessarily the pizza pocket type, but pretty decent stuff and I get why people like it. Drinks aren't from a fountain, but are bottled sodas. They do have a decent selection though. I saw they have fried livers and I kinda have a weak spot (probably literally- a nice and clogged spot) in my heart for that. I do wish they have gravy to dip em in, but that's just a personal preference I can't hold against them too much. Maybe I'll bring my own. Will be back for more fried fare!

PS has been getting a lot of my lunchtime business lately.Usually go for the sub, but on a whim, decided to order a Chipotle chicken wrap.  Why do they call it a wrap, because essentially, its a sandwich, in a burrito.I'd much rather be eating a "Sanrito", which makes me think of Hello Kitty.  Conversely, the "Burwich" makes me think of Burma, now called Myanmar, which makes me think of self-immolating monks... which brings me right back to the roasted chicken in this here wrap.

Restaurant name  Pan Asian

Review Text :
Pan Asian is a bit of a misnomer. This is one Asian restaurant that does not deserve to be panned. Good food. Great service. I'm definitely a fan of Pan.The interior is pretty tiny. There is a meager total of 12 chairs in the whole dining area (which was 75% full while we were there). I'm not sure what kind of capacity they can achieve in that space, but if Dal Lat can squeeze in seating for 34 in their tiny restaurant, Pan Asian could probably at least double their current seating chart.Anthony M and I both ordered the Massaman Curry - I went with beef while he got tofu. This curry dish is on the sweet side, but the heat balanced it out for me. It was a good serving size and I enjoyed everything about it. The large chunks of potato and carrot, the ample pieces of beef, and the flavorful curry all came together very well.For some reason, the chef offered us some fried banana on the house. It was a generous gesture, but it strangely took a long time to come out and quite honestly, I didn't really enjoy it. It's probably a Filipino thing, but thanks to Turon, any fried banana that doesn't come with jackfruit automatically falls short.Nevertheless, I enjoyed my meal and will definitely return to try other items. I was almost tempted to "pull a Misti" (yes, we are hereby coining a new phrase) i.e. I was tempted to come back for dinner on the same day. (I didn't).Pan Asian is literally just down the street from where I am currently living at. It has been opened for only 2-3 weeks and without a splashy and eye catching sign, it may be easy to drive past on Durango unless you are really looking for it.The restaurant has a large kitchen and prep area, but the dining area is comparatively small.  At the moment there are not too many tables and chairs setup (seating capacity is probably only at 16-20).  The interior is decorated simply but nicely.  The owner David Wong and his wife, the chef, are both super friendly.After my first spontaneous visit after just having had dinner at another new restaurant that recently opened just down he street, mainly based on Misti Y's positive comments about this new restaurant.  So I was looking to see what their menu offers and try some desserts.  The Thai dessert looks interesting, but I was told that it was not available that day and to try the Cheesecake Tempura. It was regular slice of cheesecake that was cut into smaller pieces and tempura fried. It has a different texture and if you enjoyed fried desserts, this one is probably something you should try.The next day I dropped by after a stop at the Costco Food Truck Fest #2, and tried the Massaman Chicken Curry.  It was tasty and the portion was generous. Before I left, the chef also gave me a large cup of longan tea (on the house)  that she brewed from dried longan that her relatives visiting from Thailand had brought her.  The flavor is sweet, as it was sweetened with brown sugar, and maybe that was why it also reminded me of the Winter Melon Tea that I used to drink when I was in Taiwan.  I really enjoyed the drink and the generous gesture.Day 3, I had a Sababa Groupon to redeem before it expires. So after finishing the Sababa Special, which I thought would fill me up, I still had room for dessert and dropped in again to see if Thai Sticky Rice and Mango would be on the menu.  Lucky for me, the chef said if I was willing to wait a few minutes, she will make it from scratch for me.  It was a simple and very traditional Thai dessert served especially during the summer, when mango are in season.  And My T and his wife just happened to drop in for dinner.  With a friendly couple that runs the restaurant and serving good food at reasonable prices, Pan Asian is already starting to get a decent Yelp following.  I know I will be back soon to try more of the menu.Decor:  4/5  Minimalist decorations that just works for the space.Food:  5/5 I enjoyed the food I have ordered thus far.  Service:  5/5  The owner and his wife, Chef Lisa, are both super friendly. Can't have a meal prepared and served to you by a nicer couple.Price/Value:  5/5  The price is fair and the portions are pretty generous. Lunch menu portion is the same as the dinner, so an even greater value.Location is super close by, and even after I move a little further away, still worth the detour back from work or to satisfy a Pan Asian craving.Swung by here for some takeout after Paolo's UYE Photowalk.  All I can say is yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!  I got the Massaman curry, Thai spicy chicken salad, and basil fried rice.  All the dishes were freshly, yet quickly made, and soooo good.  I think my favorite was the spicy chicken salad, but everything was super tasty.Friendly owners and they sing!  Whatever's playing, they sing along.  So cute!  I think they were singing Come Together by the Beatles when I left.  Awesome.  Yelp comes through again.Oh, and there is free wifi.  I don't know if it's a mistake or it's coming from another business, but it's there.  Yay!Vegas has weird weather at times and last week it was windy and cold, the perfect weather for soup. I just didn't know what, and I didn't want to go far for it.  I asked my cousin and he suggested Pan Asian. Looking at the menu, everything listed looked so appetizing.  I wanted to try them all.  My budget for that day for lunch wasn't more than $6 so I ordered Tom Kha soup made with coconut, chicken, some different herbs I've never seen or tasted before, lemon grass, and amongst other things.  It was the exact kind of goodness I just needed on a cold windy day.  The sour taste was just perfect and not overpowering the whole dish.  Everything together was combined well.  The service was also comforting as the employees all were very patient, and easy to talk to.  It's also great to be able to speak with the chef.  It's rare that chefs talk to their patrons anymore.  It definitely was a nice change.I am curious about their penang curry and the other curries they're serving.Ding ding ding, we have a winner folks!  First of all, thanks to Misti and the crew for finding yet another gem.  This place advertises itself as an Asian fusion restaurant, but at its core it is a gourmet, mostly authentic Thai restaurant.  And you know how I love Thai food...  We ordered the Massaman Curry with beef, the Rad Nah with pork, and the Vietnamese Shrimp Ravioli.  After eating these, I am convinced that this is one of the top three Thai restaurants in Las Vegas, maybe top two!  (UPDATE: This is THE BEST Thai restaurant in Vegas currently).The Vietnamese Shrimp Ravioli were quite interesting as an appetizer.  The presentation was very gourmet and beautiful.  The ravioli noodles were soft and sticky, wrapped in a shrimp that's cooked in interesting spices.  The flavor was perfect with a little bit of red chili sauce on it (I skipped the soy sauce that came with it).  Not Thai, I know, but definitely yummy.I am not really a fan of Massaman because it tends to be sweet, but with all of the talk about it here, I thought I would try it.  This version was sweet, as it is supposed to be, but it also had a ridiculously intriguing and complex flavor!  There was a definite peanut flavor, but also another flavor that I couldn't put my finger on.  The chef makes her own curries, so I attribute this complex flavor to the homemade curry sauce.  I probably would order this with less sweetness next time, but this dish was amazing.  It came with big potato slices, carrots cooked to perfection, bell peppers, and beef chunks that were nicely prepared.  The Rad Nah here is extremely good, and won me over.  This is probably tied for the second best Rad Nah I have had!  The cook said that it was one of her favorite dishes, and so she takes a lot of pride in her recipe.  This dish smelled absolutely amazing.  Smokey, lightly sweet aromas.  The taste was just as good.  The pork was nice and juicy, and the Chinese broccoli was fresh and crunchy.  The sauce was slightly more rich than the other two great Rad Nah recipes I have had, which gave it its own character.  Not a lot of places can make a great Rad Nah, and Pan Asian makes one of the best I have had.  Great job, Pan Asian.I am so glad to have this restaurant available in Las Vegas.  I will have to take some breaks from my usual spots to explore their menu some more.  The Thai food is mostly authentic, but they do have to Americanize certain dishes a little bit.  So, if you want the real deal, just order it "Thai style".  We rattled off a few exotic dishes that we like, and the chef said that some of them she can cook very well (very spicy Pa Cha).  I can't wait to go back!Edit: I've been back a number of times and have loved every dish I have had (roast duck, red snapper).  One dish really stood out yesterday though, the red curry.  I had it with beef, spicy level 10, and it came with fresh peppers and pieces of pumpkin!  It wasn't as sweet as the other curries, so you non-sweet curry lovers will enjoy this one!  The sauce is homemade, and full of fresh flavors.  I believe that it may be the best red curry I have ever had.  Dave said that this is how the royal family eats red curry.  I don't know about royalty, but if this dish isn't fit for it than I don't know what is!Second Edit: recommended dishes for Thai food lovers, may not be on the menu: the Red Curry dishes (served with fresh pumpkin!), Pa Cha with tilapia, Red Snapper, Duck curry, fried banana.The family has been planning to come back since our visit Mothers Day.  I figured since I've been twice in a row this week, I should write a update.I planned to have lunch with my mom and grandma in law and they were suggesting to come back. They wanted the Stir Fried Linguini and Massaman again. This was definitely a test in consistency and it was right on and just as good. This time the massaman had avocado pieces which made it even better for me! I also tried the Chicken Tom Khar. Lisa (chef/owner) came and said it wasn't coming out the way she wants with consistency since she changed and tried a different coconut milk. I thought it was still good as the flavor of the spices came through and made up for a lack of creaminess from the coconut milk. I guess the BF felt shafted we went without him so we went for lunch the very next day. We had pork pad se ew which had a great flavor. The noodles were a little sticky, but I rather like sticky noodles than the usually greasy treatment of this dish at other places. We got chicken red curry. This is different than most reds I've had, less thick and a bit more watery but the flavor is much more complex. I loved the addition of eggplant and squash to this dish as those went well with the curry flavor. I love meat, but I equally love vegetables that are fresh so it's a big plus for me that the curries here isn't all sauce and meat. The BF and I had a good talk with Lisa about her food and a bit about their past restaurants and such. I loved that she said that since they don't have overhead they spend it on proper good ingredients because it's about the customers. That good food needs good ingredients to become a superior dish. If only every single business adopted that instead of cutting corners on ingredients they might have solid dishes and avid fanbases! And it's not like she is just saying that....we can see her cook and I see that their ingredients are quality (like our Thai Tea had organic Horizon milk) and fresh (herbs from their garden, fresh kefir instead of dried they obtain from LA, Melissa's produce). Considering the quality for the price, it is a steal of a meal! Many places charge about this much for much less quality. I LOVE this place! It feels so comfortable to dine here with how friendly they are. It's like being in the Wong's home. This is THE BEST Thai food I've had in the city and reminds me of some great Thai food giants in Los Angeles (if you didn't know- has the largest population of Thai in the US) solid Thai home cooking. I thought Thai Grill solved all my Thai food answers here in Vegas, but I think this has definitely bumped to my number one.  I rarely endorse a place this hard, but if you are gonna read any of my reviews and decide to go to a place, I hope I influence you to give this humble place a try. A small UYE coming soon so check the calendars!*This is a tribute to Misti Y.*I just HAD to go to Pan Asian before my Texas vacation, so I steered myself here which made me also have to go back to Patisserie Manon and buy every flavor of macaron to take on the plane back to the French mama.The owners of Pan Asian are super sweet.  Chef Lisa has a great name, doesn't she?  I was the only one there, and I told them my friend Misti recommended them so highly that I drove from the other side of town!Some things Chef Lisa and her husband said:"Misti sure has a lot of friends!""Misti just ate here yesterday!"...and when I ordered the massaman curry with fried tofu, "Misti prefers her massaman with steamed tofu."So I smiled and giggled, and enjoyed that Misti is like the fabric of the restaurant (well, there are brick floors but you know what I mean).The massaman was unlike any massaman I ever had.  I am used to thick, dark, and sweet coconut-milk based sauce.  This sauce was savory, almost buttery, and thin.  I am not sure how I feel about the butter instead of the coconut flavor.  However, it was CHOCK full of big chunks of veggies (potatoes, red peppers, green peppers, carrots, onions), crisp peanuts, ripe avocado, and then of course, the tofu.The spice was right on.  I told them I was going to Thailand and Cambodia for my honeymoon and wanted to keep up with the heat.  My nose ran, always a good sign.  Lisa's husband told me he lived in Cambodia, and Lisa told me about her travels in Phuket.  The lunch special came with a canned drink, which I found out after I got Thai iced tea, so I ended up with 2 drinks.  However, I got my can of coke served with a straw, and for anyone who knows I drink soda through a straw, that is pretty cool.I definitely want to come back and try other dishes.  The atmosphere is pretty and clean, the owners warm, the food spicy and tasty.  And even if Misti isn't physically there, she is definitely "there"!I came here yesterday for lunch with one of my gfs.I was really excited to try out this new hot spot with awesome reviews.I was really bummed out with lunch yesterday and will not be coming back.We ordered pad thai with chicken and singapore noodles with chicken. Both dishes were horrible. I'm a huge pad thai noodle fan and was not impressed at all. Both were lunch specials ranging around $7. On the other hand, my gf thought it was good.Parking and seating wasn't a problem.Our server which could be the manager/owner was nice but then forced the issue of us coming back tomorrow... which I told him I live very far and he insisted I still come back. Ummm no thanks.I wouldn't recommend coming here and I won't be back. Such a bummer, I was hoping to find a new lunch spot.Sorry Pan Asian... Next!A majorly delayed review, I have eaten at Pan Asian at least 6 times since it opened and I have to say, if you want a noodle dish, go with the Thai Linguine with vegetables. This dish is one of the best looking (and tasting) bowls of noodles I've ever experienced. The pasta is perfectly al dente and the dish is wok seared in a light soy-sauce with spice level dialed to request. The veggies are bright and fresh: red/green bell peppers, white onions, sliced tomatoes and asparagus. This is THE dish to crave, and Chef Lisa describes it as her 'favorite' as well. First-timers are making a big mistake not ordering this one. The woks are perfectly seasoned at Pan Asian. No weird aftertastes from cheap sesame oil or five-spice here. This is something to take note of anytime there is a wok involved. Do the right thing - GET THE LINGUINE, spice level 3 and you will be good to go.Pan Asian. Which means go spicy or go home!Me and the wifey wanted to try this place out finally after driving by it so many times. The one time I actually stopped by to try them was when they went on vacation for almost 2 months. I guess everybody deserves some time off especially if you have your own restaurant. After looking over the menu I decided to go with the Chicken in Spicy Garlic Sauce. The wifey was not all that hungry so she went with the Spicy Tom Yum Soup. Now back to my very first statement. Our server asked us how spicy we wanted the soup. He said choose from 1 to 3. Now from what I remember skimming on some of the reviews, their spiciness is hotter than the norm. So when my wife wanted 3 I politely interrupted her and said to go for a 1. Im glad we did because after tasting the soup, (which was awesome btw) my lips were burning. Combine that with the Chicken in Garlic sauce, wow! That in itself was spicy. Im glad my dish came with a bowl of white steamed rice because if it didn't, I would literally have steam coming from my head!Now im assuming not all they have on their menu is burn a hole in your stomach spicy but once I was done with my meal, my clothes were all soggy with sweat, like I just came from the gym. Now if I can actually lose weight while eating here, then I am set! Who said multi tasking was hard?As for service, we got our order pretty quick. But then again there were only two other tables being served. So next time the real test is when they are packed. Which means more trips to try other awesome food on their menu!The only thing I thought that stuck out were the prices. We only ordered two items, but with tax and tip it was about 21 bucks. I think that's why lunch time is a hit here with the lunch specials.  Im kind of glad it was spicy because I probably would have ordered more food. Needless to say, we left satisfied.Although very out of the way for me, I happened to be in the neighborhood while going to see my hair stylist. I was a little bit early so I decided to grab a quick lunch. I saw the ratings and thought this was the place. The service was solid and the prices were pretty standard. It was on a weekend, so I did not see the super awesome lunch special deals that some raved about. I ordered my go to dish that allows me to best gauge a new place - drunken noodles with chicken. These were probably the best drunken noodles I've had out of countless places that I have already tried. The price was around $11 and we also shared the calamari appetizer which was delicious at the time, but pretty forgettable. I wouldn't drive across town for the calamari, but I would go for their drunken noodles every time I am in the area to get my hair done (once a month on average). I heard the waiter make curry recommendations to other patrons, so after I have had my fill of the drunken noodles, I may venture on to the curry.Move over Lotus of Siam, there's a new kid in town! I was introduced to this place by one of my favorite bloggers, Wendy C. of  http://wendyfulworld.com/  She was on the money! David Wong's is now my go-to Thai in Las Vegas. His signature dishes, the Shrimp Mango Salad and Crispy Duck in Red Curry, are out of this world! The Pad See Yew and Pineapple Fried Rice are also authentic and tasty. They have a numbering system of 1 to 10, but beware, 5 is incredibly spicy!The bonus is you can bring your own wine or beer here, no corkage. I wanted to try their Mango with Sticky Rice but they were out. We ordered Fried Banana instead, but that was a disappointment. Guess we'll just have to come back for the Mango with Sticky Rice!HAPPY LUNCHI once lived along Florida's Gold Coast and so did Pan Asian's David Wong. And I've been to Thailand multiple times in recent years. We chatted a bit about the cost of living in Bangkok and how it's become so expensive to live there. David also mentioned one of the reasons he moved to LAS from Naples, FL.  Snow birds aren't full time residents and his restaurant business needed full time customers.Being that I'm from Hendertucky, it's a long trek no matter how I wanted to zig zag across the valley streets. Fortunately, I had a few appointments on the west side of the valley and so it was a must that I try Pan Asian.David Wong is a very charismatic man especially with his friendly Thai demeanor. We decided not to order from the lunch categories but from the dinner selections. Of course the Pad See Ew with pork is a must and for a market test his Panang curry with eggplant and chicken. We sort of came in at the tail end of the lunch rush, so our lunch arrived post haste. The aroma from the simple dishes were irresistibly enticing that Yu-go chauffeur almost didn't take his photos of our meal. By way of David's advice we ask that the Thai heat (spiciness) of three be applied.  We're talking three out of ten.I have to say we were most impressed with the wok skills of Lily, David's wife. Ingredients meeting at the right temperature that enabled the Thai spices to meld into a consistent experience of Thai cuisine in it's intended full fragrance and taste.Now that I've eaten here,  I can further appreciate David Wong's other advice while he was serving our lunch: "Children, do not fight for the food." with a smile. Let's just say both dishes were crazy good.The BEST Thai in town. Not just in my hood, but the best period. I'm not usually regretful but I'm seriously upset that I just recently discovered this gem. The Massaman curry is amazing. With big chunks of sweet potato and buttery avocado, "It's the best Jerry, the best!" Spicy #7 is ALL I can handle. They do 1-10 on the spicy scale and we're talking serious heat here. If my Thai food doesn't cause a runny nose, I don't wanna eat it. David Wong's does the trick every time. If you order spicy #5 at your usual Thai joint, you probably wanna cut that down to about a #2 at Pan Asia. If you LIKE Thai food, try David Wong's, and you will LOVE Thai food.It's been a while since I've returned to Pan Asian, but I don't know why.  This place still serves up some great food.  My friends and I came in for lunch on a recent Friday after a morning of training; food tastes even better when it's recovery food, IMHO.  The lunch specials are still a good option. We shared the still fabulously refreshing tiger shrimp mango salad and I had the chicken panang lunch.  My only gripe is that brown rice is $2.50; really?  I am not willing to pay that much.  Other than that, I still love this place and I really won't wait so long to eat here again.Oh yes, it is true, I have found a new favorite Thai place. And yes I will drive back to the complete other side of town for this spice again, and again, and again. I was dining solo, and on Durango so I figured  would take my fellow Elite yelper Shawn's recommendation for Thai. I walked into Pan Asian and was greeted and told to sit anywhere. As I went over the menu, I couldn't help but hear the table of 6 across from me talk about this place and "their spice level". One guy said how he won't go over a level 5. If you know me, and spicy, I was instantly intrigued! I ordered some pot stickers (some of the best I have ever had) and the order of garlic and black pepper chicken, level 8. The boss/server guy looked at me and said "here, level 8 is very spicy, not like other Thai" I simply looked back, smiled, and said "GOOD."When my plate arrived I could see the spicy. I started to get a bit nervous but then brushed it off. I was there alone, and I just told the boss I can handle it, can't wimp out now! It was perfection! Yes I may have ordered a 2nd Thai iced tea, and my eyes may have been a bit watery at times. But did I finish it? YES. Will I order it again? HELL YES. I love being the white girl who impresses the old Thai people. When my guy came to check on me he asked if it was too spicy, I told him it indeed was spicy, but perfectly spicy. It's about time there is a place I can brag about to my friends when they want a real heat level. Good quality Thai food, and great service. I can't wait to return and try something else!!All these raving reviews must be from non Asians or Asians with bad taste. This place is at best mediocre. Greasy. Small portions compared to what real Chinese restaurants offer. And a grab bag of Asian cuisines all clumped under 1 roof. You don't see a "Pan European" anywhere and hear the French exclaiming how delicious the food is.New favorite restaurant! I was on the hunt for spicy food, some of my fellow yelpers recommended this place so I decided to give Pan Asian a try. As a starter we ordered the Gyoza, it was good, crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. For my main meal I ordered the linguini noodles with chicken, my palate is very sensitive so on the scale of 1 to 10 of spiciness I ordered a 2. Let's just say I'm ordering a 1 next time. The noodles were amazing though, they were packed with a lot of flavor and a great amount of kick, my nose was running like niagara falls the entire meal. I'm not sure what noodles my husband ordered but he did order the noodles a level 8, he said he liked them as well but was expecting the noodles to be spicier, he's going with a level 10 next time. For dessert we ordered the deep fried cheesecake, it's like a slice of Heaven in your mouth, its so rich and creamy and it's served with whipped cream and ice cream. Overall we loved our entire meal, and the staff was extremely friendly! Plus it's inexpensive, for an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks, and dessert, we only spent $38. I highly recommend Pan Asian, I can't wait to come again and try more of their dishes.This tiny restaurant packs big flavor! Feeding my cold, I had the filet mignon pho (I ordered small, which I still didn't finish). I ordered it at a spice level of "2". I'm a heat wimp, so this was actually still a bit much for me, but it sure cleared the sinuses! My friend ordered the chicken rice noodle soup (but he kept poaching from my bowl, so the clear star of this dining experience was indeed the pho). The service was extremely fast. Our server was super cute, and I will definitely come back!I am really surprised at the high ratings for this place. I came here three times thinking maybe the next time will be better. I have ordered Tom Yum Goong, a grilled shrimp mango salad, and a Filet Mignon pho. The Tom Yum Goong was just awkward with the glass noodles & big onion slices. It wasn't the Tom Yum Goong I was used to. The shrimp mango salad tasted fishy. I wasn't sure if they put too much fish sauce or if it was from the shrimp.For my most recent visit. I went with their $5.95 pho. I ordered a spice level 5 which turned out to be too spicy. Call me a wimp but I couldn't finish the broth because it was too spicy. I enjoy a little kick but not too much to the point where it's painful to enjoy and eat. That's why I ordered a spice level in the middle. Their Thai version of pho was not my thing either. I'll just stick with traditional pho. Note, the $5.95 bowl is kid size. You'll probably be hungry after.The lunch specials does not include soup, egg roll, and a fried wonton like the other Thai restaurants so that's another negative for me. Service was slow the first two times and OK the last visit. If you enjoy extremely spicy food and your butt being on fire, you might enjoy this place. Not for me.I was visiting my best friend in Vegas and met her for lunch here. I let her do the ordering because she obviously knew what was up (she comes here like once a week!). Honestly, I had low expectations because it's totally unassuming, but OMG their pad thai is sooooooooooooooooooooo so so so so good! Saucy and flavorful and so damn fire, I loved it!!! Might even be better than the pad thai at my favorite spot in Thai Town, LA! I also really enjoyed their tom kah. Would highly recommend Pan Asian for anyone in Vegas craving bomb Thai food.

I visit this place at least once a week, because I think that it's important to support small businesses and the food is good. However, the last three weeks I have had the unpleasant experience of having my order taken and rung up by a young lady who seemed bothered to have to be working there. I think that she is the daughter of the owners and she has been very rude all three times that I have encountered her. The other employees are all lovely and chatty and the food is excellent. Unfortunately I am going to have to give up on this place because this young lady does not understand that being rude to customers is not good for business. I will spend my money somewhere else.

Review Text :
Looking down & spying the bright "Red Velvet Cafe" sign from the upper floor of the Fashion Show mall had me doing a quick search for the closest escalator. If one wasn't nearby, I was considering jumping over the rail and Spidermanning it down to this beacon of red velvet in the middle of a mall. Was I bored with shopping? Sure. Was it time for Red Velvet? It's ALWAYS time for red velvet, foo.Well, guess what? This isn't just any old corner bakery red velvet cupcake or Grandma's Christmas cake either. It's a Vegan Red Velvet Cake. Yep, VEGAN. Giddy-up cause I'm getting one to eat right then and there. The lady at the counter brought it to our table with two forks and couple glasses of water. The individual cake costs $5.50 and is perfect for sharing or just eating by yourself. Olivia Z. and I split it since we were heading to a buffet in a couple hours.Soooooo... how was it? Oh, you mean the Vegan Red Velvet Cake. It was great. I don't know how they do it without butter and such, but the flavor was rich, the cake moist, and the frosting near perfect. If you are sick of the uber-sweet fake red velvet at your local supermarket, the Vegan Red Velvet Cake at Red Velvet Cafe is a treat. Sure, they have other stuff like sandwiches, salads, coffee, and juices, but save room for a healthier and yummier take on a classic American dessert - the Red Velvet Cake.This review is for both Red Velvet Cafe locations.I'm not saying they don't serve delicious healthy food. I'm not saying their sweets are yummy. They are, for that, I'm giving 2 stars. However, I won't be returning to either locations again.http://www.reviewjournal...To summarize really quick, this article tells about how people LOVED Red Velvet Cafe's infamous chocolate cookies, which claim to be only 27 calories each. Too good to be true? Yes. A Las Vegas author had these cookies analyzed and found out they were actually 157 calories! So the six-pack of cookies Red Velvet claims to be only 162 calories is actually 942 calories. Read the article and judge for yourself.I've had Red Velvet vegan cakes many times, the ones that are supposed vegan and around 200 calories. As I try to stay fit and eat a sensible diet, I always appreciate establishments who offer vegan healthy alternatives. However, if I find a food I really want it, I'll buy it, sometimes regardless of if it's low-calorie. I'll eat a 900-calorie triple chocolate cake if that's what I really crave, but at least I KNOW how much I'm eating.I know that not all eateries provide their nutritional information on their food. I understand some recipes are kept secret. However, if you are going to be proud to claim how low calorie your delicious chocolate cookies are, they better be true!I just don't appreciate the dishonesty Red Velvet Cafe displayed. People rely on accurate information on what they eat, if that information is available. Now, I cannot trust anything Red Velvet Cafe says about any of their food. Can you? Their food may be delicious, but their actions left a bad taste in my mouth.I'm slightly embarrassed to admit I've been buying cookies from the Red Velvet Café for years. My girlfriend, too. We're both health-conscious people, and we were attracted to the cookies' low calorie count. "Red Velvet Café's Famous Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies: Approximately 27 cookies & 1 gram of fat per cookie!!!," read the sign--look for yourself. That equates to 162 calories per six-cookie box. The more I thought about it, the more it seemed too good to be true.And it was; a food chemical breakdown test, conducted by the Pacific Coast Analytical Services, showed that Red Velvet Café's cookies actually contain 157 calories each. So when I thought I as eating a 162-calorie box of your cookies, I was actually eating a 942-calorie box.I learned about this last week, in the Review-Journal. And a couple weeks before that, I began to grow suspicious myself, so I snapped the picture shown above. I also took a secret video of a Café employee walking me through the BS calorie counts of the various baked goods. Then a guy--I believe he's the bakery's co-owner--assured me that the cookies had been tested after baking, and the calorie count was 160. A total lie.A week ago I went to the Café to ask for my money back. I gave my info to the assistant manager, who assured me I'd hear back by Tuesday. Tuesday came and I never heard back. So I'm suing.Am I crazy for wanting my money back? The way I see it, I didn't get the food item for which I bargained. Am I crazy for thinking Red Velvet Café needs to be punished (through punitive damages) for its outrageous, egregious untruth? I don't care whether they were willfully deceiving or just reckless with the truth; I just care that these people are punished for all the years they made money on a total lie. I'm suing them in Clark County's Small Claims Court now.Vegas is not known very well for its extensive vegan options, so I was happy to hear that a vegan-friendly cafe was minutes away from the Trump Hotel, where I was staying. All I had to do was skip across the street, make it through the mall, and there it was!It is very cute, in an open are in the center of the mall. There seems to be plenty of seating, and rows of desserts lining the shelves.Not everything is vegan, but they do specialize in vegan food and desserts. I didn't get a chance to try any of the desserts, but I decided to splurge on my meal.I got the veggie panini-vegan style. That means they use the vegan pesto and vegan daiya cheese instead. She asked if I wanted to add vegan chicken in for a few dollars more, but I opted out because I felt like the flavors in the sandwich were probably rich and filling already. I stuck with the salad, but added on the plain roasted potatoes on the side.It is on the pricier side, especially if you decide to start adding ingredients. ($3 potatoes here, $3 faux chicken, $1 avocado, etc.)I should have splurged a bit even more and added the chicken and went for the seasoned potatoes.The sandwich was good, but nothing extraordinary. It quickly got soggy and the flavors were surprisingly not rich and filling. It felt like it was missing something. The pesto just fell flat. But it wasn't bad, I still enjoyed it.The salad was overdressed, and the dressing itself was nothing to write about.The potatoes, advertised as roasted, were nothing more than steamed potatoes. I like that they use exotic potatoes, such as red, blue, yellow, etc. But the fact that it was simply steamed meant that it didn't have a hearty "roasted" flavor, not was it seasoned at all. Very very bland.In the end, it was not unenjoyable, but nothing too memorable. A bit overpriced, but what isn't in Las Vegas. I'm just glad I was able to find something to eat so close to my hotel!Friendly staff, good food (not great) but in my opinion not worth the price. It was $40 for our bill for 3 people (we ordered a veggie pizza, a veggie wrap, and 2 juices all to share). KUDOS to being a good vegetarian option! They have non-vegetarian dishes on the menu as well.  I understand that it's the Fashion Show Mall, thus I shouldn't expect cheap prices but the food in my opinion wasn't delicious enough for me to pay that much. I would recommend looking at the food court or go up the elevators towards Auntie Anne's for a more wallet-friendly mall-session meal.

Restaurant name  China Poblano

Review Text :
What do Mao Tse Tung and Frida Kahlo have in common?  Besides their intimate connections to communism and controversial personal lives, they also both appear as projected photographic wall art at China Poblano.  I adore Frida and collect mementos from her life.  I can't say the same for Mao but don't mind seeing his picture every so often at this restaurant.  China Poblano has a fresh concept, delicious food that mixes quality ingredients with creative combinations, and an artistic urban atmosphere.If you come alone, sit at the bar, it's communal and gives you a peek into the kitchen with cooks demonstrating their skills.  If you come with a group, sit by the wall with exhibits of colorful Chinese masks and Mexican figurines, which appear surprisingly similar when displayed together, (these tables also have cushioned benches that are much more comfortable than the ones under photographs of Mao & Frida).Everything is tapas style, we discovered about 2 items per person is a good amount of food.  Scallop dumplings are very tasty and served in authentic bamboo steamers.  I also love the Dan Dan Mian, wheat noodles in a spicy ground pork sauce.  Hot & sour soup has real content, not just broth.  But my favorite is the Singapore Sling, their signature cocktail.  It's very good gin paired with pineapple juice that they make in house plus other delicious things that come together for a fabulous concoction.They did forget a couple of our orders so it seems like management is still settling in.  All forgivable under this prismatic fun house where I can eat delectable fusion food.Everything is pretty small and served like tapas, but somehow its surprisingly filling.  There were definite highs and lows to this meal, but I think there were a few dishes that excelled while only a few weren't quite what we had hoped for.There was a big group of us so I managed to sample quite a big portion of the menu.Highlights:Carnitas tacos-served with guac, pork rinds, and a verde sauce!Like water for Chocolate- fried quail served with dragonfruit and edible flowers.  Chilaquilles- tortilla chips cooked in a pan with a salsa verde and cheese.  Kinda like nachos.Mango "sticky rice"- this is something quite interesting.  The sticky rice part was made into a mousse and ripe mangoes.  I've never seen this before and it was really cool.  The "rice" element were like rice crispies on top.  Chocolate "terrain"- Awesome chocolate mold of a Chinese soldier with a spicy chocolate mousse inside.  It was served with cookie crumbs to look like sand, and a ginger ice cream that was spicy and sweet all at the same time.Things to skip:Oceans Nest- fried noodles served with stirfried saucy seafood and veggies.  We ate all the lobster out of it and then left it there.  It was super bland.Lamb potstickers- pretty presentation with the little edible flowers and everything but it was bland and looked more exciting than it tasted.Overall, I thought the place had a whimsy to it that I thought was fun.  The ambiance was interesting and diverting, the waitress and wait staff were helpful and went out of their way to see to our requests.  While some of the food is a bit overpriced and small, I really enjoyed their desserts, there is something light hearted and comical about them.  They were the highlight of the meal.  If nothing else, come and have dessert and a laugh all at the same time.Allow me to preface, i seldom give 1 or 2 stars: A lot had to be missing for any dining establishment to fall in this category. it was a saturday night at the Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino.  H and I were in a hurry to grab a quick bite before heading to the Marquee Night club.  The cafe would surely prepare a hearty meal, but as the minutes ticked away, we knew that time was not on our side.  Luckily (or unluckily in this case) China Poblano jumped out of nowhere and had a sign that said "to go or take out."  instantly, i'm thinking it's kinda like Taco Bell fast, but let's just say that we're lucky to get our food in less than 20 minutes.the menu was a fusion of chinese and mexican food.  unique? not really.  anybody can make any type of meat and throw it in a tortilla shell and call it mexican food.  anybody creating this type of concept needs to think it through to create a unique dining experience for everyone who passes through the doors.  come'on, people travel from all over the world to come to vegas.  is this is best meal the Cosmo can offer?  i believe not.THE PORK SIU MAI were a disgrace to Chinese people who invented this dish.   i have eaten this all my life in OC & LA & even SF and have never seen anything so tiny.  it was literally the size of a quarter, all 6 of them, looking pretty sad and lonely in this takeout container that it was tossed into.  no shredded lettuce or cabbage for garnishment.  just 6 puny little siu mai's squished to the corner of the container.  i finished them in 2 minutes and naturally was not full at all.  the taste -- it was ok, not spectacular.THE TACOS that H had were another dismal dish that appeared from the same menu.  i can't quite comment on the taste but the size was disappointing.the prices.... were not cheap. both microscopic & macroscopic items came in slightly less than $30.  what?  does money grow on trees?  Asians are taught to get the best bang for the buck and to bargain our way through life... this time i felt jipped & helpless.  left the establishment with a more than half empty stomach & feeling robbed.THE EXPERIENCE:ok, granted we order takeout, but there was no place to sit outside in the hallways of the hotel.  it's just not sexy or classy to eat in the hallways.  meanwhile inside, the bar was completely empty (as in zero, zip, zilch, nada patrons).  We asked the girl cleaning the bar if we could please sit there for a few minutes, and she said yes. then, like a bat out of hell, the hostess stormed over and said we cannot sit there.  what?  did you not realize we were not fighting for seats but actually making your establishment appear fuller than it is?  so, she escorted us to these benches behind the bar with pillows that we could sit in.  for all the commotion that she caused by moving us, we could've finished our food in the 2 minutes that it requires to consume our so-called meal.IN CONCLUSION:this place is not suitable in such a gorgeous hotel as the Cosmopolitan.  it does not compare to its elegance, its grandeur, and its sophistication.  the people who work there need to grace better manners and accommodate its patrons a little better.i would highly suggest you save your money and go to the cafe downstairs or win a couple of hands in blackjack and eat at Blue Ribbon Sushi or STK instead.Picky eaters do not apply. To enjoy this place, you have to be an adventurous eater.  If you just get chips, queso fundido, or a pork bun, you will not be happy.  For foodies who won't turn their nose up at a beef tendon taco, this is the place for you!  Super creative food and a great bargain for what you get.  We started out with the Pozole Rojo ($9) which is a spicy shredded pork soup with chickpeas, cabbage, pork rinds, chopped onions, radish, and avocado.  This was a really good portion size for $9 and so tasty.  You can get it with a shot of tequila for an extra $3 but our server didn't recommend it unless we just wanted to do a tequila shot. Apparently the tequila is offered for hangovers.  Hair of the dog, you know.Next we tried the Viva China taco ($5.50 each) which has beef tendon, a Kumamoto oyster, and Sichuan sauce.  Yes, beef tendon in a taco.  This was extremely tasty.  I could eat ten of these.We also tried the Cochinita Taco ($4.50 each).  It's pretty much pork and pickled onions.  Pretty good, but the Carnitas taco topped with pork rinds is so much better.Another great dish was the Papas with XO sauce ($6).  French fries covered in a dried scallop sauce.  They serve it with lime, which you think would be awful.  But it's actually really, really good!The big surprise of the night was the Gaspacho Morelia ($10).  This is a huge plate of very fresh, very tasty fruit covered in freshly squeezed orange juice.  Some of the fruit had some spicy seasoning on it, which enhanced the flavor of the fruit.  Pineapple, watermelon, mango, jicama, dragonfruit, strawberries, and queso fresca. Very good and light.The cocktails are also very inventive.  I don't think I can ever have a normal margarita again after having the salt air margarita ($12) served here.  The salt foam is a perfect compliment to the margarita and doesn't have the harsh taste of salt on the rim.  My husband had the lychee sour ($12) which was also very good.  $63 before tip and we were very, very full.  Service was impeccable and very friendly.  Just focus on the more creative dishes.  Yeah, you can get a pork bun in Chinatown for cheaper.  Of course you can get a carne asada taco at a taco truck for cheaper.  Come here for the creative dishes that you can't get anywhere else.My traveling companions decided to go and get pampered at a hotel spa and rely on a trained professional to provide some comfort into their lives, but I nixed that idea because for me comfort comes in the form of good food passing from my mouth to my belly.I found myself exploring the Cosmopolitan on my own when I came upon this unique second floor restaurant which announced Chinese food in one window and Mexican food in another.  I stopped to study the menu and learned it was exactly what I thought it to be, a restaurant specializing in dim sum, noodles and tacos.Since I was dining alone I was seated at the dim sum bar where I had a front row seat watching the ladies prepare, fill and fold fresh dumplings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=zE32BWJoqOAZL4TmaNlT3w) and roll out fresh hand-cut noodles.  I decided to order from both the Chinese and Mexican menus in order to sample the cuisine a little bit better.For starters I ordered one of two Agua Frescas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=W60P4p4WhAKZMHqhVyGHmw) available at the time choosing one made of blood oranges and pomegranates.  From the Dim Sum menu I selected the Sui Mai Scallops made up of ground pork, bamboo, mushrooms and peanuts and the Har Gau which combined shrimp and pork belly in its filling.  From the Tacos menu I selected an individual Carnitas taco and the Pescado Frito taco.  I agreed to have my selections brought out as they were prepared.The Pescado Frito (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=8cIp34h9uM_xmdh4LajsUg) taco arrived first.  On paper this was supposed to be fried fish and a Mexican salsa, but the fish I had inside my taco certainly didn't seem fried.  No matter its preparation I liked it as the flaky fish was bursting with flavor and hot juices running amok.  This was a very simple but very good fish taco.The Carnitas taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=9WJy0kQq33M7dBVaCtAbNw) was up next.  This was braised baby pork, creamy guacamole, chicharrones and lime at its best.  When the server told me this was her favorite it took me just one bite to understand why.  If I really wanted to pig out I could have easily devoured another three of these.The dim sum were served in individual bamboo steamers with the lids left on until I was ready to enjoy.  This helped keep the little morsels hot and steamy while I worked on my tacos.I had the Har Gau (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=ugVecr8s4E13Ak4f0t3P8w) first.  These were quite unique as there was actually a pocket of broth inside the chewy, translucent shell much like what is usually experienced with xiao lung baos.  The shrimp was so fresh it was crunchy and while I didn't notice anything special with the added pork belly the juicy har gau was delicious enough to stand on its own.I saved the Sui Mai Scallops (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=OG_yUcneFS9wu0I9ejqQLg) for last.  These were easily some of the most eye-appealing sui mais I've ever had topped with a bit of tobiko and some micro greens.  In terms of flavor and originality it was another winner.  The soft peanuts mixed in with the pork and the mushrooms gave these a very pleasant earthiness.  I enjoyed each one slowly, and stayed in my seat contemplating the delicious food I just sampled until it was time to meet up with my friends again.Uh, guys, I won't be joining you for dinner tonight.  I'm stuffed!!When I first saw China Poblano, I thought it was just some gussied up Chinese joint at the Cosmopolitan.  When I looked a little closer, I realized it was some kind of combo Mexican-Chinese restaurant.  When I checked them out on my phone, I learned they were a Jose Andres creation.  When my friends suggested them for lunch, I was game.  When we were done, I was sorely unimpressed.Now, it's probably my fault for assuming, but looking at the place, I was under the impression that China Poblano offered a fusion of Chinese and Mexican food.  In reality, they mostly offer Chinese AND Mexican food.  As in, one and the other.  Not as in, a melding of two very different cuisines.  Disappointing enough already, but that also meant having to get two things in order to try both sides of the menu.  After asking the waiter for suggestions, I took his advice and ordered a couple of tacos to go with my noodle dish (he warned that the portions were "small-ish"):- Dan Dan Mian (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=1znpnNpUi4mUde6NTXRxEA) - underwhelming.  The noodles themselves were okay and I liked how the pork sauce was actually spicy, but the dish seemed salty.  Really, the only flavors I could really get out of it was spiciness and saltiness.  I didn't expect much and they still fell short.- Carnitas Taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=BqnTT9gfKS5Ol5gszHWr2A) - FAIL.  Unlike my noodle dish, I actually had hopes for this one.  Rather than crispy, grilled meat, I was greeted with a mound of shredded pork dripping with oil (check out the ends of the wrapper) and a topping of deep fried fat (think pork rinds but worse).  No bueno.- Pescado Frito (fried fish) Taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=ilJU8hdfD1EXVL_EZKfFeA) - by default, it was the best thing I had.  On its own, it was only decent.  The fish and pickled onions worked, but I thought the flavor was too muted.  If it was a little stronger, I would have liked it more.Given the celebrity chef owner and China Poblano's location on the Strip, the meal wasn't cheap.  To charge $5.50 for that carnitas taco (and to a lesser extent, $6.50 for that pescado taco) is practically criminal though.  With just the $12 I spent on the tacos, I can find a better Chinese noodle dish and tacos, and still have change to tip.  Unless you're a big Jose Andres fan, you're better off going elsewhere (like Holstein's next door).I had to edit my review because I gave a low rating the first time, but I have genuinely liked this place way more since I've come back a few times.I will keep this short and sweet, the portions may be a little small, but most dishes are eloquently designed and they make you savor each bite.I've had some things a little over done w too much oil (ie street taco). But there are also many dishes that are quite refreshing and made quite clean.***Jose Andres' China Poblano in the Cosmopolitan Hotel scores a mediocre score of 3 stars on Yelp, but I found all of the food (I had two of their savory courses and 1 dessert) to be good to very good***China Poblano features a mix of contemporary Mexican and Chinese dishes.  Some dishes are gussied up with contemporary cooking techniques or high end ingredients while other dishes veer more on the fusion side.  I started with one of their tacos--a carnitas one topped with guacamole, fresh lime and chicarrones.  I thought the fillings were great.  The carnitas was moist and tender.  It was also nicely seasoned.  It had a good flavor and wasn't too salty (which happens a lot with carnitas).  The guacamole was cool and refreshing and it was a great contrast to the warm and savory carnitas.The chicarrones were crispy and light.  The soft corn tortilla was fine, but it wasn't a good vessel for the meat juices.  The only problem with the taco was that it was too wet.I also has the twenty vegetable fried rice and it was very good.  The rice had a nice soy flavor, but it was not too salty.  The vegetables provided great contrasts in textures, but with that many vegetables, which were cut up into small pieces as well as paired with a flavorful rice, the individual flavors of the vegetables were (as expected) kind of lost.Still, there were a lot of vegetables including fresh greens, crispy sweet potato, haricot verts, squash, turnips, carrots, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, and watermelon radish.  There were also proteins like soft tofu and scambled egg.For dessert, I opted for their flan and it was very good.  The flan was incredibly smooth, creamy and light like a panna cotta.  It was topped with a great cajeta gelee (rich caramel flavor).  There was also cajeta ice cream (incredibly dense and a great rich caramel flavor).  The plate was garnished with good pineapple, which was not too tart.Service by the bartender Victor was excellent; he was incredibly personal and helpful with the menu.  You could tell he really wanted all of his customers to have the best experience possible.Prices are not too bad considering that it was Vegas.  The fried rice dish was under $20 and it was a very generous portion.  Some portion sizes seem small in a few dishes when considering the prices (like the tacos), but it is still a better value than the many overpriced Vegas restaurants serving just so-so food.In terms of the decor at China Poblano, the bar gives you a view of the chefs making the dim sum.  There is a main dining room, but I wasn't a fan of the tables (they kind of looked like what you would find at a gourmet order-at-the-counter spot).  Overall, the decor was forgettable and not that great.I thought the food at China Poblano was good.  The food was pricey, but Vegas food tends to be pricey and there are places in Vegas serving much more expensive food that is not nearly as tasty or refined as what you can get at China Poblano.  I think China Poblano is a good spot for an upscale lunch.  And since the same menu (with the same prices) is featured at dinner, it is a good spot for a nice dinner with a more casual approach and more reasonable prices than the many overpriced high-end dinner places in Las Vegas.I believe the Cosmopolitan offers both complimentary valet and self parking.There's no Mexican-Asian fusion going on in this restaurant, except that the 2 menus and decor are intertwined. It's almost like someone could not decide if they wanted to open a Mexican restaurant or Chinese restaurant, so they decide to open both in the same space, with separate kitchens. I love both Mexican food and Chinese food, but this is neither here nor there. Two cuisines that are normally best in a hole-in-the wall spot, and inexpensive - this is just the opposite: overpriced and mediocre.We ordered everything family style and tried to get a good mix of both Mexican & Chinese food:Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita ($15) - I liked this margarita a lot. I don't care for the taste of tequila, and the blood orange seemed to mask this well. It had a spicy kick to it, but not so spicy that it was undrinkable.Guacamole & Chips ($15) - Handmade, and delicious, but the price is about double what I would expect to pay for fresh guacamole. Chips were light, crispy and fresh.Tacos (about $5 each) - I'm used to dollar tacos (maybe $2) at a taco truck. I got the Tinga Poblana and it was good, but unless I'm expensing my meal to work, I would pass on this - much too expensive for tacos.Lamb Potstickers Stuck on You ($12.88) - 6 pieces - This was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. The lamb inside was tasty and I liked the crispy lace (sweet onions) design on the dish. Would recommend this.Sui Mai ($13.88) - 6 pieces - The only cool thing about this were the gold flakes on top. The rest was just okay, and tasted heavy on the ginger. At a normal dim sum restaurant, you can get 4 sui mai's for $4 that taste better.Dan Dan Mian ($12) - Wheat noodles and spicy pork sauce - This was definitely spicy, nothing that blew me away though. At least the price was reasonable for the portion-size.Col de Bruselas ($12) - These are on the acidic side - tasted really limey. I wouldn't get this again.Shrimp Mojo ($18) - 8 pieces of shrimp = $2.25 per piece of shrimp. Sauce was good, not too spicy, this was one of the better dishes we had.Bistec con Mole Amarillo y Hongos ($20) - Grilled hanger steak with mole - there were about 6 sliced pieces of steak - again, with the small portions. It was one of the better tasting dishes we had, but expensive.All in all, it's an interesting concept and I was there for work so I was able to expense my meal. With tip and tax, it was $60 per person - quite honestly, I would rather eat at a Mexican food truck or a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place for 1/4 of the price and more authentic food. With so many other options in Vegas, I'll be going elsewhere.China Poblano is such a waste of money. DO NOT COME HERE! As I was walking through Cosmopolitan, I didn't really pay much attention to this little Asian-Mexican joint because it looked like an unappetizing fast food spot, BUT what did catch my eye was Jose Andres' name plastered in front of the restaurant.  I've fallen in love with Jose Andres ever since my enjoyable experience at The Bazzar so I just had to try it.  Of course I knew it wasn't going to be the same, but this just wasn't even good... for any type of standard.  I wanted to try an item from both sides so I opted for the lobster taco and their dan dan mian noodles.  The lobster taco was about $10 and the noodles were around $16?  Both were extremely overpriced for what I got and I honestly don't mind forking out the cash for good food, but this did not even come close.  The portions were extremely small for both, not to mention that my lobster taco was soggy.  The dan dan mian noodles were supposed to be one of their more popular items and I can tell you that there are about a million places in 626 that do it better for about $6.  I regret coming here and should've just gone to Secret Pizza.  China Poblano, how dare you taint Jose Andres' reputation like that!!I am very turmoiled about this place. I've seen it several times and my guitar instructor/friend has been here 5 times and loved it every time. I had big expectations. Thursday night, the middle of the Pac 12 tournament week around 9 o'clock in the evening. Not too crowded but people were scattered around the edges of the restaurant. With all the room in the restaurant, we end up sitting at a table against a wall nestled in between about 4 other tables a super tight sardine type squeeze. Our red headed male waiter did not come around for awhile, but we watched him attend to the table directly to the right of us and a few tables left of us. I kind of felt like we were playing that childhood game, Red Rover, wondering if I was ever going to get picked and the anticipation was killing me! I just wanted to order. He finally comes over with his rehearsed speech. Yes, my hubby and I order margaritas, and then he disappears for a long time again before we get to order food.Fast forward sometime later.. The guacamole and chips, hubby's choice, make their appearance first. Very good stuff. Not mind blowing but definitely worth a try!I enjoyed my "air" foam topped margarita and my chili pepper spicy margarita. I had one of the most unique tacos I ever had - a duck tongue - lychee corn tortilla taco. Although I really enjoyed the duck taco, I definitely liked the beef lengua taco more since the duck tongue taco was too unique for my tastes. I also loved the Hao Gao dim sum - the insides combined pork and shrimp when its usually just shrimp. Very tasty stuff. The six pieces disappeared in my tummy quickly!I also ordered a carnitas taco, but it never came out. I inform the waiter of this and he said I never ordered it. I could have sworn that I did. What happens next? We receive our check, and the carnitas taco was on the bill! The supposed taco that I never ordered! I think the manager noticed my dejected look. He came over and asked us if we were okay and we told him what happened. Our waiter never returned but the manager helped make the correction on the bill and sincerely apologized. My summary: Food very interesting! Manager and hostess very friendly and nice. Waiter - I think you were having an off day or honestly forgot about us. You probably were tired or overworked and were ready to be done with the day. We had come in from a long road trip and just wanted to relax and have drinks and food. It was just a bad date between us and the restaurant that night.I had a really incredible lunch here that was a pleasant surprise. I almost didn't eat here due to the mediocre reviews but I am so glad that I gave it a chance! We were looking for a lighter, healthy lunch, not an easy thing to find in Las Vegas. We ended up at China Poblano as there weren't many other options near by. I thought it was going to be a mix of Chinese and Mexican flavors but it was actually just a combination of Chinese and Mexican dishes. The shrimp mojo was incredible. Eight shrimp were smothered in a yummy black garlic sauce that had a great kick with green poblanos. The tuna ceviche was another winner. Amaranth seeds gave it a nice crunch, but it was just a tad too salty. The beet salad was beautiful, simple and small. Pieces of beets, oranges and avocado were topped with slivers of pickled onion and an orange dressing. The golden pig dim sum was my least favorite item. They were super sweet and there wasn't enough meat in them. Overall service was very friendly. Food was great. It was surprisingly expensive as a lot of other reviewers have commented. I would come back but I'd skip the buns!

3 IN THE MORNINGOnce in a blue moon, we feel lucky (crazy) and play the slots into the wee morning. Of course, when we play hard, we get hungry too. Not an abundance of places open during this time of the morning. Grand Cafe is pretty much it for a Hendertucky selection.  It's been years since our last visit and then,  it wasn't so memorable. Yu-go's memory is like an elephant and he was not esstatic about my choice of this cavernous high ceilings cafe. Ordered corned beef deli sandwich on sourdough served with French Fries ... big thick lean tender meaty .. only take down is the cornbeef is served at room temperature  ... still enjoyable.Yu-go opted for prime rib dip also served with French Fries ... we both agreed it was of high quality without  the normal dry mouth attack episode from using a sandwich dip. BTW ... A++ for the fries.Past experience for waitstaff service was sparse. Not so this time around. Jarri was very much on top of everything. Most important, there wasn't a long wait for our food.A four star rating for good quality and pleasantly professional wait service. Can't imagine what business would be like if they ever decided to serve oxtail soup Hawaiian style, ramen and Tonkatsu Japanese curry over rice. More tgan Half of the diners happened to be Asian this morning.This place is for sure hit or miss. When I come here after 11 pm it seems they have way too many customers and not enough servers. I try to stick to coming here for lunch or in the early evening dinner but after a concert or night out on the town this cafe is open 24 hours and has pretty good late night specials. While out with some friends and it being after 1 am we decided on coming here. We were seated right away but as usual because of the hour it was, there was just not enough servers and service was slow. The following prices are from the "All-Nighter Boarding Pass Specials Menu" so you will need to have your stations boarding pass handy. I had the "2 Egg Bacon Skillet" priced at $3.99. My bacon was burnt and hard as a red rock (pardon the pun tee-hee) so I passed on eating anymore of the bacon then what I already disgustingly ate. The eggs were good, the hash browns were good even though they didn't add the cheddar cheese I requested when ordering, and the sourdough toast had way too burnt grill marks on certain sides. They did bring the cutest little jelly jars to the table in grape and strawberry. I used one to try and cover the burnt taste of my toast but did keep the others. I figure I can make a PB&J sandwich with it at home which will taste better. My hubby had the "Short Stack" priced at $1.99, "Biscuits & Gravy" priced at $1.99and a side of sausage. He enjoyed his meal. The pancakes were actually really good and priced perfectly. My friends ordered the "Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs" priced at $4.99 and the "NY Strip Steak & Eggs" priced at $5.99. We like to sample each others and one of my friends said her chicken fried steak tasted sour. I tried a bite and it had NO flavor. The server was kind enough to remove the charge from the bill. We all shared a "Tiramisu Cup" and it was more like a custard with no flavor. That is all.Went here at 2 in the morning with my fam and some Yelp peeps after just getting done with our bowling UYE.Already I have a bad first impression because as soon as the hostess saw there was about 12 of us, she told us it was gonna be about half an hour before we can get a table. As I looked around, it didn't seem like they were busy at all. I would say overall you had about 8 tables of customers being tended to. The feeling I was getting was that the hostess didn't really wanna be there.So after about 35 minutes we finally got to sit down. It took about 10 minutes before our server came to get our order. We were all actually ready with our orders but she said she was gonna take our drink order first and to put that in. That's stupid. We already had 10 minutes to go over the menu and decide what we want but yet she insisted on getting our drink orders first. So she brings our drinks out after about another 10 minutes. We give her our order and off she went. What happened next almost made me walk out. It took 30 minutes, yes, 30 MINUTES for her to bring out our food. She could have refilled my soda at least twice in that time frame and for your information she never did. So by the time we got our food, it was just a little after 3 am.I know what you're thinking. Since we had a party of 12, of course its natural that making that much food will take a while. Only thing was that all the food we ordered was off the graveyard special menu, meaning pancakes, eggs, biscuits and gravy, etc. So all the items we ordered were simple and quick things to make.The first couple times I ate here around the same time, it was decent. This third time, I am now convinced not to eat here any more. It seemed everybody's attitude that worked there was like they did not wanna be there. If you don't like your job, find something else. We as a party did not demand anything special or were rude in our interactions. Even the manager I spoke to said it was usually slow around that time. I think he didn't wanna be there either. So in closing, just because they are 24 hours and they have graveyard specials, that doesn't always translate to great service and great food. For this place, the food is decent but the really bad service gives you a bitter taste in your mouth. I recommend going to Fatburger in the food court. They are 24 hours as well but I guarantee you wont have to wait an hour to get your food.Great for breakfast plates!The reviews on this place aren't the best but I still enjoy it and if there's a long wait you can seat yourself right at the bar which has no wait time at all. It's actually a fun spot to chat with the bartenders who are always great and just enjoy your food. Breakfast is always great here with perfectly crispy bacon, hash browns, fresh eggs and toast that comes with whipped butter and a selection of jellies. I prefer strawberry & lay it on :)The actual restaurant is very pretty with lots of nice details & yes it's always busy especially in the evenings. I always say that's a good sign. The service is good and I wouldn't say they are the fastest so don't come here if you're in a rush. I prefer to enjoy myself & take my time...Overall it's a great place with a good traditional menu and the prices aren't too bad. I come here all the time to grab breakfast for dinner.

Review Text :
A friend and I stopped by this joint after having a few drinks at the W.  It's a short walk, couple of blocks, away.  It was the middle of the week around 9 pm and the place was half full....good crowd, decent vibe.  We saddled up to a table near the bar and close to the patio.  We ordered a couple of drinks and people watched for an hour or so.They serve a specialty Margarita here that's served in a large glass and a full Corona bottle turned upside down inside the glass, they call it a "Beer-garita".....it looks ridiculous.  Even more hilarious was the number of people who were walking around drinking this monstrosity....it reminds me of the tourists in Vegas who walk around with those giant tubes of Hurricanes or Margaritas....great people watching I tell ya!Our server was very attentive and made sure our glasses remained full.  The music was pretty good too....a DJ was playing house/dance music.  Overall, it was a fun time.Return Factor - 90%I'm NEVER coming here again!When I first came I was waiting in line forever while the security/bouncer let several people ahead of me. I didn't see them check anything off a list so they couldn't be VIP or anything like that.Then, I finally get in and the service just ISN'T there. I wait and wait and finally the bartender takes my order, and gives me a very weak drink! HELLO? I DIDN'T PAY $7 FOR A GLASS OF COCA COLA!! I ASKED FOR A JACK AND COKE!Don't believe the hype, this place sucks!Also El Hefe claims to have amazing tacos... I've had better tacos from a taco bus back home in Seattle, Washington.This place...just wasn't for me.  The company I work for took us on a mini-retreat to Scottsdale for a weekend, and a crew of us made our way over to El Hefe.  And...it was just....how do I put this nicely?Just not the Midwest.  All the women with fake tans, fake boobs spilling out of tanks, faux sexy hipsters mixed Men wearing tight Ed Hardy's with overly gelled hair & possible steriod use?  Just not my thing.And it wasn't just the crowd of people there.  I ordered two gin & tonics (same gin) and they tasted VASTLY different.  On top of that, there were the overly surly cocktailers who seemed to be pissed off that people were there drinking.  I mean, I get that you want to finish your side-work and get home, but when a bar is open (and it's not even midnight), you can't get pissed off at your customers for putting down a drink on a table in an open section.My favorite part of the night?  Leaving.  Sorry Boss.I really like to hate on this place. It's so easy (cue Staples Easy Button) - it's douchebag central. Ladies, if you want to find a roided out meathead, bro-tank wearing, Scottsdale doucher fist pumping the night away, you've come to the right place. Fellas, if you're looking for two-bit skank with hooha's hanging out of her child-sized wifebeater, you're in for a treat. So why the 4 stars? Because, when you're blacked out, this place is fun. Not gonna lie. It's the type of place you go to when you're already 5 shots deep and you're just lookin for trouble. I, personally, am a fan of house music so I love the loud, in-your-face music blaring overhead. Some people can't stand house, so preeettttyyyy sure this ain't the spot for them. Those of you looking for a mellow spot to sip on a marg should probs walk over to Cien Agave and relax there. But those of you looking to make some bad life decisions and who might want to make out with strangers should def head to good ol' Hefe. If it's not absurdly busy with people stomping on your feet with their 8 inch hooker wedges, def get a bulldog margarita. It's delish and can def help kick start your buzz. Proceed with caution friends.DO NOT BUY BOTTLE SERVICE HERE.... We called ahead and reserved a table.  They told us the table was 1 bottle minimum .  We usually get 1 bottle of grey goose and then just order drinks and shots from our server (spending just as much as a bottle).  Server was pouring EXTRA drinks without putting mixer in them and leaving them on the side of the table. Then I noticed her take one of them away as if it was an empty. Our server was also pouring very heavy, I don't usually mind and understand the server wants the bottle to finish quicker so we buy more. Once the bottle ran out the server told us we needed to buy another one. We said we would rather just run up a tab and buy shots, mixed drinks, etc etc.  (there was 8 of us and we would have easily ran up more money than a bottle in the same time frame of drinking a bottle).  THE SERVER TOLD US TO GET OFF THE TABLE SINCE WE ARE NOT BUYING ANOTHER BOTTLE....  This has never happened at Revolver, Smashbox, Firehouse, Axis, or American Junkie.. We said we would be running up an equal amount, she said the only way she would allow us to stay is if each of us racked up a $200 tab. Cliffs:Server was constanting pouring extra drinks and leaving them around our table.Server booted us from table for not buying another bottle even though we were willing to run up higher $$ tab.

Restaurant name  Spanish Fly

Review Text :
Spanish fly opened where the old Drift was, and I gotta say that the minute you walk in you feel like you are on vacation. The palm trees, the colorful mosaic tiles, fruity cocktails and pool area complete with a water fall take you away from  your day to day routine. There are a few tables set up, as well as ample seating in the bar areas, and lets not forget the cabanas! My friends and I received great customer service from the bartenders, and when we moved over to check out the pool area the servers were just as attentive. The menu provided an array of cocktails that were both tempting and seemingly refreshing, as well as a variety of food items. Im sure this place will be busy for the summer pool party season.You do realize that this isn't the pool at Mandalay? And you realize, on Monday, you will have to go back to the cash register and US Magazine? And really, you thought it would be a good idea to get a tattoo of your dog on your shoulder?...next to the tribal swirl? All questions I didn't ask, but did wonder, while at Spanish Fly. If you want to hang out at or near a pool with Scottsdale's "finest", well this is the place. It is presently Exhibit A. Of course, at night, stay out of that pool! No, I am serious, they will physically take you out if need be. But, during the day, you and dog tattoo boy can hang out in the water all day. The service is friendly, well minus the typical Scottsdale door people, who generally fail, as always, to remember that they are not working the new hot club in LA or NYC (come on people, South Park makes fun of Scottsdale!!). Oddly, at night (because of the pool I presume), you need to sign a waiver...I will leave it aside as to whether that waiver would ever hold up in court. The drinks run the norm, but I've never had the food, however I did see someone carrying out sushi rolls to a table in the 100 degree heat...ummm, no thanks. The DJs...ehhh, the usual, but better than Drift. If you want to see 20 somethings in bikinis, a few cougars on the prowl, high rise baseball hats, shorts and high tops, and really bad tattoos...plus catch some water and sun, this is a good spot. It is worth a 30 minute show if there is no cover, but it is hard to swallow as an afternoon hang out, and I would never pay to get in.Reserved a cabana for a friends bachelorette through VIP Services (highly advertised on their website).  Had been here a few times before, no issues, had a lot of fun.  Once I determined that Spanish Fly would work for us, there were multiple e-mails back and forth between the VIP host and myself about details for the event and I had confidence that everything would be made perfect for our group of 25 girls that night.  I talked it up to many in our group because others had made different suggestions as to other places for the evening, but I really pushed for Spanish Fly because of the way the communication was going with the VIP host and myself.  I truly felt they would make my friend feel special.  Unfortunately, I could not have been more wrong.  When I arrived with the 20+ girls in my group, I discovered that absolutely none of the decorations I hand delivered in 2 separate trips that day (at the offering/suggestion of the host) had been set up in our cabana (which was not even a cabana...just a square couch with a folded down umbrella. Cabanas are reserved only for those getting bottle service).  I was taken to a back office to speak with the hostes and a manager and was told that there were multiple bachelorette parties that evening and there was some confusion as to who's decorations were for which party.  I had clearly labeled my decorations with a very large slip of paper with the bride's name on it (who the reservation for the evening was under) so I'm not quite sure where the confusion came into play, and the other bachelorette party I saw there that evening didn't appear to have any decorations.  I also sent the host an e-mail after I finished dropping off the 2nd set of decorations the day of the party asking if I needed to do anything else to be sure that the decorating was taken care of as I wanted to be certain everything would be set up for us when we arrived.  It was a terrible disappointment that it wasn't.  Not only did I miss out on all of the fun at the hotel pool with the rest of the bridal party so I could drop things off at the club, but the situation made me, as the organizer, look like I was the one who let the ball drop.  To make matters worse, while the host ran around trying to set things up at the last minute, nobody was told to come and take care of us while we waited.  The manager should certainly have been the one to be sure that was happening rather than continuing to sit in the back office.  The host finally showed us to our seat, which wasn't the area where I had originally requested at all, but completely on the opposite side of the club and as far away from the dance floor as possible.  We were finally brought some complimentary shots, and what I thought were complimentary pitchers of drinks to make up for our trouble.  However, at the end of the evening, I was charged for the pitchers as well.  Every other bar we had been to that evening happily to provided our party with complimentary shots, even if it was just in passing.  Had I known the shots were all that the hostess was providing us with for this huge faux pas, I would have asked her to give me my bag of decorations and left.  Awesome service by Jenn, can't say enough good things about her.  DJ and his house music sucked.  When the server has a party who's been seriously pissed off, get over yourself and play the bride-to-be a remix of the song she wants to hear.  Have written a letter to the owner.  If he corrects the situation, I will change my rating.

Restaurant name  Coasta Cantina

Review Text :
While on this side of town taking care of some errands, I suggested this place to hubby since we were passing by it anyway. I have eaten here many times in the past but it had been a while so I was curious to see what had changed if anything. They now have a "Coasta Cantina Express" which is right where you walk in to be seated in the actual restaurant. If you don't want to eat inside this gives you the option to just grab it to-go. I would think you could just order it to-go from inside the restaurant the same but maybe people don't think about that and having the express makes them realize that they want a taco. The express menu is limited compared to the menu inside but has the standard favorites. You can choose tacos, burritos, salads, rice bowls, quesadillas, nachos, soda, water and it wouldn't be Vegas unless they sold beer and they do that too. $4 a beer! Eating inside gets you free chips, salsa & bean dip but if you want it from the express it is going to cost you $3.50 (no beans just chips & salsa) and $1.95 if you want to add rice and beans to your order. Now that I was finished being nosy about the express option I decided eating inside would be better for us. We were seated right away and had our drink orders taken. The person bringing us refills was spot on he was quick to refill our chips & salsa or ask if we needed anything but our server lacked a lot of things. It took her 15 minutes for her to even come over and see us and then 5 more minutes until she came back to take our order. We finished 2 rounds of chips & salsa before she came over to us. They weren't very busy at all so I don't know what the deal was. The chips & salsa are good and the bean dip is amazing. It tasted just like I remembered it. When it came to the main course I ordered the "Cheese Enchiladas" made with flour tortillas. It came with a side of beans (I know I said it but the beans are so tasty!) and rice. It wasn't terrible at all but it wasn't spectacular. I think it could be due to the fact that the plate wasn't very warm when it arrived. I was able to get it for $7.99 after I showed my players card. Currently if you have a players card then on weekdays before 6 pm you can get a 2 item combo for just $7.99. My meal would have been $11 with out the deal. Score! Hubby ordered a "Shredded Beef Burrito" priced at $12 and had it smothered for 99 cents more. He enjoyed it and found the size to be good but again the food was sorta cold. This could have been easily given more stars by me if the server did her job and if the food wasn't on the cold side. I will more then likely leave this location to the tourists and stick to the location closer to my home.

It's been a while since I've had In N Out, so yesterday I decided to stop by for lunch. I had been to the dentist earlier that morning & my teeth were still hurtin, so I decided to avoid any long drive thru lines & go after the lunch rush at about a quarter till 2pm. When I pulled up there was still a bit of a wait, about 6 or 7 cars were in front of me. I can only imagine how long that line gets at noon! Any way, I ordered a #2 animal style with a dr. pepper. Everything was so tasty & I finished it all! Total for a cheeseburger, medium drink & fries was less than 6 bucks, so awesome. Best fast food burger by far!P.S. I love how pleasant the employees working at In N Out are, it's very refreshing :)

Restaurant name  The Las Vegas Grille
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Driving to the library I noticed a white banner advertising the opening of another new restaurant on W. Sahara Ave (same strip mall as Swish).  So I decided to give The Las Vegas Grille (former site of CJ Texas BBQ) a try on my way back.  The restaurant looks spacious, tables are not crowded together, and the chalkboard menu looks beautiful, and there is a big smoker near the cashier.  It is a barbecue restaurant with a menu that can be categorized into the following major groups: barbecue meats, handmade sausages, meatballs, and sandwiches made from barbecue meats or meatballs, salads, side items, and desserts. The lady at the counter plus all the staff at the restaurant were all very nice.  As this was my first visit, it took me awhile to look at the entire menu, but they were patient and offered suggestions to help me decide on what to try.  I was thinking about the St. Louis BBQ Ribs, but ultimately went with the 4 Meats 3 Sides Combo, which consisted of Beef Sirloin, BBQ Chicken with Pineapple Ginger Jerk Sauce, Applewood Roasted Herb Crusted Pork Loin, and Handmade Sausage (Artisan's Bratwurst)  for the meats, and Bavarian Potato Salad, Rainbow Slaw and Rotini Pasta Salad for the sides.  Before I was done with my meal, I also ordered all three of their meatballs (Arisan's Fusion Meatball made with beef and pork, Sweet & Sour Hawaiian made with pork, beef and ham, and finally the Southwest Green Chile Meatball made with chicken and turkey).As long as I can remember, I have always enjoyed charcuterie items, from Taiwanese and Chinese sausages to artisan German and Italian sausages and hot links from the South.  After culinary school and having had the opportunity to attend a master's class on charcuterie taught by CMC Fritz Sonnenschmidt (master chef, author and leading authority on the subject), I learned to appreciate it even more.  And out of all the items I ordered, I would say that their Artisan Bratwurst was my favorite.  It is also very healthy, as far as cured meat products goes, as they do not use nitrites, nitrates or MSG in their curing process, instead they utilized a high heat smoke curing method.  The result is sausages that have a nice flavor, good smokiness, and not overly salty.The Applewood Roasted Herb Crusted Pork Loin was also very good.  It has the nice smoke ring, indicative of true barbecue, and the pork was still juicy and packed with flavor.  Undoubtedly, it would be great in a sandwich as well.The BBQ Chicken with Pineapple Ginger Jerk Sauce has nice flavor, but was a little on the dried side.  The White Oak Roasted Beef Sirloin was okay, it definitely has the smoky flavor, but was otherwise too much on the well done and dried side for me to appreciate or enjoy it.The meatballs were pretty good. Served as it, it is too salty for me (but my personal preference leans towards less salt), but serve it in a sandwich it will be just right.I like restaurants that strive to serve healthier and more natural foods, and this place definitely does that!  Although they do not make their own breads, they do sourced them from a local artisan bakery (Great Buns Bakery), which makes a good pretzel bread.Overall, it is a good barbecue restaurant that can be even better with more fine tuning.  And personally I would be here just for their sausage sandwiches, which currently is available in the following selections: Artisan's Bratwurst, Italian Fennel Sausage, Keilbasa Polska, Kids Beef Frankfurter, Mediterranean Sun-dried Tomato, and New Mexico Chile.Food:  3/5  Some items are super good, while others were okay.Price:  3/5  Reasonable.Ambiance and decor:  3/5  Spacious arrangement, minimally decorated restaurant with a giant shinny barbecue smoker right inside the restaurant, staffed by friendly restaurant personnel. Location:  West side, just down the street from the car dealerships on W. Sahara Ave.Parking:  4/5  Plentiful parking.Cleanliness:  5/5  New, and kept in pristine condition by the restaurant staff.A-OK!Eating at the Las Vegas Grille was like watching the first season of the Simpsons.  Very, Very rough around the edges but you can tell there is a lot of potential there.My first visit to this new entry on the Westside dining scene was on a Saturday night and I found the place to be more on the empty side.  I attribute this to a an odd location within a non-descript strip mall on Sahara.  I was impressed however with the gigantic electric smoker they have staring down at you as you walk through the doors.  The menu immediately strikes you as shouting "not your typical bbq place."  Sure they offer standards like Ribs & Chicken, but they also have a selection of fresh made sausages, meatballs and other non-traditional bbq meats like pork loin.  You can order the meats a la carte, in sandwich form as as combo.   Rather than bore everyone with the fine details of the meal, here were the highlights:-The side options are phenomenal.  Not only do the offer a unique variety, everything we had was top notch.  I absolutely loved the Bavarian Potato Salad (no mayo, with vinegar) and the Red Cabbage.  -The Kielbasa on the pretzel roll was tasty, large, and a definite value at 7.99-The pork loin and sirloin were both captured the essence of properly smoked meats.  I could tasted the rich earthy taste that smoking gives meat.-The guys running the place seem passionate about making the restaurant into something great.  They were friendly and genuinely wanted us to understand their menu.-Prices were reasonable for a meat joint.But there were some lowlights as well:-The ribs had a great rub on them, the sauce was tasty but there was very little meat.  By that I mean they give you a fair number of ribs per se, they just use really small ribs. -Speed of service.  You order at a counter giving the impression the food will be coming out relatively fast, yet we waited 1 minutes despite their being only one other table.  Im all for waiting for quality, but let the customers know that it might take that long and perhaps offer free biscuits or cornbread....just a thought.I really liked a number of things at the Las Vegas Grille, but you can tell they still haven't found their feet yet.  I hold out high hopes for them because its always good to see the Vegas dining scene diversify with unique choices.  My 3 stars represents a restaurant in their first month, but it certainly doesnt capture all the potential that is there.The Simpsons were able to refine their show before they got canceled, lets hope the Las Vegas Grille can do the same!Been DYING to come back here after Misti's wonderful CMYE at LVG last month.  The restaurant.com coupon made the meal even better although $35 worth of food for 2 is basically a buffet at the table :PLVG has the best ribs I've eaten in Las Vegas.  It's true!  I'm all about St. Louis style ribs now and on the verge of texting baby back ribs to tell them we're through.  The juicy tenderness and smokey flavor make them truly unbeatable.That's not the only thing that's awesome here.  Thai green curry sausage!!  Amazing.  Phil's a genius!  Not me but the owner haha.  The bbq chicken is also super good.  The breast was actually juicier than the thigh somehow.  The red cabbage, red potato salad and pasta salad sides accompanied all the meats perfectly with the pasta being our top favorite of the 3.  We were on senior citizen time and ate dinner around 4pm so we were the only ones in there.  We chatted it up with Phil for a good part of the dinner and he informed us of some great new additions to the menu coming up in December like prime rib and double smoked ham.  Like you needed more of a reason to come here...more of a reason to come here everyday!!!This is a hard review to write.  Not because I don't know what to say, or how to say it.  No, this is a hard review to write because all I will be thinking about for the rest of the day is The Las Vegas Grille's BBQ.  After trying Phil's homemade sausages, I feel like every sausage I've had up to this point has been a lie.  These are the links you've been looking for.The sausages here are truly homemade, from the grinding to the smoking.  Phil, Las Vegas Grille's owner, has absolute control over his final product.  The first half of the equation is what to put inside the sausage.  The other half is the wood he uses to smoke the meat.  It may be cliche to say "quality over quanity," but it totally applies here!  The easy way out would be to throw all of your different meats into the smoker, and cook them all at the same time, which would give a similar flavor profile to all the meats.  Instead, Phil takes care to pair each meat with a specific type of wood and smoke them separately.  Longer process?  Yes.  More unique and distinct flavors?  Absolutely!My favorites have been the Thai Curry sausage and the Sundried Tomato sausage.  Yes, they really do taste like curry and sundried tomatoes, and have an awesome smoked flavor as well.  In my pre-LVG life I would have said that sausages came in two varieties: plain or spicy.  Phil has opened the door to artisan sausages, and there is no turning back.  Sausage sandwiches?  Not no more.  You don't need bread interfering with what these sausages offer. You can also order combos and get different meats for your meal.  On my most recent visit I went with a 2-meat 1-side combo for $9.99: Thai Curry Sausage, Sirloin with red wine sauce, and herb roasted potatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DO3FefiMYiPYsEl6O8W2dw?select=-lGXHtFOQ8wCSmeD3YE8dA).  The sirloin was oh so tender and came with a swiss and horseradish aioli.  I found myself using a lot of the aioli, as the red wine sauce on the sirloin was a bit sweet for my tastes.Excellent experience all around.  Friendly service that will walk you through the menu.  Be sure to talk to Phil to truly see what makes this place so special.  One of his newest menu items are smoked chicken wings, which I haven't tried yet.  Looks like I'll be making another trip to The Las Vegas Grille real soon...Although I'm one of the most proud Texan girls you will ever meet, for whatever reason I escaped a Texas upbringing without developing a fondness for BBQ. In fact, I kind of hate BBQ. Some might say I'm not a real Texan, but I digress...I waited a long time to try this place for some silly reason. I guess I figured it was yet another BBQ place, and I'd hate it just like all the rest. Luckily, LVG is something DIFFERENT! If you are craving Memphis or Texas style BBQ, you might be disappointed.. but for those of us who don't like BBQ or for you BBQ-lovers who can appreciate a completely different experience, this place is nirvana !So my favorite item on the menu is actually the smoked salmon sandwich. In general I hate fish sandwiches and find them icky, but this is the best fish on bread this girl has ever eaten! They smoke their own salmon and pair it with a lemon garlic aioli.. YUMMMMM. I like mine on ciabbata - it's perfection! (On a side note, the local bakery they get their breads from is INCREDIBLE, and they have the most fresh perfect ciabbata ever ! I have yet to have a sandwich on stale bread here!). Another favorite of mine is the BBQ chicken sandwich with that insane pineapple jerk sauce.. So many things to try and love! Meatballs, sausages, wood-fire roasted wings... .this carnivore couldn't be happier! The staff is friendly, the restaurant is clean, the prices are reasonable.. GO NOW.. :)

Yummy cheap street eats. It's a happening food truck without the wheels, no need to follow em' on twitter, they are here to stay. I am in no way shape or form an expert on the food of Venezuela, but I know delish when I taste it, and there are some mighty fine treats coming out of this window. I sampled strictly the Arepas. What the heck is an Arepa? Kind of a grilled corn shell, like a mash up of a sope and papusa, but hand sliced down the middle like a hamburger bun. After that just pick the filling(s) you want and enjoy. I particularly like the black bean and cheese and the tongue. Perico is the kitchen sink and really good too. Don't forget that crazy good green sauce, don't worry, it's not hot, but does burst with flavor. Arepas run $2.75-$4.00 Empanadas are $1.99 Venezy drinks are $1.49-dude hooked me up with free refills, don't know if that's the norm though. I tried 2 beverages Parchita which is a very sweet fruit punch thing, and the star by far was the Guanabana drink, which comes from the native southern hemisphere fruit of the same name. Very light, clean and refreshing taste. Bonus, they claim only fresh ingredients and no MSG, no microwave, and no can openers.Hit I LUV AREPAS for a quick lunch snack - I think it's actually smaller than a food truck !  I originally thought it replaced the Naked City Sammie space but not true - a stand alone shack on Dino's  parking lot ( maybe it uses the NC space for prep work ... not sure ) Had the pollo arepas ( $3 ) and the carne ( $3.50 ) Comes with a side of spicy and mild sauce - damned if I know what's in them  the spicy had a smokiness to it, theMild a cream base - both very good.The arepas ??  I actually like the pollo more but both were very good.  They basically take a corn based thick pancake,  cut in 1/2 and stuff with meat - no frills - simple food with great flavor .I wanted a bacon dog ($2.25 ) but not ready yet - next time because there will be many next timescrappy pics addedYUM.  I tried arepas for the first time last night, and I'm sold.  These things are amazing.  I was swooning with every bite.I had spoken with the owner earlier in the week and he told me that the arepa dough is made with milk, but that he would be happy to make me a special vegan one if I was willing to wait for it.  Well, Saturday night, drunk and hungry, I was more than willing to wait.  And I am so glad that I did! He made me a gorgeous arepa filled with black beans, and topped with freshly sliced avocado and tomato.  I have not stopped thinking about this food since I finished eating it, and I will definitely be going back soon.The arepa dough was crispy from the grill on the outside (and btw, they cleaned the grill and made mine off to the side of all the other ones!) and almost fluffy on the inside.  The fillings were so fresh and tasty too! Every bite put a smile on my face.  As a regular at Dino's, I am so thrilled to have a late night, vegan friendly food option to help me soak up the booze! And I really appreciate how super friendly and accommodating the folks who run the place were.  My carnivorous friends went crazy over their non-vegan pork arepas too... and in fact everyone I saw get food there seemed pleased.  If you've never tried arepas you have been missing out!Love at first bite! Wow! Wow! Wow! Finally had the chance to enjoy this Venezuelan treasure! My gal pal and I got the Royal treatment on our first visit! I ordered a Pepsi with my order, and the Head Chef/Owner Felix gave me a sample of the Passion fruit juice, I said yes I'll have that!!!!! Natural Fruit Juices...Mango and Passion fruit mmmmm so yummy! You must order a fruit juice, forget soda. Trust me! I ordered a shredded beef empanada, my friend ordered two different types of Arepas, we both got a natural fruit juice. We sat in my (air conditioned) car to eat as it was hot hot hot outside and this was 10pm at night, ugh. They brought us our order to the car where an awesome conversation was started with the Owner Felix. So we chatted with Felix for a bit at the car, we informed him it was our first time trying them out. He gave us a bit of the History behind it all and how he previously worked with Mario Batali! He said I must try something so he went and made a Reina Pepiada Arepa for me to try! He told me I am the Reina Pepiada, whatever that means, lol Wow, it was Amazing! Delicious, melted in my mouth, full of flavor! He also wanted me to try his Cod empanada since I told him how much I love seafood. Mmmmmm yummy soooooo good, that also melted in my mouth like butta! The best way I have ever eaten cod fish in my life, in form of an empanada. Not just any Empanada but his which is the best! He also made a beef empanada for my girl Karen to try, mmmm she loved it, the best empanada ever. Felix...thank you for treating us so special and taking the time to hang out with us! You truly hooked us up and spoiled us so well!We will be back sooner than you think! Muchos Besos!I have long avoided this place for two reasons: one, I despise the food truck trend. And two, my previous experience with arepas was limited to some mystery-meat-stuffed weirdness at a bus depot in the Venezuelan hinterlands.But yesterday, as I was driving past the street corner where the Arepa boys do business...out of the corner of my eye I noticed that the proprietors were two hot Venezuelan dudes of childbearing age. Hell-O! I did a quick U-turn and pulled into the parking lot. As mentioned, my previous experience with arepas left me skeptical...but the hotness of the staff, and the fact that it's not actually a food truck, but more of a dingy kiosk unadorned with Twitter and Facebook logos, convinced me to give 'em a second try. And now.......... I, too, Love Arepas!I only had one -- the bean and cheese. But it was fantastic!! WAY better than the ones I had in Venezuela (they hate Americans down there, so they probably pissed in my arepa at that bus depot). At $3.50 it was a filling mini-meal...and actually stuck to my ribs through three cocktails, preventing me from getting wasted and doing embarrassing things down on Fremont St.IMO this is hands down the best dining in all of Vegas -- cheap, unpretentious, delicious and al fresco. You can sit at the little tables in front of the arepa pod and enjoy the scenery of the neighborhood: a strip club, a dive bar and an all-night drugstore patronized by pimps and weirdos. I will MOST DEFINITELY be coming here again and again and again -- and that's just with the hot proprietors. I'll come to the kiosk again, too :-)Hidden GemHole in the wallSmall crappy looking shack that serves delicious grubAll three of these phrases perfectly describe Viva Las Arepas, but I like the third one the best!Located at the end of the strip, on Las Vegas Blvd, just a few blocks past the Stratosphere Hotel, sits a small, ugly white shack in a deserted parking lot that serves up some of the tastiest little snacks in all of Las Vegas. Viva Las Arepas serves up some of the best tasting Arepas I've ever eaten. For those of you who aren't familiar with Arepas, they're pretty much small, fried cornmeal pockets stuffed with meats, cheese, veggies, sauce, etc, etc. Viva also makes empanadas, a few hot dogs, aguas frescas, and a few sweet treats like flan and more. They also have these two amazing shack-made sauces. One is a lime green color that's mild but has an amazing flavor and the other is a spicy red sauce. Since my wife and I were going to have a big dinner the same day we visited Viva, we decided to just get a few items to try. This is what we purchased;Lengua Arepa W/ White Cheese & Avocado Slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=8lN2NE_nQzG-VFNGfeR1hAGround Beef & Shredded Cheese Arepa  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=-dY7b8L5QpT1MPtSHG34ugBlack Bean & Cheese Empanada http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=D_dkKgnCHti4moXUxO85vQAll three items were incredibly delicious. The cornmeal pockets were perfectly fried yet still had a soft center. The Lengua, which was shredded and cooked in a delicious sauce, was my fave of the two. It was savory, sweet and slightly spicy all at the same time. The ground beef Arepa reminded me of a Taco Bell Chalupa, but obviously much better. The black bean and cheese empanada was also very good. To wash down our yummy snacks we had a large Passion Fruit aguas frescas. It was super sweet and super refreshing. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=Wz0vow2OgM5E5N6lMQP07Q The prices for each Arepa are about $3 or $4 bucks a piece, which isn't too bad considering how delicious they are. The guys who were working in the shack were all friendly and got our food out to us quickly. If you're in LV and feel like something quick, tasty and cheap, don't go to some crappy chain place like McDonald's, head on down to Viva Las Arepas and treat yourself to some phenomenal Arepas. Trust ME.My first Arepas and is was Viva Las Vegas good!I had to try this place after reading Craig R's review.  I've never had an Arepas before so I was looking forward to trying it.  This place is a stand alone shack on the corner at the end of the north side of the strip.  Seriously its a shack, you cant miss it cuz it sticks out!!!  They have some tables set outside so there are places to for you to eat there.  Saw a few that just swung by and got it to go.   An Arepa is a flat, round and soft patty made out of cornmeal, which is grilled, making it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and then it can be stuffed with beef, chicken, ham, cheese, beans, shrimp, and many more. These delights are gluten-free, and wheat-free.  Aside from arepas (hot/cold) they also serve empanadas and hallacas which are like tamales.SInce I was having a really late dinner I decided to try 2 and got a #5 and #7 with a mango drink to wash is down.  I sat down and waited about 10 min and the guy brought it out. #5 Roasted Pork Butt  (Pernil) which is Slow Cooked Marinated Pork, Fresh Tomato Slices and cheese.  Damn this was tasty good.  Great flavored pork, tender and juicy.  The cornmeal was grilled perfectly with a crisp!#7 Reina Pepiada which is Shredded Chicken Breast, Avocado,  Mayonnaise, Cilantro, Green Peas.  Was like a chicken salad as this was a cold version.  They look small but they are actually pretty big and was only able to eat half of this one as I was totally full. The guy told me about the 2 homemade sauces they have on the table.  One is green and a milder version but with a really good flavor.  I would buy some of this good stuff.  The red was obviously spicy and so I didn't really use it but it was good.  This place may look questionable but let me tell you this is a great hole in the wall place to hit up when your in LV.  It's way off the strip so you wont have to deal with lines and strip prices.  They have great tasty food Eyes ~ Ok its on the corner and the seats are pretty much on the sidewalk.Nose ~ Not much to smell when your outside and the wind whipping!Ear ~ Cars cars cars!Mouth ~ Damn tasty arepas!Tummy ~ Stop stuffing more food mouth, I'm freaking full yo!The BF and I were close and needed some snackies. We ordered a pork arepa, 2 bean and cheese empanada and mango to drink. The mango drink was really good. It was not too sweet, fresh and refreshing. I coulda had a few of those since it was a hot day. When our order came it was the wrong order. We got one meat arepa and a bean and cheese arepa so we figured maybe she didn't hear the empanada part and perhaps got us a arepa instead? Oh well, we'll eat it anyways. The bean and cheese was yummy with flavorful beans. The meat turned out to be beef (unless my taste buds are wonky) but it was so tender and fantastic. Normally shredded beef is somewhat stringy, but not this. I normally wouldn't order beef but here I would definitely consider it. The arepa was wonderfully crispy on the outside and had some chewiness inside that was addictive. I can eat those alone even. Don't skimp on the mustardy hot sauce and the creamy sauce as both make the arepas even better, I think! Eventually I guess they realized it wasn't that they got our order wrong, we got someone elses order! The guy on the grill (I'm assuming is the owner) was apologetic about it and gave us 2 bean and cheese empanadas anyways which was cool of him. It was not what I expected at all. I was thinking more like pastry dough type empanadas, but the consistency was like the breading that is around corn dogs which lead the BF and I trying to figure out how they make it. These were tasty but since I'm a Hot Dog On the Stick fan, I'm definitely ordering just a plain cheese one next time. Now that its hot, it's gonna suck to come visit but I definitely enjoyed that meal and want to come back again soon.Blame it on the A-a-a-a-a-alcohol if you want, but the food this place puts out was like mana from heaven at midnight last Saturday night. We were leaving Dino's and a friend suggested we get Arepas, since I'd never tried them before. We got a beef arepa and a lingua arepa. When i tasted the yummy, cheesy, tender filling surrounded by the moist corn flour wrap I could barely put it down. I love that they leave the sauce on the side, so you can add it to your liking. The shredded beef was so tender and hearty. The lingua (beef tongue) tasted very similar to a slow cooked pot roast that had been shredded and sauteed with peppers and onions. It was spicy and the accompanying sauce made it even more so. It was delicious! It took some liquid courage to get me to try it, but now I'm hooked! I'm actually considering driving there on my lunch hour today (completely sober of course)! This place is a must try if you've never had an Arepa, or if you're close to downtown and hungry!Short review!  (will include an update in a month)Viva Las Arepas!!!  Oh Viva Las Arepas!Located on an unseemly street corner (Believe it was LVB/just pass Charleston - be sure to be on the look out!)  sits a tiny little 10x12 shack of goodness!This past Vegas trip was all about exploring the local food scene outside of the main strip, and boy did we experience some delicious treats such as these Arepas!Since it was simply a tasting... our part of 4 decided to share on one arepa... Reina Pepidas!  Yes... 4 sharing one......Reina Pepidas is this arepa (corn meal bun toasted with savory fillings) that is filled with shredded chicken mixed with cilantro, avocado, green peas, and mayo..... just think of it as a chicken salad sandwich on steroids!Super delicious!!!!!  The flavor of the cilantro and avocado coupled with slightly crispy buns of the corn meal made this a super filling yet delicious treat before actual lunch!  Sauces comes with it too... I believe one of them is a delicious non-spicy cilantro sauce while another one is a spicy salsa that could potential knock your socks off!  Mixing all the flavors together will create a different yet awesome flavor that you surely don't want to miss.Our party was looking at the pork butt arepa but since we were heading over for actual lunch, we decided to give it a try next time...Is there a next time?  Hell ya!  They've done pretty well to a point that we noticed that an actual storefront is in the works just closely down the street... I bet it's going to be crowded when that completed...But in the mean time, be sure to keep your eyes open for the little tiny shack that is on a street corner.... don't judge the book by it's covers.... you will be pretty amazed on what you find here at Viva Las Arepas!  Until next time Arepas!!!I wanted to have lunch and try something different and Viva Las Arepas came to mind.  As I drove down Sahara, I was wondering if it was wise of me to go here today when we were having a sprinkling of rain and take a chance of sitting outside in 50 degree temperature or else eating in the car.  What a surprise to find they had moved from their small stand with no interior except for cooking and serving into their own strip mall store!  Having read my good friend Holly's Yelp review, I knew I was going to get the pork arepa.  That and a can of diet Coke came to $4.99 plus tax--a great price for a good lunch.  After placing the order, the woman at the counter said they'd bring my lunch to the table and she told me to sit anywhere I wanted.The sandwich came quickly along with three plastic bottles--one with mayonnaise, and the other two with their sauce, one spicy and one mild.  They're in mustard/ketchup kind of plastic squeeze bottles with the mayo in white, the mild sauce in the yellow container, and the spicy one in red!  Appropriate.  I tried some of the spicy sauce and I was hooked!I wish I had taken a bit more time to really savor this wonderful sandwich but I snorted a few times and it was gone!  The pork was very flavorful and tender, and the arepas dough was cooked very well.  This was my first time having one but it will not be my last.  I have to go back and try some of the other things.  It's too good of a place to pass up anymore.  And now with an indoor restaurant, I won't stay away because it's over 100 out and I won't have to worry about a few raindrops on my head!Viva Las Arepas!NO LATIN TRANSLATOR NECESSARY!It seems like everytime I go to any Latin restaurant, I need a real live Rosetta Stone for any questions I have. Either that or I need subtitles when an employee talks to me. LOL.Anyways, back to my review. I have heard good things about this place from all my Yelp buddies so that alone is good motivation. I have heard of arepas but never actually had them. For those noobs like me, its a dish made of ground corn dough or cooked flour, very prominent in the cuisine of Colombia and Venezuela. So you can put two of them together with your choice of meat and other toppings. I ordered carne asada with cheese. I scarfed it down like a it was the last piece of food I will ever see again. They have other delectable choices as well but when you go to a highly recommened place, you get what is popular so their namesake lived up to the hype.Service is awesome! They answer all the questions you have and even make suggestions based on what you are leaning towards. They bring it out to you where you sit with two ketchup bottles. One has a light green colored kind of sauce and the other has a light reddish tint to it. Both have different spices to it but the reddish colored one has a little kick to it. Not overpowering, but definitely gives your food that extra oomph that keeps your mouth watering.As for their location, they used to be half a block up the street in a little taco stand. They are now on the corner of Oakey and S Las Vegas Blvd, just kitty corner to 7/11. Look for the weird Indian statues because they are neighbors with an Indian antique store.  I guess with their recent popularity, they moved to this spacious building. They have plenty of tables and chairs so bring your friends. Plenty of room.The only negative things I can see is that the parking is kind of limited. The old Indian statues take up several parking stalls and the stalls are small to begin with so be real careful in parking and backing up. Also they charge 50 cents for using cards to pay for anything under 10 dollars. So if I ever make a trip to South America, at least I know what and how good arepas are. VIVA LAS AREPAS!Viva Las Vegas? Nah, Viva Las Arepas!A couple of buddies told me about this place and how they have cheap yet satisfying food. My cousin and I took a trip on a Tuesday afternoon for some grub. The restaurant is located on the left when going north on Las Vegas Blvd on Wyoming. The place is quite clean and large with tables and booths.  There are pictures of their food items posted all over the restaurant. Those helped with familiarizing myself with their food items but didn't help in the sense for me to choose what I wanted since they all looked so delicious! After reading Yelp reviews and getting a recommendation from the girl behind the counter, my cousin and I decided to get the Reina Pepiada. In between two warm cornbread slices, there was shredded chicken breast with avocado, mayo, cilantro and green peas. The consistency was almost like a chicken salad. I was a little thrown off with how warm the cornbread slices were and how cold the chicken concoction was. But I got past this in a hot minute and chowed down happily. We were given a red bottle (spicy hot sauce) and a yellow bottle (mild hot sauce) to have with our arepas. A little sprinkle of some hot sauce (I like the spicy but the mild is good, too) with each bite is key to elevate flavors. And a side note, don't be fooled by the "small" size of the arepa. This little baby fills you up. I walked out of there overly stuffed. To wash it all down, we each ordered a fruit juice. What's cool is that they let you try samples before you buy one. My cousin ordered the guava juice and I ordered the mango. I expected the juices to be a little thick, but they weren't. Very refreshing and not too sweet. Doesn't taste artificial. I think I will end up craving their mango juice during the hot Vegas summer months.If you find a silly Asian girl chanting "long live the arepa!" here, that's me. If you find a female Asian bum on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming with a sign that says "will work for arepas," that's me, too. That being said, you all get the point. Go get some arepas!I woke up this morning and all I could think of was AREPAS! I asked people where this place is at since all I know is that it's close to Olympic Garden. I used my GPS to help me find this place and brought me to Art of Flavors. Where is this place? Ah, it's right next door to Art of Flavors tucked in the corner.After a yummy experience from an arepas foodtruck, we got garlic shrimp arepa, pork butt arepa with cheese, Reina Pepiada arepa, wood fire chicken arepa and fried plantains. They have more options here compared to the foodtruck which is not surprising. The prices are about the same. But the arepa itself is less toasted and is heavier than the foodtruck version. The cilantro sauce is equally as good, this place's spicy/red sauce is spicier. I had to try their guanabana juice to compare it to what I had when I was a kid. Garlic Shrimp Arepa:No tomatoes or veggies, just straight up garlic shrimp. I liked this a lot especially with the cilantro sauce which elevates the garlic flavor of the shrimp.  5/5Roasted Pork Butt:Comes with tomato slices. Add cheese. In case you didn't know, pork butt = pork shoulder and not the actual butt of a pig. Tasty pork. Both the spicy and cilantro sauce work well with this. 4/5Reina Pepiada Arepa:Cold chicken with mayo, avocado and cilantro. Tastes just like the one from the arepas foodtruck. A much better version of a chicken salad. 5/5Wood Fire Chicken Arepa:Really flavorful chicken with tomato, onions and lettuce. 4/5Fried Plantains:I love this stuff. My mom would fry some plantains for me as a snack when I was a kid. So simple and easy to make yet it tastes so good. The natural sweetness of the plantains come out when you fry them in high temperatures. Eventhough they could have gotten rid of the excess oil, I still like these things. 5/5Guanabana:AKA soursop juice and in Filipino, guyabano. This tastes like concentrate mixed with lots of sugar and water. I couldn't taste soursop. 3/5After that meal, we headed next door for dessert. After dessert, I decided to come back here so I can try the chicharron with fried yucca. Shawn tapped out as I was enjoying chicharron and yucca. All he said to me was "I can't believe how you're still eating."Chicharron with Fried Yucca:The chicharron wasn't the same crispy fatty pork I was excpeting. The yucca was good with the cilantro sauce though. It was as if I was eating garlic fries. Yum! 4/5I did some wondering around after having some gelato from Art of Flavors and noticed Viva Las Arepas right next door. It was spacious but there weren't a lot of people inside. The menu seemed like there was a lot of going on, don't know when I'll be back again and had to get it right, so I had to rely on the Yelp app to see what everyone was getting. The Reina Pepiada was mentioned pretty frequently.  I wasn't sure if it was something I should eat or someone I should meet. It was an arepas filled with a mixture of chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro. It wasn't that big and didn't taste that amazing on it's own. It was too much avocado and mayo and not enough chicken for me but it was only about $5 and it was enjoyable after dumping whatever sauces were inside of the red and yellow containers.  They did lack customer service. I explained that this was my first time here and if they had any recommendations or customer favorites. They could not help me with that and seemed rude about it, even went back to whatever they were doing before I asked for a menu, sat in the corner, and brought out the Yelp app. I didn't feel as welcomed as Art of Flavors felt like I should go back there. Customer service is big for me, it's not that hard to be friendly, courteous, and give your attention to paying customers.The rest of their food do sound and look good, from the reviews and pictures posted, and I'm sure they're well deserving of the 2 star I gave them but since the food from what I had was just OK and the service wasn't to my liking there is no way I can give them a 3 star, OK, to something I was not OK with. Another visit will happen but not anytime soon.Short Review:I'm a fan of Arepas. I'm just not a fan of the Arepas served at Viva Las Arepas.  I got their Beef Empanada and Beef Arepa.  Both were greasy and not worth the price. $5 for an Arepa the size of your fist??  I've had this place bookmarked. Now, bookmark checked! Time to move on.Longer Review:Viva Las Arepas has been one of my bookmarks since I was introduced to their neighbor, the great Art of Flavors. Yes, Viva is located right next door in case you didn't know.  Upon entering, you're hit with nothing but orange and a menu with a decent selection.  At first, the prices looked pretty good until you get your food. I got the Beef Arepas and a Beef Empanada.  They both tasted "Just Ok" and were super oily. For a minute, I thought I was eating a beef chimichanga. Both were also so small that I was able to finish my Arepas in about 3 bites.  I know I can't mention names, but I have had better Arepas out here in Vegas. Better in regards to price, value, and most importantly, taste. All is not lost though.  Their plantains and the service were both excellent.  I may be back, but most likely for their plantains only.  See Ya' But not here...I'll be next door enjoying the best peanut butter gelato.It's a shame, but after each visit, I've become less and less impressed. My first visit was phenomenal and my second visit was still pretty great (as evidenced in my previous review). The Wood-Fired Beef was a bit dry during my third visit, but I brushed it aside attributing it to a fluke or bad timing. However, my last visit has solidified my disappointment and necessity to write an updated review.Since I've had five of their arepa options, I decided it was time for another one, so I chose the Vegetarian (avocado, black beans, tomato, peppers, onion) for $5. I was confused at first because all I saw were black beans with a little bit of avocado barely surfacing (reference photo). Maybe they got my order wrong? I searched for vegetables through the beans with no success. It wasn't until I took a few bites that I finally located a very sad tomato piece. I figured that was just how they made the "Vegetarian" arepa. The beans were nicely seasoned, but their overwhelming quantity made it incredibly difficult to eat in an arepa. The arepa itself was delicious, as always. I was already disappointed by my selection because of the lack of vegetables, then I saw photos of what the Vegetarian Arepa should look like or have looked like and now I'm upset. It costs the same as or more than their meat options and they can't include a heap of vegetables? Not cool!Also, after four visits, it doesn't seem like a coincidence that my table is consistently ignored. No one ever checks on us (it's usually me and Ruben), while they seem more than happy to visit and chat with several other customers. It has made us feel unwelcome. I'm really sad to say this, but I will be getting my arepas elsewhere from now on.If I wasn't sitting shotgun to a Vegas local, I would have never made it to Viva Las Arepas... bonus points for a punny and city-appropriate name. Seeing that it's far removed in all directions from the "action," and the fact that I have never had an arepa before would have made it next to impossible for me to find it or even want to go there. Props to my buddy for carting us around and opening my eyes to something new and incredibly awesome. Thank, Drew-fus.The place is clean, there are pictures lining the wall, the menus are in both Spanish and English, (great sign), and ordering is a simple as strolling up to the counter and taking a chance - something tells me that it's hard to go wrong here. I ordered the hot garlic shrimp arepa and the grilled chicken empenada. If you have never had an arepa, I really don't know how to describe it. I guess it's like a crumbly corn bun with your choice of filling piled up in the middle. Does that sound right or even make sense? Who cares, they're delicious! So great in fact that I've now tracked down a few places in SD serving arepas that I can only hope compare to what VLA is serving up in Sin City. Oh yeah, the empenada gets some love too. The grilled chicken that they loaded up in that bad boy with a drizzle of their house sauces made for a perfect and timely hangover cure.I'm a bit torn in writing this review. I've had Viva Las Arepas (VLA) bookmarked for the better part of two years now, hell maybe more and it wasn't until recently had I been able to finally stop in. I love that there are still highly rated,  non-boojie, cheap, no frills food near the strip. I love even more that it's Venezuelan food.  Unfortunately, I may have been driven by the hype so much that I was left slightly disappointed. After a very long, grueling work schedule, my beau (bless his tired heart) was sweet enough to bring me here because I listed it on my top 3 places to eat while in Vegas.  We drove up to VLA, which isn't a stand anymore, they've transitioned to a brick & mortar. The parking lot is shared with other establishments and can get crowded during peak hours. The menu is large enough to spell some confusion for those salivating tastebuds. I know these arepas can be filling so I definitely had to strategize my meal. The man just got himself a carne arepa (non shredded) and 3 shredded beef empanadas. I got the pork buttt and carne arepas in addition to a chicken empanada. Our plates came out hot and fresh within a few minutes and those empanadas were super hot--so hot that a piece of it was left thrown and regurgitated back onto our tray lol (wasn't by me though). We enjoyed both empanadas though I will say the shredded beef was better than the chicken. We also both agreed they needed more meat in them. I love the arepa itself, and they generously filled 'em with our protein of choice. Unfortunately, neither of us were impressed with their beef. It was tough and lacked flavor. Even with all that drippy sauce, there was just something amiss with the beef. The pork butt I did enjoy. It was moist and tasty, and once I was carb loaded, I picked out all the pork and gobbled it all up. As cheap a meal as I thought it would be, we still paid $30++. Overall, I'm saddened this long sought bookmark didn't wow me, but I wouldn't mind giving it another try.Items Selected:Fried Pork Rinds & Yucca RootFried PlantainsWood Fire Chicken Arepa with Tomato, Lettuce, OnionsRoasted Pork Butt Arepa with Tomato and CheeseGuava and Cheese PastelitoSet beside Art of Flavors, where another star-studded sampling had just concluded in the best 'ice cream sandwich' ever to cross my lips, it was with long-held interest and a touch of gluttony that I finally entered Viva Las Arepas; my "some for now with the rest for later" order rooted not only in convenience but also in hopes of avoiding a later trip from home for dinner.  Ever popular amongst locals and tourists alike with a menu focused on the Venezuelan flatbread sandwich alongside additional items both grilled and fried the time was just past two on my arrival to the deceptively large space and greeted by a short line with the dining room 2/3 full it would not be long before I found myself standing at the counter, a friendly middle-aged man expediting orders and assigning me number #36, my five boxed selections delivered to the table a mere fifteen minutes thereafter.   Clearly a restaurant vested in its core with a menu infrequent to change it was in a duo of 'sides' that my meal began and although bland plantains dripping with excess grease quickly proved inedible the unlikely star of the show would in fact be the wood-grilled pigskins, a crispy exterior overlying supple fat with intense brine offset by tender chunks of fried yucca.  Moving next to a pair of arepas it was with the wood grilled chicken that I started yet with flavors no better than the frozen stuff from Roots sold at Walmart I quickly moved to the pork-butt, the flavor almost indistinguishable from the bird as a trickle of oil ran down my hand into the napkin below.  At this point tossing what was left of each sandwich to instead sample the rinds and root with accompanying sauces it was finally with the $2 Pastelito that I finished and although tasty enough to stand on its own I couldn't help but think that for a buck per bite I'd have been better off staying next door with another scoop of gelato.*Yelp 100 challenge complete!As much as Vegas is founded on facades and paradoxes, I found it pleasantly appropriate that perhaps the best food I had in Vegas came from this hole-in-the-wall place in the corner of a sketchy looking strip mall far from the Strip as opposed even to the meal I had a L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon!One of the benefits of Vegas is that can you drive a few miles and start your morning with some Hawaiian Poke, have some French for lunch, and finish with Venezuelan food. I'm glad we came here, saving this local gem for last.The Arepas here were fantastic all served piping hot. To rank them in order:1) Reina Peplada: Chicken Breast, Mayo, Avocado, Cilantro2) Wood Fire Beef - think carne asada3) Garlic Shrimp - big pieces of shrimp just not the best shrimp in qualityThe corn meal bun is crisp and houses some incredibly tasty meat. They give you sauces but thats not necessary with all that is going on in the arepas. Also the Yucca Root fries were good fat fries but I will go with their normal french fries next time.And I know it is just rotisserie chicken but something about that actual hickory wood fire grill really brought out the flavor in the Wood Fire Chicken plate ($14.99). It was perfectly moist and tender and the skin was the right amount of char and crisp.I thought the Passion Fruit juice edged the Mango juice and it is refreshing and the right complement to the arepas.My advice to Vegas-goers is to take a slight detour to Viva Las Arepas for some very delicious comfort food. Then make it extra special by going right next door to Art of Flavors (one of the best gelatos I've had in the city). Viva Las Arepas!Tip: Ask to sample juice flavorsThis popular downtown eats has been on my recent bookmarks to try. Arepas...a South American sandwich made of corn flatbread and various fillings.Located in the popular area of other Yelpdom heavy hitters like Art of Flavors and Goodwich, I figured Viva Las Arepas would be a no-brainer favorite.The restaurant inside is clean and warm, with more seating than parking available. If you haven't been, parking in the front is nearly non - existent.We ordered the Reina Pepiada, which is a featured review item and wood fired chicken arepas, plus an order of Yucca fries.In seeing the photos of the Reina Pepiada, I expected the sauce to be a light, creamy cilantro avocado type of dressing. What I actually experienced was very heavy and overly sauced chicken. With each bite, I kept thinking how the addition of a nice fresh slaw could cut some of that richness. The tortas were also heavy and chewy and again my expectations of a light, fluffy flatbread were dashed. I did like the peas, though. They provided additional sauces, which was unnecessary considering the meat was already drowning in it. The yucca fries were nothing special.  My daugter seemed to enjoy her wood fired chicken arepa. The Reina Pepiada didn't sit well with my wife as she was sick the rest of the night.Viva Las Arepas fell short of what I wanted to experience. I so wanted to love this place, but didn't. I will continue to search to hopefully find my ideal arepa.Ok, so I read a couple of reviews where people say this is located in a scary neighborhood. Nope. Asides from a few drunks and homeless folks wandering around, It's pretty tame for Las Vegas. The dining area is pretty clean, and they just recently added an outdoor seating area in the front.I go here at least a couple of times a month because:- it's cheap- I don't have to think about what I'm gonna get, since I always get the same things- it's right next door to AOFThe arepas range in price from $4 for a cheese arepa to $7 for a garlic shrimp arepa. I usually stick to eating the Reina Pepiada, (chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro), or the Perico, (scrambled egg, ham & cheese, onion and tomato). If I'm not mistaken, the Reina Pepiada is the only arepa served cold. Kind of reminds me of a cold chicken salad sandwich, but with a lot more chicken. Nice to have places like this to dine at, especially if you are budget-conscious. Beats the hell out of going to a fast food chain. For $20, you and a date can grab an arepa here with a huge order of fries, then bounce over to AOF to grab dessert. After dessert, have some fun and browse the selection of lingerie and adult novelties in the boutique next door! Cheap and convenient date options!Wow. What a difference since the first visit. I ordered the same thing I had before, shrimp arepa, yucca fries, and soursop. I took a bite of my arepa and immediately had to spit it out. The shrimp tasted rotten and the arepa was so greasy it made me sick just looking at. Then I bit into the yucca fries, they were dry rotted. $14 for one arepa, fries and a drink. I'm so mad at myself for not going back and demanding a refund for nasty, rotten food. Never again.I promise you that Viva Las Arepas is a little piece of heaven just on the outskirts of the city where you allow all your sins run free. In addition to mindless betting, grandeur casinos, and endless shopping boutiques, Las Vegas is about good eating, and there is a lot of it. I was feeling a little disinterested from fine dining everyday during my little Vegas weekend getaway so my date wanted me to try his cherished best kept secret in Las Vegas which is now one of my treasured eateries that I look forward to trying again upon my next visit.Located just outside of The Strip near The Stratosphere, Viva Las Arepas wouldn't be noted to be in the prettiest part of the neighborhood. As well as the establishment is not the most elegant, the food was spectacular.Without knowing exactly what an arepa was, I ordered the Reina Pepiada, a cold chicken salad covered in avocado and mayonnaise dressing whilst my date ordered a wood-fired chicken arepa. We added an additional cheese empanada for me, and a beef empanada for him since I have never had an empanada either.Once our order was ready, my Reina Pepiada arepa reminded me of an overstuffed torta, but better! and once I tasted my arepa I knew this place was a special gem. The avocado mayonnaise sauce is really something that distinctively brought out the flavours. They also provide two bottles of their signature sauces; reach for the lighter green + garlic one, it is pure heaven, I wasn't shy to spread it all over my food.The cheese empanada was still warm with gooey cheese. For just 3 dollars, this was delish! They also threw in a little extra extra for us; a sweet guava + cheese pastry, mm!I cannot stop noting about Viva Las Arepas to my friends and other fellow Yelpers, this is one place not to be missed. I mean, if it wasn't for the cheese empanada order with the surprise sweet treat, I would order two of these on my next return xFlavorful experience!I've had this place on my mind for several months and finally made our way over to it for a late lunch on a weekend. It was a beautiful day and wanted to enjoy our food outside since they have a cute little corner space. We ordered - a chicken arepa with avocado and a pork butt one with cheese. Next came a beef empanada, fried plantains and a sugar cane drink with lime. The chicken arepa had some type of sauce on it and it was way too wet for my taste. I loved the pork butt and it was my favorite part of the meal, especially with the delicious creamy cilantro sauce over it! The beef empanada was ok, expected more flavor. The plantains were fantastic and the perfect way to end the meal. I would skip the sugar cane with lime drink as it was very sour. Here's the rest of the story and why I couldn't give it a higher rating. As I mentioned above we chose to sit outside because the weather was perfect. A homeless man came over and sat next to our table and began staring at me. It was nearly impossible to enjoy my food and we ended up buying him food. He chose to sit next to us and eat it as he continued to stare me down. Then came over a couple who were high as kites and the male wanted to show us his junk. He was committed to this and with every passing minute was also screaming at his female friend. I wanted to crawl under the table. So next time I'm siting inside no matter how beautiful it is outside!I was trying to think of a dumb arepa joke and didn't have much success.  Knock, knock. Who's there?Arepa. Arepa who? Arepa any man who brings me delicious venezuelan sammiches. Womp womp womp.  I told you it was going to be dumb.  Went on Saturday 11-7-15 around 8pm to grab a quick bite.  $10.57 got me a chicken arepa with black beans and a beef empanada. This is actually my second time here and I really like arepas.  Being from the south and eating lots of hominy and grits, an arepa is kind of like if you made a hamburger bun out of really thick, fine-ground grits and then stuffed it with lettuce, cheese, chicken, etc.  They are really tasty.  I think next time I'll just get the beans and cheese kind because their chicken is sooooo salty.

The service was AWFUL!! let me elaborate: 1. we tried to use Groupon we had by showing it via our smart phone. They said we needed it printed out or they won't accept it. so the suggestion was 'either give them the printed version or COME BACK OTHER TIME'2. the server spilled my coke all over the table and never give me another bottle or any refill3. our Groupon promotion states that we are supposed to get 12 chicken wings. Only 9 were served. When we asked the server, she said that they 'go by pounds, not numbers' Seriously? how should we believe that? 4. It took a long time to get a check even though there were enough servers that we almost missed our movie5. Unsatisfied with the service, we barely left any tips. When the server saw that, she said 'DON'T COME BACK' to our face. FYI, I will NOT BE GOING BACK THERE. Never mind the food.A bunch of friends and I had out Friday dinner here. Didn't have to wait for a table, that was super nice. The burger was really tasty. I had québécois burger with onion ring. I like their bun especially, very soft. The atmosphere was pretty great too, the music wasn't overwhelming loud. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because their sweet potato fries wasn't crispy.

Update timeI had an eggplant sauteed in olive oil and spices, served on a hoagie roll with 3 cheeses, and egg, lettuce, tomato and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. IT ROCKEDBobby will customize anything you ask if he has the food to make it. JUST ASK.No sides just plenty of sandwich.Funky little breakfast and lunch cafe with an ecclectic menu.Some may say a jack of all trades masters none, but to know a little about everything is exactly the kind of knowledge a cafe "chef" should have.Where else in the known universe can one indulge in a Rainbow Doughnut and breakfast burrito in the morning, then come back to the same place and not be able to decide if you want a pizzasteak sandwich, spicy Terriyaki chicken bowl, or fried bologna for lunch?Awesome friendly service from Bobby, too. Yes, that's him. Say hello and make a special request.  If he has the food in the building, he'll cook it for you however you like!

Review Text :
I'm seriously considering going back to all my AYCE sushi reviews and moving them down a star. THAT's how good it was. I can't believe this is the 3rd Japanese restaurant in this location in 5 years. To go from Sushi Hana to Shin to this. Goyemon has by far the best decor of the three. Sushi Hana just had these gross green painted walls and an old ass TV showing ESPN for chrissakes! Along with your usual suspects for nigiri and rolls...they have a ton more including daily specials. Highlights included their inhouse smoked salmon (smokiest salmon ever!), big eye tuna nigiri and "kobe" beef nigiri although the beef being kobe was highly suspect. No big deal. Pork belly was like the best piece of bacon ever. I also like how yellowtail collar (1 order per person) is on the menu. So good! Its like a super meaty fish chicken wing kinda sorta. A must. We were pretty lucky to be seated around 6pm since there was a bit of a wait for tables about 10 min later. Not that many seats so definitely be prepared to stand around for a while. I love how this is so close to my place. No more drives to Sushi Mon on Sahara for me. I'm actually ready to go back here...like...now.A tough week calls for a pick me up dinner. Sometimes I worry about going to a new place with crazy rave reviews as I feel my standards are jilted to high and come out feeling like it was over hyped even if the place is good I ate words- like "yum", "oh that's fresh", and "lets get another order". We really wanted to try all the specials so we started off there. Today the chalkboard had:Big Eye Tuna- had a richer, tuna taste than regular tuna. Anago/Saltwater Eel- this was delish. It's softer and less slimy than freshwater and as much as I like unagi, I wish more places would have this. Japanese Snapper- this was very delicate of a flavor and very fresh. I find some snapper has a very chewy texture and almost muddy taste. Aji/Spanish Makerel- this was nice. I like the grated ginger on top, but I love gingery stuff. White Clam- the BF doesn't normally enjoy such thing but even he appreciated the flavor. I thought this was good and must for people who love the chewy nigiris like tako, hokkigai, ika. Regular nigiri menu:Cajun Albacore- good seasoning. I appreciate that their ponzu sauce isn't overtly citrusy and is much more delicate than other places. There's some places that have that "fake" lime taste and kills all other flavor.Albacore- good and freshSuper White Yellowtail- buttery in texture- very freshMackerel- good, but with the cure+ soy is too salty. 2nd order I asked for ponzu and it was much better this way. One thing I noticed about the nigiri cuts is that some have a very faint citrus note on it. Not like someone squeezed lemon, but I suspect that they wipe their blades with a citrus water which imparts a hint of it. If you douse your rice in soy, you won't probably taste it, but I barely dip any soy onto my fish. This is something I've seen done in Japan so kudos if that's what flavored it. Even at my current favorite place, there's some days where certain fish is just okay. Everything today was fresh and on. The daily specials rotating is a great idea since those are intriguing and were all fresh. I like there is half rolls- we tried the Calico and Ecstacy which are both pretty decent as far as rolls go. Appetizers: The famed pork belly was pretty tasty!- Crispy, melty, salty, sweet and tangy balance. Dynamite- most places but too much mayo. BF liked this and I appreciated it was a bit crispy on top. Orgasm salad- nice that you get a little sashimi salad action and it wasn't overly dressed or too much greens to fish ratio. Hamachi Kama- we love yellowtail collars and theirs was good. I wish the skin of it was crispier though....nothing beats when it's like fish skin chips, but only one ayce so far grills it to that (Island). Grilled Yellowtail- this was on the specials board and was a good piece with some sweet glaze Dessert: I like that you can get more than just one dessert (though some desserts have a 1order pp limit). BF and I shared the green tea creme brulee, green tea cake and tofu cheesecake. The green tea creme brulee was the winner for both of us. It isn't light on the matcha though so if you don't like the strong green tea taste then it might be a bit much but it is creamy, bittersweet burnt matcha and sugar goodness. Service was great! That was one that put it over the edge for us. Servers checked on us often, was on top of drinks, had some suggestions and were friendly. It wasn't too busy until the end of our meal and the service didn't suffer just because we weren't the only ones there. The sushi chefs were super nice, funny and personable. We had Tony during the first half of dinner then Fredo came in. Fredo is all jokes and curses. I'm all for it, but just a warning to those who can't handle a fucking joke. I also like the decor in here- definitely one of the nicer ambiance ayces around. We will be returning soon (and I will be coming sooner for the UYE) ! I feel we might be coming here on a regular and making this our favorite spot if this service and quality stays true.EDIT- Just wanted to say that the UYE had so many people (25) plus a filled restaurant and our service was still friendly, organized as possible (had separate checks ready for all us) and a reasonable pace on the food. Kudos to the staff! They work really hard here to keep up with the crowd.This is a review of their a la carte options.The Skinny: Although we didn't partake of their AYCE, their a la carte items and bento were below par. FYI - if you do not have their AYCE, the menu and pricing can be confusing (2.5) Service: messed up bill which my hubby had to actually grab a menu and show the waitress that she was wrong (2), Value: given the experience here, I wouldn't come back.(2).I was enthused to see a highly rated sushi place. So I nagged the hubby to come try this place out. When we arrived. we weren't hungry enough to try their AYCE option. Instead we ordered their deluxe bento (with a side salad and miso soup), katsu curry and a side order of the grilled pork belly.FYI - if you order a la carte, the prices are all on the actual fold-out menu NOT what's on the AYCE sheet or the supplement page on the placemat. Make sure you check your bill because we were charged for the more expensive price for pork belly (ie, supplement for the AYCE add- on) instead of the a la carte price. The waitress asked the chef instead of checking the menu and didn't believe us. My hubby had to ask for the menu to show her the difference. The deluxe bento suffered from many problems but let's just start off with the baby upchuck masquerading as some sort of misguided egg salad they put in the top right hand corner. (see pic: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q&select=pNoiIE--ccKc0V8o2PwRgw) Or perhaps the completely anemic "teriyaki chicken" which didn't even have grill marks on them. The fried salmon and tempura were both soggy. We had to ask for tempura sauce. Sashimi - the fish was cut into thick chunks but isn't cut in the proper matter allowing the fish to melt in your mouth. For what it's worth, the California maki was okay. There was little to no katsu with the katsu curry.  (FYI - the cutlet in the photo represents about 40% of the entire cutlet which is rather small for $8 see pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=tl0GrsOs4ViWjApsgaBvog ). The curry itself was overly thick and bland due to the addition of perhaps too much potatoes.Finally, the grilled pork belly. While the texture of the pork belly was nice, the flavour of the pork was overly smoky for our tastes. The addition of the rather oddly sour tasting mango salsa was a deteriment to the dish. Certainly not something we would order again and we found it expensive for the price.Overall given our experience with a la carte, we probably won't be stopping by for AYCE. But certainly check your bill if you do decide to do the a la carte tasting.So when i was asked what i would like for dinner on our final night in Vegas i said Sushi please!!  Lucky for me, Minh D knew about this awesome place that is located off the strip and is moderate priced       ($26.95 for AYCE) and open till 3:00am. Parking wasnt bad and we were warmly welcomed and seated at a table right away.Hungry and not knowing what to order first (I love sushi and could probally eat my weight in it). Minh said he was getting the AYCE which was unlimited sushi that had to be consumed in 60minutes with no left over rice on the plates, if there was any traces of sushi or rice left overs they would charge you A La Carte prices. You can not share with other non AYCE people at your table, however you can share if anyone at your table is partaking in the AYCE challenge which is a good thing and highly recommended!! So after really thinking about it i decided to challenge myself and do it!! Heck you only live once, gotta try different things!!In no order and from what i can remember before the sushi coma totally took over:Grilled Tofu Salad-Grilled Tofu and spring mix served with a garlic sesame dressing.Tryed some of Minh's Grilled Pork Belly-Grilled pork belly served with mango salsaHalf roll- Philadelphia Roll-Salmon,Cream Cheese,Avocado,Cucumber topped with smelt eggsHalf roll-California RollFive piece Roll (no half boo)- Spider Roll-Deep fried soft shell crab meat,cucumber,avocado with eel sauce and wrapped in soybean paperHalf roll- Chicken teriyaki roll (Do not order, sadly the chicken was so dry it almost gaged me)Between all those rolls and eating some of Minh's i started to realize that i could not finish all of this. Taking a rest and also walking around the food just wasnt wanting to settle. Sadly i had to tap out half way through the challenge. This little cupcake has had her fill of sushi for the next month and a half!! I was looking forward to saving room for dessert which they had Green Tea Creme Brulee (my favorite).  Untill next time we are in town, i think i will come better prepared for such a challenge!!WHERE: Located on Tropicana & Decatur.WHEN: 5pm-3am (dinner & late dinnertime!)WHY: Have you ever posted "best sushi in LV" topics on Yelp Talk? If so, no need to ask anymore, because this is it!! THE BEST ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI JOINT IN TOWN! WITHOUT A DOUBT!WHAT: Firstly, we got to test out the new party room! There were 20 of us sushi-eaters ready to devour and take advantage of that AYCE sushi menu! The servers were all dolls! They were extremely helpful (knowing how hectic a large party can be) and us paying separately did not scare them at all. They were well-prepared! COOL points for the staff that night!So, on to the food! I would just like to state the fact that each dish was made with such perfection! From the many attractive flavors, to the presentation!SOME THINGS I TRIED:Orgasm salad: Something a little bit different! The sauce blend had a little tang and zest to it, which actually made the salad.Pastel roll: shrimp and crab wrapped inside soy paper, shrimp and avocado on top, slightly drizzled with spicy yum & eel sauce on top!911 roll: To all of you spice-aholics, you need to try this one! I personally thought that I would be able to take some HEAT, but I had to LEAVE THE KITCHEN for this one! After several drinks of water and patiently waiting it out, the spice stuck to my tongue! So, the tip for this roll: BEWARE, AND PROCEED WITH CAUTION! hahaI LOVE BAKED ROLLS! So, I love the fact that they have a handful of great ones!O.I.D. roll: shrimp & asparagus wrapped in salmon & baked with yumyum sauce! Oh whatt?!!Baked 428: I had to try this one just because it said baked chicken inside the roll! I have never tried a chicken roll =)Goyemon lasagna roll: I love japanese lasagna rolls, so I always try it in every sushi spot. & this won my heart over! My absolute favorite lasagna roll of all time!DESSERT! Oh how I love the end of beautiful beginnings solely due to dessert! So... there are a couple of desserts you may choose from on the ayce menu, (tempura, mochi, etc) meaning you can get as much as you'd like?! There is a separate dessert menu you can choose from as well, where you are only allowed to pick one on there! And on this beautiful menu lay "GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE," which happened to be my pick! =D It was completely marvelous!Lastly, I would like to give a shoutout to my fellow yelper, Nelson Q., for introducing me to such greatness! You got me hooked, my friend! So hooked that I will be back there next week!WINNER, WINNER, SUSHI DINNER!OK, it's a 5 star review, but was almost 4 stars.  Came here on a Saturday night, and it was of course busy, but there were two tables of 2 open that I could have been seated in way sooner.  The staff were trying to wait for the table between them to get up so they could seat a party of 6, even though there was another table for them opening up shortly, so my party could have been eating sushi sooner.  But whatever, I won't hold that against them.The AYCE sushi was awesome, as all the other reviewers already covered.  The toro was just out of this world, and so was the sweet shrimp.  Everything else was pretty well above average, except for the salmon, which was nice and big but just wasn't as delicious as a few other spots I've been to around town.   Oh yes, the hamachi was great as well.  Kept ordering "one more order" at the end of the meal.Had a couple 1/2 rolls that were ok.  I'd much rather eat nigiri.  Also tried a few of the unusual (for AYCE at least) items like the crispy rice with spicy tuna and the grilled pork belly.  Again, everything was delicious.Also was offered a punch card when I paid, which I wasn't sure if they'd have or not.  Kind of rubbing it in my face, because I had a fully stamped card from Sushi Hana, the place that used to be in the space Goyemon is in, and then they shut down.  OK, let's try this again.  8 meals to go!Every time I've been here it's always been busy even at 5 which is when they open. I always sit at the sushi bar, it has the best & fastest service. I've been here about 4 times now and it kills me that I don't remember the sushi chefs' names but my favorites are the hispanic chef and the Hawaiian chef! They always remember & take care of me and are so helpful. I pretty much only eat nigiri on my AYCE adventures so I can't really comment on any of the rolls. All of the fish are always fresh & delicious and the great thing is that they don't pack on the rice! I'm not a huge fan of the pork belly side dish but the hamachi kama is a winner! They also have Monta ramen available but trust you don't want to be filling up on noodles when there's sushi to be eaten lol Make sure to always check their Specials board for what's hot on the menu for that day! They have a really good dessert menu and you can sample each one! My favorite is the lychee sorbet, simple yet refreshing and it satisfies my sweet tooth! I love this place because it's clean, the quality is great and the service is amazing! So be sure to take care of your sushi chefs and servers! Also make sure to get a stamp card because at $26.95 you want to get ALL your money's worth ;)The Husband and I have been anxious awaiting our turn to check out this newly popular AYCE sushi joint in the southwest part of town and we finally got a chance last week!  (After all, this location once housed Sushi Hana and SHIN Yakitori.)Open only for dinner from 5:00 pm to 3:00 am, we made it our mission to be waiting when the doors open.  We weren't the only ones on a Sunday night to think of this, but were definitely glad we did.Beyond the standard sushi rolls and sushi, what makes Sushi House Goyemon a star higher than others?  These were noteworthy in my book:* Specials board: Oh my goodness!  This is what got me!  They had off the standard menu fish like bonito, kampachi, sardines, and yuzu tobiko that were included in AYCE.  That was definitely a highlight in my book!  Loving the yuzu tobiko!* Pork Belly - Yes, everyone talks about it and it's good stuff.  We love pork belly - we have marinated cooked pork belly sitting in our freezer ready to throw into the rice cooker at a moment's notice.  We love pork belly.  Sure, the portion is a meager two pieces at a time, but it's AYCE, so order up more!* Shoyu Ramen is included in AYCE after 11 pm.  Sure, we missed this, but it got the Husband all excited with the possibility of it.  (Why someone would want to fill their belly with ramen and soup during an AYCE sushi fest is beyond me.)* Dessert included, as in ALL the desserts are included!  I've been to other AYCE sushi joints that may or may not included AYCE ice cream, but they not only have a few ice cream flavors, but four different desserts to choose from.  Uh, score a point there!  We tried them all - Green Tea Cake, Chocolate Mousse, Plum Wine Jelly, and Green Tea Creme Brulee.* Hot or Iced Green Tea is included.So, what's with all the mixed reviews?  The major problem here is service.  I read over the recent reviews and took note of the declining service and definitely can attest to what the other yelpers are complaining about.  We were lucky that Chizuru was our primary waitress because she is stellar.  And the rest of the staff, that's the problem.  From the moment we walked in and said party of four and one highchair, the hostess/waitress totally forgot to bring a highchair.  Other staff people were just not attentive, as I was often seen waving my arms around to get their attention.  Waiters who refill your beverages should really put your glass back in front of you, not at the other end of the table and watch you struggle to reach across to get it.  There are just some people who are just really good at restaurant service and others that could use some improvementNonetheless, we've been gone so long from the AYCE world that we are happy to go back.  Yeah, we'll be back this week!4.5 stars.They offer a frequent eater card, which is always nice.  Looks like they are related to Sushi Mon and Monta Ramen as well.  Good to know!They also take reservations for their party room from 10-20 people.  Last seating for AYCE is 2:00 am!After reading all the wonderful high-rated reviews, I bookmarked this spot as our final cheat meal for our stay in Vegas during the Olympia 2011 weekend. Hmph...it was not the best idea and here are the reasons why:1. When we got there around 7:45pm, Saturday night, the place was packed...and I mean packed as in it's super small and doesn't have much seating available, so when you include the AYCE option, I can tell why the wait here is always LONG. We waited for over 45 minutes before a table finally decided to get their bootays up and leave. Even though, the waitress was kind enough to offer the 3 of us seating at the bar, we opted to get a regular table and let the bar be available for the couples/singles.2. The AYCE menu is quite confusing. You can't have everything all-you-can-eat...meh?? There were certain items on there were you were only allowed one order per person. So the math did get confusing for me. I'm no bueno with numbers here people!3. FOOD: The pork belly that everyone raved about was MEH for me. The sushi rolls were also A-OK, nothing too crazy besides the nutso 9-11 roll we ordered. That habanero sauce they used on that roll had my mouth feelin like Angelina Jolie for a good 1/2 hour. OMG! The sashimi and fresh fish was very fresh indeed and those orders always came out the quickest. The chicken skewers were...what they were, just chicken skewers with Teriyaki sauce all ova em, again...nothing special there. The ONLY thing I really did enjoy was the AYCE option of DESSERTS! Mmmm, mmm bombalicous! I had 2 of the green tea creme brulees (which were sooooo decadent and perfect) and 1 red bean ice cream, how can you go wrong with anything that has beans in it? Yes, I'm Asian and I love my beany desserts! =P4. SERVICE: It got kinda confusing who our server was. There were some dudes that would come out with our order but didn't take our order and then we had about 3 waiters that did take our orders back & forth. Major minus? Food came out WAY too slow-momo. I know there are only about 3 chefs working, but the place is tiny and I've been to plenty AYCE sushi spots and never had to wait about 15 min between each order. I'm ALWAYS hungry! Especially now since I'm still in precontest season for my fitness competition, so if I'm looking forward to a cheat meal, it better be top notch and the food better come out FAST. Sushi House Goyemon did NOT do this job well.Would I come back? For the desserts? Yes. But even that's not really worth the trip there.P.S. We had to hit up Jean Philippe Patisserie at the ARIA (since it's the only thing open super late and close to our hotel) right after we left this spot cuz my ass was still HUNGRY as EFF!Lowest quality of any AYCE sushi restaurant I've ever experienced in Vegas.  I expect previously frozen, gassed fish at any AYCE place but not color added fish.   Unless I missed a new trend in genetic engineering, there is no such thing as bright fuchsia colored tuna or brilliant orange salmon.  What's worse is many items (tuna, hamachi, salmon, shrimp) have a dry, rubbery texture as if it was previously frozen and thawed using tap water.The rice is seasoned well but is so compacted, it's the densest sushi I've ever had.Decent creativity but by the end of the meal, I never wanted to hear "yum yum sauce" again.  This mayo based concoction is slathered on almost everything.  Cloying and fatty, even hot tea can't cut its mouth grip.Service was OK, I mean I did get a menu, water, food, and the check but with every additional order, I felt less like a welcome guest and more like a theif hacking away at the profit.Maybe a bad night?  I doubt it. The fundamentals are wrong.  Not worth it considering how many better AYCE restaurants dot Vegas.Take all your vega$ winnings and splurge it here, folks! The QUALITY of the sushi was SUPERME.  For $25 a pop, you are granted unlimited amounts of sushi including their specials of the day.  in other words, AYCE!I won't hit every single item I consumed but some of the key ones that I enjoyed personally were:+ Salmon Belly: If this is listed on their Special of the Day menu, do not hesitate to order this! Smooth and Yummy!+ Tempura Shrimp: I know what you're saying, how can this be good? The tempura was light and crispy.  Shrimp tasted as if it was just taken out of the water and cooked to perfection.+ Tempura Ice Cream: pretty good, light tempura shell and soft ice cream.Do not feel overwhelmed as you can spend a couple of hours digging into every single Nigiri item.  Their AYCE also included Appetizers (all), Dessert, and Special Rolls.  I recommend sitting at the counter so you can socialize with their Sushi Chef who will charm and enlighten you with his culinary life and knowledge of the sushi world.  Plus, you can place your order on the fly.  A QUICK TIP: Ramen served in the Evening.  I would most definitely make a return when I'm back in good ole' (third home) Vega$.I gave them 4 stars on my first visit for dinner AYCE.....and I was hoping that it would be as good for lunch AYCE....no such luck.  It was atrocious, revolting excuse for sushi.When I walked in, I had a bad feeling when I saw two latino looking sushi chefs at the tsukeba.  Not that I have anything against non-japanese itamae, but from my fairly vast experience....it's not a good sign in general and boy was I right.  Since I'm Japanese, I don't order any rolls.  I always go with straight nigiri, none of those yum yum sauce, fancy rolls bulshit and here are what's wrong with their "sushi".1)  It was ugly.  Cuts of fish were uneven, too small, and were just very asymmetrical and poorly balanced with rice.  When you have two pieces and they look so different, there is a significant lack in their sense of aesthetics, and more importantly, utter luck of skill.2)  Sushi rice was horrendous.  To make things worse, there were 2 sushi "chefs" and they seem to be using very inconsistent sushi rice.  One was soft and overly sticky, and the other was dry and hard.  Neither of them had proper vinegar flavor, and was too bland to be called "sushi rice".  They obviously have no idea or skill to make proper sushi rice, which is just as, if not MORE important than the fish that goes on it.  3)  Utter lack of nigiri skill.  Sushi rice was too hard.  You had to chew it.  That is what happens to amateurs and newbies who do not have the proper skills to maintain shape of nigiri while having enough air within it so that if falls apart in the mouth.4)  The wasabi issue- I was embarrassed for them.  My first order of nigiris had no wasabi.  So I asked the waitress (non-japanese) that I need to have wasabi in the sushi.  She comes back 2 minutes later that "most people" don't want wasabi so the "chefs" cannot put wasabi in the nigiri.  Let me repeat "THE CHEFS CANNOT PUT WASABI IN THE NIGIRI"Let me make this straight.  In Japan, the sushi chefs will occasionally make UPON REQUEST nigiris WITHOUT wasabi for little children, I mean like kindergarden aged kids. Never do they even consider NOT putting wasabi for adults.  So I tell this non Japanese waitress that I don't care what "most people" want.  I want wasabi in the nigiri so that I don't have to peel the fish off of rice and have to put it on there, and it is the PROPER way to make a nigiri.  So she goes back and talks with this "chefs" and they finally comply with my "request" to make a proper nigiri WITH wasabi.  It's very unfortunate that whoever the Japanese sushi chef is there allows these "sushi chefs" to let these joke of a sushi out to customers under their roof.  I asked the waitress if there are any Japanese chefs at lunch time and she says that it depends on their schedule, sometimes yes, sometimes not.  Well if a real chefs can't be there to properly supervise these jokers then they might as well close down the restaurant instead of allowing these atrocious nigiri's out to the customers who may have the palate and knowledge of what a real sushi should be like.  The management should be embarrassed with what went on today.  If people think that this kind of atrocity is sushi, then I am truly saddened.  There are better restaurants with real japanese sushi chefs in this town who serve decent AYCE sushi.  But if people have numb enough palates to keep going here then so be it.First of all, I don't like to give bad reviews, and I generally consider myself a patient person, but I came here after working a 13 hour shift and I was starving. Gave my name to the host for a table for two, waited a good 15 mins, gentleman who comes in after, gets seated before me, really? Um ok? Finally seated and drink orders placed, my iced green tea tastes like dirty water. Then we order a couple things (I generally don't do AYCE sushi because I find the fish isn't good) so I opted to do a la carte for my first visit. I don't like rolls with mayo, or dairy, or sauces like "orgasm sauce". I immediately noticed the rice to fish ratio was way off, fish was dry, rice was dry. Great. Now let me get to the service.....we couldn't get our server to come around once, the cutest little old lady sitting at the table next to us flagged a server down for her check and then told them that we needed our server as well. Again, never saw her. At this point it's when I contemplated walking out and leaving money for what I thought we owed. Service was atrocious. Never refilled my drink and couldn't order any more food, which was probably a good thing. I will never give this place a second try or recommend. Overrated.After the epic meal in the tatami room hosted by Tony T. (see my review for the event), Eric R. bugged me to return here for dinner.  We arrived on Saturday around 7 and were seated immediately at the bar.  The AYCE is an amazing deal, as it includes the specials on the daily special board, grill items, salads, rolls, nigiri, and all sorts of other things.Some of the new things I tried included the grilled tofu which was quite tasty and amaebi shrimp head miso soup.  The shrimp were a bit harder to eat since they were not fried, but the flavor of them in the broth was good.  The mackerel was cured wonderfully.Since we were at the bar, we had a nice view of the crazy action here.  We were taken care of by 4 different sushi chefs, and it took me awhile to even start a conversation with Chef Jun, a real Japanese chef yay!, in front of us.However, the biggest disappointment is the rice.  Sushi is all about the rice.  The volume of this restaurant is huge because of the crowds, and the rice is not acceptable for sushi rice.  First of all, it was HOT.  I am talking just made, no cooling/fanning and hardly any vinegar/seasoning.  HOT rice with ice cold fish tastes bizzaroooo.  It ruined the meal.  I noticed the first time we ate here that the nigiri slices were all out of whack.  Because of the volume, the slices are not cut with precision but with speed.  I watched the chefs cut awkward nigiri slices that barely covered the hot rice.  Eric R. asked Chef Jun about the rice.  He said they have such a demand that they just use hot rice, and he apologized because he knows it is just like sushi faux pas 101...most sushi restaurants I have been to make rice in advance.  As someone who learned how to make the rice from a local Japanese market recently, I know that it requires 45 minutes to an hour of fanning and cooling prior to serving, and that is for my small batches (3 cups at a time).  Though there is a lot of variety and I have no complaints about the service or quality, I could never enjoy hot rice touching cold uni or cold amaebi or cold hamachi...you get the idea.AYCE appetizers, AYCE daily specials and AYCE dessert.  That, to me, is what makes Goyemon stand out above the competition.  We're not just talking miso soup or mochi ice cream either!  Delicious pork belly, yummy grilled veggies, daily sushi specials, green tea cake, black sesame creme brulee...these are some unique offerings.Sushi here is good, and the daily specials always offer a good variety of fish to try.  All of my visits start out with me ordering one of every special, both sushi and grilled items.  The one thing that I haven't really been fond of is the rice.  I know that they get very busy, but it seems like their sushi rice is almost fresh from the rice cooker; by time the sushi gets to the table, the rice is warm and the fish feels like it's been sitting at room temperature for a while.  It's never been bad enough to ruin a meal, but it is something I notice each visit.  To be fair, other people I've dined with either don't notice it or it isn't a big deal, so it could be a personal thing.Outside of my little rice quirk, Goyemon is a solid choice for sushi.  It has a big roll selection for your casual sushi friends, as well as a good fish selection for you nigiri folk.  Add in the appetizers and desserts to help cleanse your palate, and you have a dinner spot fit for most, if not all of your friends!I've had this place bookmarked for a long time &  finally got a chance to try it out!!As with all AYCE, not everything will be the best quality, but you get good quality fish for a reasonable price.Some of our faves of the night were:yellowtail - very fresh & creamylychee sorbet - THE best sorbet, mmmmmstrawberry mochi - I love mochiunagi - good texture, not slimypork belly - great grill flavor but kinda fattysalmonscalloppoke saladcucumber saladgyozasSome of our not so faves of the night were:uni - not freshestsweet shrimp was ok tuna - not freshThe location is nice but pretty far from the strip, about 10 minutes drive.  The ambiance is really cute.  Loved the decor and bar area.  It is smaller than I would have expected, about 15 tables and a bar.The service is top notch as we were never rushed.  Even when we spent about 2.5 hours, they still made sure we got everything we wanted.  I ordered extra dessert a couple of times (hehe).Definitely recommended for being piggies in the desert!!  What's Vegas without all the munching!!  Don't forget to get a stampcard, buy 10 get 1 free!We are blessed to have the option of AYCE sushi deals at pretty much all sushi joints in Vegas. So in my search of the BEST one, I think I'm going to have to go with Sushi House Goyemon. Lunch is 21.95 and dinner is 24.95. I asked what the difference is and it's just a small change-up of the menu with the addition of some extra sushi pieces. Lunch would satisfy me just fine any day.  However, if you want to try that green tea creme brule and that nice green cake in the main photo... you'll have to join them for dinner (Reminder: come back for dinner soon). The place is small and they don't take reservations. I'd say there were about a good 10-12 tables in the main dining area, and an extra 3-4 tables in their extra room in the back. So if you're planning to throw a big birthday hoopla there, make sure you and your guests come early to reserve because they won't sit you unless you are all present. The decor is simplistic but modern with their wooded ceiling framework and their fancy light structures (i think it came from Ikea).Now finally on to the food. The appetizers aren't bad. The nigiri sushi pieces are mediocre. Too little rice, and not enough fish. If you're a salmon lover, skip the nigiri and just get a salmon handroll. It's much more worth it, I promise. If you have some rice left over on the place, order the dynamite (creamy mixture of seafood and mayo concoction) and pair it with the rice, it's actually pretty darn good and compliments each other very well! I'm not the biggest roll fan but I actually enjoy their rolls here. I love how they provide the option of getting half orders (4 pieces) of each roll so you don't have to kill yourself to finish massive amount of pieces to avoid any extra charges of anything left over. There's some good and bad traits, but overall I think you'll get the most bang out of your AYCE buck here.As this was my 1st experience of All You Can Eat sushi, there are a number of words that I want to use to describe to you how I felt at the end of this meal. Words like "disgusting", "bloated", "obese" and mainly "self loathing" were the ones I was tossing around as I wondered how I would write this review. But you know what word REALLY sums up surprisingly delicious sushi in quantities that would shock a Sumo wrestler?Glorious.Seriously one of the best AYCE dining experiences I have ever had!!!!This is being said by someone who avoids AYCE (unless it's KBBQ) like the plague!!!!The menu is very creative and tempting and there are things included with the price that you would never expect at a sushi AYCE like desserts and ramen!!!!The price is just above $25 which seems like a lot but pretty much everything is covered by that money - including your drinks!!!!Sit at the bar!!!! The sushi chef and his accomplices are pretty cool and not shy at all as they will suggest you eat what is good. This is actually a good idea since there is actually a time limit. Funny, a couple of times they gave us random items with our permission and we thoroughly enjoyed them. Needless to say I am an extremely picky eater and I hate avocado. We just told them to hold the avocado and they didn't make a mistake once! I liked everything I ate pretty much!!!! I enjoyed the J.J., Tiger, Rock n' Roll and Sexy Girl rolls the most. The Dynamite which is one of my BF's favorites is really good here! The desserts are to die for here!!!!Service is pretty good. Few mistakes if any and the servers didn't ever have to be reminded about what we ordered! Give them credit, people order a lot of food here!The interior of the restaurant is pretty nice looking! This place attracts nice people apparently. I chatted with some guys at the bar and some other guy while I was waiting to use the bathroom. This says a lot about the food and ambience!!!! Of course they started the conversation in both cases. I'm usually quiet but the people here are soooo cool I broke out of my shell a bit!This is definitely not a place for sushi snobs and I LIKE IT like that!!!! All the fish tasted fresh and was always very well complemented by the other things the chef put into the rolls. There is only one drawback here, all that being said. You will most likely have to wait at least half an hour most of the time. That's how popular this place is!!!!There is ample parking as this restaurant is in a newer good sized strip mall.Trust me! This is the AYCE experience of a lifetime!!!! I am not into buffets (ugh!) or AYCE (if it's not KBBQ) but this place makes me forget how much I hate most AYCE/buffet establishments!!!!I have to update with a star lost unfortunately. The last few times haven't been as good as before. I think they are suffering from growing pains and staff changes. I do not see my favorite sushi guys and I know one in particular does not work here anymore. While the food is still made right and the cuts were decent, it lost that personal, familiar charm and the new guys didn't make an effort to really talk. It was busy, so fair point that they may not have had the opportunity so maybe something will change again, with time.The big thing for us was the rice has been too warm on visits of late. Last time it was affecting the fish that it was not appetizing. While I get they are busy, they should have someone making and properly cooling rice throughout. It happened twice at a busy but not line out the door rush time. The second time severely changed out love for this place. We will probably come during a off time again and see what happens. I still thought the fish was fresh, I like the rotating specials and the many delicious dessert options.  As of right now, the changes has made this spot suffer a bit for me so it'll be a while until we are back. I'm hoping in that time they figure out how to deal with their popularity and adjust the way they do things to keep a standard.Hostess was totally unreasonable, our seats @ the bar was ready but she made us wait @ least 30 min before she sat us down. She kept walking around, talking to other customers & doing who knows what...WTH??!! -1AYCE Dinner Review $26.95:Sashimi salad yummy 4 starsPoke salad was just ok 5 starsWhite salmon so yummy 5 starsUnagi was just ok 3 starsGrilled mussels yummy 5 starsBlack tobiko caviar was pretty good 4 starsSea urchin uni yummy 5 starsSweet shrimp amaebi so yummy 5 starsSurf clam was soft, not chewy yummy 5 starsScallops was yummy too very fresh 5 starsGreen tea brulee, taste was kinda off 3 starsChocolate mousse was very bland 3 starsRaspberry mousse was too tart 2 starsThe freshness here beats AYCE sushi places in CA hands down.Lychee was so delicious perfect desert w bits of real lychee inside 5 starsGreen tea ice cream good 4 starsRed bean ice cream was ok im not a fan of red bean 3 starsIce creams were much better tasting than all of the mousses =)Overall, this is one of the BEST AYCE sushi places I've tried...=)Sushi House Goyemon has become my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant in town. It is very conveniently located and because of this we are able to come pretty frequently. I can't believe I have been coming here for so long and am just now writing an update to my first review. Everything here is amazing and I tend to like to stick to the nigiri and some of the cooked options here. I can never resist the salmon skin handroll, pork belly and scallop. The dessert selections are all amazing as well. My favorites are the green tea and black sesame creme brulees and my fella can't resist the tempura ice cream. We try to go during off hours so we don't have to wait too long for a table. We have never had any service issues and everyone is always friendly and helpful when we are here. If only they would expand a little into the shop next door so maybe the wait times wouldn't be as long.For a while there Goyemon was very hit or miss for me.. But lately every time I go it has been a definite and delicious HIT~ Especially after checking out most other AYCE spots in the valley.. I've come to realize Goyemon is pretty much the best.. I always give other places the benefit of the doubt but they always leave me wanting more and also feeling angry that I wasted a perfect opportunity to get another stamp on my loyalty card LOL Top Reasons Goyemon is currently #1 for AYCE:*Freshness- I think since they're so busy all of the time they go through fish fast so all of their items are fresh & of good quality.. I love their scallop, yellowtail jalapeño, tuna, salmon, squid, ikura, uni & amaebi nigiri~!!!*Size- The rice to fish ratio is perfect and their nigiri is not too huge so you can sample a little bit of everything.*Appetizers- A good variety ...I always get the tuna poke salad, miso soup with shrimp head & pork belly.   *Rolls- I've never had a roll here LOL but they look huge which some people might consider a plus *Desserts- unlimited and I am addicted to the lychee sorbet ahhhhh*Service- I find that service at the bar is waaaaaaaaaay better than at the tables so try to score a seat there if you can!  The only negatives I can think of are that it's always so busy so go at a weird time~HOT TIP: Ask for fresh wasabi at no extra chargeOne of the best sushi places I've had! Location is a little strange and out of the way but well worth it. Yelpers were spot on with their raving reviews of Goyemon. The inside was very nice and clean and didn't smell :) It was a packed house which is always a good sign of a great establishment. We sat at the sushi bar and Ivan, our sushi chef was amazing. Of course we ordered the AYCE. Loved the fact we can order 1/2 rolls so we could try lots of different items. The nigiri was the perfect bite size. We enjoyed the Hurricane, garlic tuna, masago with quail egg, and I also tried the 911...spicy habanero HELL! We made friends with nearby patrons & started sharing but none of them dared to try the 911. I couldn't feel my face after eating it, thank goodness for the nearby sugar packets to help put out the heat.To finish our meal, lychee sherbet...refreshing and light.Definitely at the top of our list for sushi.I'm afraid to even write this review... EVERYBODY seems to absolutely ADORE this place... I've heard a lot about it, everyone ranting and raving about how GOOD it is. Everytime I try to come here, there is always a wait and HB and I are not about that life. So we came for lunch. HB got a cucumber roll and loved it. I ordered Edamame, Steamed Shumai, Seaweed Salad, Tuna Poke, and yellow tail, tuna, salmoon and fresh scallop nigiri. 'I was FAR from impressed by their Tuna Poke. Amando S. can make it better at home! The Edamame was crisp and good... the Shumai was PLAIN - I think I ate like ONE piece. The Seaweed salad was good... aaaaaand the Nigiri... It was OKAY. The Tuna seemed a little fishier than I normally experience however the Scallop WAS quite good. The scallop is so hit or miss depending where you are at and they served it very well here so that was definitely a good thing! I just don't know what all the hype is about! It was GOOD don't get me wrong but my mind was not blown!This WAS my favorite AYCE place which I had been visiting for the last two years, until my last visit where I had the worst customer service experience EVER.My boyfriend and I are well aware of the policy for uni and sweet shrimp (one order per person), which was what we ordered but the chefs gave us a really hard time about it and would only serve us one order. Not only that but they were hispanic chefs and immediately started bad mouthing us in spanish..... unfortunately I speak spanish as well however I'm light skinned enough to pass off as a white girl..... so I understood everything. SO for any of you who are wondering what the chef is saying while they're staring at you while you're seated in front of them at the bar, don't think they're saying sweet things about you. After we did not receive the order, the chefs continued to ignore us while we sat there in front of them. They continued talking and giggling while taking glances at us. The servers eventually came around to fill our drinks as we had nothing left and the server (also hispanic) asked the chef what was wrong or why we looked annoyed. The chef later replied in spanish that it was because we wanted "more food" so I interrupted and in spanish spoke out to them. OF course the chefs at that point turned bright red since they were unaware that I spoke spanish and was listening to them the entire time. Needless to say I was furious. I'm still baffled that someone can talk all this messed up stuff while you sit in front of them. Thanks to this I will never return.When I first moved to Vegas, my family and I constantly went to Sushi-mon. Then when we moved away, Goyemon opened so whenever I visited Vegas, I always had to go to Goyemon. It was amazing. It was probably my favorite AYCE sushi place in Vegas. The sushi was yummy, they always have some type of specials on the board, and they have other things on the menu for non-sushi eaters. So if you were to come with a huge group of people, you can get a mix of things. One of my FAVORITE items from Goyemon has to be the salmon belly! It is delicious, fatty, and never a disappointment whenever I get it. So why, in heaven's name, did I give it 3 stars? Well ... let me tell you a story.Goyemon had their 3rd Anniversary Customer Appreciation event and it was supposed to last 2 days. They had a list of special items for those days, which included blue fin and toro. With that, they offered the ability for you to make reservations. My friends and I decided to make a reservation for the 2nd day of the event since the 1st day of the event didn't work out with our schedules. The excitement built up even more after we found out that on the first day of the event, they did AYCE toro and AYCE uni! OMG! Like, I can't even WAIT. So when we went in for our reservation, my excitement turns a little bit sour. Why? Well, we had our reservation for 7:30 pm. We get there a little bit early but we have to wait for a table. I'm sorry .. I thought I had a reservation. So what we find out is .. they are still accepting walk ins and because they're typically a walk in restaurant, they don't quite grasp the reservation concept down that well. We actually didn't get seated until maybe at 8 PM.And then they tell us that there is no AYCE toro tonight, only AYCE uni and waygu beef. Well, gee, thanks. What's the point of having a reservation then? Why would you give AYCE toro one night and not the other night? I wanted to flip multiple tables but since we waited for the table, sat down, and were ready to order, we just stayed. So my experience from that is just really really sour. So I learned to just walk in on the days they have yummy specials. That way, I won't be missing out REGARDLESS of what they say. So Goyemon gets an average from me. I still like them and will continue to go to them for AYCE sushi. Service can be slow sometimes though and the servers will look at you funny when you order 20 orders of one thing. Oh and LOVE their yuzu sorbet (:AYCE Sushi!  Let's do it! I'm probably still considered a newbie when it comes to sushi determining what is good and what is great.  From a newbie standpoint, this is great! We met up with some friends to dine on their delicious creations.  Since it was AYCE, I was going to take full advantage and try a variety off the menu. It was busy but there were open seats at the bar for immediate seating.  When you sit there, the waitress will handle sides and drinks.  All you have to do it tell the sushi chef's what you'd like. It was pretty great!  They were so quick on our orders and just fun watching them. I ordered half rolls of the Baked 428, Pete's, Sexy Girl and Frying Jason. The 428 is baked with grilled chicken spread with yum yum sauce, cream cheese, eel sauce and spicy sauce.  Love Love Love this!  I would have been happy with just ordering this.  Can't stop there! Pete's is deep fried sushi with white fish, crab, cream cheese, avocado and eel sauce.  The light texture enveloping this masterpiece from being deep fried made me fall in love with this roll.   Sexy Girl was filled with shrimp tempura, crab and cucumber.  It was then topped with tempura crumb and a spicy garlic sauce which made it totally SEXY! Frying Jason is a baked roll filled with crab, cream cheese, asparagus and avocado topped with spicy yum yum sauce.  Yum Yum indeed!!  I absolutely loved everything I ordered.  I am definitely a fan and will tell anyone who is in the mood for sushi to go here.  Fabulous friends + Fabulous food = Happiness!Yelp Challenge 2014 (150/365)Me and the wifey met up with Bethany E and her hubby Mike for lunch on a Sunday just right after they opened which was 12 pm. Already the place was packed and we were told that the wait was an hour. So we were given the option to sit at the bar. I thought it was better way for we got superb service in getting our rolls because the chefs were literally right in front of us.We opted for the AYCE ($21.95) lunch option which was from 11:45 am to 6 pm. According to the menu, you had 45 minutes to alotted time to do the AYCE which didnt make sense because we were there for at least an hour.What is good to mention is that most of the rolls you can get you have the option of getting a half (4 pieces) or full (8 pieces) roll. I strongly recommend that you get the half rolls so that you have more chances of trying more rolls. Some rolls are only available as a full (refer to menu for they clearly state which ones are not available for half orders). As for what I ordered. Man, I will only tell the names but not describe them because this review would go on forever! That's what's good about doing the ayce option because you can try just about everything!What I got for starters were the Garlic Edamame, Fried Calamari, Ahi Poke, and Shrimp Tempura. Then, we got half orders of the Taylor Roll, Sexy Girl, and Frying Jason, Then full rolls only for the Spider Roll and Pixie Roll. We also tried one order (2 pieces) of the Seared Ahi. Lastly, we finished it up with 2 pieces of Strawberry Mochi.Originally, we wanted a table so we can all hang out much more comfortably while we ate, but after sitting at the bar, I think we got our orders much faster for the chefs actually hand you your order instead of your server grabbing it and bringing it out to your table. If you are at the bar, the servers are mainly there to get your drinks, appetizers, and dessert. Overall, I think that this will be the measuring stick to other sushi places that I will be trying out. The only negative thing that might deserve a mention is the wait time. But after eating here, I can understand why it can be a long wait for they serve good stuff  and the overall size of the place is not that big. Shout outs to Bethany E and her hubby Mike for inviting us to lunch! You guys are awesome!Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #135 "Go Go Goyemon!"Came in for lunch on a hot weekday. I'm not a big fan of AYCE sushi but Sushi House Goyemon also offers lunch specials. Parking was easy to locate. I arrived after the lunch hour began and the place was near capacity for lunch.I opted for the lunch sashimi special which was reasonably priced and included miso soup, rice and salad. The quality of sashimi was unfortunately A-ok with the exception of the salmon which was the tastiest and ended my meal with a generous portion of green tea ice cream. Another con was the spotty service - I had to flag down the waitress for assistance and also request dessert! Not sure if they were having a off day here but I probably wouldn't return here again.I try to avoid doing the all-you-can-eats and buffets.  I never can eat my money's worth!  But whenever I'm in Vegas, I try to make an exception and Goyemon is definitely a place where I go all out.  Skip the skinny jeans and put on that billowy dress with the stretchy belt because we're having half the ocean's worth of fish for dinner tonight, kiddies!I'm Seafood's worst enemy and I take no prisoners at Goyemon!  Goyemon is my ultimate favorite place to go for sushi and it's crazy for me to even say that!  I've taken my brother and friends here and they all go crazy for this place.  Nothing in Arizona can compare.  With uni, sweet shrimp, salmon belly, blue fin tuna, unagi, conch, aji mackerel, garlic tuna, and black tobiko being on their menu, how can I not love this place?  There's so many more amazing bites and everything is fresh [Remember:  fresh salmon should smell like cantaloupe!]!  Even with the all-you-can-eat, they don't try to rip you off by offering more rice and less goodies like a lot of other places do.  It just proves how great their work ethics are.  Don't forgot to check out their ever-changing daily specials.Goyemon is a trendy little place and it's nicely decorated.  The wait time can be pretty crazy and they're always busy.  The wait staff is pretty on point here as long as you're nice and polite.  Loud annoying people generally are given much worse service as we've seen first hand with the annoying drunken jerks next to us.  But in the city where clubrats and lushes prevail, I can see how they're just over it.  Stay on The Strip, fiends! Let me just have Goyemon all to myself.  Give me an hour, dim the lights, and don't come in when my stretchy belt is hanging on the doorknob.  NSFW.WORST SERVICE EVER.. This one's for you IRVING (waiter of the night)!30-40 minutes to even get noticed (yes we timed him)??? Very unacceptable!!! No apologies, only a butt-hurt attitude to add the "cherry on top"..What really set me off is...It is FREEZING in the restaurant, all I asked for was miso soup.. Had to order it twice, almost a 50 min wait for MISO SOUP, and again... Even after the issue was brought up kindly-- no apologies ...Even the guy refilling the waters was more attentive than IRVING..How frustrating for something that could've easily been fixed ...Goyemon! I love you! Definitely my favorite place now for all you can eat sushi. I'm not a sushi expert or anything but I know a great deal when I see one! Every time I've come, sushi has been pretty fresh, food has come somewhat fast and I always leave satisfied! There's usually a wait but to me, they're worth it! The only I don't like is that their stamp card now has like a two month expiration on it. Okay I like sushi, but I think it's safe to say that the majority of people would have a hard time eating sushi 10 times in 2 months. Mehh, lame. But anyways...My favorite rolls-Lemon: California roll wrapped with yellowtail, salmon and sliced lemon drizzled with ponzuMoon: Fresh water eel, scallop yum and avocado served with eel sauce on bed of tempura crumbPuffy: Fresh water eel, cream cheese, cucumber and avocado topped with smelt eggs & eel sauceMoment: Shrimp tempura, scallop yum and avocado topped with smelt eggs & eel sauceHurricane: Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado topped with salmon tempura, smelt eggs & green onion drizzled with eel sauce spicy yum yum sauce & mayonnaisePixie: Deep fried soft shell crab, spicy shrimp yum, cucumber and avocado wrapped in soy paper with smelt eggs & eel sauce on topYum Yum!!! and for the desserts, I love the Lychee Sherbert, Tempura Ice Cream, and Green Tea Creme Brulee!Goyemon is largely heralded as the best AYCE sushi in Vegas. A member of the Mon restaurant group (which also includes Monta and Sushi-Mon), this spot is generally regarded as their best effort and highest quality. Unfortunately, by the time I finally made a trip here, I was underwhelmed. Maybe my familiarity with their Sushi-Mon location on Sahara is to blame- their menus are virtually identical, with Goyemon offering additional items at dinner and some more unique specials. The quality of fish was good, but having a friendly relationship with a Sushi Mon chef garnered me the same product at their sister store. I really didn't see the upside to coming here instead.Service during my recent visit was frustrating- server did not come around very often, food was came out slow and sporadic, and rice was falling apart on all rolls and nigiri. Not what I expect given the reputation that precedes this joint. They were busy, but not overwhelmed. I will say that the menu of rolls is extensive and their pricing is very fair ($22/lunch, $27/dinner). It's also nice that their last dinner seating is at 2AM. Better to visit for dinner than lunch, for increased menu options. But frankly I just found it good, not great.TLDRStandby items: superwhite tuna, garlic tuna, mackerel, and halibut nigiri; Lemon, Moon, Hurricane and Ecstasy rolls. They were out of uni my last visit, appreciate that this was on signage as you entered. Don't bother with the tuna poke, miso soup, or mochi dessert.Wow... What happened to this place?We hadn't been here for a while (since JJanga opened) so we decided to give it a go... The following things caused my dinner to be a 1 star experience:-HOT restaurant... I think the AC might be broken so they had floor fans throughout the restaurant but that didn't really help. It was quite stuffy. -SLOW service... The servers were so slow and the food from the kitchen came out at a snail pace. Miso soups and salads were ordered at the beginning of the meal and didn't come out till mid way through. Plus we had to flag down the servers for water refills.  -RUDE sushi chef... We usually love sitting at the bar but our sushi chef, Denis, was not friendly and never acknowledged us. He never answered when we would place an order... He either really didn't want to be there or he can't speak EngRish? -QUALITY went downhill... The fish was average at best. They were out of uni, quail egg and yuzu sorbet. The sweet shrimp smelled fishy and nothing was amazing. The only positive of the meal was our awesome busser, Ariel. Thank God there is someone who works there that actually wants to be there. The worst part of the meal was the fact that we felt like we were asking a favor every time we placed a sushi order... WTF?!! No thanks.I love that they give little mini rolls as compared to the full thing for ayce..and you can even order half servings!! Definitely gave the bf and I a chance to try everything...well, almost everything. Most of the items (practically all) are available for AYCE, and we very much enjoyed the jellyfish nigiri, and most of the rolls. I think the regular nigiri has too much rice, though I'm comparing to crazy joints such as Asahi sushi and AYCE sushi back in Cali. I don't have much experience with AYCE in Vegas yet, but I do think that Goyemon's quality and unique combos make it one of the top in the area. Definitely a go-to joint, at least to try once!Small note...joint gets PACKED even at midnight, so come prepared to wait at least 30 minutes.Some might say that you shouldn't compromise when looking for a great place to eat. This is one place where you should.Let me elaborate. You'll never experience top-of-the-line fish quality at Goyemon. You won't have the best uni, the most delectable tuna, or the sweetest shrimp. You might have to wait for an hour or more, especially if you bring a larger group. But you'll always be able to have as much reasonable-quality fish (and other tasty things) as you please for $26.95 (or $21.95 for lunch, but that's irrelevant - more info later). You'll always impress friends and family from out of town (disclaimer: yours may not be as cool as mine). Compared to Strip buffets, you'll get superior value, more-than-sufficient variety, and zero lining up in front of heat lamps. Yes, newbies: you place orders here like you would at a normal restaurant, and they cook and prep to order.At Goyemon, choosing dinner (starts at 4pm) is an absolute must. If you don't go for dinner, you won't get grilled pork belly, multiple types of grilled fish (cajun salmon, super white, yellowtail, even salmon kama occasionally), the crowd-pleasing spicy tuna rice cracker, or the extra desserts that often include chocolate mousse, green tea creme brulee (I actually dislike this), yuzu sorbet, and extra mochi flavors. You'll also miss the uni - generally not "good" but at least passable, unlike some other places - and amaebi. I tried lunch once a few months back and was surprised that they do offer nigiri specials, but I missed my dinner exclusive so much.The rotating nigiri specials are rarely or less reliably found at other AYCE places. Salmon belly is often available. Kanpachi (amberjack) is another nice option that I can't recall seeing elsewhere. Conch (rhymes with honk) is a surprisingly good too. Occasionally on holidays or perhaps at some manager's whim, they'll have blue fin tuna or even toro available as specials. They've had a few anniversary or special items from time to time too with special pricing and expanded menu (invariably drawing huge crowds or rapidly filling time slots). These rare treats are always nice.I'll just list some other items that I almost always order: sashimi salad, baked green mussels (it's not overly sauced), super white tuna nigiri, fresh scallop ("hotate") nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, lychee sorbet, green tea ice cream (best texture and flavor I've had at any sushi place). Also, the moon and hurricane rolls (usually half-orders).I congratulate and empathize with all the reviewers who have seemingly lucked into poor service. I may have had relatively slow service once or twice in the past, but it's been reliable the last few times and has left a good impression in long-term memory. If you're with a very small group, sit at the bar for likely improved sushi response times (the servers still cover appetizers/grilled items and drinks). And in general, don't sabotage yourself by under-ordering. I'd say 7-12 items per order is a good range.After dozens of visits over the years, Goyemon is still consistently the best AYCE sushi place that I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Others in town are close, and at least one has marginally superior fish quality, but I'll always bemoan a lack of dessert variety (if it's not one per person, which is a huge negative for those places), a lack of my favorite grilled items, a lack of a stamp card (buy 10 and get a free meal), or something else possibly nitpicky. This is the jewel of the surprisingly good AYCE sushi scene of the desert.This was such an unreal dining experience! The food kept coming and coming... and it was ALL good!  For an All You Can Eat place, I was really surprised at the quality of the sushi ...so fresh and beautifully prepared!My friend was celebrating her birthday in Vegas, and I was her chauffeur. Her aunt and uncle invited us to dinner - how can I refuse a free meal?  We used Google Maps which took us to the townhouses right after the restaurant. If you drive there, slow down and look for the sign for the restaurant! We got there at 4pm which is a great time - before the crowd gets there. The contemporary, clean, beautiful interior matched the beautiful, organized plates of sushi. I'm not sure about the service. It seemed like aunty kept asking about her order of Hamachi and our server kept replying that he would "check on it". Eventually, it did arrive. The amount of rice was the big surprise... I thought it would be a lot so that we would fill up faster. This was not the case. The fish-to-rice ratio was perfect! Also, I didn't taste any added wasabi - just add your own!  The ikura, saba, scallops (with a hint of lime), maguro, uni, unagi, & amaebi were superb! We also had some of the special rolls (Caterpillar and Dragon) for fun! We were supposed to be there for just 2 hours but they didn't chase us out. We did see the line to get in, so it was time to go and let the next set of customers have their turn!  I'll go with you if you need a ride!STANDS OUT FROM THE RESTI have been here for the A.Y.C.E. & recently I just came here to grab some lunch w/ the in-law fam bam... A.Y.C.E. is definitely awesome for dinner as they have a good variety as well as daily specials which is always a plus!! The place is pretty small & there is pretty much always a wait when it comes to dinner time... I don't know if I have ever been here & there hasn't been a wait. For LARGE parties they do have a secret dining area as well which is a bit secluded which is nice especially when you try to talk amongst everyone in your group or your group is just darn routy ahahhahaService is pretty quick & they show you a good time... I say props for when I came to eat w/ friends & they we're able to take care of all 20 of us smoothly & kept the food coming to feed 16 bois & 4 girls who were starving & came to chow down! *bravo*Besides the A.Y.C.E. they have pretty good specials as well which is nice when you are not tryna eat a whale during the day time.SUSHI DINNER $11.95 - you can choose from Cali roll or spicy tuna roll & then it comes w/ 7 pieces of sushi (2 tuna. white fish. yellowtail. salmon. eel. shrimp) The combinations also come w/ house salad & miso soup.SASHIMI DINNER $13.95 - also choose Cali roll or spicy tuna roll & then it comes w/ 12 pieces of sashimi (3 tuna. 2 yellow tail. 3 salmon. 2 albacore. 2 red snapper) This also comes w/ house sale & miso soup.NABE YAKI UDON $11.95 - I got this dish & it came w/ an order of Cali roll & house salad which was freaken awesome because I was totally only expecting to get the udon itself! Way to surprise the fat kid =] but it did say it on the menu.. I just didn't read it hahahahOCTOPUS POKI SALAD $5.95 - pretty good & simple served w/ seaweed salad & onions w/ a sesame oil dressing.ICE CREAM $2.50 - we got green tea. yuzu. & lychee which came in 2 little scoops =] green tea is green tea... yuzu was refreshing & lychee was sweet refreshingOH MY GOD!!! The best AYCE sushi i've been to. Everything was so tasty.. you can taste all the ingredients in every bite. I've been to a few AYCE and they taste so bland. Goyemon is the best AYCE sushi. Everything on their menu tasted so good. Even their green tea and mochi ice cream is yummy. I like how they make their rolls a little smaller than normal, gives you enough room in your tummy to try other items on their menu. Great friendly service. Our waitresses were so nice to us. Definitely coming back here when i'm in Vegas.

Restaurant name  Citizen Public House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
If being a good public citizen means I get to eat at a restaurant like Citizen Public House, then I vow never to roll through a stop sign again! I had the chance to check out Citizen Public House for dinner last night and was eager to take a bite into the culinary adventures of Chef Bernie and pastry delights of Tracy Dempsey. We arrived to enter a cozy atmosphere full of energy from the group of guests enjoying their meals. The setting here is simple but simple does the trick because the food and drinks are excellent. We started with cocktails and an appetizer. I was told the coconut drink (I'm blanking on the name) was like a vacation in your mouth and considering that I've got the tropical itch, I opted for that immediately. They warned me it was a stiff drunk, but I had no idea how stiff they really meant! Let me just put it this way, if you are looking for a cocktail that will do the drink for the entire meal, this is your drink. I didn't need another after just this one! Moving on to the food now! We started with a bar snack appetizer of Kilt Lifter fondue with sausage, pears and bread. It was a perfect snack to get our appetites moving and munch on the food while we waited for out entrees. The pears and fondue were an interesting combination but it grows on you after awhile. Apparently, I was feeling cheesy that night because for my entree, I went for the Grilled Halloumi Cheese which is on Serbian lepijna bread, with chickpea puree, pickles, Campari tomato, tender greens, tahini. I liked to think of it as a grown up's grilled cheese. Although it didn't have any meat in it, the sandwich was hearty and satisfying enough that it didn't need any. I had a taste of the Smart Chicken and that was excellent as well! To end the good citizen meal, we had to try a Tracy Dempsey desert because how could you pass up one of these delicacies! We were told that the Chocolate Toffee Bread Pudding is a must for chocolate lovers. They weren't kidding! The dessert was delicious and just the right amount of sweet to end the meal. I like Citizen Public House because it isn't pretentious and while it's in the heart of Old Town, it doesn't have the Old Town scene vibe. It's perfect for an evening of good good and tasty cocktails in a comfortable setting. I can't wait to visit again!Five stars for the cocktails, desserts, and service, four stars for the entrees I've sampled so far and the ambiance.Over a total of four visits to CPH, I've sampled five of their cocktails and a number of their appetizers and desserts along with two entrees, met and interacted meaningfully with all three of the owners (including the at least locally-renowned Chef Bernie Kantak, creator of Cowboy Ciao's Stetson Chop Salad [which is recreated here]), and generally thoroughly enjoyed myself on each occasion. The space is large enough to accommodate large parties or couples with equal aplomb. I've twice now toured the private upstairs space, and look forward to finding a fitting occasion to fill it with close friends. I've had fantastic service upon each of my visits - twice sitting at the bar, once at a Yelp event, and finally for a normal dinner, and feel completely confident in suggesting CPH to the most demanding diner. I'll update or edit this review to talk more about the food once I've had the short ribs and the lamb burger. The entrees I've tried thus far (the salmon and the chicken) didn't quite plumb the depths of my soul, and while the appetizers I sampled on other occasions were excellent, I don't remember any of them well enough to cover them in any detail. Hey, it was a busy month! I will say that the salads I've tasted are all amazing and that the bread pudding dessert was an absolute revelation right up there with the one delivered to John on the Isle of Patmos.I've saved what I feel to be the best feature of CPH for last: the drinks. I could attempt to describe the feeling of anticipation I felt watching Richie rinse the old fashioned glass in preparation for a sazerac, or the deep happiness the feel of the froth of the pisco sour brings me when it hits my lips, or even the wistful yet satisfied feeling I got when I drained the last drops of the bijou (pronounced bizh-OOOh) from its martini glass, but I won't bore you any further - just go and taste (and *feel*) for yourself.  The wine and beer lists will certainly offer you something you'll love, should your tastes run that way.  In sum: good food and great drinks served by lovely people in a nice setting for reasonable prices. Far and away my favorite bar in Old Town.So nice to have a new type of environment to hang out in Scottsdale.Decor - Its so clean and sophisticated sharp decor right when you walk in tn the door , you immediately want a drink when you see the beautiful bar in the center of the floor. OK OK I'm a little obsessed I know:) with good reason!!Food- I have tried several things on the menu and was impressed with every hing ! LAMB BURGER!!! a must!!!Service was friendly and professional. This place is here to stay !Have you ever heard of a salad that is so popular that it has its own Facebook page? I know I couldn't believe it either, but this isn't any ordinary salad. Think tidy rows of smoked salmon, Israeli couscous, asiago cheese, arugula, sweet dried corn, black currants and pepitas (toasted pumpkin seeds) topped with a creamy pesto dressing all tossed table-side. The Stetson Chopped Salad should not only have its own fan page but its creator, Chef Bernie Kantak, should be given a hug every time you see him at his new Citizen Public House. Located in what used to be the valleys original Trader Vic's, there isn't a tiki torch in sight. Instead you'll find a contemporary space outfitted with wood accents, leather booths and a stainless steel-topped bar. The vibe is casual and relaxed elevated by outstanding service on every one of my visits. If you're wondering what a public house is, well simply put it's a tavern that also serves food. While they do serve some great drinks and have an excellent wine list, I'd be hard pressed to call Citizen a mere tavern. How many taverns have you ever heard of serving pork studded Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn ($5)? Or how about a pot filled with creamy 'Kilt Lifter' Fondue ($9) savory hunter's sausage, sweet tangy pears and toasted country bread? If you have, please let me know right away.For dinner I couldn't recommend The Original Chopped Salad ($12) more but if you don't like smoked salmon, they can make it with chicken instead. The Mirliton Chopped Salad ($12), a composition including chayote, snow pea greens, tomatoes, popcorn, grilled halloumi cheese; cucumber-onion salad tossed with a tangy parsley-garlic dressing was a fantastic textural explosion but lives in the shadow of its older sibling.I'm not even sure where to start with the entrees; I guess it comes down to price point. Take the lower priced lusciously juicy Lamb Burger ($12) topped with a cucumber salad, zesty tzatziki and served with fries, you'd think with flavor and quality like this would be much more expensive. At the other end of the price range sit the fantastically meaty Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs ($28) complete with a side of brightly sour dried cherry bbq sauce and roasted parsnip puree. Somewhere in between is the juicy "Smart" Chicken ($18) which refers to the brand not the chicken's admission into the Mensa Society. Desserts by Tracy Dempsey were all that and a bag of cookies, literally. Cookies and Milk ($6) were delightfully chewy and come served in a sealed pouch for freshness, of course the milk was ice cold just perfect for dunking. Three words, Strawberry Pound Cake ($9). A thick slice of strawberry olive oil pound cake is lightly grilled then served with vanilla malted ice cream, chocolate sauce and malted strawberry streusel and like the Stetson salad it was Facebook worthy.5 stars. You heard me.Man, am I late on this review...My sweetie took me to dinner at CPH for my 35th birthday. I know what you're all thinking... "but Kristi...you don't look a day over 34&3/4." Stop....no, pleassssseeee enough with the flattery folks. I can't take it anymore. No seriously. Keep going..Turns out CPH is right up there with the likes of Nobuo at Teeter House and FnB when it comes to quality and experience. Excellent wine selection. Please, if you have the opportunity, try the 'Tender Belly' bacon fat heirloom popcorn. It was delicious. Though bacon fat could probably make dog poo tasty. I enjoyed the Porcini-dusted Filet Mignon, medium rare and had a couple of nibbles of my fiance's scallops (which were amazing). The Filet was cooked to perfection and though I'm somewhat of a purist and usually prefer my steak 'au-natural' I was beyond satisfied with the accoutrement. Impressed even. The service was phenomenal. The distress surrounding my age caused me to consume a gigantic Ketel martini, a shit load of wine (local by the way, I love that) and a desert drink and not once was I cut off. Truly though, our server was a doll. Engaging and genuine; something obviously lacking in the service industry in Arizona. The only thing I would change about CPH is the location and that's only due to my location, so I'll deal with it.Molten drinks please.  Grand Master Mixologist Richie Moe @CitizenPubHouse whipped up a couple shots for my wonderful wife and I that brought much of the bar to a silence on a crowded Saturday night. When he heard we were celebrating our anniversary he said he'd like to make us a special drink...and he felt like burning something.The end result was kind of like bananas foster in a shot glass.  It involved melting Mexican chocolate in a metal mixing cup, flaming 160 proof black strap rum, Richie repeatedly pouring a flaming mixture of orange liquid with blue flames from cup to cup in an arc that captured everyone's attention.Outstanding drink with an outstanding show leading up to it.We've been to CPH twice and had great food and outstanding drinks each time.  If I am in the mood for a cocktail, this is where I want to go. If you're in the mood to go out for drinks and a bite, this is your place. Enjoy.Yelp Eats Week 2011 (50% off!), Take 1:Easily a 4.5, maybe a 5-star review, but tonight's wait times for the entrees were too long, AND the restaurant was VERY noisy, and if there's one thing I really dislike, it is dining in a noisy venue!  I estimate that we waited at least 10 minutes our Sausage of the day app (chorizo, w/ a side salad that included pickled onions), which was fine, assuming by the time we sat down and ordered, it was already 8:15p (app photos* were taken at 8:28p), but I'd also placed our orders for the Pan-seared scallops (sub parsnip puree for the corn grits) and the Tender Belly strip steak at the same time as I'd ordered the app.  These did not arrive until shortly before I took photos (8:57p).  Andrew personally sat us at a table, but quickly obliged our request to move to another location that was a little less noisy- a booth had just opened up.  Nice touch, and it was greatly appreciated!  However, as the wait times extended longer and longer, the noise did get to my mother, who was very hungry and tired.  Subtract the long wait times and the excessive noise, I'm left w/ friendly and accommodating, yet VERY slow service (Andrew said I'd be able to sub something else for the corn-based sides in all of the "Yelp Eats" menu... I went w/ the dessert-sweet parsnip puree) and fantastic food!  The strip steak, cooked medium, was not overly-seasoned, and Mom was enjoying the meal, which was accompanied by a gorgonzola-corn spoon bread ("just like eating bread pudding"),  stone-fruit compote (apricot), and  crunchy pistachios.  I LOVED the compote, which really added to my enjoyment of Mom's entree choice.  I also loved the scallops entree, which consisted of three scallops that were around 1.75 inches in diameter each and sat on the parsnip puree, topped w/ sauteed snow pea greens and a gastrique made w/ Red Rock cola.  The applewood-smoked bacon lardons tasted nutty and had a nut-like mouth-feel, as well.  My first few bites of scallops and puree were lovely, but then the sweetness became too much, since the scallops were naturally sweet themselves.  Mom REALLY enjoyed the scallops (she didn't have much of the puree), much more so than the strip steak;  Hearing her hum w/ pleasure made me feel so happy!  :)  I would love to visit again, but on a less-busy time- it was, after all, first day of "Yelp Eats 2011."  Maybe for lunch?  I also put in a request to add the bread pudding fondue Yelpers enjoyed at the Yelp party held here in February on the regular menu; Andrew said that the venue still served it, but on special events.  While I was not able to enjoy the bread pudding tonight (I intend to visit again before YE' week ends), I did bump into Donjay S., who had tried it and said it was good, but not as good as the fondue version.  This menu's version includes bacon-- I cannot wait to try it!(*Lost my card adapter, and the photos uploaded using the USB seem to be corrupted... Please return back to view the photos, which will be uploaded soon!)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA?select=pfXMOtx6TQCUJlfsw6qZyAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA?select=_fOtfCw4UONRwxFaj68TXwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA?select=DfQI2P_ONdYqtNV1435YhQ"Have you ever been over to a friend's house to eat and the food just aint' no good?"You know the famous line from the Sugar Hill Gang. You won't have to feel that way at this house, because this house has the sauce that is awesome.Yeah, Citizen Public House might just be the most legit place in all of Arizona. I don't know what took me so long to get here.This is a destination for foodies, and not just because it's been featured on the Cooking Channel or the Food Network.Some Highlights:--Tender Belly Bacon Fat Popcorn! (Not for the pretentious and idiotic)--Gorgonzola-Emmental mac-n-cheese (Not for the lactose)--The Chopped Salad (This ish is famous yo)--The Squealer Burger (yeah, it has bacon in it)This place is absolutely amazing.If you appreciate food, and can afford to splurge both in the wallet and palate, then make this a destination. Absolutely worth it. Next time, I want to try the Lamb Burger.Also, the cocktail and draught list is solid. Goose Island Matilda FTW! (Yes, I know its a Budweiser product)CPH is great for groups!I admit it, (and I'm sorry, Chef Bernie), but I've only been to Citizen Public House on two occasions to date... That being said, both times I was there for events, and both times CPH did a great job.  My first visit was an event with passed appetizers and drinks shortly after they opened, and the other was for a happy hour / sit-down dinner for a group of 45 people, just last week.  Since it's more fresh in my mind, I'll go into more detail about the latter visit... We started on the patio and had drinks and some light apps including hummus and flatbread and their delicious bacon fat heirloom popcorn.  (They had vegetarian popcorn as well).  After about an hour, we moved inside to where there were three large rectangular tables set for our group with our own special menus.  We were able to choose from two mini-salads and four entrees and then we had family-style desserts.  I went with the infamous "original Chopped salad" to start and then chose the Pan Seared Scallops as my entree.  I think I cleaned both plates... and those around me likely had order envy as I definitely ordered right!  In addition, service was spectacular... somehow the Citizen staff managed to serve all 45 of us within minutes of each other!  They also kept our waters and our wine glasses full, which I'm sure added to the experience.I recently saw a preview of the new fall menu which includes some interesting items such as Chicken & Waffles, Applewood Smoked Duck Breast, and Grits + Gumbo... I will have to head back over there soon to give these things a try... that is, if I feel adventurous enough to order something other than what I know I love (the original Chopped salad and the scallops).  Whether you stick with your old stand-by favorites or try something new, enjoy!While I've never actually eaten a full meal at CPH, this is probably my favorite place for drinks and apps.  I don't even care that their happy hour discounts are not that great.First off, they make a version of a sloe gin fizz.  Based on that alone, I'm at 5 stars.  The fact that it was fantastic was just an added bonus.  Second, they ingeniously thought to put bacon fat in the popcorn.  Now we're at 10 stars.    Third, 'kilt lifter" fondue.  Need I say more?02/15/16Forgive me, oh Lord, for I have sinned... I don't know what I was thinking eating a sandwich, side salad, AND drinking an entire blackberry mojito (it was sooooo good!) at a nearby restaurant when I could have just had a couple of bites there and then gone for a second cocktail here...  Of course, instead of ordering a cocktail (the flaming cocktail expert Richie Moe wasn't in the house, yo!), I decided to go for an espresso and try that delicious-sounding black & tan pudding http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA?select=eKxPXAmYF0fu0b38M4lpsA  our server said was his favorite dessert on the menu.  By the time the sweets arrived, I'd already inhaled the espresso, so I had to get a cup of drip coffee, black.  Oh lordy, lordy, lordy- what a beautiful combo the decadent chocolate pudding and luscious and oh-so-sinfully-creamy caramel (my fave of the two flavors), topped with fresh whipped cream and a peanut brittle crumble made w/ both coffees!  Yeah, me wanna love you long time!A shout out to our super-fun server, Newman.  What a terrific guy!  ;)If I lived in Scottsdale I'd probably be broke in a short amount of time because I'd be spending all my money buying cocktails at Citizen Public House. Drinks like The Persian (Absolut Wild Tea vodka, St. Germain elderflower liqueur, housemade sweet & sour, Persian cucumber juice, lemon peel, served on the rocks) or the Citi-Zen (Absolut Pear vodka, Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur, housemade sweet & sour, rock candy, lemon twist, served up.) Or I might find myself slipping in through the back door to head to the upstairs speakeasy, buying a tableside gin and tonic and laughing my best mad scientist laugh while doing so.Or I might just have to eat the Chopped Salad every.single.day of the rest of my life.Or I might live on Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn alone.All I know is that it's a good thing I don't happen to live in Scottsdale...Would it be rude or pretentious of me to admit that I wouldn't find great food and cocktails in Scottsdale? Well, mea culpa. I honestly didn't expect much out of this city when it comes to comestibles. But Citizen Public House surprised me on all levels. The cocktails here are crazy good. They even have a little 'speakeasy'-ish mixology lab upstairs that's all secret and only accessible by... wait... can I tell? Anyway, these folks are making some interesting drinks with house-made infusions, tinctures, and various chemistry equipment. Better than the best drinks in PDX? I don't know about that, but impressive all the same. The food is a very big surprise for me. The chop chop salad is, from what I understand, legendary, and from tasting it I am not surprised. I also sampled some tasty meatloaf and delicious scallops. The fact that I can't recall the dessert doesn't mean it wasn't memorable, I think it had to do with my focus on the drinks and mains. I recall everyone at the table enjoying them. Service? Impeccable. 'Nuff said. Consider me a little humbled.I really love this part of Scottsdale.  You have a vast choice of amazing restaurants.  We decided to try Citizen Public House.  The atmosphere is an energetic one.  I can't really remember the last time I went to a restaurant at 5:30 in evening and seen such a lively place.Now for the food.  We started with the bacon popcorn.  I was only ok, but it was also only about $2 or so.  We decided to have the pork belly pastrami and the butternut squash soup.  The soup was ok, but I wouldn't order it again.  The pork belly was amazing.  I can't wait to go back and have it again. We shared the short rib.  It was a pretty healthy portion.  My husband and I were able to share one.  The bbq sauce was a tad bit on the bitter side.  I think I will try the scallops next time.The cocktails were amazing.  I'm really into cucumber right now, so the Persian was to die for.Service was great!  Our food came out quickly.How is it that I don't write reviews for places I absolutely love to go.  I think that when I truly LOVE a place, I get writer's block.  I generally don't know where to begin, so let me start with the item that drew me in.... Bacon Popcorn.  If you read my reviews, you know by now that popcorn is my favorite food.  My second favorite is bacon.  When a place takes those 2 things and puts them together in one dish, it won't take much to make me a fan, for life.When I walk in Citizen Public House and pull up a seat at the bar, I feel like I'm in a craftsman style supper club.  The interior of the building itself is beautifully appointed, yet simple with those beautiful wooden beams.  There is a lovely patio area as well.I've dined on several things from the menu.  I've gone for dinner with reservations and I've stumbled in late night for a bowl of popcorn and libations.  By far my favorite thing on the menu, save the Bacon popcorn, is the Chopped Salad.  I enjoy it every time I've gone.  I'm a creature of habit and it is hard for me to order something different at a restaurant when I've found something I enjoy a lot.  HOWEVER, I love it that I have some adventurous friends and I've managed to try several of their drinks and menu items.  I like the fact that they host a monthly cocktail tasting.  Come in and taste their crafted cocktails for about $65 with some food pairings.  Their drinks are adventurous, but to be honest, I've had better crafted cocktails around Phoenix.  I would give them 5 stars, but I did order something once that was not prepared correctly and I had to convince the server that it wasn't.  I didn't have to twist his arm but he tried to tell me that it was correct and etc, but I said no, I don't think so.   I suppose after the server took it to the back and examined the food item more, he discovered I was right.  They remade the item for me and the night kept going.  But that makes me wonder if the menu is being prepared correctly.  I wouldn't know, probably never will since I'm stuck on that salad. (SN: I think their chopped salad has a facebook page.)   And the menu doesn't change often enough.Another downer is the fact that there is no audible music.  I'm on the fence if I'd want it there or not, but when I've gone, I notice I look around thinking, we could use some atmospheric music.  I also think that place would rock with a really good Jazz band playing live music there.Please don't get me wrong, this place has excellent service.  The fact of the matter is that I will definitely be back  CPH has the chance to earn 5 stars from me.If there's a place in old town that you can rely on for quality in food and service, this is the place.  You get what you paid for.  Based on my last few visits, it seems to always be busy, which as you know is a great sign.  This is a place where you come for a date, birthday or just about any type of occasion you can think of.  These are what I consistently get and enjoy:+ Chopped Salad: BOMB.  You cannot come here and not get this.  If you don't have a big appetite, this is a must.  The corn, salmon and dressing does it for me every time.  You just can't go wrong here.+ Lamb Burger: Its very tasty and juicy.  It can be a little messy if you mishandle it.  So I suggest just slicing it in the middle.  + Kale Caesar Salad: BOMB.  Kale is a super vegetable that is packed with nutrients.  They make the Kale anti-bitter with a great balanced Ceasar dressing, served with a cheesy, toasty bread! Some things can break your wallet but if you manage to try to share your plates in your party, you will walk out okay.  Drinks aren't too pricey.  But if you want to keep the night going, I suggest heading up to their sister bar, Citizen R+D, a speakeasy that is around the building and requires a secret phone call to reserve a table.There's not much to complain about really.  For its consistency and quality, I will always have them on my go to places.I went to Gibson's in Chicago and never thought I'd find a steakhouse like that in Scottsdale... until I was introduced to Citizens. One of my best friends + her boyfriend are steak snobs and only eat steak at this restaurant. It was their birthday celebrations and they, of course, wanted dinner here before the party. The staff was so accommodating. They let me bring cakes for both of their birthdays (see photos) and checked on our group consistently the entire night. The manager is great friends with the couple so he made sure everything and everyone was well taken care of. The food was extraordinary. I ordered the short ribs the first time and the filet mignon during our second visit. The meat was very tender and full of seasoning (unlike most steakhouses). The short ribs come with this cherry BBQ sauce that is something I've never experienced before - but perfected the meal. Also, I'm kind of hooked on their house drink called The Citizen... but it is one sneaky ass drink! It takes like candy and you feel like you're just drinking juice... then after 15 minutes, you're drunk.Be mindful of the price of this establishment prior to your arrival. It's worth the amount but it is on the pricey side. If that's not an issue for you... go here and enjoy!Came in with friends for cocktails.  Marian and I tried the Pyrat Eye for $5 each on the happy hour menu. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/citizen-public-house-scottsdale?select=qP8gnrbtP8N9BMaFlGh6vA#qP8gnrbtP8N9BMaFlGh6vA  Others had a Negroni HH special, a glass of pinot noir (half-off during HH), and Boulevardier (also $5 on HH).  I did not really like the dark rum cocktail.  The scent reminded me of rum and coke, which I never cared for when I tried it many, many years ago, and when I took a sip, did not get the satisfying cola taste at all, and instead came away tasting very bitter dark rum.  It certainly wasn't as unpalatable as I make it sound, since I did finish half of it.  I just wasn't a fan.  If you're all about getting drunk fast though, then this might be a drink for you!  Next time, I'll just stick to wine.When I felt the buzz coming on after only a few sips, I decided to go with the table bread that everyone had passed on earlier.  This prompted orders of Kiltlifter fondue and bacon popcorn from everyone else-- so happy!!  The cheese fondue paired the best with the toasted cubes of bread, although I skipped on the pear that Chrissy P. was loving!  (Pear doesn't like me very much.)  We all raved about the farmer's sausage from Shannon's (sorry, forgot the whole name).  The spice level was perfect!  Wished there were more slices on the plate!  I skipped on the popcorn (corn allergy), but I did try a sliver of bacon-- it was floppy, not crispy, so I left it on my plate.  The warmed, but not toasted, table bread was good, and paired only with a tiny cup of extra-virgin olive oil.  I was hoping for butter, but the EVOO did have a great, mild flavor with slight buttery notes when consumed with the bread.Citizen Public House is an upscale, modern American restaurant where you can find plenty of unique dishes and a signature salad with its own Facebook site.My Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - We checked out Citizen Public House on a week night, but it was still busy.  Lights will be dim, noise will be loud, but everything around you is modern.  If you're looking for a quiet place, Citizen Public House is not it.  But if you're ok with the high energy and noise you'll love it.Service - Our server was better than great.  He was very accommodating.   We made reservations over the phone for a large party, and he secured a semi-private room for us and let us put in several appetizer orders ahead of time.  Throughout the meal the entire team went above & beyond, making sure we were ok, talking about our love of food, and making sure our experience would be perfect.  1 Star.Food - The appetizers rule at Citizen Public House.  I think it's ridiculous that a SALAD has its own Facebook page.  Then I ate it.  It was ridiculously good.  The presentation itself is great, and once the servers mix it together, it becomes a fresh, modern, texture packed bite.  I will admit I doubted it but now I'm a believer. Bacon fat popcorn.  Yes.  It was even great the next day.  Pork Belly Pastrami - tender, well-seasoned, and could have been my main meal.  Which is funny because looking back, I enjoyed all the appetizers a lot more than the main courses.  The scallops were good and my short rib was not as tender as I would have liked, but after our appetizer fest it really didn't matter.  Bottom line is the pre-meal is where I'll put my money in the future.  1  1/2 Star.Will I Return? - For the apps!  Not sure the main courses are worth it for a return visit, but I would come back and order the same delicious starters as I did that night.  Now, Citizen Public House is not cheap, so that's all I would be able to afford.   1/2 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.Food like this exists?! In Scottsdale?! I think Scottsdale has better tasting food than San Diego! I saw Citizen on yelp and had my eye on it but was a bit tainted because my friend and I have bad experiences with "gastropubs" or at least the ones in Cali. It always turned out to be horrible tasting food that tries tooooo cool and overpriced... we took the leap of faith and said fck it lets do it, maybe Scottsdale gastropubs will be different, and indeed it was!We couldn't get reservations (place is packed for a good reason) but the hostess said there were bar seats available, and we were cool with that. We just wanted food in and out. Also it was fight night, all the other bars were charging $20 each, why not spend that money on good food instead? I couldn't believe how good the food tasted here. I was in shocked because... well it's Scottsdale, wasn't sure if this was a foodie mecca. Citizen (and amongst other places) proved me wrong. We decided not to stuff our faces and instead get 2 apps and 1 entrees. -Chia Seared Tuna: the best seared tuna and most creative seared tuna I've tried thus far...and I eat out a lot (1130+ reviews). The chia seeds were unique and gave it an amazing crunch! Put that with the asparagus puree, black-like rice and a spicy puree...it was a burst of flavors in your mouth. We licked the plate clean.-Crabcakes: For a landlock town, they sure weren't stingy on the crab meat! Every bit had crab and the breading was at a minimal so you actually tasted the crab!The aioli was also good on it but it was flavorful itself you probably didn't need it!-Pork Osso Buco: We usually have lamb, but pork is also a good alternative. The pork by itself is dry, but if you actually mix all the flavors it was not at all dry and had sooo many flavors. The polenta that tasted like butter and cheese with the roasted tomatoes and kale... it literally made my mouth melt and fall in love with this dish. The kale was cooked perfect! I can eat this everyday. Everything we had that night was excellent. This place sure was not the hype. Service was great, good was great, company was great... I think this is as good as it gets in Scottsdale for dinner... put this in SD and it'll be the new "it" restaurant. *Hint Hint* Come on over

I'll continue to stand by my one-star rating... the owner of the restaurant has sent me threatening and derogatory emails, messages with fake Yelp accounts, and now a recent comment here.  One comment said something along the lines of "You don't know what I'm capable of", which is exactly why I will continue to warn others from "dining" at this establishment.  I think the lesson to be learned in all of this is that while sanitation issues can happen from time to time, the key is recognizing the problem, apologizing and making it right.  Instead, what Nefelie's has done is harass me and told me I am wrong.  This is definitely not the right way to do things as a human being or business owner!

-ALOHA!!! If you crave the creamy taste of authentic macaroni salad from Hawaii, look no further...yum, yum, yum!-Kalua pork was tender, smokey, and moist...yum! yum! yum!-Grilled BBQ chicken was tender and so good!...yum! yum! yum!-The noodle soup was so good - $5.99 and the portions are very generous!-Crispy shrimp was crispy, maybe panko breading? It was so good! Not greasy! Perfectly cooked. Must have more!-They even have SPAM on the menu too (if you've been to Hawaii, then you know that SPAM is offered everywhere - even at McD's too!)-Service - FRIENDLY, SUPER NICE, and very cordial. -Order your food at the counter and wait for your number to be called, or they bring it to your table on a tray. Fantastic service!-The PORTIONS are VERY GENEROUS!!! Two people could easily share one combo plate...unless you are a very BIG eater. Two scoops of sticky rice, a scoop of macaroni salad, and sauteed cabbage come with your meal.-They do offer a rice bowl with choice of meat for $4.99 if you want a smaller meal.-CLEAN place!!! Clean restroom!-Parking is very convenient. Leo's is located across the parking lot from Barnes & Nobles and next to Baskin Robbins.-Mahalo!I grew up in Hawaii (lived there for 20 years) and after moving to the mainland a few years ago, the only good Hawaiian/Korean style BBQ I've had was in Vegas, which the kama'aina refer to as the 9th island due to the many people from Hawaii who've moved there. Since moving to AZ a year ago, we've only had our cravings satisfied when we go to Vegas, that is, until we found out about Leo's. Granted, it's not 100% authentic, but then again, there's nothing like it out here, especially in the west valley. The bbq chicken is super tender and tasty, mac salad is superb, and the katsu curry is ono-licious! Musubi's are pretty good, though there's too much rice. The broccoli and the occasional romaine lettuce used to soak up the oils is a bit odd, but it doesn't detract from the flavors at all...most of the time the usual cabbage is still used. Our first visit there they were playing some uh..."interesting" music, but subsequent visits have yielded better results, and it finally has more of a local flavor. Add that to the friendly employees/owner and their awesome food, and they've got a regular customer in me. Until of course, when they add spicy chicken or pork to their menu, which means I'm gonna have to go more often!Leo's does a really decent plate lunch. As for the people complaining about certain dishes, it's more a matter of expectation, rather than execution.My brother in law is from the big island Hawaii... pidgin and all (which I secretly love when he breaks in to, but will deny if he asks), so I have heard all the stories about plate lunches and the time he ate three in one setting, etc. He LOVES a plate lunch and he likes the ones here. I'm trusting that he knows of what he speaks.Yes the macaroni salad is bland. That is how they make it there. It is basically a ton of mayo, macaroni, a smidge of grated onion, and usually a hint of tuna. Basically you get additional flavoring from the grilled meat or add it with a little shoyu. If that doesn't sound like what you are "used" to getting, you probably aren't going to like it. But I have to say all that mayonnaise makes my heart sing.I personally love the BBQ chicken and the lemon pepper chicken. Mostly because they are on the healthier side. If you order the lemon pepper chicken with no rice or salad and extra cabbage, it's low-carb and low calorie, in addition to being really tasty.The chicken katsu is also very good. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. And my BIL likes the spam musubi. Well he likes any musubi actually. :)Service is fast. The eating area is clean. The meals are cheap. And I actually like that there is no "corporate office" to complain to. If you want to eat at a chain, go somewhere else. This is family owned and operated.I like Leo's. If you have a family, order the family dinner and pull up a chair, because you are going to be there a while. It's a lot of good food!Good lord, the macaroni salad makes you want to give up and quit your job so you can pull up a chair to the kitchen window and eat it all day. The short ribs are my favorite meal- they are seasoned that perfect balance of sweet & savory- and all the platters are big enough for a huge dinner or two lunches...if you eat like most mainlanders eat. If you're a Samoan, eh, not so much...you better order two meals!The staff is always friendly and smiling and the dining room is very clean. The menu has catering prices on the back page, and you could get a backyard luau going for 50 people for about $200.I'll totally host the luau as long as it's BYOB and I can keep the leftovers.

Review Text :
The Bar is OK..the food looks better than it taste. I just want to warn anyone who goes to the T. Tavern not to make any jokes or comments about the Adult book store located just east of the establishment. I must have struck a nerve or something. I made, what I considered an innocent comment/joke about the bar being right next door to a Porn shop. The snotty, little, freak bartender went berserk !  She really got her panties in a bunch and probably disfigured the ugly-ass tattoo on her butt. She immediately had me escorted out. If you go there..Just watch what you say..I know at least one bartender there that has absolutely no sense of humor.. what-so-ever.Never want to go back, no matter who's playing. First of all the stage is shitty and the room is so small my ears are ringing for what I can tell is gonna last for days.  Food was poor and overpriced. Our waitress was nice but I spent $10 on a double whiskey something and didn't even feel a buzz.  That's saying a lot for the huge lightweight I am, and my drink was at least 24 ounces. Lastly there's barely any parking, and we got towed for parking in an adjacent parking spot where the towing sign was almost on the ground so we didn't see it when we first parked there.Let me start by saying I go to bars to see bands.  I've seen several shows at this bar.  It even has a surprisingly nice sound system for such a small room.  It should be a perfect place to enjoy a live band.  Instead, it is a PAINFUL DUNGEON where live music is an endurance test rather than a pleasure.  The problem?  One incompetent sound man and management too apathetic to notice.  The dreadlock entangled caucasoid at the mixing board drives the house system at decibels appropriate for a large auditorium.  His first mistake is pushing bass levels hard enough to bruise internal organs.  Then to balance the lows, he cranks the mids and highs.  At those levels, any vocal microphone would feedback in such a small room.  His solution?  Turn down the vocal mics!  The result?  It is impossible to hear the music over the sound of your ear bones being ground into dust.  There are still occasionally audible vocal blips punctuated by piercing feedback squeals.  It's a real shame as I've seen some truly exceptional bands there and they get to sound like they don't know what they're doing.  Any monkey with a finger can push a slider and make it louder.  It doesn't make you look cool.  It doesn't increase the size of your genitals.  It won't win you friends.  It makes you an incompetent sound man and it drives away customers.  As a reward for enduring the whole night, my ears rang for days.Oh, and if you want to get something from the bar, be prepared to wait until the staff gets done flirting with each other and discussing  some guy's new hat, what Tiffany thinks of okra, whose turn it is to clean the ice bins next Wed and any other world shaking issues that supersede basic customer service.  Eventually you will get your drink, generously garnished with I-don't-give-a-4uck.  At the rate the bartenders serve drinks versus the rate your liver metabolizes alcohol, I don't believe it is within the realm of physiologically possibility to become intoxicated at this bar.By all rights, this should be the best bar in Tempe.  It's close to ASU, has easy access to the light rail, good food, cheap drinks, live music, excellent sound system, etc...  Even convenient porn next door if you're into that.  But the abusively loud music levels and contemptuous attitude of the staff make this a place that my friends and I will continue to avoid with gusto.  With more engaged management, this place could be as iconic as the old Long Wongs!Here is a copy of the email I sent the owner:Rob,I am taking a moment of my day to write to you to inform you of our experience last night in your bar which could be described as unethical and unimaginable.  We were in there until about 10:30 or 11:00pm last night and went home to get more money because I make it a practice not to bring my bank card to a bar.  We went home, had something to eat and walked back.  We live at the Tempe Travel Trailer Villa right down the street and have been coming to your establishment off and on since the end of last May which I am sure you could care less about.   There are reasons we are not more frequent which I may get to later.We came back in at 11:42pm (you can check your bar cameras) and we were asked by the bouncer if we were next door.  It was late, we had some drinks in your bar earlier ($30 worth to be exact and we tipped the bartender about $10, so we're not scum) and were taken by surprise by this question and I said "yes" not realizing that he had meant Modern World.  My partner had asked him "what do you mean next door?"  Even though TTTV is not exactly next door it is less than a block from your "bar" and could be considered "in the neighborhood".  We have patronized your bar to the tune of probably $500 regrettably since last May between us and friends that we had brought and while your bar could be considered a place to frequent on the way to something better we are close to it and don't have to drive.  After this question was asked and we had told him, after the confusion was eliminated, we went home and came back he had promptly said "We don't allow that."  I said you don't allow what? I can't go home and get more money and come back?  He said "NO, get out, we don't allow that.  You know what I am talking about?"  What is this guy talking about?  May I ask why patrons of Modern World are not allowed into your bar?  Let me remind you that you own or manage a bar which doesn't exactly attract Christian folks ready to preach the gospel.  You attract drunks, the homeless, broke college kids, and if your entertainment was any mark of what to expect it's no wonder why you're not busy.  Every time we have been in there it's been dead and we've been there ranging from happy hour to Friday and Saturday nights.  If someone is causing trouble in your bar, you boot them out.  The key word here is causing.  You don't assume that someone is going to start trouble ESPECIALLY when you don't know the facts and boot them out.  We were in there before and have been there before and to prove it, no one on your staff knows us by name which means we're not on their radar or they're not friendly and care not to know their customers. I was completely offended by that asshole assuming we came from Modern World which in my opinion is not a problem.  I didn't know you were in a position to be able to afford to kick folks out which happens every time we're in there.  At one time the bartender told  a guy last month he wasn't going to be served because he had already had some drinks.  She told him to come in sober and SHE would get him "fucked up" which to me means no difference.  If someone leaves your establishment and gets into trouble drunk it's not any different than someone coming in with some drinks under their belt and leaving.  People bar hop.  I have read reviews and have heard testimony from our neighbors at TTTV and they all say the same thing, you guys are quick to throw people out rather than accept the challenges that come with running a bar.  We are now going to Starters and they have better drink deals and food.I'm an average guy with no title but "customer" and I expect to be treated like one when entering an establishment.  I am 38 years old and have NEVER been kicked out of a bar because I know how to behave even intoxicated.  Legally?  You're drunk after one drink.  Are you going to boot everyone after one drink?  I later established that they were wanting to go home and were closing up shop.  I think they were worried that we would stay until 2am (which I believe is posted, could be wrong) and we had no intention of it, especially after that.  I did NOT tip the bartender after she served us last night (the last round, we tipped her before we left) as I felt that she could have told the guy to cool it off since she is the one in charge.  He was so rude and after we told him we went home to get more money and we had cash in hand, he looked at us and rolled his eyes in the manner that we were lying.  Bar closed at midnight.It would not let me cut the entire email because it was lengthy.  I don't expect to hear back.  I assume it's a prejudice bar and the staff really has a thing with who can come in and not.  They're never busy.  I wouldn't be so picky.The bar tender was rude and was refusing to serve people. Plenty of places with better ambiance and better service nearby.

Review Text :
@ZoesKitchen is a great addition to the Scottsdale Waterfront shopping area!  Now I can have a good meal over here for under $20/plate!  I had the Greek marinara chicken plate.  Marinated, grilled chicken breast on a bed of orzo with a nice marinara sauce.  A good portion of Greek salad on the side.I also tried my wife's spinach wraps - reminiscent of spanikopita.Service was outstanding.The atmosphere is casual and nice.Bigger and better than ever! Zoes sure is stepping up their game in their shiny new Waterfront location. I anticipated the opening of the new Zoes for weeks and jumped at the first chance I had to pay them a visit. Now that I am reporting on Zoes after my visit, I can say that I am a happy camper!First of all, I love the location because now that means I don't have to drive 15 minutes to get my Zoes fix. Second of all, they made sure to create plenty of seating here so I hope that means I will always have the luck I had upon my first visit every time and score a seat seamlessly. The atmosphere inside is very quirky and fun with bright colors and a quick take-out environment with the option to sit and enjoy lunch. Next I will dedicate an entire paragraph to the Coke machine. I might be in the dark ages but this is the first time I've seen a coke machine like this! Upon first glance it looks like it's retro and a copy of an old school machine, but then once you look closer, it looks like a space ship about ready to take you to a new universe of fountain drink mania. It has every option imaginable, including about 8 different Diet Coke flavors. Amazing! The food at Zoes is good and tastes healthy and fresh. It's a perfect fix for a light lunch where you don't walk away feeling too full and yet you're still satisfied. Some of my Zoes favorites include the wraps, Greek salad, Grilled Chicken pita and hummus. The pita bread that comes with the hummus is a little dry for me and would probably taste better if it came out hot. However, in general the food at Zoes is good and you get a decent amount of food for what you pay for, including a side option of fruit, salad, pasta (w/o mayo) and some other choices. They also have Mediterranean tuna which is mayo-free, tasty and easy on the waistline! So farewell Zoes until the very near future because I promise you, I will be a regular here. I even bought the reusable cup which offers me 99 cent refills upon my return!This new Zoes location has been open only a few weeks but it's already become a regular lunch destination in my rotation!I'm a huge fan of Zoes' Greek Salads, chicken salad, hummus, and fruit salad.  I love their large portions, casual atmosphere, and modest prices.  I also love their "dinners for four," which are perfect if you're bringing dinner over to someone's house, and they are always a hit!Todd, the manager of this location, is super nice, as is the rest of the staff... oh, and I know it's already been written about in some of the other reviews, but you have to order a drink and use the new Coke machine!  It's incredible how many options there are.  My latest fave drink concoction is my version of an Arnold Palmer: 1/2 unsweet tea, 1/4 raspberry lemonade, and 1/4 regular lemonade.  Delish!Don't forget to check-in on Yelp for 10% off your order!start your lunch/dinner with their yia yia's chocolate sheet cake--it is very good!i prefer their sandwiches and orzo salad!I like food that tastes fattier than it is. I find this at Zoes. I'm a huge fan of the spinach rolls with chicken and rumor has it (or a nutrition website claims) that they are lower in calories than you'd typically expect. Now by no means are these probably considered low-cal but I think (hope) they are lower in calories. And if not, I still love them so don't burst my wannabe healthy bubble! :) I also love, love, love their hummus which I know is not so low cal, but it's love and I can't say no to it.This past weekend, I squealed in delight to learn about the Simply 500 menu that Zoes recently launched. Well, they didn't actually launch it since the items have always been on their menu, but they've finally made it easy on on the calorie-conscious to figure out what to order while visiting. Sadly the hummus wasn't on the menu (probably because of the pita), but there are several delicious items, including the spinach roll-ups! I uploaded the menu and posted it to the Yelp listing. Take a look! Your waistline will thank you.Fresh, fast and affordable are two things that don't often intersect these days, but somehow Zoe's manages to bring it all together under one roof! We had pre-ordered our meals to ensure we had enough time to eat lunch and picked up our food at the counter. GREEK SALAD: A light and heart healthy alternative to my usual pizzas and heavy plate lunches. Big portion of greens so hopefully this will help to fill up the bigger sized bellies.HUMMUS : Beyond the salad I highly recommend getting the hummus with pita bread! The hummus has just the right level of lemon flavor which I often find lacking in other mediterranean joints. Bravo Zoe's!TOMATO SOUP: Whatever you do, DO NOT order the tomato soup. I could taste the straight from the can flavor and this was definitely the low-point of my meal.The decor at Zoe's is modern casual with open seating. Their soda machine from the future was very perplexing and I'm glad someone else was there to show me how to use it! Great fast casual concept and I do hope it comes to my hometown of Honolulu some day soon!(Photo machine from the future: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zo%C3%ABs-kitchen-scottsdale-2?select=wldK7GljQwSOopMmhad2_Q#wldK7GljQwSOopMmhad2_Q)31 Yelps Challenge: #19/31

Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #169 - #365We were with spending time with our family friends and decided to dine out. We decided on BJ's because my Mom was familiar with the BJ's in California and we always have a good experience. Through the huge swivel door, you're greeted into this urban style restaurant that you'll find any other BJ's franchise.The floorplan is almost the same as the one we return to in California but a little smaller. Food and service was ok and there was nothing to fault on. To sum it up, it was just average and nothing spectacular. If I were to come back, I would just hit the bar for some good craft beer and bar food.

Fucking Gross. So I came here in 2006 and I really liked it back then it had more variety. I was very ardent to come back, knowing that this place was great. I asked, " can I go walk around to see what is available?" So I walk around and it looks clean as you can see I took some pictures.I then decided to stay. To my demise I regret. I went to get some food sat down and the first this that happend was there was a cock roach on my fucking table. I was so grossed out. At this point I then decided to leave, I picked up and asked for a refund.She was kind of hesitant to give it to me but I then explained that if I stayed I would around telling everybody about my experience. There aren't enough words to describe how disgusting this is. I wouldn't even give it 1 star.

I really like this place.  Prices are great, portions big.  I am more inclined to order rice dishes here, because they just come with so much.  Sliced pork rice dish comes with 3 shrimps (yes I pluralized it) this egg/pork cake cube which is delicious, a lot of rice, 2 eggs on top of the rice, and pickled veggies.  Meat is not fatty (which happens all too often at Vietnamese restaurants) what a great place.  I'm surprised at the number of reviews less than 4.  Yes, maybe you aren't being greeted by a hostess (or anyone at all) but the prices are so low, what do you expect.  LOL @ Misti's review on this place... "overfloweth"  That was funny.  And the rest of the review is in normal English.In every town I have ever lived in, there has always been a war going on between Pho restaurant owners.  When I lived in San Diego, some of the owners of Pho establishments figured out how to bypass the Yelp Filter by going WAY out of their way to take the proper steps. I mean, they would clear their cookies, register their accounts at the public library(for IP address reasons),  make tons of friends, invest their time into writing one detailed 4-star review per day for 30 days, and then when the filter believed that they were real people they would write a libelous review about their enemy.  These fraudulent reviews usually looked something like: "I got food poisoning here last night. The owner stole my credit card number and bought Burberry with it. The health inspector came in while I was eating and shut the place down. The cooks are Mexican! The owner isn't Vietnamese he is Filipino! There were cockroaches in my Pho, I ordered the rare steak pho without cockroaches but I got them anyway!  The srirachi sauce was actually aids blood.  I was molested by the owner when I went to the bathroom".  And when I lived in Los Angeles county, Pho restaurant workers used to vandalize competing restaurants, and they would always get into physical altercations in public when they would run into each other. There is a lot of politics and backstabbing in the Pho business. What many people don't know is that frequently one Pho restaurant will be started by a group of Vietnamese immigrants, then one member of the group will betray the others by breaking away and making his own restaurant. This is usually the root of the hostility. The moral of my story is that one of the main reasons all the Pho joints on Yelp average a 2 1/2 star rating is because of these "Pho Wars".  So don't go on Yelp to try and find a good Pho place. Just run around town and try various places. See which ones you like and decide for yourself. PHO SAIGON is one of the better Pho places I have been to in town. The broth is oily and clear. The steak is bloody and tender.  They pack your broth with sliced green onions. And the store has a good location.. it's located in the same center as Greenland and my personal favorite restaurant: Sushi on Rainbow!  The Pho at PHO SAIGON is actually really good. Pho is a simple dish to me, it doesn't have the complexities that Ramen has. I personally believe that Pho is Ramen's inbred twin brother.  PHO SAIGON does a great job at presenting a Pho which is quite typical of what you would find at popular douchebag hangouts such as Pho Kim Long and Pho So 1.  The reason I like PHO SAIGON better than Pho Kim Long and Pho So 1 is because you(the reader) sucks, and you eat there. I don't want to eat there and completely suck with you. No one wants to suck, right? So come to PHO SAIGON and be "cool" like me.I support all Asian-American businesses so this place gets 5-stars by default.In search of Banh Mi, Monkey scored two giant sandwiches in a hurry.  Cut both in half, Monkey got grub for next 3 days...  Very nice server, but even after asking me 3 times which sandwiches I wanted, "oh don't worry, already started making..."  Monkey still didn't get no Korean BBQ Beef!!!  GAH!  Monkey ordered:  #6 Combination $5.50 - great fresh bread, filled just right#8 Korean BBQ Beef  $5.99 - who knows?Monkey shall return, unless I find a better sandwich for less.

Review Text :
It's no secret that I'm a huge fan of Arcadia Farms, and when I heard they were going to be opening a marketplace across the street, I was psyched.  Of course, this was many months ago... So when I woke up this morning to see an email in my inbox (thanks Lisa G) saying that they were now open for business, I was very excited and knew immediately where to go for lunch.  Needless to say, I made it a priority to get there asap (I didn't want to miss the opportunity to get the FTR).  While it's different than I expected, I was pleasantly surprised!  The menu is diverse and includes many of the AF signature items such as the Mushroom, Spinach & Goat Cheese Tart, the Strawberry Chicken Salad, and their extraordinary desserts.  In addition, they offer plenty of new options such as a Chopped Italian Salad, a Tuna Nicoise Salad, and a Roasted Artichoke & Ricotta Cheese sandwich.  There is a daily soup, and plenty of breakfast items (think everything from muesli to quiche, muffins, croissants, and granola parfaits).  Arcadia Farms' famous apricot iced tea is also on the menu, as well as a full coffee menu. I went with the  AF Breakfast Sandwich ($6.95).  It's an MJ English muffin, scrambled eggs, aged cheddar cheese, and your choice of ham or bacon.  They made it with egg whites for me, and it was delicious.  My dining companions had a sandwich and soup, respectively.  Everything is made to-go, but there is plenty of seating outside if you choose to dine there like we did today.  Marketplace offers a simpler fast/casual option for breakfast, lunch, or a comforting snack in Old Town... They use natural, organic, and local products, and it shows.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  I anticipate this being a welcome addition to my "rotation" of go-to spots in my 'hood.I'm so happy! After years of enjoying a sit-down experience at Arcadia Farms and months of anticipation for the marketplace doors to open, I can officially say that I am one very happy yelper! First of all, I want to wrap the Arcadia Farms Marketplace up and put it in my pocket; it's so cute inside and out! It's like a dream farmhouse and one I could be quite comfortable in for hours. Maybe it has something to do with the tasty sweets and treats staring me in the face too.The marketplace is stocked full of food for all and friendly staff serving it. I always loved visiting the Phoenix Art Museum Arcadia Farms because I'd have a great chat with Lisa G. So, needless to say how pleased I was when I walked into the Marketplace to see her behind the counter! We had a great chat and she told me all about the wonderful items they serve! They have everything from tea packets and flowers to scones, cookies, brownie pops and nutella. They also have their miniature cakes ready for purchase as well as their tasty iced tea and lemonade. The salads are pre-made every morning and waiting in the refrigerator to be eaten. They have tuna nicoise, turkey club, their famous strawberry chicken salad, a garden salad, pasta salad and chicken curry salad with raspberry sauce. They also have a detailed breakfast and sandwich menu that are made-to-order. Besides a couple classics, this menu is different and it's lower in price. The sandwiches range from roast beef and mozzarella and to pressed chicken. They have a lot of options on the menu. I also heard they are introducing a limited dinner menu. It's still not a "cheap" meal, but it's competitive to other lunch options out there at about $8-$9 for a sandwich and $8-$9 for a salad. So now that I've given a recap of what I saw at the marketplace, I will report on what I ate! It was tough...so tough to decide between a sandwich and salad. I wanted both! Then the more I looked at the chicken curry salad, the more appealing it looked, so I opted for that. Verdict? Very pleased!! The chicken curry has a sweetness to it and then the raspberry dressing is the perfect addition. Arcadia Farm's pesto shrimp salad is addicting and I think that this one might be up there with that level of addiction! It was the perfect size and filled me up without making me want to roll out of there. For my beverage, I went for the raspberry ice tea. And yes, today I decided my sweet tooth would win over my willpower, so I took a lemon cake muffin for the road. In summary, it was a very summeresque meal and very fulfilling! I sat outside at their tables in the front. I wish they had indoor seating but it seems like the indoor seating is only for the private event catering. But then again, this is a marketplace and the purpose is for people to get in and out. Speaking of the private catering room, it is absolutely adorable in there. Arcadia Farms is the perfect place for a bridal or baby shower or ladies lunch, but the restaurant itself can be a little cramped so it makes it hard. Therefore, this is a great alternative! If I ever need to plan a ladies-only party, hands-down this will be my first choice. In summary, I definitely see myself becoming a regular at the Arcadia Farm's Marketplace. I still love the sit-down Arcadia Farms, but when I don't have time to sit down and have a ladies lunch, I'm very happy that they've given me this alternative!!

In my new-found whole-hearted embrace for brunch (after a period of thorough refusal to go out for food during brunch hours because I can be stubborn like that) I ventured to Lawrence with a group of 7 (not THE group of 7.... only in my Canadian dreams...). I was very very pleased. Been hearing the folklore about this place for a while and what they say is true! The things I adored:i) Tea cups! Really china cups!ii) Little donuts! Wee little donuts!iii) Pretty, smiley, and very friendly staff... at least our lovely waitress was.iv) The brunch itself. I had the scramble with creme fraiche on their rustic bread with a side of smoked salmon. I fell in love with those eggs. Ladies and gentlemen, this is how eggs should taste I tells ya... I tried to describe it here but I can't... you will have to try them yourself :)Location: On the main, corner Maguire. Street parking is available [metered] and the closest subway is likely Laurier. It'll be a 10-minute walk from there. The place: Not huge, but very cozy and bright. It kind of feels like walking into someone's loft apartment - if I lived close by, I'd probably want to hang out here all the time. The goods: I ordered the baked eggs with mushrooms and celeriac, along with a side of bacon. First of all, BACON. Crispy. Yum. Need more. Secondly, the celeriac/egg/mushroom combo was served piping hot with the egg yolks on top - so you get to mash that sh*t up all by yourself just like when you were five, all the while attempting not to drool in your plate. Personally, I loved this dish but be warned - it does fill you up. It was incredibly flavourful and the mushroom chunks were quite large. The home-made bread is to die for, especially with that melted butter. God help me. Side note: if you like your bacon crispy, let them know. Also, they make the bacon themselves, as well as their sausages. My two lady friends both ordered the English breakfast and I'm going to assume they enjoyed it because there was nothing left on their plates, when everything was said and done. I think I saw one of my friends licking her plate when she thought no one was looking. So busted. Service: Great! Our waitress was super friendly and patiently answered all of our questions (OK, she patiently answered one person's questions and that person wasn't me). Price point: I would say it's on par with most breakfast places. For the portion size and quality of the ingredients, I think you get your money's worth. Note: I don't think they take reservations for weekend brunch unless you're six or more. When you show up, they'll take your name and number, and call you when a table opens up. It's a very efficient system!

Review Text :
Osteria 2350, how have you been hidden from me for so long?!Oh that's right, because you've sadly been hidden behind the empty store front of Right by Nature in the Strip.  But one title this place can hold is hidden gem...because it really is!  It's part restaurant part Italian deli with fresh meats, breads and desserts to pick up.  Me and a friend came in all business....which meant we were ready to eat!  And boy did we ever!  We enjoyed 3 full courses because everything sounded so incredible!August is the month to take advantage of any sort of tomato salad, so I enjoyed a tomato and moz salad with just the right amount of balsamic dressing.  It was FRESH FRESH FRESH!  But let me tell you the key to being good friends.  The key is to pick two main courses and split them.  The best of both worlds!  We choose the gnocchi and the Riccolina.  The Riccolina had this Fede pasta in it that I had never tried before.  It was really awesome!  I'm an al dente type of girl and these were cooked just right!  It also came with caramelized mushrooms, truffle oil, arugula and parm  The gnocchi was the real winner for me...it had a medium texture between a light and heavy gnocchi.  I'm usually a fan of the light kind but I think it was the combo of sauce and cheese that won me over on the whole dish.  It was perfecto!  We also enjoyed the Tiramisu for dessert.  It wasn't the best I've ever had (that's at Piccolo Forno in Lola) but it was still pretty good.  The service was fantastic as well, with our server answering all questions we had (like the very important, how big are your dishes) and she answered the questions perfectly.  I'm now a complete fan of this place and can add it to the top of my Strip District list.  You all for sure need to go there...I'm excited to try a dinner there soon....remember...true friendship means splitting two main dishes!

I am a Teriyaki chicken lover, so this is the spot to go to if your just simply craving some traditional teriyaki with rice bowl or plate. I almost always get the Teriyaki with the steamed Veggies and white rice!! We also truly enjoy their avocado rolls and California rolls, they are both much fuller and cleaner cut, then other places.**** Also the service was nice, overall it is good.

This location is awesome. I don't get the other negative reviews but I can honestly say I have never experienced any of that here. There has been a change in employees over time but that happens in a place like this. Too bad because the current girl working (name escapes me damn it) is effing awesome. When I walk in she greets me and asks if I am going to have a spicy italian or cold cut combo this time and it's cool she remembers. I like extra bell peppers and light lettuce on my sandwich which for some reason is hard to comprehend for some employees and other locations. This girl actually makes the sandwich how I ask for it and asks if it looks OK and if it needs more or less of anything. Sometimes this location gets super busy during lunch time and on weekends so they run out of certain types of bread at times but it is what it is. Solid location. A few times now I have been approached by people selling things or asking for donations. This isn't Subways fault. It's happening outside in the shopping center. The area is nice and newer and I hope they have security in the shopping center but if they do I haven't seen any. It would be nice if there were security making regular rounds to help with stuff.

Review Text :
***Chase Field's Big Dawgs sells decent though expensive foot-long hot dogs that are heavily topped and categorized by city or state (Chicago Dog, Wisconsin Dog, California Dog, Arizona Dog)***Chase Field's main concession stand is Double Headers, which is easy to find because of their many locations.  Double Headers features traditional ballpark food like hot dogs, popcorn and nachos.  Big Dawgs (which has only one location in Section 130) also serves traditional concessions like hot dogs, but they are done with a little more flair.Big Dawgs emphasizes "big" food items such as a variety of foot-long hot dogs to a very large $16 soft pretzel that comes with multiple dipping sauces.The foot-long hot dogs are named by city/state and they were offering 4 varieties on our visit (the dogs were displayed in a glass case with all their toppings).  There was the Arizona Dog, which featured melted cheese, sausage and red and black tortilla strips.  There was also a Chicago Dog, which seemed to the traditional Chicago ingredients like relish, tomato, etc.  They also had a Wisconsin Dog, which was topped with macaroni and cheese and bacon.There was even a California Dog on the menu.  If I asked Californians what they think would be in the California Dog, I imagine most would say avocado.  I don't think avocado was in it (unless the enthusiastic cashier did not explain it correctly). The California Dog was topped with melted cheese, onions, peppers, and steak (it really seemed to be a Philly Cheesesteak Dog so maybe the name was just incorrect).We went with the Arizona Dog and it was pretty good.  The bun was nice and soft while the hot dog had a good flavor.  Not too strong and not bland.  The toppings were just okay.  The tortilla strips were fine and provided a good crunch, but the cheese did not have much spice and the sausage was a little ordinary.The staff here was very enthusiastic and helpful.Pricing was high.  The foot-long dogs were elaborate creations, but they might not be worth the $9 price tag.Big Dawgs provides a different hot dog experience so it might be worth checking out if you come to this stadium and want to walk away with something a little more interesting than a regular hot dog, nachos or popcorn.

How can you not be drawn in, just by the name alone!  Clever, fo sho!So once you're drawn in, what are you drawn to?  In keeping with the seasonal theme, I ordered the Southern Tier Pumpking Ale.  Delish, as always. They have about 12 or so beers on tap that's clearly written up on a big chalkboard above the bar.  I'm into bars that have a wide variety on tap.  I can't stand when you go somewhere and all they have is Miller and Coors Light.  But for a name like the BeerHive, they really should have more to offer!They also have a big refrigerator with a whole lotta specialty beers to pick from.  You can either pick up a beer and drink it there or take out for a "night cap" at home.  For "bar food" the food is pretty decent!  Sticking with the hive part of beer they have a lot of honey type concoctions.  We opted to try a couple wing flavors, as they all looked pretty yummy.  We tried the salt n' vinegar, honey bbq, ranch and buffalo.  I really enjoyed the salt n' vinegar, being a huge vinegar fan!  I also thought the honey bbq was pretty good.  We also ordered I REALLY enjoyed the honey bites, mini cinnamon pretzels with honey drizzled on top.  YUM-O! They have a lot of different specials, including $1 off beers and $3 apps.  The HH special for beers isn't too great, but I love a good deal on food too, so it balances out!  They also have a special armature comedy night.  I think that would be an interesting thing to see, laugh at them or laugh with them?  We'll see!

Ok, let's just get this out of the way: Wang's Delight ... The "Pervy 14-year-old boy" part of my personality is busting up laughing right now! *Responsible, functional adult part chimes in*"Sheesus, Meg, act your age already!"Anyway, the food here. Unimpressed! Especially since a few of my coworkers used to go here often, enjoyed it and highly recommended it. Found their menu in a drawer one night. I wasn't going to cook, Dude was working late, Chinese it is! *Ahem, swear I'm more domestic than takeout ...*Ordered the Mongolian Beef and Chicken Lo Mein. After tip I think this averaged out to be a little over $15. Both dishes were overly oily, mushy and lacking any kind of spice or character. Kind of like those microwaveable Tai Pei Asian food meals (or whatever the name is) I would scarf down in college. Not so sure I'm going to rush back and try them again.Sorry Wang's, I  just wasn't delighted with your cuisine.

Restaurant name  Steenbock's On Orchard

Review Text :
I forgot who said a restaurant is only as good as its people. Perhaps nobody said that and I can claim it? Regardless, in Madison, Michael Pruett is the most unsung apron wearing, slicing, dicing, sauteing, dude in a kitchen, which makes it easy for me to say the following: Steenbock's is the most overlooked restaurant in the 608. Bold statement time: If you haven't eaten at Steenbock's you're missing out on what might be one of the strongest dining experiences you'll have in Madison. The interior is far warmer than another well known fine dining establishment in town, which sets the scene for an incredible culinary adventure. The service is spot on! SPOT FRIGGIN' ON. So much so that if a server misses a beat, a GM or AGM is quick to swap out a fork, refill a glass, or bring by a new napkin that's fallen on the floor. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not for all the pomp and circumstance. Just put good food in front of me and I'll be ok. BUT if you're going to build a reputation for solid service, deliver. And these guys do. (Something else I can't say about other fine dining experiences I've had in town). When it comes to the food. It's remarkable. Full of flavor, artfully plated and portioned in a way that you can easily savor every bite without feeling like you're over doing it. True that some entrees are pricey as compared to most places in town, but split some small plates with friends, or just simply make Steenbocks a once a quarter place as I've done and splurge after a few months of hard work. You owe it to yourself! My biggest grip about the place... nobody is ever there when I am. Why? If I'm being completely honest, it's in the worst location maybe second to Naples15 which is in a basement. Here's the deal, you can't really see it from the road, the parking situation is abysmal, and I fear that because it feels like a "destination" (even though if you read their website and map your trip it's actually easy) people just pass. DON'T PASS ON THESE GUYS! My fear is the time will come when it doesn't make sense to keep Steenbock's open and Michael will be flipping burgers and sending out cheese curds dressed up in panko or something stupid on the Capitol. Go.Eat.Tell others what you think.Go back with them. Eat again.

3.75 stars!  Just finished putting away leftovers from a take-out order I placed via phone six minutes before closing time.  Mom was hungry, so I asked, would you like some pizza or Chinese?  She said Chinese, and as I started to look for the Flo's menu I had in my purse, she mentioned the pamphlet we received in the mail from Asian Island.  While she pored over the menu, I checked for Yelp reviews and found only one of significance (by that, I mean those reviews written by elites-- real photos and names), that of Scott D.'s.  Mom gave up looking, disgusted at seeing the high prices.  "What do you mean the food's expensive?," I asked.  I looked at the menu, and I didn't see anything over-the-top ($9 chicken; $10 beef and pork; $11 shrimp), so I decided I'd go w/ Scott D.'s wife's selection of Shrimp Lo Mein for Mom, and the Twice-cooked Pork for me.  I'd requested that they omit carrots, celery, and, if any, corn and mushroom.  The woman on the phone repeated these veggies TWICE, so I gathered that she was taking careful notes...The food was very tasty!  Mom said the shrimp dish was "good!"  I asked "Good-good or good-because-you're-hungry-good?"  She said "good-good, but not 'out-of-body experience' good."  (To quote Scott D.)  LOL  My twice-cooked pork (bbq pork sauteed w/ CARROTS, bell pepper, water chestnuts, spring onions, CELERY, and onions, among other things, was also very tasty!  Mom liked the dish, as well, but, when asked, preferred the shrimp.  I had also requested a side of egg noodles (loved the bean sprouts!), instead of rice, and I really appreciated that they obliged!  Other restaurants would've forced me to take rice, which I cannot have, and then make me pay for a side order of noodles.  This alone deserved a star!  Easily 4, 4.5 stars, which isn't bad for my first take-out meal from here, and I'd have given 5 stars if my request for certain veggies to be omitted was followed.  I will return to try other items, and, hopefully, they'll be more mindful about my food allergy concerns!Lunch options look tantalizing, and sushi and Hawaiian dishes are also available!

Lorsqu'on vous assoit à votre table, ajouter un « arigato » qui veut simplement dire « merci ».Nous avons partagé du poulet karage qui est le meilleur que j'ai goûté de ma vie. Des bons gros morceaux de poulet juteux avec un peu d'herbes et épices pour donner une bonne saveur à ces petites bouchées. La mayo au wasabi sortait de l'ordinaire et a donné du piquant au karage. Une autre entrée partagé, ressemblait à une espèce d'omelette rectangulaire avec soit du porc, des anguilles ou de fromage à l'intérieur. C'est servi avec de la sauce soya un peu comme des sushi, mais c'est chaud.Pour le repas principal, on a pris des soupes ramen au soya avec porc et bœuf. Au début, c'était le meilleur bouillon au monde! Après quelques secondes à essayer de deviner l'ingrédient secret, on s'est dit que ça devait être du beurre. Environ 5 minutes plus tard, j'en avais assez de ma soupe et elle était devenue un peu trop lourde et grasse pour moi. J'en ai donc laissé la moitié, et même mon chum n'a pas terminé la sienne. Ça ne nous a pas empêché de partagé un gâteau au fromage et thé vert pour clôturer un bon repas très remplissant.Good food, great concept! Service needs to be a little more refined! I really liked the fact that there where other choices then sushi or fish and sea food! Since I can't eat any of it! So ya can't wait for my next visit!P.s. I'm intolerant to seafood &fish!

Rand H, and myself went here today for the grand opening lunch buffet . The food and lots of it was very good and the right temperature.Even the hard ice cream was not rock hard and easy to scoop. Most of the food here is the same as there other location.But they did not have the great cake you eat!! I had at Thomas and 75th ave.So  we have another great Chinese buffet in the valley to enjoy.updated 8-5-11I tried again, and it still has the stupid glitter, but I'll focus on the food....No good.  Average, if I'm generous.They put way too much food out at any given time for the amount of customers, meaning it sits around getting un-fresh waiting for you to come around.  As you poke and prod the item's unappetizing shiny (greasy) exterior, wondering if every goldamn thing in the building is cooked in a deep-fryer, you reluctantly find a less-grissly or fatty bit to relinquish to your plate.  By the time you get back to you horribly decorated table, the oiliness of each dish has congealed into a lukewarm film coating the thing.  Some people say bigger is not always better.I say Bigger is always not better.===========================================Sorry, but here's the thing:You can't put glitter designs on the table tops with a stencil and white glue, with tiny pieces of the metal chips flaking off from the pattern and migrating all over the entire surface of the table.  That isn't food-sanitary, in my opinion.

Tucked away into this weird, completely out of the way, limited-access cop-road-block-breathilizer-worthy corner is a beer bar. It's a little metal and stone to be called a Biergarten, painted beech trees on black walls aside, especially since there's maybe two-three German ales on tap - but still, cool.Vegan's are going to have it a bit rough but there's plenty for the cheese loving set to scarf. Food prices are ridiculously low. And the pretzal....ah, the pretzal... is insane. Charred to black, sweet, yeasty, beer cheese skunky and mustardy. Fantastic with beer. Get it.Stay away from the latkes, meh, but the chips are good and crisp. And the burger, while veg and in no way healthy, was satisfying. Service was smiley and quick. There were many Affliction shirts stretched across many fake-tanned biceps on the night we went. Many crotch rockets parked in many annoying ways, all over the expansive lot. Both of those things scare me. Could've been Primus's fault, as they were playing next door. Fingers crossed.There isn't a TV in sight. I'm hoping this is deliberate, rather than "whoops, the semi stuffed with flatscreens hasn't made it to town yet".Prices are a bit high for CLT but not compared to surrounding establishments, so they'll do just fine at 6-7 average for a pint. There are many good brews to be had, but I wish for a few more exotics and high gravs. And surely, more German beers. C'mon now.I visited VBGB Beer Hall and Garden last Saturday night for a birthday party.  It's a great venue for large group gatherings.  The restaurant/bar is presumably modeled after German beer halls and gardens.Inside, there is a huge horseshoe-shaped bar with plenty of seating.  On the floor, there are several large picnic-style, communal tables (like a German beer garden would have).  Above, there are a handful of TV displays tuned to sports.Outside, there is big patio with more tables and many games.  Games include giant Jenga, giant Connect Four, giant chess, cornhole, and more.  Since it was cold outside, the patio was enclosed and heat lamps were brought out to provide a measure of warmth.Ample free parking is available in a paved parking lot directly outside the building.  I'm not sure when this place opened, but it feels relatively new.  A reservation was made for our party of 20+, so two tables were blocked off with signs for our group.You can get beer at the bar and there's a window by the kitchen where you can order food.  After placing your food order, you're given a number to place at your table and your food is brought out to you.  VBGB's food menu mainly consists of bar food such as fries, onion rings, wings, chicken tenders, and burgers.  I was told by the staff that their most popular items are their jumbo pretzels, bratwurst, and kabobs.  I like their affordable pricing -- not a single item over $10.I tried the following:Chicken bratwurst with spinach and feta ($6)Quinoa salad ($3) - black beans, corn, tomato, cilantro, lime vinaigrette, colored tortillasFried pickles ($3)Cinn-A-Yum pretzel ($5) - jumbo pretzel covered in cinnamon & sugar, w/ vanilla icing on the sideComplimentary sauerkraut and sauteed peppers and onions are available for any bratwurst or hot dog order upon request.  I had sauerkraut put on my chicken brat.  I also had it served in VBGB's housemade pretzel bun, so I ended up with a very unique brat.  It wasn't a pork brat and it wasn't served in a typical bun.It didn't take very long for the food to arrive from the kitchen.  The brat was freshly grilled and the bun was freshly toasted.  The brat was large, but I wouldn't consider it jumbo.  The meat was juicy and seasoned well.  I could taste the spinach and feta, but the flavors were subtle.  The sauerkraut wasn't bad.  As for the bun, it definitely tasted like and almost had the consistency of a pretzel.The quinoa salad was good.  It was served with a side of hard, colored tortillas.  I could have done without the tortillas and more quinoa.  The quinoa salad was healthy and refreshing.  It was served in a small paper tray.The fried pickles were served piping hot.  They came with a side of dipping sauce, which I didn't try.  The fried pickles were good enough on their own.  I recommend sharing this side as it's a bit greasy.The Cinn-A-Yum pretzel is the dessert spin on VBGB's jumbo pretzel.  The pretzel is indeed jumbo and they coat it in a thick layer of cinnamon and sugar.  It's expectedly sweet and you even have the option of having it coated with vanilla, chocolate, caramel, or raspberry icing.  I had the (vanilla) icing served on the side and used it as a dip.  Due to their sheer size, I recommend sharing these pretzels too.Jessica was our server and she seemed pretty cool.  Very friendly, as were many of the staff.Overall, I had a good time at VBGB.  It had a nice relaxed and casual atmosphere and proved to be a good meeting place for a big group of friends.Trivia: VBGB stands for Very Big German Beer.My favorite part about this place: it's the only spot at the NC Music Factory that I can count on being open every day. If you come here and can't find something you enjoy, well the problem is you my friend. VBGB has a more than impressive beer selection (including a ton of local brews), great bar food, killer patio, and #allthegames. It's the perfect spot to grab drinks and eats before or after a show at the Amphitheatre/Fillmore/FountainPlaza/Comedy Zone. Don't like beer? They have a full bar. Don't enjoy bar food? Get a salad. First time ordering food here? You have to go to the kitchen window. Don't go to the bar. Every time I'm here i see someone make that mistake. They now serve lunch on Fridays. I tend to order too much food here. I'm not sure why I feel like I need a pretzel, dog or brat of some sort, and wings.  The beer cheese is delicious.The patio is massive and loaded picnic tables. You can even reserve a table. It's tented during the cool months. There's a window to order drinks so you don't have to go inside. A ton of things to do- sand volleyball courts, cornhole, oversized games. I always want to play giant chess, but I have no idea how to play chess. Parking is free. Heads up, you may have to park pretty deep in the lot on concert nights. Also, expect an Uber surge if you try to leave when one of these events end. Plan accordingly.

#106After trying a few other spots in town with no luck, we ended up at Katana Sushi & Grill.  I am glad we did.  I love sushi and am always looking for great sushi and have no problem that our previous dinner plans fell through.We arrived at what appeared to be "closing time" but this did not seem to phase the manger/owner of the establishment, as he warmly greeted our party and welcomed us to his sushi house.We loved the atmosphere.  It was beautifully decorated, very authentic with lovely Japanese music playing softly in the background.  The place seemed spacious, even though it was small--great decorator to supply that open feeling while being in such a small space. The menu was what you would expect at a sushi place with all the usual staples.  There were a few "special" offerings wherein you could order a larger portion of items or add small sides to your sushi choices, which was nice.  We always like to color outside the lines ;)After ordering and then enjoying about 10 rolls, some sashimi and nigiri we were about full.  We were staying in a hotel in the area so I really did not want to take sushi to go, but my partner did...so, anyway... I really loved the staff, the service and the freshness of the sushi.  If I am ever in Arizona again I will definitely try Katana Sushi & Grill again.Stephani Smiles for Katana Sushi & Grill ;)

WHAT.THE.HELL?!People always tell me about places they think I should check out and if I'm being completely honest, that list is getting so long, it'll be months before I work my way though the awesomness from Sun Prairie to Verona... there are just so many out there. BUT I have a running list, so keep them coming folks. Now when two people in the same week rave about a fish fry at a sandwich shop... A SANDWICH SHOP... one has to wonder: How good can it be? It's good folks. It's really flippin' good. It's so good I'm willing to say it's the best fish fry I've had in Madison, and I'm a little afraid to get fish fry anywhere else now.Tonight it was baked or fried walleye, hand breaded with your choice of German style potato salad or potato pancakes, the creamiest coleslaw you'll ever eat, a selection of Stalzy's breads and baked beans if you want to add those for a buck. I debated it, but decided against it, and I'm glad I did because holy cow it's a ton of food. Half a pound of breaded fried delicious fishy goodness. I can't even describe to you how flavorful the breading is. I know a lot of people think Stalzy's isn't shy on the salt, and I'd say the same for the breading, but honestly, how much flavor does fried fish really have? I say salt that bad boy! At $16 it's steep compared to what you'll find at Avenue or Toby's. Two of my other favorites in town. But honestly, the amount of food, the quality of the fish, the flavor, did I mention the shear amount of food? If it's nearing Friday put this place on your list. So damn good.It took us many years before we encountered this little gem in Atwood neighborhood. I have little knowledge about Jewish deli so it took us a while to figure what to order. I really appreciate that the staff explained the menu to us with great patience. They make bread, corned beef, pastrami and sausages themselves and provide the meat to other restaurant in town. You can also purchase bread or meat to go. We had "Brooklyn Breakfast" (beef pastrami sandwich) and a Challah French Toast. Very delicious. Quite a refreshing taste from other more regular brunch places. The portion is a bit small, though. People in our group had Stalzy's bloody Mary. Pretty fancy. Apparently they are quite good that a friend of us ordered a second one. I hope to return sometime in the future to try out Saltzy's non-brunch food. Note: Cash only. Seat yourself before your order.Ignore everything I said in my earlier review and go get breakfast today!(Seriously!) The sandwich joint with Madison's best fish fry also serves incredible breakfast!And it really doesn't matter what you get... potato pancakes, Challah French toast, corned beef hash... it's all going to be good and it's all served ALL DAY!

It is with a heavy heart that I write this update, but when food poisoning occurs it is one strike you're out with me. Boyfriend and I ordered take out of drunken noodles with chicken and basil stir fry with chicken. The chicken tasted a bit off to me and luckily I didn't have much of an appetite that evening. Boyfriend unfortunately was not so lucky and ended up with food poisoning. He was up several hours later throwing up and doing everything you would associate with food poisoning. I felt a bit queasy with an upset stomach, but did not consume enough to really get sick. I threw out the leftovers as soon as I woke up, but the food had stunk up the entire fridge by then. I guess we will be defaulting to Penn's.This was actually not good at all, but Thai food is Thai food so I'm bumping it a star. I was really sick and wanted to eat some majorly spicy food to clear out my sinuses. I ordered my drunken noodles a 4 out of 4, and drove to pick it up. When I took a bite, it was probably a 0 spice level. It not only had no heat, it had no flavor really at all, plus the noodles were in these massive clumps. The portion was small, but it was only a $7 lunch special. Thai spice is always a gamble but I was seriously needing the spice this particular day and Naga couldn't deliver. I don't think I will waste my time trying it again.Mangoes are in season...right?!The moment they are, my boyfriend & I immediately think of Naga's mango & sticky rice dessert. If you haven't tried it, you aren't missing much. That's a lie, you'll be missing the focal point of this whole review! Don't read any more till you've tried it. Wait. Finish reading, then head over there. You need to know what to have before dessert.What have we tried? A little bit of everything...Salad RollsChicken SatayCrab Rangoons (fresh crab)Moo Ping w/ Sticky RiceTom Yum soupPapaya SaladCatfish DynamiteLemongrass ChickenPad ThaiEvil Jungle NoodlesThai Fried RiceYellow CurryBasil Stir-FryPra RamAnd of course... Mango & Sticky Rice for dessert. Yes, you say you've had it at many Thai restaurants. Naga does an AMAZING job, as they do with all their dishes. We've never sent anything back, their food presentation is gorgeous, and so tasty. A special note about their peanut sauce, try it. You won't regret it...Located in a strip mall off W Horizon Ridge Pkwy & W Horizon Dr close to the 95, there's lots of eateries close by. They offer lunch specials Tuesday-Saturday from $7.75, served with house salad and soup. You ever thought corn soup made at a Thai place would be delicious? It is, and I'm not even a soup person!We've eaten there numerous times (as you can tell by my long list of food I've tried) and called in phone orders to-go. The staff is VERY friendly! At one lunch w/ Terri R, they were willing to place an order to arrive promptly as she sat down, so we didn't have to waste her short lunch hour ordering and waiting.I have noticed is at times, the food does take a bit long to come out. Usually, I'd deduct a star for this, as I'm one to get very grouchy waiting for food when I'm hungry. However, the quality of food I taste and the good service otherwise makes me forgive the wait. Let's just say it's a 4.5 rounded up to 5 stars. I still always look forward to my next visit.P.S. Their spice level is 1-4, interestingly. I don't know why, and I always forget to ask. They're also very vegetarian-friendly!Uh.....one question.What the hell happened to Naga?It's been a late night work and personal wise for my family and I, and we had not come up with a dinner idea. Needless to say, at 845, I did not feel like starting to cook dinner.I looked on their website, and they stated that they do their last seating at 930. Perfect, we will arrive there before that.We walk in, and there are four other parties dining. It does take one girl a considerable amount of time to even notice us come through the door...which is pretty interesting to me, because when the door is opened, you hear all the traffic and noise from the yogurt place next door. We almost considered seating ourselves.The girl (that we have never seen before) hands us our menus and walks away. Doesn't offer us water.... silverware, or even a napkin. We are approached by a different girl (also one that we have never seen before) she takes our drink order. My guy ordered a beer, and I ordered a soda. She comes back with the soda (that's flat) and informs us that they are out of beer. We ask for water and extra ice. Only one water comes, so, I guess I'll just suck on these ice cubes.We order, and she asks how we want it "put in". I couldn't even understand her...she was mumbling something about food speed. My guy just said, what ever is quicker. We had asked for just one bowl of their chili sauce to go with their crunchies that they serve... I mean, the four little spaces on the combined plate is cute, but you can't accomplish scooping any up.Well, we wait over fifteen minutes for water, refills, and crunchies. No one comes by to check on us, they are in their own little world. The other party still dining actually had to walk up to their counter, with their glass, and physically ask for a refill..... I mean, seriously? My guy wanted to get up and walk out....why Pay to be ignored...? I convinced him to stay.Our food, appetizer, came out. But we still didn't have any silverware, or napkins. I guess my guy was supposed to eat his curry with his hands..We re ask for water, and our crunchies with sauce. We ask the original girl who seated us if we could have silverware and napkins. She said sure......she never brought us any.Our "waitress" did end up bringing us 2 forks, and 2 napkins. The paper ones, that is. I looked around and saw that other tables had black cloth napkins (used). So, we got one paper napkin for the two of us and our baby. Gee thanks, but I wipe my buns with more paper than this....(sorry if that's TMI).The food, was good. I've had better at Naga personally..... I've been able to clear my plate before...and this time I left about half. Something was missing. I was too tired and it was getting too late to even ask for a manager. Our daughter had been good the entire meal time, up until the check came. I just knew that it was in my family's best interest to fill out their little opinion card, and be on our way.The girl who sat us was bringing in their chalkboard sign when we were leaving.Did she say "goodbye" or "thanks" or even a "go to hell".... Nope, not a single word. This staff was so rude, clueless and they should be trained.

I'm really leaning towards gelato over ice cream these days.  I just love the creamy consistency.  I also feel like that you don't have to receive a hearty helping (although I do love generous scoops!) to feel satisfied.  You really don't have to worry about not finding your fav flavor because they've got TONS of different flavors to choose from!  And it's not just vanilla and chocolate...it's creative combo's like caramel latte, dark chocolate cherry and coconut cream just to name a few.  I opted for the Amaretto because I can't seem to not choose it when it's available.  I just love that flavor....and it translated perfectly into gelato too!  The absolute only thing I could even complain about, and it's not really complaining, just something I thought was odd...was that they measure out your gelato and you pay by ounce.  I get it when you're getting self serve (like at yogurt places) but when you're not helping yourself, it's just weird.  I suppose if you came in and had only $3 dollars to your name and the total range up at $3.01 they could lop off a little. But I guess it could also work in your favor if you wanted more or less.  I'm pretty sure it's now gonna be my mission to try all the different types of flavors....because they all looked so gosh darn good!In every scoop of Mercurios Gelato there are over 13+ years of research, study, testing, obsession and love in their dozens of freshly made daily offerings.  Mrs. Mercurio and her husband took endless culinary workshops and university courses studying every aspect of ice cream and gelato production and you can experience the fruits of their labor in every taste.  They recently added pizza to their offerings.The Mercurio's son trained at an authentic Sicilian pizza shop and they had an italian pizza oven imported to give an authentic product.   While many rave about the pizza at piccolo forno in lawrenceville, I found Mercurios to be much more authentic (and delicious) compared to the pizza I had in Italy.  The pizza dough is paper thin and savory (almost like crepes) the toppings are all fresh, generously administered and the crust is perfectly crispy.The raw brick walls and black and white photos of italy complement the atmosphere and the staff were all extremely friendly and enthusiastic.  I'm not normally a huge Gelato or Pizza fan, but Mercurio's does not offer normal gelato or pizza.  They are the finest example of both I've tasted in Pittsburgh, I look forward to many more happy meals and desserts here, Mercurios has made me a believer!I tried Mercurio's gelato at the big Yelp Tech Shop event in 2013, and I was impressed.  Now that it's only a mile away, I think we're going to have a beautiful relationship.My dad loves gelato, and when I first tested this place out, I told him he had to try it.  Being the wonderful daughter I am, we hiked South Negley to get over to Walnut street.  The gelato is around $.71/ounce, and they have three different size cups.  The employees are really great about listening to how much you want too, which is nice.I love the mint chocolate chip, lime, and tiramisu!  All safe choices.  Make sure to sample flavors if you aren't sure what you want.The pizza is also delicious.  The white pizza ($11) is good, but the prosciutto pizza ($14) is my favorite.  These pizzas are personal sized, but I could split one with a friend and order gelato for a full meal.The only downside to this place is that the service is pretty eh at the tables.  Not bad but not good either.I tried Mercurio's gelato two years ago and, more recently, at the Yelp Burgh Bash this past Sept., and I finally had the chance to stop by for dinner last Sat.  Based on my experience with the gelato and what I'd heard from Yelp and elsewhere, I was eager to try Mercurio's savory offerings.My dining partner and I shared a house salad (insalata de la casa), as well as a prosciutto pizza.  (Thanks for the great recommendation, fellow Yelpers!)  The house salad consisted of spring greens, tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and parmesan dressed with balsamic vinaigrette dressing, and included two pieces of toasted Italian bread.  I found the salad to be quite fresh and flavorful, and large enough for two people to share comfortably.  In terms of flavor, I found the pizza to be quite solid, with the prosciutto being the standout, with just the right amount of smokiness and saltiness.  It also hid a few key shortcomings, such as a sparser-than-preferable amount of cheese, quite effectively.  If you've read my reviews of other pizza places around PGH, you'll know that the aspect of pizza that I tend to be persnickety about is the crispness of the crust. While the crust was light and airy, which was great, it unfortunately lacked the key crispness on the bottom that's essential to a perfect pizza, in my view.  Nevertheless, I was generally pretty satisfied with the quality of the pizza, esp. compared to other wood-fired pizza places around town.Needless to say, after finishing the savory portion of our meal, my dining partner and I had to order the gelato, since that's what Mercurio's is best known for.  I had a small, which I split between mint chocolate chunk (my favorite!) and triple chocolate, and my dining partner had a medium, split between chocolate and caramel.  The gelato was just as delectable as I remembered, with satisfying creaminess and flavors.While the ambiance was a bit minimalist, I didn't mind. My one complaint about the layout was that the dining area was quite small and could feel a bit cramped at times.  (At one point, we had to move our table over a bit so that our neighbors could squeeze through.)  I found the service to be a slower than I'd like, but this was probably due to there being only one waitress responsible for serving all of the dining tables.  Even one more waiter probably would have sped things up and reduced the stress on her significantly.  Overall, despite a couple of shortcomings, I had a pleasant experience dining at Mercurio's, and would definitely return.I first experienced Mercurio's at various yelp events and was always impressed by their gelato. Now that I work in Shadyside, I knew I had to stop by! I have been here about 3 times in the past month- yes I am a little obsessed.Let's start with dessert first... the gelato.. is amazing! It's some of the best I have ever had. After trying it the first time, I was head over heels in love. My parents and I were in Lawrenceville, craving ice cream on Mother's Day, and the one place that popped in my head was this place. We came and they LOVED it. I think the blueberry muffin is my favorite... it's incredible. I also really enjoyed the strawberry cheesecake. My parents couldn't stop raving about their choices as well.  My dad was impressed with the brick oven and went over to talk to the employees about it. They were super friendly to my dad and very welcoming. They recommended that he try the sausage pizza with extra sausage and extra cheese and my dad could not resist. Which leads me to......the food. Yummmm. The pizza that was recommended to my dad was incredible and he loved it. He could not stop raving about it and said that the leftovers were even better the next day. We recently just visited again and this time, I ordered my own pizza. I kept it simple, ordering the Bianca (white pizza with tomatoes and basil). It was awesome- light, with a perfect fluffy crust. The flavors were fresh and just delicious. My mom ordered the ensalata con portabella- wow... the portabellas were prepared perfectly! The dressing was light and full of flavor. My dad ordered the italiano panini, which was epic. Perfect amount of meat, bread, cheese and sauce... I was surprised with how much I loved it.This place is the whole package. Located right on Walnut Street, it's the perfect place for a date night or casual lunch. Service was great all three times I have visited as well. I can't wait to return.

Review Text :
If I could define my life in terms of food, it would be defined with "Cacio e Pepe." Minimalistic and open to interpretation.  Cacio e Pepe sounds easy enough to prepare. Black peper, Pecorino, parmesan, olive oil, butter, salt to taste and pasta. Once complete, this is a symphony of flavors that makes even an amateur chef look like Mozart.  From the look of East Side Pizza, you think "typical pizza joint." And for the majority, you are right. But when it comes to pasta, man, even Scarpetta can take lessons from this typical joint. $24 for spaghetti with tomato and basil by Scott Conant ?? How about $6 for Cacio e Pepe of equal calibre by mysterious chef at East Side Pizza. AND it comes with a house salad!! Or Tortellini with chicken cooked to perfection! Let's just say the pasta dishes are so good, I forgot this place serves pizza. I hope this is not a fluke but I will be dining here quite frequently for lunch and dinner.Great little place with inexpensive prices. They have quite a few lunch and dinner specials that were great prices. I ordered the two slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $5.99. Not bad for two very large slices of pizza and a refillable drink. The pizza is really good. Thin and simple. The slice kept well too. I only ate one for lunch and saved the other for later when I got home and it was still flavorful and tasty. Service was friendly and efficient. I was interested in some of their pastas. I will have to come by another time to check out their dinner specials or some of their lunch pasta specials.I have stopped in before for the lunch special with 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. That was good and the right price at just over $6 and change. This visit I phoned my order for pick up and wanted to try a sandwich and pizza with toppings. I ordered a "Bambino" which is their version on a meatball parm. It cost $8.99 and was terrible. The bread, sauce and cheese were good but the meatballs were very tough. I don't know if it was just an off day but I wouldn't ever order anything with meatballs here again. The sandwich did come with a side salad that I enjoyed. The pizza I ordered is called "The Fenway" and has sausage, green bell peppers and onions for toppings. The pizza was just so-so. The crust wasn't able to hold the toppings well. It was $21.99 for the large pizza. Almost $35 for a pizza and sandwich after tax is way too pricey when it doesn't even taste that great. I will stick to stopping by for the lunch special since that is a good deal and tasty. Service is good and the inside is clean. I noticed a sign that said they offer catering services. They also offer delivery.I went to this place on the recommendation of a friend. If you look at my reviews over the past, you'll see that no one enjoys a good pizza as much as myself. I found the place quite easily. It is in Boca Park along with a number of other restaurants. Parking was easy. When I went in, I was a little confused as I saw a sign that said "Order Here". So i did. They do have a dining area. I asked the girl working there if they had table service, and she told me that they did on Friday through Sunday... but if you sat at a table, they wouldn't leave you hanging. Well, I ordered right there! Needless to say, I had one of my favorite foods! PIZZA!! Now having worked my way through school working in a pizza place, I'd like to think that I'm a pretty good judge of pizza. I ordered a Pepperoni, Mushroom, Bacon, Kalamata Olive (Unusual but excellent ingredient!) and extra cheese. Now for most pizzas, this presents a problem. The problem is, too much oil, making the pizza soggy. The pizza was brought to the table, suggesting that they really will not leave you hanging! And it was prepared perfectly. The crust was solid!!! Thin crust, excellent flavor. The cheese actually tasted like mozzarella cheese, unlike some of the cheese you may get from a chain. I ordered a medium thinking it would be lots, and I might have a slice or two to take back to the hotel. (I was in Vegas on business). BUT NO... This pizza was huge for a medium. I stuffed myself on 4 slices and was only able to take 2 of the remaining 4 back with me! All of the ingredients were very tasty. It was possible to taste each one!! I watched the pizza chef as he made the pizza. I was impressed with the way he kept an eye on the oven, moving pizzas around the oven to attain the best overall consistency! And it was cooked perfectly. I talked to the girl before I left and I asked her about the ingredients they used... I can't help thinking that this has GOT to be one of the best NY Pizzas in Vegas! They actually bring their dough in from NY. (After all, how else do you get NY water into your mix?) I gave them a five! The ambience is okay. The people were great. The seating area is quite roomy... but the food was excellent! It's a bit of the drive from the strip, but well worth the trip!! I'll certainly be making it again. One of the better pizzas I have savored in my history of pizza consumption!!Had a large group of 40 kids and adults in town for a soccer tournament. Made a reservation in advance and communicated with Candace prior to our arrival. We ordered everything from pizza to salads to many different pasta entrees. Everyone was satisfied and enjoyed the food. Service was excellent. They had all the food  served within about 15 minutes of our arrival. They even, at my odd request, went and bought a full sheet cake to celebrate a few birthdays we had.  Everything was just perfect.After a very long day and not wanting to cook dinner, I walked right over here after my sons hair cut. If you show them your receipt from Sports Cuts, you get 10% off your order.I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and it was delicious. The pizza itself was bigger than the normal chain pizzas and smelled very wonderful. It was nothing but cheesy goodness drizzled in sauce. I couldn't wait to get home and dig in. It was calling my name the entire drive home. Now, I have a dog at home. She knows to stay away from the table when we're eating but was hovering over us the entire time at dinner, then she finally jumped up and snatched the pizza right out of my hand. I guess she wanted some of the deliciousness too. We didn't have any leftovers after we were done since my boys loved it that much. We will definitely be back.

Review Text :
On January 4, twenty of my friends and I had a dinner at Humble Pie on 7th Street.Two days before the date, I spoke to someone who took my original reservation for 15 w/o any problems. I also informed her that we will want separate checksI'm sure, to which she said that it wouldn't be a problem. On 1/4 around 2 p.m.., I called again to confirm the reservation at 5 p.m. and also informed the guy on the other line that the reservation will now be for 20 not 15. He said it wouldn't be a problem, but noticed that the note on the reservation said "separate checks." He then said that Humble Pie CANNOT do separate checks for groups of 8+ because that's their policy. I wish that I was given the correct information when I first called because that would've changed my decision to have the dinner there. Some of my guests were just going to stop by and not stay long for dinner. At that point, it was too late to find a place and inform all 20 guests of the change, so I stuck with it. But for the record, I was already annoyed that a staff member did not know an important restaurant policy that should've been ingrained from the firstday of training. The reasoning I was given for the "one check policy" was: "You only have one server for the evening...". That sounded like a recipe for poor customer service.Well, that's pretty much what we got that evening.1. As a guest was finishing up his Kiltlifter, he noticed that there was a piece of "ice" at the bottom of the glass, which he thought was odd for beer. As he got the piece of "ice" in his mouth, he realized it was a piece of broken glass. Luckily, my guest is so even-keeled that when he informed our waitress that evening of the broken glass, he didn't make a big fuss and just told the waitress to inform the bartender in case there are other shards lying around. She said that earlier in the day, a glass or two did break/shatter and the piece was probably one of the remnants. My other friend then got worried and checked her Kiltlifter from the bottom and noticed that the bottom of her pint glass was cracked. The incident was clearly NOT the waitresses' fault and she quickly told us that both beers will not be charged. My guests were grateful and they each received another pint of Kiltlifter. Luckily, my guest didn't order a diet Coke first, which is his usual, because if he had, he wouldn't have even seen that piece of glass coming, and probably sucked on it like ice. But he didn't make a fuss because well, sh*t happens.2. Then the SAME guest ordered his burger with no cheese because of dairy allergies. Everyone ordered pizza or wings. People got their food served, but an HOUR AND A HALF after he placed his order, he still hadn't gotten his burger. Again, the waitress was apologetic but at that point he didn't want the burger. You would think that they'd give him extra attention after the glass incident, but no. He didn't say anything because that isn't his personality and he knew that I would be upset. And since it was my birthday dinner he didn't make a fuss to ruin the evening. Some of my guests asked for water and that was a little difficult to get, too. 3. After all this inconvenience, we were hoping that they could honor our request for separate checks. But there were inconsistencies--some were granted that request and then some were not. Frustrating! To be honest, she was good for the most part doing her job solo. She probably would've gotten a 20+% gratuity anyway from each of the guestNow imagine this concept, if there were maybe  2 servers or maybe 1 1/2 servers for our party, the poor service wouldn't have happened. One of them would've noticed that while everyone else was eating, one guest wasn't. Our waitress was not only waiting on our tables but other tables as well.Humble Pie, look at it from our perspective: my guest, who sucked on a piece of broken glass and was not served his burger (but instead a consolation pepperoni pizza, which, according to the waitress, was ordered but she can't figure out who ordered it, but it didn't matter anyway because my guest is allergic to dairy) was forced to pay part of the gratuity that was included in the bill. For bad service.And we're not faulting the waitress, who was working her a** off that evening, we fault poor management. I think you've done her a disservice because she seems awesome, but physically, you can only do so much. I've supported this establishment when it was The Living Room and I wanted to support  Humble Pie because I support local. Sometimes good food is not enough.  Anyone can get "good food" anywhere and they are plentiful out there, but selling an experience is an art. I'm not complaining because I'm asking for compensation or a freebie. But I am asking you to consider how you manage the restaurant.Good Pizza and great service!!The date dinner for two special is great for its value, available on Thursdays after 6:00 pm!!! It included an entree, two salads and one pizza of your choice!!! Enough food for two!!! :) The garlic french fries were bomb!!!! Deliciously seasoned. As for our friend, the birthday boy, he had pepperoni pizza and that by itself was great, better than our BBQ Chicken pizza I would say!! Fun place, great service, AWESOME YOUNG MAN SERVING!!! :) We came here with a group of 12 and were seated urgently and smoothly!! :) Oh and the Pomegranate Martini was Oh soo Great!!! A must try, a bit strong, but that's how I like them!! :)Everyone in this town, including me has become a self proclaimed  pizza critic.  Humble Pie, Pizza Bianco, Cibo, and the Parlor are eveolving Phoenix into a serious Pizza city.  Those who enjoy brick oven pizza this is a must.  And those who just eat delivery pizza must come to grips that Pizza Hut's HQ is not in Italy.  Food:The heart of the house is right in the dinning area, a wood fire brick oven. And ladies, were talking real wood here.   They make the pizzas right in front of you, how fun see.Quick note, they do a great job with non pizza items, and a fun kids menu. Service:this is a pizza joint right,  rule number one for amateurs, don't get antsy pansy because things take time on the weekends, this place gets crowded. Why well probably because Humble Pie has created a popular brand.   I like personal service, most the time your server takes care of you from start to finish and i like that.  I think restaurants like Humble Pie have given new life to the 7th St. Phoenix restaurant district.  Im glad to see the 85006 zip code continuously attracting more restaurant owners.  The Phoenix area is building up and keeping growing businesses a shot at success.  Happy Pizza,Kevin U.The good: Amazing daily happy hours with pepperoni (or cheeese) pizzas for $7, and quite a few appetizers for even less. Beers like Four Peaks Raj run for $3, with some cocktails for $5. Seating is stylish and comfortable, and service is good.The bad: The fries looked good on paper, looked good in person, but were way too salty. The equally salty aioli didn't help. The pizza was alright...I'm a huge fan of the sauce they use, and the cheese was totally legit. The crust left much to be desired...it was a bit too thick and crunchy toward the edges...not the texture you want from a wood-fired pie. The ugly: During normal hours, they charge as much for their specialty pizzas ($15) as some of the valley's most coveted pizza parlors, but are clearly not in the same league. This is a strip mall chain that wants to compete your favorite gourmet/Neapolitan locale, but at least needs better dough to come close. It's great for a quick lunch, or some day drinking with your pals, but if you want a sit down pizza place for dinner, you can do better. Much better.

Review Text :
Some of the BEST Mexican Food in the Valley and close to work. Reminds me of what I get when I am in San Diego. Been eating here at least twice a week for the last year and it is always tasty. They have take out, drive through, indoor and outdoor seating if you want. Always very clean inside and out. Family owned and run. They take great pride in delivering fantastic fresh favors with large portions for an affordable price. They have several combo plates with rice and beans on the menu or you can just order a la cart which I prefer. Tacos, Burritos, Tortas, Cheese Crisp, Nachos, Fish and Shrimp dishes, Authentic Soups, Soda Pops, and Deserts. Too many items to list them all here. Some of my favorites would be the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, chile rellenos, carnitas, carne asada, fajitas, al pastor, breakfast burritos of all sorts. They are very friendly and will make what ever you want pretty much. Great Salsa Bar also with fresh hot carrots and jalapenos, cucumbers, limes / lemons, and 4 different salsas. Simplemente fantástico!Taquitos Jalisco serves up Mexican street food common to the state of Jalisco.  You might be more familiar with the state capital city, Guadalajara.  This particular restaurant has a "sister" property on Gilbert Road that I've heard has better tasting food than this location.  Hmmm... I may have to find out!  as this was very good Mexican street food!  There's a bandwagon forming for Taquitos Jalisco and it's making stops in Mesa!Let me jump on the bandwagon for a ride too!  I missed the Yelper Lunch UYE here in April, but I scheduled my lunch group to go here this month.  I'd heard from Robyn N and Rand H that the place was small, but had no idea that by small they meant TINY!  The international lunch group that I organize was about 14 deep for lunch!  We were smart enough to arrive early.  Every table was taken once we got in the door.  Thankfully, it was not terribly hot outside and the tables outside were still open.  We gladly occupied those tables under the shade with the roar of the traffic on Broadway whizzing by.I sat next to my buddy Dawn K and we split our food!  I ordered 3 carne asada Tacos and 2 Tamales.  I will say that I was disappointed with the Tacos.  The carne asada was a little dry for me.  But still tasty enough to enjoy.  The tamales were fantastic!  I split one of my tamales with the entire group so that everyone could get a taste.  But I saved the other for myself for lunch the next day!  Dawn K ordered a platter with 3 things on it.  Enchilada, Taco and a Chile Relleno.  I tried some of her Chile Relleno!  The chile relleno was extremely good.  It was my favorite thing that I tasted.  I did not try it, but one lunch'er raved about the fish tacos and Robyn N also said their fish tacos were very good.  A slip of the brain as I would have ordered that instead of the carne asada taco.Everyone in the group was happy, even the vegetarian lunch'er was happy with his veggie burrito!  Score!  This place is worth stopping in and trying.   Remember, this is definitely a DIVE!  The parking lot is also very small.  It is on the north side of the street.  Pay attention.  The building is so small, you will likely drive past it and miss the turn.Fellow Yelpers - Thank You!I followed your recommendations and stopped here to eat.  It was good!We ordered 1 quesadilla. #3 (3 red enchiladas) and #17 (red enchilada, chili Relleno and taco).  All were good.Rice and beans... Also good.I recommend eating here!Hoooooooo shitttttt.This place. Lemme tell you a bit about this place. You walk in. At first you think that you look like you don't belong here. But you do. 'Cause this place sells love. And I don't mean sex. I mean taco love. Taco love is a sacred kind of love. If you don't know about taco love, take a knee; I'm gonna tell you allllll about it. You start off with the carnitas. The deliciously grilled, perfectly seasoned, slightly smokey goodness of pork that just wants to be wrapped up in a tortilla and put in your mouth. While you're at it, throw in some camarones (that's shrimp for all you non-españoles). They have the tastiest saucy glaze of goodness all up in there. Cooked just right. If it were pasta, I'd have to say al dente. Then check out a little grilled steak or maybe a little al pastor. Throw a cucumber on your grilled steak if you're into that kinda thing... This is taco lovin'; everyone is different... Go ahead, get a little freaky with it. Oh and did I mention that they give you sweet, caramelized, big ole onions to do whatever with? I didn't. But now I just did. I say put them on your carne asada taco, but hey that is just the way I like to experience some down south taco love. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say these are better than the street tacos in Rocky Point. Yes. I said it. The horchata is choice. Primo. ¡Excellente!They have menudo and other stews that are served all day.They grill the meat out back.The salsa bar is fresh. The girls at the counter like to dance and have a good time, of course after they give you great service and what not. I could scrounge enough change (~$1.30) (!!!!!!!) to buy a taco in about two min outside of safeway - not my thing, but it could be! Huevos rancheros served all day too. Imagine that. Breakfast whenever. The cherry on top: you get the nice mexican jazz party music playing in the background too. None of that mexican country crap. The real stuff. The jams.And that there is taco love. You finish up and leave. With a belly full of love. You should go here. Get some taco lovin'. Write a little yelp review about it and let the world know how good you feel.  This is the kinda love that people go to war for.Oh and those spicy carrots from the salsa bar were not very flavorful. I dunno what it was, but they were missing something major. Ok, now I'm done. See ya!Simply Great! Diverse menu. Salsa bar. Seating indoors and out. Gum ball machines. Friendly staff. Low prices. Quick. Tasty food. Kids meals. Everything you could possibly need, assuming you don't need white table cloths.Taquitos Jalisco does look a bit sketchy from the outside, but the interior is actually quite nice. Come on in! The restroom could use a remodel, but that's my only criticism. No big thing. They do charge 50 cents for the use of credit and debit cards, but that's a small price to pay for keeping the menu prices so low.A "go to" Mexican spot if you're in the area of Broadway & Alma School or Extension.

Review Text :
O Frenchy's; Love that spicy sauce!At the behest of a trusted source of hot dog deliciousness, I was convinced to give Frenchy's a shot at the title of 'worlds best dog'.I really enjoyed the spicy sauce that makes his Caribbean Dogs worthy of competition for a top billed dog. Frenchy is a great guy and was a pleasure to chat with, he'll brighten up your day with just a few short minutes at his cart! If you're bold and don't mind a kick to your taste buds every once in a while, tell him you want it spicy and he'll kick it up with that awesomely hot, peppery concoction.While I can't say I loved this hot dog, it definitely is one of my top picks, just behind number one. Over all, my lunch was spicilly delicious and I ended up with the hiccups to prove it.That caribbean sauce, IMO, is good enough to bottle and sell - I'd definitely buy a bottle or two. Lunch behind the AZ republic building on 2nd street and taylor is all the better because of Frenchy and his fine caribbean flavors.Happy Yelping Phoenix!

Review Text :
I came by for lunch with a guest speaker yesterday.  Upon being seated, we were given some menus predominantly in Chinese, with English glosses.  My guest asked if there was a lunch menu, and our waitress explained that usually, there is, but because it was a holiday, they weren't offering it.  We weren't thrilled about this, but okay, fine.  I asked for the Cuban menu, and the waitress handed me a menu still predominantly Chinese, but with an insert containing Cuban fare.I ordered the cuban sandwich, and my guest ordered the lamb hot pot.  The dishes came out about 10 min. after ordering them, which seemed about right.  Since I've never had a Cuban sandwich before, I have to offer the disclaimer that I don't have a standard of judgment.  Having said that, I found it quite pleasant in flavor, texture, and crispness, and a decent portion for $6.99 (this seems to be about the going rate for sandwiches these days).  Given the dearth of Cuban restaurants in PGH, if you have a craving for this type of cuisine and live in Oakland, this is one of the few convenient places you can satisfy it.  (The only other one I know of is in Lawrenceville.)  I can't comment on the quality of my guest's hot pot, since it's rather impolite to ask to share at professional lunches.  He commented that it was kind of salty, and that the lamb tasted like beef, but that it was otherwise pretty decent.Based on the decor, menus, and ethnicity of the employees, this seems to be predominantly a Chinese restaurant, and that the Cuban portion seems to be somewhat of a side business.  In the hour or so that my guest and I spent here having lunch, all of the other customers I saw were East Asian.  Given that there are several other Asian restaurants on Oakland St. north of Forbes, I take this as a sign that the Chinese cuisine here is fairly genuine, and it certainly seemed so from my guest's meal.  I'll have to return at some point to try the Chinese cuisine served here--when I do, I'll write a review under the Chinese name of this restaurant (Hunan Bar).Other than the primary focus on Chinese food, my other major criticism concerns the service.  Especially towards the end of the meal, my guest and I had trouble attracting our waitress's attention to get the check and pay.  Indeed, once we'd paid, my guest opted to just leave the check on the table, rather than wait for the waitress to pick it up.  Even before that, however, our waitress wasn't very helpful or sociable.  If the service improved, this rating would be a solid 3.5, if not a 4, but as it were, I'm going with an even 3 stars.EDIT: My labmate claims that this place used to be a Cuban restaurant before the current owners took it over, hence the Chinese/Cuban combination.

Review Text :
I gotta admit...I had mediocre expectations for Italian Pie...but they were completely put to rest after last night's meal! Hooray for good 'za. Give me a thin, crispy, garlic dusted crust and a tasty pie and I'm hooked. We met some friends here early on a Monday evening and not only had some great food, but really solid and friendly service too. The beer and wine list is decent - although I be they could add a few more local beers on tap in time. The interior hasn't changed too much since Sole - similar layout, yet cozy. Here are a few things I snacked on last night with a table of friends...Fried cheese sticks: 2/5: A bit unremarkable overall. The cheese was *fine* and marinara dipping sauce had a nice flavor to it but it was very thin. And two out the six cheese sticks were without cheese. Yep, just fried fakers. Garlic cheese bread: 5/5: Um, hello lover. This little app came out as a tiny cheese pizza pie drizzled with (what I assume to be) garlic oil. It was hot and cheesy and garlicky and damn delicious. Margherita pizza: 4.5/5: Our server recommended this pie and I ordered it with trepidation...I say it that way because margherita pies tend to be pretty bland. But oh no, not this pie. It was packed full of flavor - plenty of pepper, garlic, two types of cheese, fresh tomato and that really perfect crust. My only tiny ish? It was fairly greasy underneath - but no worries, I'll blot that right off. Go go flavor explosion. Get ye some pizza and try out Italian Pie...delizioso!

I expected to find great pizza when we visited New York, but Arizona? Ironically, we had better pizza in Arizona than in New York, thanks in large part to Taste of Italy Numero Dos. Our friends live two blocks away and are enthusiastic about this place. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?userid=fDny65qdxn3EJH0PZbCxIwWe got takeout:* Half Caprese Pizza (Fresh Homemade Mozarella, Tomato Sauce, Fresh Garlic, Fresh Basil, Pecorino Romano & Freshly Sliced Tomatoes) - I didin't see tomatoes, but I didn't hold it against them. I think we may have gotten the Margherita instead. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=k6KdshrFJ1aX3_c36fHtpw* Half Cheese Pizza* Meat Lovers (Pepperoni, Meatball, Sausage, Ham, Bacon, Extra Cheese) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=ZS6DxijAx51SqPI-4ZY7qg* Salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=-zSvKvsXY6-Ih7KYhuGDNwThe fresh homemade mozzarella on the caprese (or margherita) was fantastic. That, the tangy sauce, and the fresh basil elevated the pizza to the elusive 5 star status. The crust was a little chewier than I prefer, but this is truly one of the best pizzas I've had (and yes, I've been to Italy).The cheese pizza was delicious and well-balanced, adult and kid-friendly. Mr. L and our friends enjoyed the meat lovers special. The meat toppings were very generous. Our salad was fresh and tasty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=JLSU9y1uIHG-2QHJp-SbOQThis is a family-run business and our friends say the chefs are from Italy. I didn't confirm if they are from Italy, but the pizza sure tastes the way I think it should. On our next visit to Goodyear, I will be happy to return.

Review Text :
What a disappointment.  Pittsburgh, explain your obsession with Pamela's to me now.  It makes no sense.  Pamela's is decent, though slightly pricey, for just diner food.You know how you can tell a place isn't worth your time?  When you and your friend are eating at Pamela's and can only discuss how good Murray Ave Grille's breakfast is.  Finally, you both admit you would rather be at the Grille.Lets start with the big issue:  The service SUCKS.  Apparently, the servers split their tips at the end of the shift.  So no one bothers to serve you.  One guy took our orders and brought drinks, and another girl dropped the food on the table.  No one asked if we needed anything, and no one bothered to check that the food was OK.  So...servers working a buffet do more work than the servers at Pamela's.I got the ham and cheese omelette, with the potatoes, and rye toast.  The actual breakfast was good diner breakfast.  There was a nice amount of cheese, this potato hater thought the potatoes were good, and the rye toast was fantastic.There is outdoor and indoor seating, which is nice.  The place is rather packed, though.Cash only.

Review Text :
Let's start with my first impression...this is one clean TMAD.  Probably the cleanest one that I've been to so far.  Now about their service.  Pretty good service too, not complaining at all.  Plus, I came in close to closing time.  Usually this is when you feel that you aren't welcome.  Not here, they still served with a smile. I only had their chicken breast and that's it.  No veggies, no rice, and no sides.  Just your simple plain 8 oz of white chicken breast.  Hit the spot, plain so wasn't as tasty, and needed something that will hold me for at least the next 3 hours. My meal with a drink was less than $8. I sometimes go Teriyaki Boy.  Usually when I have this exact meal, they automatically know to put my sauce on the side.  I got use to this and forgot to tell them here.  My chicken breast was drenched in Teriyaki sauce when I got it.  Really my fault and I will be sure to put in this request on my next visit to TMAD to put the sauce on the side.  Overall, my experience is pretty good.  In regards to the rest of their menu, there's a wide selection all centered around chicken (i.e. Katsu, T-Bowls, Dark Meat, White Meat, etc).  Their meals are tasty and in my opinion have the best Teriyaki sauce.I feel that a review update is needed on this specific Teriyaki Madness. I was recently here and had good food with bad service. I waited a long time for my food and dropped my rating to a 3 because of this.  Since that review, I've been contacted multiple times from the owner of Teriyaki Madness, Dean.  We spent a good 20 minutes talking about the business, but most importantly, what T-MAD was going to do to fix some of the issues.  Let me stress that the owner never asked me to change my review, was never defensive, and never attempted to bribe me.  This is all a good sign from a owner that cares about his customers.  Dean basically explained the cooking process to me, why the katsu taste the way it taste, and why my meal took longer than most.I actually learned some things from our conversation.  1.  The Katsu here is made out of real chicken breast, not minced pieces of chicken.  Because they're using chicken breast, the batter that's found at Hawaiian restaurants will not stick.  So, T-MAD uses one that's healtier and can stick to chicken breast. In other words, they didn't want to sacrifice health over taste.  2.  I usually order chicken breast with no sauce.  I had no idea that my order would take longer than everyone else because their chicken is marinated. When I order, they assume I didn't want marinade.  So, they would cook a new batch without marinade just for me.  Thus, why my meal took longer than everyone. 3.  I commented that the other T-MAD's tasted better.  He explained some of the possible reasons with one being the new equipment at this location. 4.  I learned that all gym-goers get a discount here.  I never seen this advertised and the employees never mentioned it.  Dean mentioned it though and I will make sure that I'm getting that discount moving forward.Dean felt that my review was fair and deserving.  He reviewed video of my last visit, addressed the issues with his employees, and even apologized for my recent experience. Bottom line, he recognized me as a regular at most of his locations and wanted to know to know that he valued my opinion about his business. Great job Teriyaki Madness!  You just brought a fan back.

Review Text :
Bienvenidos a Tacos Sahuaro - enjoy authentic Mexican street tacos without leaving Phoenix!The restaurant is nothing fancy, but it has plenty of seating inside and most importantly serves up delicious tacos for only $2 each. The tacos are made with with two freshly cooked tortillas, your choice of meat, chopped onions and cilantro. The tacos are also served with a selection of fresh veggies to cleanse the palate - sliced cucumber, picked carrots, onions, and jalapeños if you want to kick it up a notch. The green chile and red salsa were good, but not the best I've ever had. At the suggestion of other Yelpers, I tried the Al Pastor, Carne Asada, and the Carnitas Tacos. The three tacos were quite filling because they come double wrapped in two tortillas. The Carne Asada Taco didn't have a lot of flavor on its own - probably would've been good with some fresh guacamole - but the Al Pastor Taco was delicious! Also, if you order a Coca Cola be prepared for "un medio litro - that's half a liter! They didn't have Horchata when we visited, but they have a wide selection of Jarritos drinks (mango, tamarindo, lime).If you like street tacos, these are some of the best in town.  This is a hole in the wall taco joint with a limited menu with a major emphasize on the street taco.  I recommend the asada and al pastor tacos, they are both very flavorful.  I ordered 3 tacos at $2.00 ea. and was completely filled up.  Give them a try if you are in the area (Thomas / 32nd St.)

Flies everywhere up front. Seriously, at the bar, there must have been 20-30 buzzing around. Put up some damned flypaper, or get an air screen. Something.Horrible waitress. She poured my beer till it overflowed, then just let the foam settle, then handed it to me, without topping it off, or wiping the glass.We moved to a table, because we didn't want the flies to get in the wings we ordered.On the way to our table, the waitress dropped plate, which shattered, causing broken shards of plate to hit me in the face. Seriously. She didn't say a word.After we ate the wings, which were good enough to make me not hate having to give the one star, she came and asked if I wanted more water. I said no, I'm ok. She took my water! It wasn't empty, and I didn't ask her to remove it! WTF?!Also, the men's bathroom was in disrepair, and smelled awful. The toilet appeared to be non-functional, there were tools and parts all over the floor, no sign on the door indicating a problem, nothing.What a disaster that whole experience turned out to be! This place is definitely going on my "Never Return" list!

Zeke's is East Liberty's only commercial coffee roaster. I feel pretty comfortable saying that, but please correct me if I am wrong.First of all, the coffee is excellent. It is small batched roasted, I'm pretty sure right now he can only do 1 or 2 pounds at a time! I don't have the most discerning coffee palate, but this stuff is good... nothing like what your friend roasts in their air popper.They have brewed coffee (I can't remember for the life of me if he does espresso) in addition to 6-8 by-the-pound offerings that were extremely freshly roasted... my pound was still warm! Averages around $13/lb.The storefront is pretty no-nonsense bare bones, don't worry about tromping a little snow inside or bringing in your bike with you to grab your coffee.The proprietor (I forget his name) is extremely friendly and welcomes a chat. He'll also do custom roasts for you, no minimum I'm pretty sure, especially handy if you want a half decaf blend or the like. I recommend calling ahead if you have a large order, as well.Hours are hard to find online, but I posted a photo of what was on the door as of today.

So we were going inside the Rio from the parking garage and the first thing we see when we come in is the Burger King.... BAR? What.Is this real life?Only in Vegas- not even. Only in Rio Las Vegas!They have a couple beers, which I didn't get, but if you ask them, they'll totally tell you what it is.The Burger King is VERY limited- they make Whoppers. And double Whoppers. And breakfast.... and to my eye, that was about all they made. O_O So you don't get hamburgers, cheeseburgers, etc, unfortunately. Or whatever else BK has, because I haven't been to a BK in  so long. They DO have smoothies though!Ordered a whopper, tasted alright, cheaply made, of course :-/ They didn't put enough sauce, and so it felt a little plain. It's totally fast food, and lines show up and that's when production begins to slow down, as there is a cashier, a man working on making burgers, and the people in the back making everything else. (Hash browns, fries...). It took a couple minutes to get our order in, but even longer for them to make the hash browns. I mean- it's breakfast.... shouldn't you have some already ready?They do have nice service and they do accept LA coupons (whose food they make), so they do have that working out for them.2.5 stars here. Located across from Chippingdales in the Rio. Which is the half naked hot men picture, if you look at pictures instead :P

This place is so great. Always very chill and relaxing to come to with the nicest bartenders, especially Lisa! I don't even have to worry about creepers creeping either ;) They have a 24 hour menu so you can get your fat on anytime of the day. Plus a dining room area so Hunnie Bunnie can come and chill too :)Super convenient that it's right across the street from the crib too so it's a short walk away! And TV's to catch your favorite sports.A great local bar location with cheap food and nice servers. We arrived around 10 and they were empty in the dining area. The server was so friendly and greeted each patron like she new them, most of the rig upsets she most likely did. My mom and I ordered some breakfast and prices were beyond reasonable. My omelet was made to order and was good. Service with a smile and great prices while watching the games, we'll likely be back soon to partake in more of the bar area as well.

What a diamond in the rough! I swear this is one of the best blocks for food I haven't tried on the west side. Well after trying to find somewhere quick to eat on the one hour break from a nearby hospital I saw a nice review for Mike's Bistro and decided to check it out. I read the specials posted out front, and Mike is right... "Life is too short to eat bad food"I am very happy with my venture into this small business and I hope more people make it in because this was absolutely great food. The wife had an eggplant parmigiana sub, and I had a pulled pork chipotle Torta, and they were both in the 6 dollar range but oh so fantastico! Mike was very polite and the restaurant was clean and tidy. The experience was authentic as was the food, and honestly this is one of the best places I have ever eaten that wasn't high priced.Check out Mikes, and support local business with some great eats!

I'm so full! And yes, it's the following day.Coming in to last night's dinner, I was looking forward to trying their curry. I pretty much love curry of all kinds and with a name like "The Taste of Nairobi," how could you not be intrigued? But Jieun wanted to try the curry, so I let her order that and I looked for something else that sounded interesting. I had settled on the "Traditional Nayama and Ugali" since it was something I had never even heard of before. But then Sun ended up ordering that. Long story short, the waiter recommended the "Nairobi Pork Chops" and that's what I went with.Holy crap did we end up with a ton of food on the table. Absolutely everything was delicious. The curry was curry--nothing too amazing--but it was delicious all the same. Being a complete fatty, I love how it comes with bone-in dark chicken meat. Sun's Nayama and Ugali had an interesting flavor and I would have been very satisfied if that was the dish in front of me. But I think I might have to go with the pork chops as being my favorite of the three. The pork was tender and juicy and everything that surrounded it (veggies, mashed potatoes, gravy, greens, and garlic mini bread thingy) just combined to deliver an extremely satisfying and comforting experience. Best of all, my dish was the cheapest of the trio.Next time, in the interest of preventing me from getting even fatter, I think we will split an entrée and perhaps try an appetizer. Seriously, the portions are humongous. I suppose the entrées at Wine 5 are perfect for taking home leftovers. The thing is, I'm never good at portion control when the food is this outstanding.p.s. Check in on Yelp and get a complimentary glass of house wine (or a fountain beverage).If you want Kenyan/American fusion in Vegas, this is your best choice. Well, your only choice anyway.A couple of my friends have been urging me to go to Wine 5 Cafe for a while now, and they finally took me there themselves today at lunchtime. Located in the Target plaza at Cheyenne and Tenaya, just off I-15 - yep, the same plaza as The Sandwich Spot - it's no small drive for us Henderson / Eastern LV residents. However, it's definitely worth it.They're open for all three meals, and even though their web site states that their breakfast menu is only available until noon, they were more than happy to take breakfast orders when we ate at 1pm. They also have an early bird breakfast daily from 7-9am and a weekday happy hour from 3-5pm, both of which feature $5.55 foods and drinks, and both of which we sadly missed. Maybe next time...They has a Yelp check-in offer for one free drink per person w/ purchase, which I used for their house white wine, a Moscato. It wasn't the best Moscato that I've had - just sweetness without much to fall back on. But then again, I wasn't here for the wine, and I didn't care enough to order a more complex wine, so I'm pretty much ignoring it for rating purposes.Owing to a glowing review by the Vegas Burger Blog, I decided to order the River Road Jetpack Burger ($9.99), which contains avocado, grilled sweet onions, house pickles, lettuce, and tomatoes. The bun was nice and the meat was seasoned fine, charred, and cooked properly to my request of medium-rare. The sweet onions were very prominent, but the pickle wasn't so noticeable, and I could've forgotten that there was avocado in the ingredient list. Still, the construction of it reminded me somewhat of Bachi Burger (which I love), and the addition of their milder hot sauce (ask the server for this or their very hot sauce) gave it enough depth of flavor. I wasn't completely blown away, but I'd consider having this burger or another of their burgers in the future.I tried a bit of the Nairobi Farmer's Splendid ($8.99), which one friend was raving about and ended up ordering. It was better than my burger. It's a mixture of ground beef, roasted corn (one of my favorite things), black beans, fried eggs, and cheese that can be eaten with mandazi, a fried bread that seems light and not greasy. The same sweet onion is provided on the side, and this along with the aforementioned milder hot sauce were welcome but not necessary for enjoying this dish. I'll probably have to order this on my own in the future.We were considering going elsewhere for something creamy and frozen, but we ended up getting desserts here. The Churro Split ($9.99) was the more interesting of our two choices at first glance, with churros, bananas, pineapple, pecans, vanilla bean ice cream, chocolate, and creme Chantilly. The flavors and textures were all there, and the pineapple was especially sweet and juicy, but I don't think it came together cohesively as a dish.On the other hand, the simpler sounding Sweet Goblet ($7.99 - with creamy cheesecake, Oreo cookie crumbles, strawberries, and reportedly a fresh berry coulis (but definitely some whipped cream and chocolate syrup) - exceeded expectations. It had figurative and literal layers that blended together harmoniously in a faux waffle cone serving cup. It tastes richer than the mundane sundae that it sounds and looks like, and it's simply satisfying as a dessert, especially if you like cheesecake or cookies & cream.Overall, my impression of Wine 5 Cafe is that it's simple food done right, whether it draws inspiration more from its Kenyan roots or its American home. And like a lot of places, I wish it were closer, but at least it's not far off the highway. My Northwest and Summerlin friends should definitely take notice and give this place a try.

Restaurant name  The Potato Patch

Review Text :
I stopped by the Potato Patch while visiting Kennywood last Sat.  Given that the Potato Patch is the most famed food stand in the park, I had to pay it a visit.  Since I had a picnic lunch at the park, I waited until dinnertime, when I was sufficiently hungry to justify getting an order of the famed potato patch fries.At the time of my visit, there was hardly any line, which was likely due to the weather, which had been threatening to rain all day.  Even if there is a crowd, there are ten lines to order from, though, so I imagine it moves pretty fast.  The way it works is that you put in your order and pay first, and then you step forward to the window to receive your fries.  AFAIK, only fries are sold at this stand, so if you want something else, like a drink, you'll have to get it from a nearby stand.  (I hit up the nearby fresh squeezed lemonade stand.)At the Potato Patch, a regular order of fries comes with one or more toppings, except for bacon, which is an upcharge.  In keeping with tradition, I ordered my fries with cheese and bacon ($8.20).  If you order cheese sauce, it will be poured over the fries unless you specify that you want it on the side--for my part, I wanted to enjoy the fries in their ooey, gooey glory, so this was fine with me.  As for the fries themselves, they are of the boardwalk variety--thick cut and with skin left on--and come in a medium sized portion (there's only one size), which was more than filling enough for me.  I am something of a fry connoisseur, so I can say with some authority that while they weren't the best fries I've ever had, they were quite good, and are definitely a cut above the usual theme park fare.If it's your first time visiting Kennywood, as it was for me, be sure not to miss the Potato Patch!  Just make sure to go when your stomach's settled, so you can enjoy the fries in all of their crispy, topping-laden glory!Note: I took a photo of the fries, as I usually do, but lost my phone before I could upload it.  :-(

Restaurant name  E-Jo Korean Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I've driven by this place many times and saw the decent reviews on Yelp. The area is pretty sketchy so I parked on the side street since there was additional lighting.Being it was a Tuesday evening there were only a couple of other patrons. I was greeted by the friendly Korean woman who immediately brought me ice tea which was refreshing. Being that E Jo is popular for their soups, I went with their combo soup which had 6 varieties of meat in a yummy broth and noodles. The soup included fresh tasty ban chan and rice.I'm so glad I tried E-Jo Korean Restaurant - good food and friendly service will have me returning again.I don't live or work in this part of town, so when I do travel this way it is usually to go to one of the restaurants in the nearby Commercial Center or simply passing through.  So over the years I have driven past this unassuming restaurant that practically blends in with the other random businesses on this stretch of E Sahara, and never really given it a second thought.  So I am glad that we the typical question about where to get dinner ultimately lead us to E-Jo Korean Restaurant.Their menu is pleasantly simple. Just 2 pages worth, and almost all of it is dedicated to the various traditional Korean soups not found at other Korean restaurants. These soups are the final product of hours of slow simmering to extract the flavors from the beef bones used in its preparation.  You can order the soup according to the meats and other ingredients that you want served in it.  If you are a beginner, then go with item #1 (Brisket Beef Soup for $9.99). If you are adventurous, then order item #8 (Their Combination Beef Soup with all the ingredients listed in items 1-7).The soups themselves are what many would considered bland, but that is completely intentional. And sea salt is available on the table for diners to adjust their soup to their individual taste (very good for individuals with high blood pressure or are on a low sodium diet, since it is easy to add salt but impossible to get it out).  Besides that, there are Korean spicy chili paste and another soybean paste and garlic mixture for flavoring the soup or as a dip for the cucumber chili (most were not spicy, but there were a few that did packed some heat, so be careful if you don't like it too spicy).In the end I opted for item #3 (Beef Knee Bone Soup with Tendon, $13.99).  If you like soft tendons, there are a lot of it in here, but no other pieces of beef.  Overall, this alone was just okay for me even with all of the tinkering that went into fine tuning my soup.The surprised highlight of the meal for me and probably everyone I ate with (Michael K and Roger T) is the restaurant's house made kimchi (2 varieties: radish and cabbage).  As far as banchans are concerned relative to other Korean restaurants, the selection is minimal.  However, what the E-Jo lack in kimchi selections is more than make up by the quality and flavors that they packed.  I will be happy with a few servings of rice and their kimchi, and maybe just a small bowl of soup or side order of Stir Fried Ribeye or Spicy Pork.  The kimchis are that mind blowningly good!  Forget the other K-Restaurant's commercially sourced industrial kimchis.  I want E-Jo's artisanal kimchi goodness!Service was friendly and efficient. The food came out with nominal wait time.  You can help yourself to as much kimchi as you want.  However, be polite and considerate and get the kimchi out of the jar with the provided tongs and put it on the serving plate first (no ones wants your cootie crossed contaminated double dipped leftover kimchi, not even your GF or BF).In the mood to drink responsibly?  They offer, you guessed it, Soju!  Plus Korean beers and rice wines and soda for me.For entertainment, besides staring at your iPhone or Android devices and neglecting your dining companions (okay if you are Yelping, but only because I am Yelping too), catch up on Korean programming of the variety show category on their TV (at least that was what was on at the time of my visit).  Afraid of ordering wrong because you are not Korean, can't speak Korean, but you still want to madly impressed your Korean GF or just being  culinaryly (I am making up words because of their kimchi) adventurous minus the requisite language skill, have no fear! pictures of menu items are on the wall for easy visual reference.  Or just ask the restaurant staff taking your order, silly.(Getting the frantic hand signals to wrap it up)E-Jo, a good Korean soup restaurant to visit, especially as the thermometer starts dipping towards your feet.  Lastly, awesome kimchi!4 stars! **** out of *****Trivial observation: Their soups all look the same to me here.  But I can assure you I am not a soup racist. I have had soups from many culinary traditions in the past. Just the other day I thoroughly enjoyed a miso soup, and before that an Italian Wedding Soup, and a very invigorating cold Borscht from Russia (or was it or Ukrainian origin) just over the summer. My point is I am not a soup racist.Shout out to my Yelp friend Michael K for doing a last second UYE for this place.With that said, I have never been here. The Korean restaurants im used to are the cook it yourself all you can eat table top grill kinds. So I was curious as to how this place works.From looking at the menu it looks simple enough. Everything has a number and is in Korean and English. Since I didn't really want to be that adventurous, I chose the #1 Beef Brisket Soup. It's your basic soup with Beef Brisket and Noodles. Now this is where I learned something new. You season the soup yourself meaning they don't put any spices whatsoever in it. On every table there are containers of salt with a mini spoon. For those that are looking for a low to no sodium meal, this is your soup to get! What I ended up doing was grabbing the meat from my soup and eating it with the steamed rice they give you. I would also mix in a little bit of the hot sauce and curry sauce that was provided as well as mild green peppers. What actually stole the show was the Kimchi. I have had it before but when I had some of theirs, it tasted really fresh. What I find out was that they make it themselves from scratch. That explains why it was so good. Definitely not from a jar you would be able to buy at Seafood City or Ranch Market.Service was good. We had a sweet old lady that looked like she would not be able to understand us or speak English well. I was pleasantly surprised when she spoke perfectly good English to us. She was very helpful in answering any questions we threw at her.As for the place and overall location, I gotta admit, I drive by this place all the time and never really noticed it. Shame on me. But then again, it is in a weird part of the east side of Sahara when most of the food places are on the west side. When you go inside, there are plenty of tables and chairs I would say for about 20 people.So next time, based on the pics, the Spicy Pork and Spicy Chicken looks really promising.A true diamond in the rough when it comes to Korean food options in Las Vegas.  Korean barbeque and tofu stew joints are aplenty in Spring Mountain, but E-Jo is one of those niche restaurants that specializes in slow cooked beef soups which  one rarely comes across unless you're in a city with a full-fledged Koreatown.  Don't be fooled by their limited menu offerings and the simplicity of their banchan since the old saying goes that it is far better to do a few things well than to do many things poorly.  They offer a variety of beef-based broths containing a variety of cuts ranging from brisket, oxtail, and tongue to a variety of other tender bits such as tripe, tendon, and intestine.  The broth has a milky white complexion that can only be achieved from boiling down beef bones for several hours under a low simmer achieving a rich and nourishing soup perfect for a cold winter day or when one is under the weather or post-hangover.   Sea salt and pepper are provided at the table to adjust the broth to optimum taste and along with the choice of meat, some silky threads of somyeon (wheat flour) noodles and fresh green onion complete the dish.  Accompaniments include a refreshing glass of barley tea, a few raw green peppers (not spicy, although they look like banana peppers, presumably as a palate cleanser?), and two artisan jars containing perhaps the best made-in-house kimchi in town in the form of radish and napa cabbage cut down table side to bite-size portions by one of the staff.  For the final fine-tuning of flavors, some ground red chili paste and additional green onion are provided for the broth and a spicy soybean paste and horseradish/wasabi based soy sauce for dipping the meats.  Other options include a few choices of grilled meats, nyangmyeon, and a soup with homemade dumplings/rice cakes which have also been well-received in other reviews.A true mom/pop joint devoid of pretense that delivers homecooked Korean goodness to nourish the body and soul."Oh come on.  When I said I wanted soup, I thought you'd pick ramen.  Tripe, tendons, beef knee bone, tongue, oxtail.  Seriously?" whines my Midwest poker bud."Be adventurous"  I say, choking back giggles."Adventurous?  It's not fair.  The worst my people got is Rocky Mountain Oysters, and you like those."E-Jo is all about authentic Korean beef bone soup.  Heavily extracted, boiled for hours until gelatinous and milky.  Incredible beef flavor with garlicky undertones.Simply select from a flavorful list of brisket (well braised, stringy), tongue (braised and tender), knee (clean, gelatinous tendons), oxtail (fall off the bone with melting cartilage), tripe (well cleaned, no off smell, tender), or all of the above then adjust the seasoning with the provided salt, fermented chili paste, chili powder and scallions.  Done.Only three banchan.  In-house made, incredible Napa cabbage and radish kim chee.  Deep flavor, good heat and just the right tingle of fermentation on the tongue.  A plate of fresh shishito peppers adds a vibrant, mild spice, green pepper foil made even better when dipped in a light but flavor enhancing soy garlic sauce.There are a few other non soup items (spicy pork, chicken, etc).  Have not tried them.  Prices for the soups are very reasonable ranging between $10 - $15.A short list of shoju and Korean beer rounds out the meal.Mom and pop Asian service.An incredible bowl of deliciousness.  Oh yeah, "Mikey liked it".korean bone broth soups....sulluntang, breakfast korean style...to soothe stomachs after a sinful night in vegas...order of korean pancakes to start...crispy golden deliciousness...well made pancakes...majority taking the brisket sullungtang...self taking the doganee sullungtang (knee cartilage soup), but basically given a tendon soup...instructions are simple for sullungtang...season it yourself, customize it yourself...add some sea salt, but remember sea salt is extra salty...add some green onions if desired...black pepper for little kick...some will go as far as to add kimchi juice straight up in their soup...there are no rules to personal preference!..kimchi jars and plates given...radish and napa cabbage...sissor to cut it  yourself...any size you want...careful not to splatter on yourself or neighbors...korean green peppers are milder...before they ripen to a red firey fiery...dip the green peppers in the brownish/reddish paste...mixture of fermented beans (korean miso) and things...overall, the kimchi is decent...korean soup restaurants are suppose to have the best kimchi, but e-jo is just decent....the soup is light and not as rich as wanted, but it does the job....Came here tonight bc it had such high ratings and I needed a Korean restaurant for my Korean mom and Korean Aunt, who need to always eat Korean food. :) Anyway, we grabbed a taxi from the Wynn (where we were staying for the weekend) and went over. In hindsight, I should've just driven but I was too lazy to get my car out of the parking structure. It cost $11 cab fare to get there. Then I paid $5 tip. I know. Dumb. It was actually worse on the way back. The owner of the restaurant called us a Korean cab to get back to the hotel. He charged us $20!!! What a ripoff!! Anyway, I digress. So, the moral of the story is if you decide to check out this place, and you have a car, just drive there. So, I got the oxtail soup, my mom got the Kalgooksoo, and my Aunt got the soup with the greens in it. I thought my oxtail soup was  good! Broth was flavorful. My meat was a little tough...I mean I was fighting with it to get off the bone. But still pretty good. The cabbage Kimchee and the radish Kimchee both were really good! They also gave us peppers with daenjang. The peppers with fresh and crunchy! Really good! My mom and aunt said their food was just ok. They said it was bland. Lol. But they live in LA, so they always compare Korean food to the restaurants in Ktown.Overall, I thought the service was great and the food was pretty good. If I have a craving for Korean food in Vegas again, I will be back.A lot of people ask me what my favorite non-bbq Korean restaurant here is in town. But, if I wanted a certain dish, then it would change for every restaurant. For example, in Korea, a local restaurant might have only a handful of dishes on their menu... but they are able master those dishes over time, and they become specialized in those dishes. So that is the reason why when I go to one restaurant, they might make only a few things that I really like, but at a different restaurant, which has many of the same menu items, I might choose other dishes. It's hard to find a Korean restaurant that does everything, very well.Which brings me to E-Jo. This is ONE of my favorite Korean restaurants in town, because what they do very well is their seolleongtang. What is this you ask? Basically, you can call it a beef noodle soup. But their are certain things one must consider before generalizing this dish. The broth for example. Normally when one makes a beef broth, you must brown the bones in the oven in order to get that brown color to shine. This soup is unique because you take raw ox leg bones, and boil the hell out of them. This makes for a very milky colored broth. But the flavor is definetely beef.Traditionally, this soup is only served with either oxtail bones, or with some brisket. At E-Jo, they have expanded themselves by offering a myriad of beef parts, including tongue, tendons, and tripe. I like this because I like offal, and it's definetely something different that I am not used to in this soup, but appreciate eitherway. Another great aspect of this dish are the clear sweet-potato noodles that are located near the bottom of the bowl, they give the soup a great texture. Also, there is salt and chili pepper located on the tables if you feel as if the soup is lacking a bit of seasoning. I tend to like this soup kinda bland, but thats just me.On another visit, I was able to try their hangover soup, or haejangguk. I thought that the korean hangover soup was well made as well. It is a bean paste soup  that is loaded with bean sprouts, cabbage, and beef brisket. I thought that the seasoning was on point, and it definetely cured my hangover, as was its intention. But, I thought that one thing was missing that really could have taken it over the top. It is usually served with pieces of coagulated ox blood. The one at E-Jo does not have any. I think that if they had added that in, it would have completed the dish.Ban chan (or side dishes) are usually kept to a minimum at a seolleongtang restaurant. This is the case because they want to preserve the simplicity of flavor that is in that bowl of soup. So, you will typically get kimchi, and some raw chili peppers, which are not that spicy. But let me go on record by saying... E-Jo makes the best kimchi in town. And I just don't mean really good, or awesome... I'm talking the BEST! I know you're going "Yea, right Mike, sure, uh huh, I believe you, get outta town, pssshhh, hold the phone" and other stuff. Trust me on this one. Just do it. Or else. Or else nothing.The prices are OK, not out of this world great, but just OK. The service is also pretty good as well. This place is usually never crazy busy.. even though it should be.. so more than likely the service will be pretty good. I enjoy getting my kimchi fix here, and this place will cure any hangover, no matter how large or small. And even if you aren't hungover, the food here will make you a believer. Just like how much I believe in you.Hearty, hot Korean soup is perfection during this chilly December weather! I've heard about E-Jo through friends and fellow yelpers and decided to go last night with a coworker. We both got sizzling hot soups (Gomtang - brisket for me, oxtail for my coworker) and we split spicy buckwheat noodles (Bibimnaengmyun - cold noodles topped with spicy sauce, veggies, and boiled egg)When I first got the soup, it looked fantastic and I had to dig in. I tasted it and my reaction showed how bland it was. My coworker pointed out the small bowl of salt crystals right in front of us (silly me for missing) that is supposed to be used to add salt to taste. That made a lot more sense to me and I added a small spoonful along with a sprinkle of pepper... My soup was DELISH!The Kimchi and Kkakdugi (radish) were both very tasty and servers were quick to replenish. A large portion came in small ceramic bowls and you serve and cut them yourself - just like how they do it in soup restaurants in South Korea. We also had spicy Korean peppers to dip in Doenjang (miso paste) which is one of my favorite simple Korean sides.The Bibimnaengmyun wasn't my favorite. The sauce tasted sweet to me which is extremely strange as this cold noodle dish is supposed to be spicy, not sweet (?) My coworker added more spicy paste to it and finished it off as I only cared for one bite.For the price, quality, and portions of food, I would absolutely recommend E-Jo. Maybe not for their Bibimnaengmyun... But it's definitely a great place for authentic Korean soup!

I went to this location for a work lunch the restaurant was able to accommodate our large group of 40 people. The wait staff would have to be the highlight of the experience. The lay out was great for large groups and the decor was fairly modern. I would say the set up of the actual buffet was rather confusing and the food served didn't seem to be the healthiest options. Most of the food was of brown or white color, not green, orange, yellow, red-- you know-- fruits and veggie options. A wide selection of desserts to tickle your after meal fancy..I came here for breakfast after an early morning couponing trip at a nearby store. First off, make sure you bring your players card! I had to wait in line to get one, although the members area is located right near the buffet. Also, come early. The food was super fresh & actually really tasty. The price: 5.99 per person for unlimited food/drink. Nice!! Will I go back? Sure, If I am ever on that side of town around egg time!! :) Diet friendly: Depends. My friend is a vegetarian and most items had some sort of meat in them already. They did have a fresh egg bar where they make them for you. There were not many low-cal options I noticed. Lots of egg/bread dishes... But not a ton of variety of fruit.Look, I love me the cheap eats!  So yes I am a fan of buffets!  I don't live on the Hender-tucky side of town so rarely do we ever go to the Green Valley Ranch for a visit.  But with getting that Station Casinos coupon buy one buffet get one FREE just about every month (a wonder what $20 a month gambling with their members card can do) we finally gave in and took the trek down there.  I know, I know the coupon is good for the Red Rock Casino too but with over 25 check ins there (yep and I'm still only 5th place for a regular) I thought it was time to change it up a bit.  Glad we took the journey!We went on the most expensive nights, Saturday for dinner.  Since it includes prime rib & shrimp for the buffet on this night the price goes up to $17 a person + tax & tip.  But with our BOGO coupon 1 is FREE!  Oh yeah!  That is a deal to me!  Don't care if people say buffets are 'whack' or 'the stuff no one wants to eat'.  Save it all for me then!  Eating on a budget is hard enough as it is, but doing it with a buffet?  Yeah, sign me up.  Let's see...$10 each after coupon for all I can eat of just about anything, or $10 each trying to pick out food to cook from my local supermarket?  I like to cook but nope, that BOGO coupon is tough to beat.  Plus, no clean up!For us, the Feast Buffet at Green Valley Ranch didn't disappoint.  Yes, there are lines, yes, there are crowds for high ticket items (like prime rib), and yes, some of the food is downright mediocre.  But tell me where you gonna get as much meat as your fatty mcfatfat self wants, when you want it?  Don't get me wrong, quality is just as important as quantity...but that's why you only eat the things at a buffet that entices you!  Don't be wasting your calories on those rolls of bread!  Skip the cottage cheese please!  And believe me, we ate like kings!  Prime rib, which was actually pretty good by the way!  Rare!  With au jus!  And a side of roasted mushrooms!  Pad Thai that was actually edible!  Orange Chicken that whaddaya know?  Tasted like there was real orange in there!  Roasted Brussel Sprouts!  Sauteed Broccoli Rabe!  Carne Asada Tacos!  Hell I could have got Mongolian BBQ made for myself too!  The list goes on & on.Had a rarity in the buffet, made to order Gyros!  They honestly weren't that great (or that pretty) but it was offered!  Choices!  I like me some choices when it comes to food because half the time I don't know what I want to eat.  Buffets fill that perfect medium.This Feast Buffet even offers shakes & malts!  Really!  Not a bad way to end the evening after your feast.  Overall the food was more than decent, some really good stuff in there.  Why go to a buffet expecting Michelin star food?  This my friends is not the place.  Go here to enjoy the food, enjoy your company!  Do what they want you to do.....FEAST!Then go home & take a nap.

I eat at boofays all the time, so believe it or not my problem isn't with allowing patrons to handle their own serving utensils and potentially cross-contaminate food allergens or bacteria. My problem at Ghenghish Ghrihll (where the heck do you put the "H" again?!?) is with the way the staff handles their meat.Sounds pretty yucky, and it is.After going through a useless ordering procedure instruction by the server, the complications of which are rivaled only by the ridiculous ChinoBandido http://www.yelp.com/biz/chino-bandido-phoenix-3#hrid:Rc5orUUva9KTB4kMp7EgMw , I winced as i grabbed a serving tong laying on top of a pile of raw meat, dished out my portion, and went on touching other serving utensils on the veggies and spices and sauces. GROSS.Guessed about what to put on the dang thing, and was scared, really, since the server warned to be sure to know you like what you put on by tasting it with a tiny spoon ( from a bowl where it was touched by all those other peoples' grubby germ-laden meat-tongs-hands) .  GROSS. Thinking that "well, at least it's going to be cooked now," I hand my dish of e-coli-laden vegetables and warm grey meat chunks to the ''chef'' and scurry into the restroom to wash my hands with soap. When the food finally comes (long wait) to our table in the overly cramped dining room, the portion is onderwhelming and the thing is ugly.  The veggies are overcooked, and when i try the meat chunks, they are undercooked to the point of being rubbery instead of flaking apart as i chew. GROSS.I will admit i got lucky and concocted a decent flavor, but it was a total fluke.  Unimportant.  I was counting on that warm, grey, pile of exposed-to-the-public meat being cooked through and through to eliminate any food borne bacteria sure to be lingering around after its recent history of unhealthy handling.The server was more than happy to allow me to fill another bowl, and the guys said i could have them start cooking the meat first and add veggies later , but why should i have to ask for that?  Well, it didn't matter, because i never got the chance to even have them cook up that second bowl.As i stared down at the sloppy serving station, trying to decide if thinly sliced meat meant more or less chance of bacteria, I watch a staff member fill up the raw chicken tray with more rubbery chunks.  He does not place the new container in the server and pour the old meat on top of it, but instead simply pours new, frozen meat on top of the old thawed meat already in the bin.  This is not only against common sense, but against food handling procedure.  Who knows how many times he refilled this way that day, or how long the meat down in the bottom of that container had been sitting there?!? GROSS.If asked whether I prefer to allow all of that sort of thing to just go on behind the closed doors of a kitchen where i can't see it - YES, that's exactly what I prefer.Just okay for my taste, the one thing I do like is that you can go crazy with what you decide you want to have them cook up for ya!! You simply, pick your choice of meat, choice of seasoning, veggies, sauce and starch and you hand it over to the cook, that then they heat it up for you in their gigantic grill and TA DA, it is all ready for you to enjoy!!The one thing that I honestly don't really like is the price, it could definitely be adjusted, it is a bit over-priced for the portioned you get and that is without a drink, if they included your drink of choice then I would then be content!!

Review Text :
43 North's special Valentine's Day four-course prix fixe was, hands down, one of the BEST meals I've had in Madison, ever.Each of the four courses offered three supremely adventurous and deliciously executed choices, imaginatively (de)constructed or served in novel - yet hearty - ways.  Standouts included the lobster bisque, poured at the table over succulent and generous pieces of meaty lobster, a take on fried chicken with spaetzle that was more like a fall-off-the-bone-tender confit, a seared salmon in microgreens with shaved shallot and lemon dressing, _huge_ sea scallops with jamón ibérico over pear and the beef loin over puréed root veg.  Each course offering was served with an unexpected yet exciting twist, and a variety of amuses-bouches were offered throughout the meal - including a starter of a strawberry purée and cava cocktail, and ending with a take-home portion of 43 North's coffee cake (presumably served at their new Sunday brunch).  Desserts were playful deconstructed takes on classics; the concentrated form enhanced flavor and offered a visually stimulating presentation that was matched with the intense flavors (of chocolate-caramel flan, in one case, and panna cotta with mango, in the other).  Cocktails were also splendid, particularly the Hendricks and St. Germain "Rainie."In addition, the service from "Birgit" was excellent - she was attentive, informative and enthusiastic about the special meal and it made dining a pleasure.  The maítre d' was equally warm and welcomed us in as special guests for the evening - it's a feeling that makes this restaurant just a cut above other high-end options in town.For $50 per person, this was one of the most reasonably priced yet fantastic dining experiences I've ever had.  I can't rave enough.  Awesome!Bobb doesn't eat at restaurants that put pictures of their food in the window and I don't eat at restaurants that put pictures of their chef on the menu. (Yet we both wound up here.)Let's chalk this experience up to me expanding my horizons and giving places another shot after they let me down once. Service is ok. Food is plated nicely. The menu offers something for everyone. It's nice that you can go small plate or large plate when it comes to their entrees. But it's not special. It ok. It's nice. It's fine. Now I feel like jerk... was that harsh? In my opinion harsh is spending $14 on two seared scallops. That's a lot of money. $7 per scallop if you're not good at math. Scallops aren't cheap, I get that, but I can throw a scallop into a screaming hot pan and sear on each side for a minute and a half. Who wants to give me $14? Tonight the scallops were in this weird pea puree that lacked flavor though admittedly was a beautiful color. Scallops themselves are already a bit bland, I wish there was something stronger than the pea painting my plate. Add to this the fact that my fork couldn't cut the touch sea life. You shouldn't need a knife to cut through scallops. These were over-done. The rest of the menu is a bit more complex taking less than common proteins and pairing them with starches in interesting ways. But at the end of the day, there is better food on the capital square. Good company helps. Both times I've been, I've thoroughly enjoyed the intimate bistro atmosphere and the people I was with. I just wish the food stood out more and resonated better with me, especially if you're going to put a picture of the guy that prepares it on your menu.

This place is so put together, organized and delicious that I had always thought they were part of a national chain, but they are actually locally- and family-owned!Big props to the Mikha family!  They have plenty of vegetarian options, and I always make sure to get a side of their lentil soup - it's amazingly delish and fresh tasting!  It's sort of the opposite of George's... :)Highly recommended and I will always come back!

This former New Yorker is so glad that this pizza place is here. The slices are big and the taste is just like that of the pizzas I have enjoyed for years in the boroughs of the Big Apple. And no wonder: the pizzas are made by friendly guys from Brooklyn who really know their stuff.  This place also offers  a  great lunch special of 2 slices and a drink for just $3.75  - one of the best lunch deals in the city.

Brought to you by the contractors that run the dining hall and Starbucks on the ASU downtown campus, Aramark.  Apparently they are also open until 1am 6 days a week too....hummm.....Stopping in on my way home from work hoping to find some veggies.  On first glance through the place I was excited, thinking, "cool my own salad bar near home." Then as I  took a closer look...the quality of said veggies, well that was another story.The employees probably never eat salad or veggies by the look of the dry wilted zucchini, cucumbers, celery, carrots, bok choy...To their credit the main piles of spinach, romaine and mixed greens were fresh.  The side salads looked like they had been sitting out all day as did the dressings.  Either cover the items, take the time to stir the salads/dressings, or put out less and replenish frequently.  All of this could be resolved with a swift kick to the ass of some obviously lazy employees. I wanted to take my salad to go and they charge by weight but I was not given a to go container.   I was told to use a plate, put it all together and then I had to dump it in to a container after it was weighed.  HUH?!  These plates are huge and plastic, and I doubt that they tare out the weight of the plate.  I didn't get a whole lot of salad considering the quality of the toppings and it came to $9.  WTF?! I can get the whole kit and caboodle at Souper Salad or even Sweet Tomato for that price (or less).  I rarely even pay that price at Whole Foods when carrying out a salad there.  No wonder this place was empty....I wish this place was better....

This was my first visit to Garden Cafe, despite working in the area. We were looking for a new restaurant to give a whirl for lunch so I pulled out my trusty Yelp app and we decided on Garden Cafe. We arrived around 12:15 and the place was pretty empty. More people trickled in after we ordered but it wasn't too crowded. My coworkers ordered the gyro lunch special. I set my sites on the lamb schwarma sandwich but at last minute I decided to try the soujouk sandwich with fries and diet soda. The guy taking my order (I presume he was the owner) promised I would like the soujouk and highly recommended it.Our food came out quickly and everyone was pretty pleased with their meals. I felt the portion size was a little slim for the price, but I definitely didn't feel cheated. The sandwich was tasty, but not the best I've ever had. I'll had to try them again to see if I like any of their other food better. I'd definitely skip the fries next time and opt for a salad or some rice instead. They were definitely lackluster. Overall, we had a good meal and I am still looking forward to trying some of their menu items and giving them another chance.

One chick working the whole restaurant.  That sucks, right?  But it wasn't busy at all.  At.  All. So the fact that my water wasn't refilled ever... Our hummus came out after 20 minutes.... The extra pita bread we asked for never came... She wouldn't even give us another menu willingly... was very irritating.  I'm a big fan of good service (gee... who isn't!?) but I tend to give A LOT of leeway to people because I was a server.  Today, it was hard for me to do so.  The hummus was actually really good and the pita bread was awesome.  Came out warm and moist.  The gyro salad was not bad.  I liked the meat, but it was a pretty simple salad.  I've had much more creative/better ones.  I think I'd give it another try because I did like the hummus, but I pray the service gets better because I may start throwing around some pita bread... if I ever got some extra slices!Despite going to the chiropractor practically across the street from Daphne Cafe, I have never even noticed this place.  So when a friend recommended coming here, I was surprised to discover this cute little cafe.  They have outdoor and indoor seating, but the outdoor seating was really cute!  On a lovely summer day, this was such a great atmosphere to have a business lunch.I enjoyed the Baba Ganoush and falafel very much for lunch.  They provide you with plenty of pita to enjoy with your meal.  The Baba Ganoush was a very generous portion, and I actually took quite a bit home with me.  The falafel was probably the best falafel I have had in Pittsburgh.   While I didn't pay for the meal so I don't remember the exact prices, they seemed fairly reasonable at the time.We had pretty good service throughout the meal so I think that issue has been resolved!

Review Text :
HOLY CRAP!After my volunteer shift at The Neon Museum I was heading back home when I noticed their trailer opening, I decided to check them out after hearing good things about their tacos, let's say they did not disappoint.My first plate was 2 El Pastor, 1 Asada, and 1 Chorizo taco.  The chef cooked them up in a hurry and before long I was standing over a plate of awesome. The Chrosizo was good, a nice little kick but not too much spice. The Asada was probably my least favorite, it was good, but out done by the other tacos. The El Pastor Tacos were INSANE, seriously I asked how much for me to take the entire roast off the spit.The fixings/toppings bar was nice, I went with only a splash of lime, but the salsas and other options were all fresh and everyone trying them seemed to like the offerings.After Plate one I knew there needed to be Plate 2, so I ordered up 3 more El Pastor and 1 Lingua. The Lingua was really good (probably my 2nd favorite to the El pastor).  So in the end I had 8 tacos, I probably could have had another plate, but I needed to get going. I can say I will be eating there again, it'll be a great place to grab lunch after my shifts at the Neon Museum.Oh I also forgot the tacos are $1.50 each, they come on top of 2 tortillas, and are served with only meat and tortilla, there is a bar you can add salsa/veggies if you want, but I kept mine simpleMy hairdresser is from Guadalajara, and about a week ago she and I started bitching about how bad LV Mexican food is. We even bitched about how the Tex-Mex sucks ever since Margarita's Cantina got blown up in 06. Well, she told me that the only good Al Pastor in Las Vegas is located on Bonanza road near the "shitty part of town". I drove down Bonanza from Rancho all the way to Hollywood, and this was the only street taco stand I could find. I just assumed this had to be the place. She was right, it was really good. Just out of personal preference, I still like Taco Taco on Trop better because of the unique seasoning. But, I enjoyed the slices of pineapples that TACOS EL PASTORCITO put in my al pastor taco, and they had this special salsa that was bright orange and tasted like Mexican Tan Tan Men. 3 Al Pastor tacos only ended up being $4.50, and they were pretty big compared to other street tacos. The service was extremely friendly and one of the cooks was really good at setting boundaries for the large homeless population in the area. TACOS EL PASTORCITO is located in the parking lot of a Llantera place, right across the street from a Siegel Suites and what I believe was possibly the wreckage of a UFO(you will see what I mean when you get there). When you wait in line, you will be confronted by multiple druggies and homeless who will either ask you: "You got a cigarette I can borrow?", or "Got 50 cents so I can catch the bus?".  Well, the cook does a great job screaming aggressive things in Spanish to these people and getting them to run back into the alley for a while. Usually a couple of minutes later they come creeping back out and then the angry cooks starts yelling again... this cycle continues all night long.  I also  liked the regular customers. Most of them are older Mexican men who like to talk about professional boxing. I had a fun conversation while waiting for my tacos.Well well well Nelson, so you've done it again. You have found one of the most amazing hole in the wall joints in Las Vegas!! Big kudos to you. This is now my favorite place to get tacos anywhere in town, especially my favorite, the al pastor taco.Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the UYE treks that Nelson put together due to work obligations. But after having these tacos, I probably should have used up all my sick days hehe. The only thing I regretted was taking such a long period of time to try these delectable morsels of flava'.For parking, try to find a spot at the gas station or on the nearby streets. It can get kinda sketchy late at night so keep a lookout!So I ordered three al pastor tacos with pineapple. First off, you know they are going to do things right when they use fresh pineapple. When the tacos came out, they were a great sized portion. Heading over to the sides station, I decided to try a different sauce on each taco. Added on cilantro and limes, and I was good to go.That first bite... Forget about it. Forget about every al pastor taco you've had in your life. Because these guys? Yea, they know what's up. The smoky richness of the pork layered by the perfect blend of seasonings and spices. Trust me, you need to go here. The sauces? Amazing! Try some and find out which one you like!In Nelson we trust! Great find!!If there's any al pastor in Vegas that's better, please tell me right away. I need to know.I've avoided coming back to this taco stand since last year for one reason or another, but since I'm working nearby for a little while, it was so easy to stop by Taqueria El Buen Pastor. Having learned about the standing buy one get one free offer for tacos al pastor on Wednesdays, I've been back on that specific day of the week twice now. At $1 a pop when discounted, those babies were all that I ordered, and they were all that I needed.I'm not sure how they encase their other tacos, but the tortillas on these get crisped slightly but with minimal use of oil, if any. They're a great base for the excellent fillings. Speaking of which, you have to get the pineapples with the tacos al pastor. Luckily, the cashier has asked me both times whether I wanted it served with pineapple. I'm pretty sure they grill the pineapple up to add that extra flavor to what's already a great sweet and crunchy element. The meat itself is a fantasy savory, sweet, and somewhat smoky experience that works even without additional salsa. If and when you do go for salsa, skip the tomatillo salsa because it just doesn't complement the al pastor meat. Get either the spicy avocado salsa, the orange colored salsa, or perhaps both (note to self: try that next time). Just don't forget to add the onions, cilantro, and even lime to your liking. Those are essential for adding even more flavor and texture, so don't forget to stop at that metal-covered condiment station.I told myself before that I would try their other tacos, but the al pastor tacos alone are enough to make Taqueria El Buen Pastor a must-visit. That's even before considering the BOGO offer on Wednesdays, which makes it all the better. Maybe I'll be able to justify trying the other meats if I have an interesting night in Downtown Las Vegas, but I'd be perfectly content without them.

This place has changed our lives. Seriously! My wife and I live in Observatory Hill and I adore this neighborhood. Right on Riverview Park, quiet, beautiful historic homes, and close to everything. The only thing this neighborhood is lacking, in my opinion, is more restaurants. Sure, there are acceptable dining options 5-10 minutes away in every direction. But some times you just want fast, delicious and convenient. And to not leave the house. Until recently there was only one pizza place that would deliver to our house. One. And it's downright nasty. Right next door to the high school so that's the crowd they cater too. I'm guessing you can set your standards pretty darn low when your only competition is the school cafeteria pizza. Then, one glorious day, a menu appeared on our doorstep. Riviera Pizza and Pasta. And they deliver to our home. Worth a try! They have all of the typical offerings, breadsticks, pizza, calzones, hoagies. You know what a pizza place has. What they have that I've never encountered before is a relationship with eat24, an app that allows me to order on my iPad and magically have pizza show up at my house. Whaaaaatt?!?! I can order pizza and never have to speak to another human, and the food will come to me while I'm in my pajamas?!? Finally!! All of my dreams are coming true! It's finally a civilized neighborhood thanks to Riviera!The food is a solid 3.5 stars. The pizza is pretty good. It's tasty, cheesy, and just the right amount of greasy. The breadsticks are super yummy and we get them every time we order. We like the calzones a lot, the small one is enough for 3 servings at least. The delivery has always been faster than the quoted time and the drivers are kind and courteous. We've been desperate for a neighborhood pizza place that we actually like. Finally, the storm clouds have parted and Riviera Pizza has emerged. And we are certainly some grateful fans!

How Lucky Can One Guy Be....I Kissed Her and She Kissed Me...Like the Fella Once Said...Ain't That a Kick in the Head...2,500 miles away from the original location under the Brooklyn Bridge and I walk in to Dean Martin singing with the smells of pizza cooking.  That's Vegas baby.  Truth is, nothing can replicate the smell of walking into the original Grimaldi's.  There it almost knocks you down, and I'm not kidding.  Perhaps it's that you have to wait outside in line to get a seat, weather be damned.  You earn your pizza there.  But here on a Saturday night at 7 pm we walked right in.  More proof that people have to get away from the strip to enjoy some great food.I love that they kept the pizza prep area the same as the original Grimaldi's - a square work area with a coal brick oven taking up the back wall.  Open to the restaurant so you can sit there and watch them put on a little show and fantasize if that that's your pizza they are working on or not.  They start with hand tossing the dough here, which is becoming a lost art, because I'm seeing more and more press machines being used for dough.  Then some of their signature tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella.  The fresh mozzarella is the key here.  It's slices rather than shredded.  I noted in my review at the original Grimaldi's that they deal the mozzarella like playing cards all over the pizza.  Well even though it's Vegas and that analogy works better here, they were a lot slower and each slice was more carefully placed on the pie.  I guess in New York they've made so many pizza's that those guys can make 'em in their sleep.  This location is fairly new, so you can't expect them to be working at that speed yet.We ordered a pie with a whole lot of toppings and each was excellent except the shredded fresh basil.  Unfortunately they put the basil on when they are cooking the pie and the result was burnt leaves on the pizza.  So if you are going to order basil, make sure you ask for it to be added after the pie is cooked.  The pepperoni had a nice spice to it.  The meatballs were sliced real thin and had so much flavor.  The sausage was crumbled, and while I prefer sliced sausage on my NY pie, this is good stuff and you won't be disappointed.  The onions and mushrooms were sliced thin enough to totally cook on the pie.  The roasted red peppers were a little different than the original Grimaldi's, they were chopped up into smaller pieces, which I think was a good thing.  That way you got a little taste of the marinated red peppers in each bite.Now the problem with getting a lot of toppings here is you really pay for it.  Toppings are $2 each with a few being $4.  We had $18 in toppings!!!.  Oh well, we're on vacation, but if you eat here regularly you might have to make choices of what you want on your pie.  I remember the same thing happened in New York, I got the bill for 2 and it was like $50.  For pizza.  LOL But so good!  The only thing I didn't think was quite as good as the Original Grimaldi's was the dough.  I don't know what it is, but once you stop using that New York drinking water for your dough, it's never the same.  But we ain't in New York, and this is still a 5 star pie.Ok I have to apologize to Julie T if you're reading this, I'm sorry! Don't be mad at me! I lied to you, I said I liked it.  I was probably one of the last in Vegas to try their pizza but I had heard such negative reviews from people I had no desire. But the opportunity came up when my friend and her bf (this is his fav place) invited me, so of course I accepted. Anyways...immediate 1 star for patio seating (and I love love love the white Xmas type lights hanging from the lattice) and for it being Tuesday tasting (half of glasses of wine) I did enjoy my wine. No stars for food.The pizza looked decent when it came out. Nice big bubbly pieces of cheese, fresh basil on top, looks good?! Well my friend had told me that the ricotta was sweet, I wasn't quite prepared for the taste of it. I wasn't down with sweet ricotta on my pizza. The sauce had no flavor, at least the pepperoni gave it some. I asked the server for a side of ranch "we don't serve ranch, our pizza doesn't need it" uh huh, I beg to differ. This is for corporate pizza lovers who don't know any better.  Once again, to each their own, but I will never return.I cannot believe I have lived my life this long without a Grimaldi's Pizza!  Have driven walked and stumbled by many times in various locations in this city but never gotten to try it.  My loss...Until now!  The service is nice from start to finish with pretty quick service.  They have a bar for cocktails while you dine (and have the coolest wine bottle chandeliers I am going to recreate in my bar at home) lots of wine to choose from.  The greeter is nice and the staff was great.  Night before Christmas Eve it was busy from the nearby stores but the food came quickly not a worry.Because it was my first and I am kind of a Pizza fanatic I had to start slow and continue slow to truly enjoy the flavors.  When you take your time this Za has so many underlying flavors that you will miss if you dig right in.  The "Coal Brick-Oven" is true and it is AMAZING!  A soft Smokey flavor with every delicious bite of all the other flavors of you're choosing.  It is an ala cart pizza style so it can add up but with flavors like this it is worth the price.The ambiance is awesome, decor beautiful as I mentioned I am totally going to have the wine bottle chandelier in the near future.  Service is nice fast and efficient and the food is great!  Well worth the slightly increased price but when I make my Gourmet pizza at home WITHOUT the coal brick oven, it cost about this to make so yeah, worth it.Where should I start!?! This place is pretty simple...Drinks...Salads...PIZZAS...Desserts! The pizza here is just amazing! The crust is delicious...thin with a great crunchy crisp texture to it. A regular pie is enough for two people to share but delicious enough for a little Asian to force down happily. Their salads are pretty great as well. Portions are very generous and the presentation is pleasing. Price wise...a bit pricey for pizza, (especially if you are a person who likes to add a lot of toppings onto your pizza) but you'll be getting a quality pie. Save room for dessert! Tiramisu get's a thumbs up.I have herd great things about Grimaldi's and finally got a chance to try it. The server and staff were very friendly and polite they did a wonderful job. The white pizza was delicious, the pepperoni and mushroom pizza was not so great. The crust ended up all mushy from the grease on the pepperoni pizza which i cant stand. On the other hand the white pizza was perfect!    Grimaldi's has a nice dining room with a large opening in the building for fresh air and sunlight. The only down side to having this large opening, it lets in the flys. I had to swat away flys from our food several times during our meal which put a bit of a damper on the whole meal. Aside from the mushy crust on one pizza and the flys, it was pretty good.

Open till 10pm every day of the week serving homemade and mostly vegetarian and even vegan soups, so already, I love Soupson. The creamy soups are made with an in house cashew milk which is beyond tasty and super filling. They also offer sandwiches with meats roasted in house so nitrate and preservative free. This is also a regular dep so you can grab grab beers, smokes, organic vegetable chips: you know regular stuff. But you can also pick up organic fruits and veggies, and if you buy a big soup in a Mason Jar you can bring it back for refills, eliminating a little bit of the great wash of packaging in your life.

Another highly talked about restaurant in the bag!  I know just a few days ago I raved about the cute little neighborhood of Highland Park, but I must say again, it's adorable!  I'm just surprised that most of the storefronts on this road were shuttered or closed down.  It's a shame with Park Bruge being so popular... You'd think more people would come out here seeking other businesses.  But I digress...A late afternoon lunch offered a chance to slip right in.  Still being on a diet, I resisted the urge to order the poutine (soon, my friends, there will be some cheat days!).  I saw the Spinach Salad and thought, perfect!  The salad comes with strawberries, pears, dried cranberries, candied walnuts and multigrain crostini.  I also added in portobello mushrooms for an extra $2.  Good choice on my part!  The bello's were nice, big and juicy and a perfect addition to a flavorful salad.  I really enjoyed the creamy chevre walnut dressing too, especially because they don't scrimp on it (if you like light dressing you might want to get it on the side).  I also really loved the candied walnuts (dah!).  There was a ton of spinach, so you really don't have to worry about it being a dinky salad!  The crostini, meh, I took a couple nibbles but left most aside.  The service was extremely friendly but laid back.  To the point where if you had somewhere to be, you may want to keep an eye on time, it can get a little slow.  I definitely want to come back off diet so I can indulge in some of the delicious looking items ie POUTINE!As we walked to the car and began to get in, my H held the door open as I rolled in.  He closes the door and gets in the driver side, when I state "better hurry to the hospital the baby is coming.  Let's call her Mussels."  I had done it again.  Ate until I was so stuffed it was unpleasant, but if you asked me if I regret it I will say "nope!"  I do get overzealous when it comes a new place that I haven't been to, all I want to do is try everything that looks good without regard to my personal wellbeing. So the food, we ordered a classic poutine, the Bruges Burger prepared medium, a LB of mussels spicy prepped, and a few drinks.  I explained to the H that the Poutine was his but I wanted to try it thus making him the main consumer so I wouldn't eat too many.  Well that didn't work as planned.  Upon delivery I fork dived in and got a huge amount of fries, curds, and gravy.  Simply divine!   He got the burger to which I had to try.  Really very good, and I ate his side salad, lovely dressing.  My mussels were very creamy and brothy I simply loved them but felt something was left off.  The bartender offered extra bread to sop up extra juices that I gladly accepted.   Now this is a shame to say about what should be a 5 star place.  The restaurant was just confusing.  You walk in and there is no hostess there.  No sign saying please wait to be seated, no just people loitering around I was like what are we supposed to do???  So there is a small bar real close to the door so with the fear of waiting forever we seized the two open seats and decided to just eat there.  Bar has no TV, and the Bartender was as slow as molasses. Absolutely no sense of urgency.  She was nice, and knowledgeable if you could get her attention.   The food was EXCELLENT!  But I am upset that I ordered the spicy mussels and thought the whole time these are not spicy... Very good but not spicy.  My H kept saying it was probably b/c I always like stuff extra spicy and have a high tolerance.  I kept saying no my mom who can't eat anything with spice would eat this no problem.  But having never been there I thought it was just how they served it.  That was until the check came.  Another episode of a bartender not writing down an order and rang me in for the classic and not the spicy.  A little too late to complain and they were really good still but, I really wanted the spicy ones!  So the service was meh.  It took her 10 minutes to even wait on us because she had one speed, the I don't give a sh*t speed.  Still would totally come back!  Those mussels were to die for and next time I will know what to expect if I get the wrong ones.I hate to be the voice of dissent, but based on the glowing reviews and price, I was a bit underwhelmed by the brunch here.  I was actually planning to go to E2 for brunch on Sun., but my dining partner and I ended up here because the wait at E2 was running an hour at noon.  Here, we were seated within half an hour, which I appreciated, given the hectic nature of the PGH brunch scene.I ordered the prix fixe brunch with the special of the day (pulled pork, cheddar, and onion omelette), potatoes au gratin, and a mimosa ($20).  I chose the special because I'm a BBQ aficionado, and I love me some pulled pork.  Between the pulled pork and cheddar, I expected the omelette to be bursting with flavor, but I found it rather bland.  I was also disappointed with the amount of pork in the omelette, which seemed rather stingy.  While I liked the flakiness of the potatoes (they were more akin to a casserole), I also found them bland, flavor-wise.  The part of the meal I enjoyed most was the mimosa, but to be honest, I don't have a standard of comparison, since this was my first time drinking one.  My dining partner enjoyed his grilled cheese, although it wasn't quite what he was expecting (he was expecting your standard grilled cheese).While this wasn't a bad brunch, I doubt that I'd come out of my way to have it again, given that there are so many awesome brunch places in PGH.  For a similar quality brunch, I could have gone to Pamela's or DeLuca's, or gotten something more unique at at E2 or Coca (and paid less, to boot!).  If I were to come back here or to try Point Brugge, I think I'd stick to dinner so I could try the mussels and frites, since that's what everyone seems to rave about.  3.5 stars.We headed out to Park Bruges for my bff's birthday last night....her and her husband have been here several times and invited us along, our first time at Park Bruges. And I have to say, it definitely lived up to the reviews! We got the Poutine - fries with cheese curd and stock gravy - and the Tarte Flambée - a kind of flatbread (I think?) with marinated tomatoes, olive oil, and cheese -  to share as our apps. Very good! I have to say I've heard nothing but good things about the Poutine, which was delicious. But I actually preferred the tarte. It was light and tasty - a nice appetizer. For our entrees, my husband got the mussels with the green curry sauce and I had the cafe chicken sandwich with a salad and champagne vinegarette (a suggest from my friend). Everything was very delicious.It's hard to complain about this place, because honestly, there's so much to love. If given the opportunity, I'd give Park Bruges 4.5 stars. Just not quite 5. I'm just going to be a little picky, since all of the reviews are so good and there's little to complain about. My chicken sandwich was very good...chicken was flavorful and the mozzarella and dried tomatoes made the sandwich. But, the bun was just a little too crunchy for my liking, so I ate half the sandwich then took the other half of my chicken and mixed it in with my salad. The only really negative thing I can say about our first experience was our service. Now don't get me wrong, the waitress was nice, she just really didn't have any sense of urgency. Drinks and refills took several minutes and we had to ask for an extra set of silverware, since there were only 3 on the table. Overall, like I said, she was friendly, just not very efficient.The restaurant itself is cute. The place is small, but that doesn't bother me. We sat inside, and the restaurant is very comfortable, although it did get quite loud the busier it got. There is minimal seating outside, which is a bummer because I love to sit outside and eat. The problem with sitting outside, if you choose to do so, is this. They don't take reservations. So, if you end up going at prime time, people are sort of just hanging around at the bar or outside, which means, if the latter, people waiting for tables are sort of just hanging around in front of your table while you eat. Could be a little awkward. My suggestion would be to go a early like we did (6pm) or a little later, say after 8 or 8:30.

I went here based off a suggestion from a girl I worked with.  I am so glad I did.  While in Scotland, we ate here a few times.  Great food. Great atmosphere.  Great service.  It is located on the Royal Mile.  I have to say it was some of the best food we had in the UK.  Please note you may want to make reservations, they fill up fast and turn many people away.  They do have a bit of room on their street side seating, but don't count on it.It is a bit pricey, but really worth it.Samuel the hipster manager (very easy on the eyes)  kind of made the experience great as well.  HUGE FAN!Angels with bagpipes? If angels really did play bagpipes...infer what you will.As a modern Scottish eatery, this is a gem.  Hidden in plain sight, right on the Royal Mile.  Traditional Scottish food elevated using the freshest obtainable ingredients served in a contemporary, multi story building overlooking centuries old courtyard.The menu is seasonal. Autumn 2015, for starters, the potato and leek soup with a poached egg and croutons is outstanding. Creamy, the vibrant flavor of the leaks mellowed ever so slightly when you break the egg open. The scallop with black pudding, and unexpected joy to eat. Tart green apple puree provides the base for beautifully seared, incredibly sweet scallop. The accompanying black pudding has been deep fried in bacon fat rendering it crispy.  Barely a hint that it's a blood sausage. Crisp streaky bacon adds even more Porky goodness. Some bitter greens rounds out the extremely well balanced, textually satisfying dish.For mains, it's hard to pass on the selection of fish. All combine intriguing flavors of produce that miraculously heightens the flavor of the fish. The salmon cooked mid rare is extremely rich. The crispy skin adds a brilliant foil. The use of a red pepper puree heightens the natural sweetness, bitter greens accentuate the fatty flavor.  The natural flavors of a simply pan roasted, perfectly cooked, moist and fatty, black cod are greatly heightened by the earthiness of grilled onions sautéed wild mushrooms and a root vegetable purée.For something vegetarian, try the mushroom mouse served with grilled mushrooms and sautéed root veg, sauced with beet root purée is wonderful.  Solidified mushroom soup!  Extremely silky, velvety, intense flavor of mushroom from the mouse combines perfectly with the bitterness of the grilled mushrooms. The sweetness of the beet purée ties the entire dish together.Very well chosen wine list at reasonable prices.  Average bottle £20.Very friendly and efficient service. One month advance booking required. Them angels can play bagpipes all they want if I can eat like this.

1st: They tweeted a special 2-for-1 sandwich special. Two from our group ordered, and were then told the special was only during a specific time. Fine, except that the tweet came AFTER that time, and it said COME ON IN.2nd: The AC uniti or something came one EVERY TIME one of the servers, busboy, manager, etc came out through the door...and it stays on if the door is not closed completely...they on many of the occasion left it just slightly open so the LOUD UNIT stayed on. WE had to close the door.#3: I was charged EXTRA for the EXTRA SMALL DISH of marinara sauce. No mention that there was a cost. #4: NO SPECIALS, in fact even though there were 2 kids and 6 adults, three of which were separate, there was an automatic gratuity. 17%+. AND they leave a spot for another gratuity in case you don't catch it. Good thing someone in the group pointed that out.#5. The garlic knots were ok.#6. My server seemed to not care about much, sorry I didn't order a BIG meal, but there was seemed little reason to do so.#7. We meet once a week on Fridays and are looking for 4 specific place to hang on a regular basis..usually there are 8-12 people that come out...I am not sure I am voting for this place...#8. Why a I doing this??? You ASKED ME TO.. Yelp it you said.. oh wait. this isn't YELP.. ok then.. guess I will now copy and paste....I'll keep this simple. We were sat at 5pm and told the server we were ordering by the slice because we were in a hurry. He forgot to put in our order until 5:20, and slices came out at 5:35. The quality was on par with Sbarro. I could understand if the place was packed, but there were 6 employees along with the owner working, and only 4 tables sat the entire time we were there. The only reason this isn't 1 star is that the decor & bar area was pretty awesome.I also wasn't a huge fan of both TVs being tuned to BlackHawk Down- not really something I want my toddlers watching.I'll start with the positives.  .... oh wait, there weren't any.  I can't even do a good analysis of the food because the wrong pizza was brought out and to boot it was a pizza we didn't particularly care for.  (Had an ingredient on it that my dining partner had a slight allergy to.)In short, completely horrible service, rude attitudes when trying to get our order straightened out, and owner/manager was unwilling to give a decent conciliation for our trouble.  Will never return.  Being treated like we were is unacceptable, especially when we acted civil and to the point.   Here is a list of follies that occured during our "experience" at Mama Gina's.  1.  Ordered an appetizer.  Was convinced by our waitress to try the garlic knots instead, only to find out when our food arrived 35 minutes later that they didn't even have any to bring out.  Sidenote:  After about 20 minutes we inquired on the whereabouts of this item to our waitress (20 minutes for some garlic bread is a little much) and she said she would go check...apparently that didn't happen.2.  Wrong Pizza delivered to the table.  After inquiring about the order since it was taking quite awhile to arrive and we had a movie to catch.  The wrong pizza was brought out.  We had ordered a 16 inch BBQ Chicken pizza and a 20 inch Supreme was delivered to our table.  Honestly, it wasn't till 15 seconds after it was dropped off that we went... uh.. wait a minute... this isn't what we ordered.  Immediately went to find our waitress to let her know.  She went to her manager and they said they could make us the right one but we'd have to wait.  Pending our time issue with the movie, this wasn't an option.  Since we couldn't wait for another pizza to come out the manager said we could either take a 20% discount on the pizza or just leave and not pay.  At this point, we were starving and the movie was starting in 10 minutes.  Didn't really have a choice at this point.  I agreed to the 20% discount so we could at least have something to eat before we sat for another 2 hours without food.  (Side note:  couldn't eat much considering one of the items on the supreme includes an item that my date has a slight allergy to.)3.  Wrong discount.  Once the bill came, we were charged for the pizza that came to our table.  Which was $9 more than what we originally ordered.  Making even the 20% discount they were offering a total more than what we were expecting to pay in the first place.  Waitress ended up paying for our beverages to help offset the cost.  Also, when speaking to the manager, he said we should have let him know sooner that there was an issue.  How were we to know???  The only thing we knew prior to the food coming out was that it was taking FOREVER to get to the table.  ... and that we did bring to their attention.  I truly dislike writing reviews that are this scathing but I just couldn't believe how we were treated by the management.  If you are in the service industry, and the mistakes are with your establishment, then do not make the customers feel as if they are the ones at fault.  I just don't believe they tried to make this better for us.I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately I won't be returning.The customer service is STELLAR. I can't stress this enough. They went above and beyond to accommodate and did so with a smile. Fat tip for them!The outside patio is great, especially during this time of the year. It's spacious and a delight for people who like to look at something other than a wall, as you can see all of Westgate from their patio.Food and drinks... this is where they lost me. Pizza has absolutely NO flavor. Mozzarella sticks had no cheese on the inside. Wings were decent but nothing special. They don't serve margaritas because there's no blender... I thought that was interesting. The bill came out to $75 for one pizza, wings and a sampler. It just wasn't worth it.This pizza here is way overpriced and even worse is that the flavor is just average.  The pizza has okay sauce but is just average in terms of toppings.  However, it's so expensive relative to what you normally pay any place else so it's really just because of the location that you have to pay more for this pizza - not worth it.

MY PREFERRED CHOICEThis pizzeria may not have all the bells and whistles nor sing happy birthday, but this family operated business serves tasty pizzas. Seating capacity is just below eighty with TV screens anchoring each corner of the restaurant.. Whenever I want to watch a Bay Area sports team, Terry the co-owner and his crew will accommodate without hesitation. Terry's family happens to be originally from the Bay Area.While munching on my Mikey's (named after Terry's brother) Special slice of pizza, Greek salad and sipping on one of my favorite soda drinks Dr. Pepper, I watched the "Dubs" take on Jeremy Lin's Houston Rockets.... unfortunately GSW didn't have enough gas in their tank to drive it home for the victory. BTW speaking of drive... don't forget on Wednesday nights starting at 7 PM, come and join in on Terry's "Cruise Night". Check out all those hot rods and funny cars.Update:  Sorry to mention... No more NFL package since they dropped Direct-TV and switched to Comcast.

In the last couple of months this summer we had 2 new thai restraurants pop up in Downtown Phoenix, both no more than 2 blocks or less from long time Thai establishment Thai Elephant.  I guess we shall see how great the demand is for Thai in centeral PHX with at least 5 Thai restaurants within a 2ish mile radius.  After seeing they had openend on my walk into work and not having packed my lunch that day.  I decided to see if they have a website and check out the menu.  Humm....not bad. So I called in my order just before noon.  Panang curry lunch special, chicken, medium..."that will be ready in 10 min", she replied and hung up the phone.  She didn't take my name, I guess she was confident or they didn't get many carry out calls.  I walked over and it was ready and waiting for me.  The little restaurant was bright, clean and teaming with an active lunch crowd. I took my order and walked back to my office where I opened my bag to discover a covered bowl of creamy well seasoned Panang curry (next time I will order it hotter) sliced chicken breast, bell peppers and a side of steamed broccoli and white rice.  I quickly tossed the broccoli into the curry and began sipping on this delightful curry sauce.  Now I am a bit picky since red curry is of my my favorites and I can make it at home (live in the boonies and you learn to make the dishes you love and can't get without a 2+hr drive).  This was quite tasty, but the Duck Pineapple red curry at Siam Thai is still my favorite red curry in the valley. Thai'd up...you've caught my attention!It's humorous to read other reviewers issues with the service at Thai'd Up, as when we went this evening, and we thought the service was fabulous. My friend John G. and I shared the Crispy Tofu appetizer, Panang Curry and Spicy Drunken noodles. All were superb! I love the hot chili paste which I added to my dishes. The Drunken Noodles was fierce! I have never had anything so peppery, but yet so clean tasting. Delicious! Our bill came to $40 which I thought was a good value considering we had two entrees, 2 bowls of rice, an appetizer, Thai tea and 2 coconut ice cream. To top it all of, we received a 10% Yelp discount! So be sure to check-in if you have a smart phone. What makes this eatery particularly special is its proximity to the light rail. Great location, great value and great service. Highly recommended.

Review Text :
Last week, a group of us went into the Mellow Mushroom restaurant in Tempe to have a "quick" lunch before a 1pm meeting. We got there at Noon, ordered and then waited, and waited, and waited. At 12:50pm I told my waitress that I had a 1pm meeting and please run my card now so I can take my food and run to my meeting. Well, I get my food at 1pm and it is the wrong order. Argghhh!! So I have the waitress send it back to the kitchen and have one of my coworkers bring it to me, but I am still waiting for my card which I gave to her 10 minutes ago and I have to go this meeting that I am already late for. My co-worker signs my card and I get my cold food later and again it's the wrong order. I eat it anyways and can't lie, it tasted really good.Fast forward to today, where a co-worker and I had another 1pm meeting. We decide to work through lunch and order take out from them and give them another chance. I make our orders at 12:05pm and the girl says that it will take 20 minutes. So I go to pick them up at 12:30pm and they aren't ready. So again, I wait, and wait, and wait. While I am waiting I hear the kitchen manager and a server talking about a table where the customer was not so happy about having to wait so long for their food and was trying to get a discount. At that moment I hear the kitchen manager refer to the customer that is arguing this as a "douchebag". My jaw just dropped at what I have just heard. I have to go outside because I don't wanna hear more. So I continue to wait until I get our food at 12:55pm, 30 minutes after it was promised to me, we end up having to eat our food during our meeting. Uggh. Now the food is great here, they do an great job at this but the customer service is absolutely dreadful and that is being nice. Surprising because there is usually 25 people working in there at one time. I do not recommend Mellow Mushroom unless you have a lot of time and patience, and don't mind the kitchen staff calling you "douchebag" and other names behind your back. I'll passFirst restaurant in Arizona! Great spot for a late night snack while walking through Mills. Since it was happy hour, we ordered a couple drinks, which came out to be too artificial and sweet for our table. We decided to order the chicken wings, the stuffed portebello mushroom, and the five guys pizza with five types of mushrooms.The chicken wings were pretty standard, but a good starter snack. The portebello mushroom came out cold, and we could not enjoy it at all, so we sent it back. What a bummer. The pizza, on the other hand, made up for the appetizers. The thin crust was nice and crisp, and the toppings were fantastic. We really enjoyed the pizza and finished it within minutes. I would recommend sticking to the pizza and maybe skipping the appetizers if you're not that hungry. Our total came out to be around $45 which was pretty reasonable as we also got drinks.

Going here the other night may have very possibly one of the most fun nights that I have ever had.Okay, so it's a little dive bar, nothing too unique about that in Vegas.  But it was the sign out front that made me stop my car, throw it in reverse, and drive back to see if I read the banner correctly:Porn star karaoke.It's true!  Monday nights at 10:00, porn stars call it a day from their jobs and come to this rather cheery bar with a good vibe to belt out some tunes.  And everybody is super nice.  From the great bartenders to the hostess who has apparently been in over 26,000 films.  At this point, all boasting rights I've ever had as an actor are laid silent, because I am never going to beat that.So the initial call to new wacky situations was strong enough to summon out the missus, my good friend and I to sit, drink cheap, tasty drinks, and belt out tunes alongside a whole cadre of adult film actors.  And they can sing.  And they also flash more than a few boobs while singing, so if that's also your thing, then there you go.  They even play some crazy games, of which my friend won a prize.There may be too many highlights to list, but I think one of my personal favorites was being able to stun a group of porn stars into open mouthed wonder with my rendition of Michael Jackson's "Rock With You".  I thought about singing "How Deep Is Your Love" from the Bee Gees, but that's perhaps too tacky and obvious.  But they have a sense of humor, so who knows?I've done a lot of karaoke, and I've been to a lot of bars, but nothing like this.    I would completely have to recommend the Red Label on a Monday night as a "must do" Vegas experience.  It's hilarious, quirky, and way too much fun.I can't wait to do this again.....I think it is about time I create a Yelp review since I have been here many times over. I feel that each time it has gotten worse by far with more complaints with each visit. My first complaint is the bar and bar staff as they are always understaffed on busy nights.We only attend on special bbw nights which is usually on a Saturday night. The fourth Saturday of every month to be exact. You would think for a special group function that they would have extra staff on hand to handle the crowd.The staff is not friendly and they NEVER have drink specials which is a let down since they have one beer special. I recently found out that they do not honor their advertised Yelp check in which is not cool. There is no excuse for having a Yelp check in offer and not honoring it, that is unacceptable.  The ventilation sucks and there is zero air conditioning, it is hotter than hell in there and when busy it is BAD! Especially considering they are hosting BBW dance parties. I mean come on us big girls get HOT!I am done with this review, I am over it. This place sucks! I will not visit again due to the rude bar staff as it is a complete turn off!

This was the first time I had a bad experience at this location, but it was so frustrating! I informed Associate #1 that I was ordering a salad. Before I could say anything else, he proceeded to throw a tortilla on the flattop with cheese. When he walked back, I had to inform him that I didn't want cheese. He just looks at me, then turns around, throws a container on the tortilla, and turns back around. Trying to be helpful, I asked my fiancé what he was ordering and it was also a salad, so I told Associate #1 that he would take that tortilla. No response. Oookay. So I quickly tell him, "I'm having a vegetarian salad" before he could assume anything else. Also, since it was Thursday, there was a tamale meal special that I hadn't tried. I wanted to give them a whirl, so I asked Associate #1 if I could order one as a side item, since I didn't want the meal. He seemed confused and I asked a couple different ways, but he eventually answers, "Yes." Then, it's on to Associate #2. She seems nice enough, until I ask her a question, then she appears obviously annoyed. I say yes to all the vegetables, but no cheese. She asks me what type of dressing I want and as I'm attempting to formulate a sentence to indicate the dressing that is Vegan-friendly (I couldn't remember the name of either of them and she didn't tell me what they were, but just kept asking me which one I wanted), she starts scooping the creamy one into a cup. I'm like, "Um, ah, uh, I meant the other one...the Vegan one???" While trying to point through the glass. "It's vinaigrette." Right. Then she just tosses it haphazardly to Associate #3, but it lands in the tortilla strips compartment. Nice. While she's finishing up, I began to wonder where was my tamale? Me: Um, I ordered a tamale in the side....Associate #2: Did you tell him? (pointing at Associate #1)Me: Yes.Associate #2 to Associate #1: Did you get the tamale ready for her?Associate #1 has the look of "Oh crap, I forgot" on his face and gets it together. Associate #3 was great and asked if I wanted sides with the tamale (rice, beans, pico, and lettuce). Sure, why not. I also asked for no cheese.Now, we are at the cashier.Cashier: Sure you don't want two tamales? It's the same price for one.Me: Uhh, what??? I asked the guy if I could order a tamale on the side and he said I could.Cashier: Oh. Weird. So you want the other one?Me: Um, okay...well, yeah. If I'm paying for it, I might as well.We sit down and I'm pretty annoyed. I've barely started eating when the cashier walks over to bring us the tamale.Cashier: (as she is handing us the tray) Oh, did you want cheese on that?Me: (staring at the obvious, melted cheese on the tamale): Uhhhh...Cashier: If you don't want it, that's fine. We can make another one.Seriously, why would you bring it over with cheese on it and THEN ask me? Or better, why didn't anyone bother to ask Associate #1 or Associate #2 about how I had ordered the first tamale just a couple minutes prior?So $25 and one (disgusting) tamale later, I didn't finish my food and Ieft feeling disappointed and dissatisfied (really, two tamales and two salads for $25 with bad service, no thank you). Additionally, for a salad I typically love, I had absolutely no desire to eat it tonight nor will I want to again in the future. For an establishment that has the appearance of promoting Vegetarian and Vegan options, it seems to be a bother to every associate to request NO cheese melted on the tortilla and NO cojita cheese (and cilantro, which Associate #2 also didn't bother to ask me if I wanted or not) topping my salad. If I hadn't received such amazing service in the past where associates have asked me whether or not I wanted certain items or concerned themselves with what I want on my meal, then this experience wouldn't have stood out so much.Ok Cafe Rio, I'm very disappointed with you. I eat or at least used to eat at Cafe Rio about 1-3 times per week. I can agree with some of the other reviews regarding customer service, but I always ignored it because they generally make my food correctly. Plus the food is good and portions are huge. Well, I recently took a break from dairy, which makes me very sad, but it is what it is. Considering I usually order the grilled chicken tostada with creamy Ranch type dressing I was pretty nervous that it wouldn't taste the same without dairy. My friend recommended I get avocado instead of sour cream. Great idea, right? So I order my salad, no rice, no cheese, no sour cream, no dressing. Oh wait can I sub avocado for the sour cream? Counter guy: doesn't answer, just puts it in my bowl. Ok. Great. I get to the checkout and the cashier tells me it will be $. 95 to add guacamole. So I ask her, even though I didn't get cheese, sour cream or dressing? She doesn't reply and just adds the extra to my total. Normally, I may have said something, but I'm so tired of having to argue or complain to receive appropriate customer service. I think I'll give my normal Cafe Rio another try (on Eastern) but if I get the same treatment I may just be over this place. Obviously they don't care about my business. It's frustrating because the amount of guacamole that you receive is paltry. I mean for a dollar I should at least get a full scoop. I used to rave about this place to anyone that would listen, but now I'll take my business to a place that can accommodate my dietary restrictions.I've never been a big fan of Café Rio, but given it's convenient location and online ordering, we decided to pick some up for a quick dinner last week. We placed our order and left to pick it up in the time scheduled. We arrived at the restaurant and the food wasn't ready yet. We weren't in a huge hurry, but they seem a little disorganized at this location. It took several people to handle our checkout and when they said my mom's bowl wasn't ready because the chicken was still cooking and would take another 15 minutes, they offered us a different protein. Since we didn't want the rest of the food to be sitting out while we waited for the grilled chicken she changed to shredded chicken. It was only after we decided that did we realize they hadn't even made the rest of the food yet, so there was really no need to change the order. The food was ok, but I don't see myself going out of my way to return to this location with better non-chain restaurants in the area I'd rather give my money to.

Restaurant name  Midwood Smokehouse

Review Text :
Well, color me impressed. Midwood Smokehouse was really, really good! It's sitting at a 4.5 stars for me right now, but I imagine it will jump to 5 in no time. Not that I'm surprised, frankly...because Frank Scibelli seems to have the magical touch when it comes to delicious and well-formulated restos in Charlotte. It's a great location (parking can be tricky) with wonderful, friendly service and tons of tasty items on the menu. Here are just a few things I tasted...1) Pork platter: 4.5/5: Succulent, tender and delightful. This pork platter rivals Mac's, in my opinion. The meat is very smokey - due to the fabulous smoker they purchased for this establishment. But it's a good kind of smoke, no Liquid Smoke here. 2) Hush puppies: 4/5: Crispy outside, soft inside and damn good. 3) Sweet potato fries: 3/5: Good fries but paled in comparison to the other decadence on the table. 4) Bacon wrapped jalapenos: 4/5: Not nearly as hot as you'd think but a really flavorful starter. Make sure you eat one that has the bacon all crisped up. No one wants sad, soggy bacon.5) Queso with barbecue: 4/5: Um, I love queso. I also love pork barbecue. Put them both together and voila! Instant amazing app. 6) Banana pudding: 5/5: Hell to the yeah. Homemade deliciousness. With vanilla wafers. This is the real deal and you must order it. I don't care how full you are. I have a big ole smokey crush on Midwood Smokehouse. Looking forward to going back and checking out the patio!Can't believe I'm just now reviewing Midwood Smokehouse. Having BBQ aplenty in Crown Town, you've got competing businesses who want that coveted, smoky place on your palate. I'm happy to say that Scibelli has done it yet again!The locale on Central Ave is a bit tricky for parking. Pulling into the compact lot amongst other cars whizzing by on their way to Uptown can be a bit of a hassle, but it's all worth the struggle. Parking on the street is available, too. Be mindful of your space. Be sure you don't inhabit private spaces or any of the adjacent businesses lots as it my result in towing. Venture in to the cozy dining room, patio or rooftop and treat yourself to the bacon-wrapped jalapenos. I can barely muster enough words to describe their culinary beauty. Smokey, cheesy, spicy, bacon-y glory. If you're sitting at a table amongst bacon lovers, more than one order will be required. They go fast. If you're in the mood for a sandwich, the Superbird is wonderful. Smoked turkey, ham, bacon, avocado mayo, tomato on a texas toast. I'd get it again in a heartbeat. The brisket is great. You can order a lean plate, if you're not wanting the fattier, yet more tasy, cut. The sides are where it hits home. Creamed corn that is out of this world. Spot on mac n' cheese, greens like mama used to make and smoked veggies. You can even order 4 as a meal for $9!Do yourself a favor and order hush puppies, too. Fantastic flavor and crunchy texture paired with their tangy BBQ sauce. The service is splendid. Friendly, fast, and very knowledgeable of the menu. Great job to our server Ben!Look forward to each visit. These guys are making a name for BBQ in Plaza! Cheers!Midwood is still the go to place for bringing your out-of-town guests to show them the great Queen City barbecue. And so I met my Minneapolis buddy here! Great service from our waitress, who kept the conversation going and kept the beers filled.We split a plate of the pimento cheese fries. Plenty here for three, but we put a good dent in it. Lots of great cheese, good grilling that toasted the fries and melted the cheese all the way down.For barbecue, my friend had the four meat sampler and enjoyed it. He said that the sausage was particularly tasty. I had the pulled pork, with mac & cheese. It did not need any extra sauce. The pork was chopped fine, which made it a little mushy. Next time, I'll go for the sliced brisket perhaps.Overall, still great to visit and still great to bring your visitors.

Yum yum... after having a fun afternoon at the Desert Botanical Gardens and walking thru the Yucca and Aloe exhibits, my mind had locked onto the idea of getting some yucca for dinner. hahaSo what did I do?  Well, I came home and Yelped 'yucca'... quicker than a snap, up popped a variety of restaurants and bars in my area.  Well, after skimming reviews on each of them, I picked the restaurant that was the newest and more reasonably priced, Inka Fest.  An hour later, my roommate, my guy and I were sitting at one of their tables, trying to decided between the many delicious-looking options.  We appetized with empanadas and fried yucca and ended with Bistec a la pobre, saltado camarones and saltado pollo.  It was all delicious!  Seriously, I'd reorder any of the 3 dishes.  The only note was that the restaurant was a lil quiet... could've used some musica in the background.  It was interesting to see the Peruvian channel but it would have been better to have captions on the TV and music playing in the restaurant... for the non-Spanish speaking patrons. I'll definitely be back.  I'm still thinking about my shrimp saltado!See ya there. :)

I was so excited to right this review for a new place up north on the east side of i-17 just north of Jomax.  It just opened and it didn't seem like they could handle all of the business on a Saturday night but north Phoenix has needed a place like this so bad that I would be lying if I didn't tell you I love it.  The food is nothing special really but it served its purpose, we ordered chili which was pretty good, chicken fingers the kids loved, quesadilla, chicken wings, and 2 beef tacos all decent.  The fact that I can go there and have a beer with my family while my kids play on a playground and my friends play horseshoes all while a live band is playing and a big grass area for kids to play also makes this place awesome.  There is no waitress service so you have to get in line to order food, and it kind of reminds me of Salty Senoritas over in Arrowhead but without the servers.  The whole place must be on over 5 acres or so, it looks so big and they also do weddings and stuff like that.  I am sure there is much more to tell but I only came here once after our soccer game Friday night and I think it will be a regular stop for us now.

If you 'n yer partner ever pass along about Wickenburg way, you can rustle up some purdy fair vittles and frozen custard right here.This here Tastee Freeze ain't one of them there Weinershizzle ones neither.  It's got it's own thing a goin' on with pizza which I ain't never tried but I have set down with one of them there cheeseburgers.  I had them folks throw some grilled onions and bacon on that critter too.  It weren't one of them high falutin Fezburgers like them fancy city folk eat off of Central down there in Phoenix but it was purdy tasty.  I reckon out here in dusty ole' Wickenburg it stands just fine on it's own.  Yup.God's honest truth here as well, when I sauntered up out of this waterin' hole a long tall cowpoke tipped his big ole' hat in my direction and offered up a polite "How-do."

Yay for new restaurants!  Yay for fun new restuarants!  And a final yay for a good exerpeince at a fun, new restaurant!I always love walking into a restaurant which looks super duper tiny from the front and then surprises you by being large on the inside.  The colorful pictures and art make it a bright and fun atmosphere.  Just like you'd expect from a 24/7 Mardi Gras party, minus maybe the flashing!First time's a charm with this place!  Service was fantastic!  The server came up and explained everything to us in terms of drinks, apps and main courses.  Since it was for lunch I went on the light side with the Crawfish and Sherry soup and the Nola salad.  The soup was delicious with just the right amount of kick for me.  Sometimes if things are too spicey for me I become a watery mess, and not in the emotional way!  I think the soup was just creamy amazingness!  The salad was also very fresh with some great toppings such as candied pecans and my personal fav, little mini potato chips.  Of course the later mentioned doesn't end up making a salad healthy, but whatever, it was tasty!  For a final send off we ordered the fried artichoke's as our "dessert."  They were incredible!  Nice, crispy and huge with a spicy mayo type sauce.  I'm all about the sauces, so it was just the right touch.I really can't wait to try out this place for dinner and/or a happy hour!  I will definitely be back.  I hope they have some idea's for events, because I think the place will be a great host for special parties.  Great addition to Market Square!!

Seriously?   $23.99 for linguine and clams?  I really wanted to have a closer go-to for well done simple Italian since Baci moved to QC, but this was just awful.   The menu is not extensive; so you'd expect that what is on there to be reasonably priced, and very well done.    My husband and I were turned off by the bizarre scented candle / restroom smell in the dining room, so we ate on the patio... with the bugs.   The restaurant is very recent, so you'd think they'd have the lights outside all in working order.   They're not.    The service was outstanding; Marcie was clearly a pro - but no level of service can make up for gamey canned clam bits on boxed linguine. We'll drive to Baci next time.

After a little winning in the poker room, the husband and I did some shopping at the Forum Shops and ended up deciding on lunching here and are both thrilled we did.Both the service and the food way exceeded our expectations and we wished we had a little more time to have eaten here again before we left.We shared tomato soup that came with a small sliver of a delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We also had the warm goat cheese salad with a wonderful green goddess dressing and finally, we shared a french dip sandwich with a side of yukon gold mashed potatoes instead of french fries. Our waitress was great, refilling our drinks and even splitting our sandwich so Kevin could have cheese on his half and I could have mine without it. It was a great French dip and a great meal overall!*Happy Hour Review Only*As if Vegas visitors weren't SEXED up enough, here comes $1 oysters for your aphrodisiacstic pleasure (so good it deserves a new word)! Every day happy hour from 2:45-6pm features a different oyster on rotation. Been here a few times and every bite has always been deliciously fresh. It comes with creamy horseradish, vinegar-shallot or cocktail sauces for your choosing.PJ Clarke's also offers $3 beers and 2 for 1 drink specials for their cocktail of the day, but neither is as good of a deal as the oysters. The beer comes in a mug the size of your hand.Bottom line. When you're done shopping, take a seat at the bar (oyster or regular) and order a dozen happy hour oysters. Then turn around and say hi to me, because I'm likely camped out there. Added as a MUST VISIT for my Vegas trips!I stumbled upon another Happy Hour spot on the Las Vegas Strip over at P.J. Clarke's which is daily from 3pm to 6pm.  Their headliners are their $1 freshly shucked oysters and their $1.50 burger "sliders."  You'll see why I put quotations there on sliders.I ordered a half dozen of their $1 oysters. http://bit.ly/WYjLmuIt really doesn't get any better than $1 oysters at Happy Hour.  Who cares what oyster farm they came from because they're $1 each!!   Nicely sized and pretty good!Now check out PJ's Famous Slidershttp://bit.ly/XADMzKNow you know why I put quotations.  Sliders?  Are you kidding me?  To me, sliders are little burgers that you can stuff in your mouth with one or two bites.  These suckers were huuuuge!!  Very tasty and also complimented the oysters very well.  It's almost a steal at $1.50 each.Washed it all down with a $3 Blue Moon which is another great Happy Hour deal.  So all together, half dozen oysters, two sliders, and a Blue Moon came to a whopping $12 before tax and tip.  Awesome!!!I'd say next to the Prime-time Bites at Palm Restaurant, this is probably one of the best Happy Hour deals on the Strip.  I'll definitely be back for this deal again!I came for Dana's Happy Hour UYE. Happy Hour is normally served at the raw bar or the alcohol bar from 3-6 daily. The main draw is the $1 fresh shucked oysters, but there are other treats as well. They have their other bites that are on their happy hour menu (which you can see online on their site, all various prices $6-9), 2 for 1 cocktail of the day, $3 draft beer, $6 prosecco. While I knew from signs it was at the bar, we were able to sit at a table. The BF and I chose Lagunitas IPA and Tenaya Creek Hefeweizen to drink since they were included in the $3 choices, which is nice as we only drink craft beers. We started off with a dozen oysters which were Crystal Pointe and they were delicious. Lovely, fresh and creamy. We got another 8 and those ones were a different breed, I cannot remember the name but it was double the size and a bit more briny. I know it was a Ca one. Also very fresh and good, but I preferred the first kind. They give you migionette, cocktail and horseradish. They pick the oyster for the HH, but depending on availability I guess it changes. We also got the cod bites which were really delicious. It was 3 small fish filets, but very fresh and fried to a crisp with a solid sauce. Also got a slider each which were good, but standard. They are a decent deal at $1.50 each though so I would get some to fill up if you're making a meal out of the happy hour. Service was pretty good. We got a waiter who was all worried since he found out we were Yelpers and he was the new guy who just started, but he was good and attentive so nothing to worry there. What he didn't know, he went to go find out for us.While it was happy hour and a good deal considering the quality, it racked up fast! For top notch oysters this is on the shortlist.(Yelp 100 Challenge 47/100)I organized my UYE here and got to hang out with fellow Yelpers Jade, her boyfriend Scott, Kevin, Molly, Julia, and briefly Anthony. The company was definitely great.We were here for their HH which offered $1 Oysters from 3pm-6pm, reduced prices on appetizers and beer, and buy one - get one cocktail of the day. Since it was an organized event we were able to take advantage of the HH items at a table instead of the bar. I started off with half a dozen Crystal Pointe oysters. They tasted incredibly fresh and I knew six would not be enough. Next dozen of oysters were California oysters but I don't remember the variety name. These were large, meaty and filling. Very delicious and fresh. We were provided with Tabasco  sauce in addition to mignonette, cocktail and horseradish sauces. I also had their Cod Bites (picture provided) which were $9.50 for two decently sized pieces of battered cod. It was perfectly cooked with great flavor. They also offered $1.50 sliders as well. The food and the oysters were fantastic. This is such an amazing deal for FRESH, high quality oysters. The server was friendly and accommodating. The only bummer was their cocktail of the day...it was just  vodka cranberry.REVIEW 365 OF 2013!!!YELP 365 CHALLENGE (LA Style) - Crushed and DeMELished!!!Met up with a few close friends to celebrate the GF's birthday. I've heard of the place, seen it, but never had the opportunity until now. Let's start with the restaurant itself.  I thought that the actual restaurant is clean and loved the ambiance because it wasn't packed for a Holiday weekend.  The menu is just a basic one pager with food on one side and wines on the other.  The first thing to catch my eye with PJ Clarke's menu is the sticker price.  Here, you get your choices of different steaks, lobster, fish, burgers, and a few different appetizers.  The prices are a bit high, but expected since it's on the strip and in the Forum.  This is a chophouse and their steak and seafood entrees are about what you expect to pay for on the strip.  The portions looked just about right too.  My gripe about the prices is on their other food outisde of steaks.  Everything outside of their steaks were a bit over-priced.  I wasn't in the mood for steak on this visit, so I ended up with their Cadillac Burger (Over $20).  No frills, above average taste, but not worth the price tag in my opinion.  We had tater tots, calamari, and onion strings for appetizers and felt that all three were little on the salty side.  Terri R had the Lobster Mac and I thought it was pretty good, but a touch on the salty side too.  Service here wasn't the best. From where we were at, you can hear the chef yelling at that the staff and our server wasn't the most attentive.  First, he took forever to take our order.  When our orders finally came in, he just dropped off the food without even asking if we needed anything else.  Yes sir, ketchup would be nice with our fries. Please, some dipping sauce for our onion strings would be great.  A knife would be perfect with my meal, but I guess a butter knife is all I get.  I also got an allergic reaction from my dessert (my fault).  All I needed to hinder my nauseousness was some crackers.  Our server was too busy chatting with his buds that I had to wave for another server to take care of us.  The sad part...our group was big and the tip was automatically added.  That means that our server got close to $100 for doing almost nothing. Overall, not the biggest fan of PJ's.All is not lost though.  I still had a great time with friends and the birthday girl, Terri R.  Happy Birthday to my GP!!!  If I could rate the restaurant based on the great time we all had during dinner, it would be 5+ Stars for sure.  PS:  Read the reviews...seems like Happy Hour is the way to go here.  Maybe, I will be back.  But for now, 3 stars is all you get, PJ Clarke.

Review Text :
Wandered in the other day after leaving Echo Coffee... They haven't officially had their grand opening, but they were indeed open. Still in the process of getting menus printed and figuring it all out, but that doesn't mean they don't have the pizza down. First off - I can't tell you how glad I am that this corner is getting good tenants. I worked across the street a million years ago when it was Scottsdale Video, and I used to frequent TT Roadhouse. The corner always seemed to have so much potential other than a spot to bottom out your car crossing the intersection. I'm just happy to see some nice stuff pop up. Hopefully it'll turn the ill parts of the neighborhood around.Anyway, I only had a slice, but it was flavorful and delicious. I'm looking forward to having another. Pepperoni was spicy and the cheese and sauce were as well. It's a little on the greasy side, but that's what napkins are for. I like the decor and the owner is a nice guy. It's a little small, but it's nice and new and clean - and it's in a new building. The more pizza options in the Valley, the better.This place has good pizza, very nice comfortable atmosphere and great customer service. I went to lunch with some co-workers and had a large pepperoni and hot wings. The wings weren't anything to write home about, but what can you do? The pie had good ingredients and tasted great. I will be back.

Review Text :
Amazing!  A wonderful tasting menu of Chef Andrés' avant garde Spanish cuisine.  We were served 20 small bites and 5 wines over approximately 2.5 hours.  My favorites were the Apple "Brazo de Gitano", José Taco, Bocata de "Calamares" and my slice of the "Whole Lobe of Foie Gras Baked in Sea Salt"It's not cheap - $250 plus tax/person - but this price includes food, wine AND gratuity.  They have two seating per night at 5:30 and 8:30, and only 8 diners per seating so the experience/service is unmatched.  And while I don't make enough money to call anything 250 bucks an absolute steal, compared to many other high-end restaurants in Vegas I wouldn't hesitate to call é a bargain.If all you care about is getting as full as possible for as little cash as possible, the Cosmopolitan Hotel has a wonderful buffet one floor down which I'm sure you'll enjoy more.  If you love interesting, innovative, delicious food, and are willing to pay for some superior ingredients and service, é is an experience that shouldn't be missed.One more thing... reservations are only available by e-mailing a not-so-secret anymore address - reserve@ebyjoseandres.comI'm very torn about our experience at the E Bar, as its called.  On one hand, the experience was ridiculously amazing; it is nice being diners #140 and 141(since the place has opened).  But on the other hand, the food was not. It's challenging to come up with an appropriate star rating to balance out the two.  It's also hard since the price was $250 plus tax/per person.  As the previous reviewer mentioned, that price does include food, wine, gratuity, and an awesome experience.  I keep asking myself if it was worth it...I'm not sure that it is.The evening was a special one though.  We arrived, checked in at the reservation desk and were waiting to be seated for the 8:30 seating.  One of our 'hosts' came to us, letting us know that we would need to wait for a bit, as the previous seating was wrapping up and they were preparing for our seating.  She would like to know if I would like a glass of cava while I'm waiting.  But of course!  So we're chilling in the Cosmopolitan's fun little sitting area (with billiards, checkers, funky chairs, etc.) enjoying some cava while we wait.  As we're finally seated, much of the busy Jaleo watches the 8 of us as we walk into the private E room.  There are 8 of us seated, with 5 people making sure our evening went smoothly.Anthony, our specific server, was funny, helpful, and hooked up the wine.  Frankly, I didn't care for most of the wine as it was incredibly sweet.  In fact, most of the dishes had more of a sweet element to them rather than salty or savory, which was what I was looking for.  All dishes were served at one time by the two chefs, so we needed to coordinate bathroom breaks over the 2.5 hour meal.  When it was an appropriate time to go, Anthony walked me all the way to the restroom; what a gentleman!Some of the highlights of the evening food wise were the Beet Jewelry (salty, crispy, gold-dusted--yum!), caramelized pork rinds (there's nothing like making chicharrones high class!! haha), the smoky oysters in escabeche, secreto of iberico, and, the star of the night really, the Jose Taco and artichoke with caviar.  The Jose Taco was a lovely slice of Jamon Iberico de Bellota with a dollop of caviar on top, to be rolled like a taco (really a taquito, i think).  YUMYUM!!!  And the roasted baby artichoke with caviar and quail egg inside. Divine!  I would like ten more of those please, rather than some of the flowery, fruity dishes we were given.The most disheartening thing of the night (other than the bill, haha) was the Whole Lobe of Foie Gras baked in Salt.  I love Foie Gras, seriously.  They showed us this beautiful lobe that has been crusted in tantalizing sea salt and baked.  I was very excited.  We were all given our own slices; they were sitting there, glistening in the plate, waiting to be devoured.  Then they poured an orange juice type sauce on them.  Travesty!!! It ruined the Foie Gras.  The texture was mushy and all I tasted was juice.  Why, Jose?! Why?!I know this review reads a bit like a schizophrenic's journal, but this is how I feel about E by Jose.  The experience was once in a lifetime and the staff could not have been more accommodating.  But the food was, overall, a disappointment, especially for the price.  Bottom line: I guess it's both a yay and a nay.José Andrés has brought umami back. But, he's not only brought it back, he's redefined it. Think of it as umami 2.0. With 20 mouthwatering courses, his avant garde brand of sweet and savory cuisine will slap your taste buds around like a night with Ike Turner and Chris Brown. This is dinner theater at it's best. It's a 2.5+ hour interactive show in a private room located within Jaleo. After checking in at the hostess stand we were seated at a table in Jaleo and brought complimentary glasses of cava while the previous seating finished (There are two seatings of 8 per night at é at 5:30 and 8:30). When ready, we were escorted to the back and entered a space beautifully designed by the Rockwell Group and Spanish designer Juli Capella. Two of the walls are lined with card catalogs with several drawers open and holding artifacts that tie into memories from José's past. It's an intriguing space that's equal parts Dali, Pan's Labyrinth, and Alice In Wonderland.In the center of the room is an 8 seat bar where the chefs create and plate the evening's meal. Much of the actual "cooking" is performed out of site in the Jaleo kitchen but the plating is done in front of the diners at the bar. Throughout the evening there was plenty of interaction with the chef's and we were encouraged to ask questions and learn more about the chefs and dishes. It was cool to see them at work. Who knew tweezers and pipettes were such important kitchen tools? Each dish was a work of art... a really delicious work of art.I'm not articulate enough to describe how creative or tasty each dish was. So if you want a complete breakdown of every course you're better off reading this guy's review: http://www.kevineats.com/2011/01/e-by-jose-andres-las-vegas-nv.htmlBut, here are a few notable dishes that I loved:- Beet jewelry. Playful, crunchy and delicious. I never thought beets could be so amazing.- Membrillo and la serena cone. A flaky cone filled with a creamy, tangy sheep's milk cheese.- Bocata de Calamares. An homage to the calamari sandwiches Andrés used to eat on the beach, this sammie had uni in place of calamari and it was delicate, briny masterpiece.- Cigala with Roses. Typically, I hate foams because they add little to dishes. But here, it added a noticable texture and flavor to the lobster.- Secreto of Ibérico Pork. The best dish of the night. The best piece of pork I've ever tasted. This was the pig equivalent of A5 kobe beef. Amazing!- Frozen Apricot Coulant. Similar to a chocolate lava cake in that you cut it open and liquid oozes out. It's a delicious and unique fruity dessert.- 25 Second Bizcocho. The best microwaved food ever. It had the texture of a sponge cake and had a creamy filling.Honestly, I could probably list a few more dishes that I loved. There wasn't a *bad* dish all night, but the weakest were the two they had to supplement because of my apple allergy. I can't fault them for that.The service was exceptional. Truly the best service I've ever experienced. There were two hosts (and I say hosts because dining at é is like dining in their home), Anthony and Stephanie, who were able to accommodate dietary/allergic restrictions, serve and clear dishes throughout the night and answer any question we had. It was professional but not stuffy. They're also not shy about keeping your glasses full. Wine was included in the price and Anthony and Stephanie were generous with the pours all night. It was like dining with an open bar.The price for the meal, as others have mentioned, is $250 per person. That includes wine, gratuity, and tax. In order to get reservations you have to email them. It's best to plan ahead and email them at least a month before you'd like to dine there. If you're a local, the more flexible you are with your dates (a weeknight instead of dining on a weekend) might make it easier for you to get in. For out of towners, make sure you tell them the dates you'll be in town and they'll try to fit you in. For me, after I initially emailed them I got an automated response right away followed by a dining reservation a couple weeks later.In the end, é was the most entertaining and amazing dining experience, although not necessarily the *best* meal ever. But, I'd put it in the top 3 that I've had. It's pricey but worth it for a once in a lifetime experience and a peek inside the mind and food memories of José Andrés.Everything about my experience at E by Jose Andres was Five Star.  From the Golden Ticket I received in the mail the day before my trip, to the last bite of Saffron scented Chocolate at the end of the evening made this one of the best Food Evenings of my life.My Golden Ticket promised, "Culinary delights that you have not imagined."  E delivered on that promise and  more!  On arrival, I was given a glass of Cava while I waited to be escorted to the private dining area that is E.  I don't usually comment much on decor, but I was struck by the intimacy and personal nature of the space.  I can imagine Chef Andres has a study designed in the same manner.  I also appreciate the fact that the communal seating has wheelchair accessible seats cut into the bar.  It allowed me to have the  same experience as the other diners. Now onto the food itself:1) Frozen Sangria with Grilled Strawberries. Made table side with Liquid Nitrogen, the Sangria had all the flavor of its liquid cousin, but provided an interesting temperature contrast to the Caramelized Strawberries.2) Spanish Clavel. Hardest item to describe. An  amazingly light bite with a thin wafer made from yogurt and flavored with a Spanish Flower. Vague enough?3)Beet Jewelry. Rings of dehydrated beet, dusted with Gold.  So much flavor in such a small bite.4)Caramelized Pork Rinds. Best. Pork Rinds. Ever.  Salty, Sweet, Spicy, Crunchy goodness!5) Apple "Brazo de Gitano". An Apple flavored Sponge Cylinder filled with a bleu cheese espuma.  Another great combination of flavors and textures.6)Jose Taco. A thin rectangle of Iberico Ham with a dollop of sustainable Caviar. I expected this to be salty beyond belief, but there was a sweetness to the caviar that made this one of my favorite bites of the night.7)Artichoke with Caviar and Quails Egg. Again, the interplay of tastes and textures was amazing. Earthiness from the Artichoke. Richness from the Egg. Sweet and Salty from the Caviar. Another great bite and I am not a big fan of caviar.8)Membrillo with La Serena Cone.  My least favorite item of the night. Goat Cheese and Quince Paste.9)Bocata De Calamares.  A tiny tiny version of a Lobster Roll using Uni as the protein.  This was so good they could start a sandwich shop with a larger version!10)Ajo Blanco. Modern version of a Spanish soup made from Almonds and Garlic. The Almond Soup was poured over a bowl with several different components including Sliced Almonds, Ground Almonds, Microgreens, Grapes and a Granita ( I can't remember what it was).  This was much mellower than the preceding dishes.  That is not a bad thing! In a multi Course event like this I find that sometimes my taste buds need a rest!11)Cigala with Roses.  Perfectly cooked Langoustine with a floral note from a Rose flavored foam.12)Smoky Oysters in Escabeche. The Oysters were smoked in a little globe in front of us.  What actually made these wonderful was the accompanying Onion Confit and Toasted Honey Air.13)Roasted Turbot with Black Garlic. The fish was the star but The Black Garlic added its intense sweetness and pungent undertones.14)Foie Gras Baked in Salt.  Best Foie Ever. The salt dome it was baked under gave  it an amazing texture.  A wonderfully tart Citrus Sauce cut the richness of the dish.15)Secreto of Iberico Pork.  A rarely used cut from behind a Pig's Shoulder Blade was served with Chanterelle Mushrooms and Black Truffle.  This was full of Earthy, Rich, Meaty, Porky Flavor.   It had a texture that was far from soft, But  worked with the rustic nature of the dish.16)Orange Pith Puree with La Serena. That wonderful Goat cheese reappeared in the first Dessert Course.17)Frozen Apricot Coulant.  Sort of a fruit version of a molten chocolate cake. This time the outside is an Apricot Ice and the center is an Apricot liquid.  Very light and refreshing!18)Apples and Red Wine "Freddy Giradet".  Vanilla Bean Ice Cream with Red Wine Glazed Apple and Apple Spherifications. Another fun and inventive course that also tasted great.19)25 Second Bizcocho. A light, airy Citrusy Angel Food cake actually made in a Microwave. 20)Chocolates.  Saffron Scented and Chocolate "Air" brought the evening to a sweet end.We had several spirits that enhanced our experience.  With the first few items we had a Pastrana Manzanilla Sherry. It was clean, delicate and slightly yeasty.  It went very well with our first few courses.Next up was actually a beer. Estrella Damme Inedit. I am not a beer drinker but  It actually went very well with our fried oilier items.Third was 2008 Mengoba Godello y Dona Blanca Bierzo. Another very light wine that kind of got lost with all the flavors of the food.Next was a 2009 Guimero Mencia Ribiero Sacra. This went great with the Foie and Pork.We finished with a classic 1982 Don Pedro Ximenes Sherry. Dessert in a glass.Service was outstanding and as I mentioned before, they are extremely wheelchair friendly.Yo! To all you legit foodies in the house.  This place is da bomb!Ok, now that I have your attention with my lame ass hook, seriously, you people need to check this out.  $250/person.  Not stuffy at all.  A ton of fun.  If you really do truly love inventive food (picky eaters opt out) then you will LOVE this. And at $250 per person including tax, alcohol, and gratuity (although you will want to tip more when you are done) it is such a bargain!  Plus, for people who don't drink, the chefs and servers say that the non-alcoholic offerings are extremely inventive.  They seem quite eager to serve them.  I think they just need advance notice.The process: First, send an email to reserve@ebyjoseandres.com with a variety of dates and times that you would like to go.  Give a bunch of choices.  There are only 8 seats, so keep that in mind.Next, wait for confirmation.  If you are lucky, you will get a reservation and they will ask for more details including any allergies and if there are any non-drinkers.  Eventually, you will get golden tickets in the mail and a very nice note. (Yes, snail mail.)  Yay!  Very Willy Wonka.Next, show up at Jaleo at the Cosmopolitan promptly.  Anthony (one of your servers) will be waiting at the hostess stand and will psychically know who you are.  Especially if you are the dope with the golden ticket in your hand and a stupid grin on your face.Next, enjoy some cava (a variety of sparkling wine) at the bar and meet your foodie companions.  At your respective reservation time (5:30pm and 8:30pm are the choices), you will be escorted to an exquisitely designed room separate from the rest of the restaurant where three chefs and two servers will prepare and serve the best food in the world right in front of your eyes.  It's essentially a 3-hour conversation about food, while you pig out.  And, yes, there is stripper dust involved.  http://eat.c-bas.com/2011/03/14/e-by-jose-andres/  But it's all good. :)The other reviews and all the blogs go through all the courses in better detail than I ever could.  For example, see http://www.kevineats.com/2011/01/e-by-jose-andres-las-vegas-nv.html and the link above. Just let me say that this is a best meal I have ever had and I've been to Guy Savoy, Joel Robuchon/L'Atelier, Masa (NYC), French Laundry, Per Se, Le Bernardin... need I go on.  I'm a food and service snob (when I expect quality), and this is the best.  I actually closed my eyes in bliss during many of the courses.  The servers, Anthony and Stephanie, are fabulous. The chefs, Edwin, Brett, and Johannes, are also terrific.  Very knowledgeable and so willing to share that knowledge.  It's so much fun and we made some new foodie friends.  What's better than that?WOW!  One of the top three restaurant meals I have ever had.  Food: At E, I had the best dish I have ever eaten, crispy chicken skin in escabeche(chicken skin and chicken oyster).  My other favorite dishes of the night were the mini brioche street food sandwich that contained uni and the secreto of Iberico pork.  At most tasting menus, there are a number of dishes that stand out negatively.   At E, I enjoyed every single dish!       Service: Two servers provide unpretentious, friendly, professional, and flawless service to the eight diners per seating at E.  In addition, the chefs prepare food in front of the diner seating and explain the dishes as they are served.Reservations: email reserve@ebyjoseandres.com with some dates you are available and they will get back to you.  I was lucky enough to email at the beginning of the week and got a reservation for 2 later in the week!Cost: They recently changed their menu so food is 160/person.   Drink pairings are around 100, and non-alcoholic drink pairing are around 50.  My dinner for two with drinks was around 650 after tax and gratuity.Pictures: They let you take camera photos as long as you don't use a flash.Pros: Excellent service, interesting presentations, great foodCons: Expensive ($160 (food) + $120 (drinks pairings) per person)If you're down for foodie adventures and you're willing to spend some money for great food and service, you should check this place out.First of all, you have to make a reservation via email (i.e. reserver@ebyjoseandres.com) up to a month in advance.  When it gets close to your reservation date, you get mailed golden tickets (a la Willy Wonka style).On the day of your reservation, you actually dine in a small room with 8 seats.  All dishes are prepared in front of you.Here are some notable dishes:Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche - Perfectly seasoned chicken skin and chicken oysterUni slider - I love uni. You should too.Secreto of Iberico pork - It's like the filet mignon of pork. Moist fatty deliciousnessOverall, great experience.  Our servers and the chefs were super nice and willing to answer any questions that diners might have.  The only issue is the food is a little pricey for my tastes.However, if you're looking to celebrate a special occasion and want to witness molecular gastronomy in person, give this place a try.This was one of the best food evenings I have ever spent.  I made my reservation through their process about a month ago.  While I originally requested the 5:30 seating, there was a singleton space for the 8:30 so I went for it.I showed up about 8:05 and handed my gold ticket to them.  I was then escorted to the bar where I had some ice water and started to meet my dining mates for the evening - Greg and Lindsey from Glasgow, Scotland.At about 8:40, we were escorted into the separate dining area that has a horseshoe shaped table with 8 seats.  Behind the table was the staff ready to greet us, tell us a few rules, and encourage us to ask questions about anything.  Then the dinner started.Over the next three hours, the staff made some of the most creative, tasty, and beautifully plated dishes I have experienced.  Since the room seats 8 people only, generally four servers each took 2 plates so all 8 of us were served in unison.  I had the non-alcohol drink paring which gave me a chance to have spirit-like drinks along with the other diners.  And in two instances, my food or drink was not laced with alcohol but with lemonade or some other substitute.Each of the 20+ courses was explained.  We often had questions about technique, ingredients, or other matters.  One of the chefs came out of the kitchen to explain the red mushroom we enjoyed and explained why it was red and whence it came.The staff is amazing.  They are friendly, always smiling, and always enjoying what they do.  I really felt that I was a valued visitor.The room - oh it's quite different.  Two walls are lined with card catalog boxes to represent the knowledge Andrés has built up in his mind over the years.  There's a bustier which know one explained on the wall and a ladder with high heels on the rungs.  Very creative and innovative!Midnight was almost upon us as we finished the dessert courses.  We then signed the guest book - I was diner #1693.  I then passed the book to Lindsey to sign and so we went around the table.I recommend this to anyone who wants to try something very different and wants to find out about molecular gastronomy.  It was truly a very delicious and memorable evening.  All the staff at é made it outstanding with food and service!Dammit, e', you suck. Besides the fact that I still don't know how to pronounce you, you've ruined me. You've ruined any five star rating I could possibly give because none of them will really be able to compete. Yes, this includes the five stars I gave to Popeye's whose chicken is dabombandyoucanallsuckitifyoudisagreebecauseIvebeenknowntoeatanentire10pieceboxinasinglesittingbitches.Even then, five stars to Popeye'e and five stars to e'? That doesn't seem quite right. Six stars to e'? Wait a sec. Ten piece box of spicy chicken for $8.99? 20 course meal at e' for....a mortgage payment?OK, I guess things equal out in the end.Yeah, this isn't an everyday kind of meal place. It's a special occasion, once-in-blue-moon-and-if-that-moon-were-rich-and-crapped-gold-in-your-lap kind of place. We didn't care though. It was my birthday and my wife wanted to see me happy. She sure enough saw me grin through the foodiest douchebaggiest experience of both of our lives and my wife rules.I won't go into too many details since most Yelpers have repeated them ad nauseum. My dishes were pretty similar to most others with the exception of the ever-changing "Catch of the Day." (Ours was turbot for the record.)The chicken skin was memorable. The secreto of iberico ham rave-worthy. But it was the "chickpea" stew that made me actually swear a series of expletives into my bowl. I believe I was quoting the celebrated poet Lord Byron when I muttered into my bowl, "You've got to be fucking kidding me" and "I'd eat this shit off of Bin Laden's bloated, decaying corpse."There are only eight seats, sidled up to a high-top bar. I think that a diner's experience would depend heavily on their surrounding companions. Fortunately, after a few courses (and some flowing wine), we all warmed up to one another. Jose Andres is famous for encouraging diners to play with their food and play we did. Observations were made and notes were shared. "What did you think of this?" and "Could you taste the jasmine in the foam? So did I!" One of us had the vegetarian option and she described in detail her obviously different experience. My glutarded wife requested the gluten-free option and she did the same for the others. I and one other had sprung for the full alcohol pairing, but after the ninth pairing, what seemed to us a cogent and eloquent discourse in which we deconstructed every layer, aroma, and lovingly created component for our dining companions was most likely, when I think back on it, a couple of guys who sounded like the Hulk and Cookie Monster trying to read a restaurant review out of Parade magazine. None of us cared though because we had a ball. Yes, your individual experiences may vary, so I hope for your sake, you get a fun group.The service was professional and precise. The staff introduced each meal and fielded questions. They were upfront when needed, stayed in the background when not.A few final notes: 1) You get to take home a menu, which answers the question, "How do all these Yelpers remember what they ate to put in their reviews?" 2) You also get to keep your golden ticket. We actually never received ours in the mail, but they made sure we walked away with a couple. 3) the coffee is not part of the meal. You'll be charged for it. Nothing in Vegas is free, yo. Stupid coffee. 4) If you're on an iPhone, good luck checking in. Or doing anything on that phone for that matter. This restaurant exists in an AT&T blackhole. If you're meeting friends afterwards, make sure your plans are well-defined beforehand. 5) We never got to sign the guest book. In fact, this last note is my only gripe in an otherwise perfect night. Guestbook, man, guestbook! How can I prove I was there?! I mean, other than the pictures. And receipt. Oh and the menus and golden ticket.All right, just forget I said anything.We had reservations for Friday Feb 10th. We had followed all the rules for getting the reservation (emailed at midnight on Jan. 10th). When we were told we had the reservation a few days later we immediately sent in the confirmation form with credit card info.  All was set. Then on January 21st we received an email saying that our dinner reservation happens to fall on "Valentine's Weekend" so they are going to charge an additional $100 per person. And were we okay with that? So to recap: we followed their rules, made the reservation and then they decided to just change the rules. We're not naive--they will of course easily fill the spot at the new price ($250 per person before the $155 per person wine service.) so essentially they don't have to care whether we say yes or no. There's a line long of folks eager to take our place.But that doesn't make it okay.  It is unconscionable to treat people like this.  I realize this is Vegas and money is all that talks. But on some level doesn't this scream about the lack of professionalism? Jose Andres is a great chef, but he should be ashamed of the business culture he has given his name to. We canceled. No meal, no matter how delicious can make up for being treated with such indifference.A tour de force of Spanish cuisine.  A meal at E is a dining experience capturing the excitement and joy of discovery through food and conversation.  This exclusive restaurant within a restaurant is a tapas bar on steroids.  Modernist cuisine at its finest as molecular gastronomy collides with traditional techniques.  This is one of the greatest foodie adventures bar none.There is no menu.  The offerings change with the seasons.  Unfortunately, the incredible salt crusted foie from the fall of 2011 is not a part of the current winter 2012 offering.  All good.  The ingredients are incredible.  From selections of sublime, umame packed cured ham to the sweet earthiness of roasted Iberico pork to the salty brininess of quality caviar everything works to create flavor explosions.Sure, every course may not be to your liking but with the huge number of courses, you are sure to find something you can't live without.  The progression of dishes is very bold.  Courses compete with one another, with each making a bolder statement than the last.  Utterly incredible.  Desert lovers rejoice, the meal ends with multiple deserts.  The only way to describe them is WOW!Opt for the wine pairing.  The selections tie the meal together perfectly.  The entire evening is engaging.  You watch the chefs prepare and plate the majority of dishes right in front of you.  Conversation between the chefs and your fellow guest is encouraged.  It is an extremely social meal.  Just wait until you start sharing wine from the porron.  Unintentionally missing your mouth and pouring wine on your face and down your neck is a real ice breaker.There is only one way to make a reservation at E, through email.  Don't bother calling the Cosmo.  They can't help you.  Send an email request to reserve@ebyjoseandres.com with the number of your party (not to exceed eight), and a range of dates and times.  A restaurant manager will respond and ask about any food allergies and dietary restrictions.  If your restrictions can be met and if there are openings, your invitation will be confirmed.  You will receive your golden tickets via SNAIL MAIL.  Bring them with you.Probably the best $250 you will spend at a top restaurant anywhere.An open mind and open heart?  You will have the time of your life.  Highly recommended!WALLAH saved the best review for last as I catch up on writing reviews tonight!I'm Customer #3339! Yes, each guest that dines at this restaurant gets their own number.  Makes you feel kinda special I guess.We got lucky with getting reservations here exactly a month in advance so it must've been meant to be :-)  Each seating only seats 8 guests; 2 seatings a night. I've been to Alinea in Chicago few years ago so I knew what to expect.  I think I may have actually enjoyed e by Jose Andres a slight more maybe because it was more interactive and intimate experience because you sit in a curved table watching the chefs semi-prepare your meals. The amount of prep work the chefs had to do to orchestrate the 20+ courses was quite remarkable.  The details and intricacy of each dish was impressive. (astericks tagged next to dishes I really enjoyed)        1. Rebujito - alcoholic drink they stirred up and topped with foam reminded me of this drink I had at the Lobby Lounge at the Modern (formerly called Edition) hotel in Hawaii.         2. Spanish "Clavel" - beautifully shaped into a flower and served in the palm of Jose Andre's hand. Tasted like candy        3. Beet Jewelry - they said to eat it off your pinky finger like a ring. Dusted with gold. Tasted like beet chips with a savory sweet taste. *        4. Caramelized Pork Rinds - ehhh wasn't too into this        5. Apple "Brazo de Gitano" - light airy texture and sweet. we were confused why it seemed like it was starting out with "dessert" like courses.       6. Nitro Almond Cup - wow, this was genius. It looked like half an egg shell with caviar and cream in it. The chef said to eat it quick because it will melt so I put the whole thing in my mouth. Quite a surprise. **       7. Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche - not a chicken skin fan but this was quite delicious. tender chicken on crispy skin topped with foam.       8.  Jose Taco - caviar wrapped in proscuitto - nothing special, it was as you could imagine.       9. Olivia Sferica Ferran Adria - olive juice in a bubble so it pops in your mouth and tastes like an olive. they process to make this sounded quite intricate.       10.  Bocata de Calamares - similar to the sandwich but of course with a twist. It had a huge piece of sweet uni from Santa Barbara. **      11. Cava Sangria - a SHOT of alcohol in the same bubble like thing as the olive.  whew, woke me up!      12. Artichoke "puree" with Vanilla - it looked like sato imo (small japanese mountain potatoes) but it was little artichokes. never had anything like that. It was in a nice dark sauce with lemon foam dressed on the side.        13.  Lobster with citrus and jasmine foam - MY FAVORITE! I love lobster and jasmine so pairing the two was heaven. The dish was beautifully plated with citrus segments.**      14.   Chickpea stew with Iberico Ham - this was a pretty dish you just wanted to just stare at and not eat. This was a favorite amongst the entire table. It was like a delicate cream stew with garbanzo dumpling like things.       15. Turbot with bone marrow - the moist white fish had a crispy skin and was complimented well with grounded coffee grinds on the side. The chef was raving about the bone marrow filled pockets but it was nothing special for me.      16. Rosemary wild mushrooms in Papillote - wrapped in a cellophane bag, this was like a mushroom soup with scents of rosemary, then topped with foam again.  One of the guest had a substitute of veal cheeks since he doesn't like mushrooms so we were all quite envious of that dish.       17.  Secreto of Iberico pork with squid - loved the pork and sauce. This dish once again topped with some green vegetable foam. *      Still not over yet....can't forget about the desserts!!!     18.  Orange Pith Puree La Serena - spooned goat cheese plated with sauces and thin piece of bread.      19. Flan - beautifully plated with four small pieces of flan and flowers and mint with shaved ice in the middle drizzled with caramel. I enjoyed watching them making this one.*     20. Pan Con Chocolate - was the least attractive dish but what a treat, my favorite dessert course. top looked like it was sprinkled with dirt but it was chocolate cake that melts in your mouth. Layers underneath had crunch which gave it texture to the creaminess of the dessert.**     21. "Arroz Con Leche" - arroz con leche in a cone made with melted sugar, kicks of citrus.*     22. 25 second Bizcocho - they said it took only 25 seconds to make this cake like volcano in the microwave. similar to a chiffon cake, very light. Dusted with gold.    23. Fizzy paper - crispy paper like candy but wakes you up with the strong citrus flavors.    24. "Air" Chocolate - just like the name, airy chocolate, one that was bitter dark and the other yogurt flavored.Yes we felt like we ate enough food that could last a week in our tummies but the memories would last for a long time.This is a very very expensive piece of culinary performance art. Dinner for 4 with two alcohol pairings and two non-alcohol pairings came to $2,000. Be prepared for that because the prices were very vague before actually getting the bill.The food was more unique and interesting than delicious. The drinks piled up on each other so instead of being paired they became muddled together over 3-4 of the courses. Yes, the courses! 24 of them actually. Many just a single bite.This should have been a 3-4 hour experience but was crammed into 2 hours and 15 minutes because they have to fit a second seating in. Seatings are at 5:30 and 8:30.We have had the tasting menus with paired wines for each diner at Picasso at the Bellagio and Joel Robuchon at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The food, the taste, the time given to enjoy and savor, the opportunity to compete the course and accompanying drink really were perfect. Dinner at each was all of four hours. You were not rushed and each distinct presentation were really outstanding. When the course and drink were completely finished, we had time to appreciate what we just enjoyed before the next course and pairing came. Dinner for 2 at Picasso was $600. and $800. at Joel Robuchon. We walked out without any doubt that it was worth the money. An obscene amount in today's world but extremely memorable.To be honest, I was disappointed in é by José Andrés. The presentation was really great but not as engaging as it could've been. The chefs could barely be heard and the courses were not really explained in a manner that you felt you could grasp. We had to ask over and over what it was that was being presented. We felt rushed and the courses came too quickly. If we had 4 hours, maybe the experience would have been savored more. Instead it was a jumble and a muddle of tastes and drinks. I really did not feel that the meal was worth half of what we paid mostly because of the timing.If you've had some of the chef's tasting menus at the other stellar places in Las Vegas, then try this. If not, it would not be at the top of my short list due to the excessive cost and the rushed feeling.On making reservations:It can be ambiguous and quite a challenge. It took 2 trips to Vegas for the stars to finally align for me to finally be able to get in. They have 2 seating a night and they seat about 10 people inside a separate room in Jaleo at the Cosmopolitan. You must email them exactly one month in advance at midnight Vegas time, which means if you are traveling from the east coast set up an email rule to send your email at 3:01AM. Also have several dates and times that you are available to increase your chances of getting in.On the dining experience:I dined here on a Sunday evening after a monster weekend in Vegas. This is definitely a social experience with the other diners sitting around the bar style seating. I felt just as comfortable dining here solo as I would with a date. About half the group were actually solo diners. Our group was young, funny, and very social. Don't feel pressured to do the wine pairing, although I heard it was excellent only 2 or 3 of the diners in our group did it. Plus we were greeted with a glass of champagne when we sat regardless of whether you ordered the wine pairing and one of the dishes was, as I would describe it, a large sangria caviar. So there is enough alcohol served if you wanted to drink light.On the show:The show here is the two chefs in action. Most of the dishes have been prepared somewhat in advance, but they are assembled and discussed right in front of your eyes. Some of the dishes came off like alchemy. Feel free to ask any questions you want, they are happy to discuss the dishes in detail. The 2 chefs/wizards said it takes 36 man hours to prepare for each service.Normally I would go into detail about each dish but there were just too many and you don't have a choice in what you eat. You just get to try everything. The dishes ranged from good to amazing. I've been to a handful of places that I would say had better food, but the presentation and creativity at work here is unmatched. On my visit it cost $199 + tax, I was told there was no tipping even after insisting. If you are interested or curious about molecular gastronomy then it is worth the visit. If like me the high price is tough to swallow, do what I did, look at it as a great Vegas show instead of a dinner you won't regret it.*Posted are a picture of the golden ticket you get when you make a reservation, their menu you get to take home, and a few of the dishes.OMFG!This was by far the most expensive and memorable meal of my life. My wife and I dined here about two months ago. We shared the drink pairing. Two meals and one drink pairing came to $666. Though dare I say it, it was TOTALLY worth it.I love cooking and trying new foods. If you do, too, this is totally the place for you. You will love it. If you're not a foodie and not into unique cooking techniques, you'll probably find it overpriced and won't fully appreciate it. That being said, it was the perfect place for me.There were four couples in our sitting. None of us knew each other, but we all seemed to be the same basic type. Foodies who make pretty good money but aren't exactly rich who are willing to pay for a one-of-a-kind once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.We all LOVED our food. In fact, at one point the chefs left to get something from the kitchen and one of the guys said, "Good, they're gone. Now we can lick our plates." We all chuckled but all highly considered it. No one wanted to waste one single drop of deliciousness.I would say my favorite course was the chickpea soup with iberico pork. The "chickpeas" were filled with iberico pork and chickpea broth. It was amazing. I had never had iberico pork and instantly fell in love.I am not a fan of desserts and there were quite a few served. However, I have to admit that I liked every single one of them. My favorite involved olive oil, cocoa powder and mascarpone or something similar. We were instructed to drag our spoons through the olive oil and into the cocoa powder. Sounded weird but WOW!My wife is a connoisseur of flan and said that hands down e's was the best she had ever had. I don't care for flan, but I had to agree this flan was delish! I could go on and on about every single course. But lots of people have already done that, and it would be very hard to truly do any of the courses justice.Aside from the food itself, the other awesome aspect was being able to watch the creation and plating of many of the courses. Everything was done with such care and perfection. The chefs used droppers and tweezers to carefully add the most delicate items. I was in awe throughout the whole dinner and was envious of the chefs who get to work with such great ingredients every day.About midway through the dinner, the chefs told us to look behind us. When we did, we saw none other than Jose' Andres. He was in town for Uncork'd and stopped in for a moment to see how we were all doing. We all expressed our amazement at everything we had tried thus far.When we finished our meal, I saw Jose' sitting at one of the tables in Jaleo. I asked one of the waiters if it would be okay for me to go up to him and ask for his autograph. He said that Jose' was being interviewed by a food magazine but should be done shortly and I could wait at the bar and approach him once he was done. I did so, and once his interview was over I was able to catch him before he went back into the kitchen. He autographed my menu and my wife took a picture of us. The people from the food magazine were still around and their photographer snapped a few pics too. It was a perfect ending to a perfect night.I mentioned earlier that this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. However, I can't imagine never going back. Maybe I should change that to a once every 5 years event. Or if I get a big raise, maybe once a year. Even my wife who usually gets upset when we go to higher-priced places as she thinks it's not worth it (and that's with a bill about 1/6 of e'), said that the meal was totally worth it.The tragedy of e' is that after my meal here, my body will turn the food that I ate into poop. This is a shame and it is insulting to the brilliance of the food that any part of it would wind up in a toilet(albeit in a severely altered form). I like to think that the food served at e' is not excreted like a typical sandwich, but it is instead ascended to a higher plane of existence somewhere in my soul. Yeah. That makes me feel better.e' is an incomparable dining experience that trumps anything I've had in Las Vegas. The experience is part meal and part show, where the chef will explain and answer questions regarding the preparation of each bite. Highlights include the turbot, chickpea soup, and assorted insane desserts. Some bites didn't blow me away(reduced olive) but I don't care because when something at e' shines, it makes you question everything you've been eating so far in your previously wretched culinary existence.The room is intimate without being claustrophobic and is decorated in an interesting way, with random oddities placed upon walls set to look like library drawers.So save up some money at your job, start a pyramid scheme, kill a hooker, cook meth, or win the lottery. Do whatever it takes to afford a nice meal at e'. Don't think of it as a super expensive meal - Think of it as a trip to a super expensive theme park where you get to eat some rare and delicious foods.One of the most intimate and unique dining experiences you will ever experience in Sin City!Having tried most of the fine dining restaurants in Vegas, I thought i'd seen it all til i was pleasantly surprised with a shiny golden ticket in the mail!When that fateful evening arrived on Saturday October 13th, I was like Charlie waiting in eager anticipation to finally visit Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.  Truth be told, I wasn't quite sure what was in store for me but i had a feeling it would be something good! In fact, as soon as we stepped into Jaleo, we were cordially seated at the bar and kindly given the drink menu for the evening on a handy iPad! Since I was feeling celebratory, i decided on the wine pairing with my meal and  as soon as our server found out it was my birthday, he gave us a glass of cava on the house! Now that's service IMO! After that, we were escorted to a dimly lit and intimate private room with a semicircular bar surrounded by wooden card catalogs housing Jose Andre's eclectic tchotchkes, which he apparently collected from his travels around the world.  At this time, the chef introduced himself and proceeded with a brief explanation of the evening's events.  Without a moment to spare, the chef and his skilled staff worked feverishly on the first dish. Liquid nitrogen began to billow over the counter and within moments, we were presented with beautiful bite size pieces of food art. About 20 or more dishes followed in succession, each skillfully crafted to engage and amaze!I must admit, I arrived with high expectations, but the chef and staff at é definitely did not disappoint. It was a truly unforgettable experience that was filled with intrigue and spectacle. An intimate showcase inspired by traditional Spanish dishes, masterfully executed by the talented chef and staff. é is bar none one of the most interesting and enjoyable dining experiences I've ever had in Vegas! With that said, it's an experience you should make when visiting the city because like magic, it could soon disappear!Happy Eats!I count my lucky stars that I am so fortunate to be able to finally eat at é by José Andrés.  It was a special occasion and we (surprisingly my husband included because he usually prefers cheap Chinese food over frou frou stuff) both thoroughly enjoyed the EXPERIENCE.  It was a precisely choreographed dance to put together these pieces of food, a play on textures, temperatures and flavors.  It was an experience with the art of food, and I'm not saying it with any disdain for snobbiness this time.  There were 24 morsels of delicious food - all incredibly creative.The short and sweet version: Precision.  Perfectly choreographed and executed.  Juxtaposition of Flavors and Textures.  Adjectives that come to mind:  Fragrant.  Whimsical.  Airy.  Crunchy.  Ice Cold.  Salty and Sweet.  Warm.  Fluffy.  Umami.  Crumbly.1.  Rebujito - our starting cocktail smelled like fragrant roses.  2.  Truffle Cotton Candy - whimsical, fluffy with the aroma of truffle.  3.  Idiazabal "Macaron" - delightfully crunchy with a cheesy filling4.  Apple "Brazo De Gitano" - Airy on the outside, creamy blue cheese "espuma" on the inside5.  Seta Suprise - Creamy 'shrooms6.  Nitro Almond Cup - NITROGEN cold (not just ice cold) and smooth on the outside, creamy/briny/salty caviar on the inside.7.  Barquillo - crunchy shell, aromatic Truffle and anchovy foam8.  Almejas Al Natural - spherical globules encased with the essence of oyster 9.  Bocatade Bacalao - warm, buttery brioche, savory cod, umami-licious?10. Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche - extra crispy chicken skin + foam11. Cava Sangria - Pop!  globule of sangria 12. Artichoke "Puree" with vanilla - creamy, mild, smooth13.

Flan - creamy, light and airy20. Pan con Chocolate - MY FAVORITE DESSERT OF THE NIGHT.  Crumbled frozen chocolate sorbet with cream, hints of saffron, crunchy sweet crystallized bread, and olive oil.  21. "Arroz con Leche" - Another well played piece on texture, temperature and flavor22. 25 second Bizcocho - fluffy cake with lemon cream23. Air Chocolates - wow.  bitter chocolate and I usually really like dark chocolate 24. Cocoa Paper with Dried Strawberry - airy light chocolate with tangy freeze dried strawberry bit$ to Value Ratio:  4.75/5 Stars... This is definitely debatable (my mom may think it's a complete waste of money), but I rated it high because my experience was impeccable (service was top notch, ingredients were top notch)Yummy Factor: 5/5 StarsTexture Satisfaction: 5/5 StarsAverage stars: 4.92 StarsWe were guest 4999 and 5000!  =)I was pretty impressed with E by Jose Andres.I would say the experience as a whole was near a five star experience, but the food and timing overall, along with the huge price tag set it back a few for me.The food overall was good though. The foie gras dish and Secreto of pork were definitely my two favorites along with the bocata de bacalao. The service was definitely top-notch and everyone was very attentive the whole meal. I loved the idea of the chef's cooking everything in front of you and it was interesting seeing the different techniques being used.I think my problem was that I was expecting too much from the meal. I expected that my mind would be blown by all of the food, but I only had that experience from one or two dishes from a meal with 23 different plates. I also think the two hour time slot was a little quick to fully appreciate everything. About an hour after the meal I forgot about every dish I had, due to the quick eating.Overall I was pleased with my experience at E. It is a little overpriced in my opinion for what you are eating and how much you are getting, but I guess its the overall experience that warrants the high price tag. The food was good, but I do not think you should go into this experience expecting the tastiest meal of your life, but rather a unique and exclusive dining experience that only few get to enjoy...This was an amazing experience for me.  People have described much of the food already, but I wanted to address some of the lower rated reviews.  I think what makes this a different type of meal than your average expensive restaurant is that it is actually an experience that requires some participation.  The seating is small (max of 8 people, my dinner had 6 total) and intimate.  Including myself and my SO, there were 2 other couples, and none of the pairings knew the other.  Our chef (Cody) started pretty even-keeled, and we didn't engage right off the bat.  So if you are quiet and don't feel like engaging, your shyness will reverberate through the room.I think the type of person who would enjoy this experience the most, or the proper way to enjoy it, is for someone to spark up conversation with your neighbors, the chefs, and the servers.  That energy will carry through the room, get everyone going, and make the night a very different experience than you would get at say Robuchon or Guy Savoy.So if you don't really like talking to strangers (and can be honest with yourself about it), maybe you're better off spending your money at some of the other blowout restaurants in Vegas.Ate here on Saturday night, March 2, 2013, 8:30 seating.  You won't be disappointed if you go here.  After reading all the reviews, my expectations were quite high...and they were met.   If you can, my only recommendation would be to be closest to the person that leads you into the dining room so that you're furthest away from the door.  Jaleo is quite a loud open seated restaurant and some of the noise from Jaleo drifts into e'.Other than that...have a good time and be ready for a $650+ bill.  $195 per person for food, $50 corkage, $92 auto gratuity, two cups of coffee, and tax.Once was definitely not enough for é by José Andrés.  I dined here in September of 2011 and I felt the need to go back and try some of the newer things being described by newer reviews.Last night's experience was just as good or better than my first time.  There were some dishes that were the same, but many were different.  Sitting in the private room with your fellow diners, watching the chefs put together the courses and watching their meticulous plating work is an incredible experience.  We had only 4 diners last night because the others couldn't keep their reservation due to airline delay.One of the dishes that I especially like is the dehydrated meringue filled with bleu cheese and topped with praline cream.  This was served both times I was here and it is superb!  One thing new last night was the foie gras baked in salt.  Exceptional when it was served with the citrus juice.Another dish of note was the crispy chicken skin with two chicken oysters.  Wow, such thin, crisp chicken skin and the wonderful oysters on the skin.  It was a delicate pick up to eat.One final dish of note, although they almost all are, was the ham and bean soup.  The ham flavor is in the broth and the beans are three large beans created from three kinds of deconstructed beans and reformed into these luscious, soft gems.  Wow!For anyone who wants to have an exceptional meal, make your reservations via email and do go.  It is pricey, but remember, it is both a show and a great meal all in one.  I'll wager some lose more in a couple hands of blackjack than they'll spend here.I am pleased to be guest #1693 and #6212.  In another year or so when they rotate some new dishes in, I'll go back and get my third gold ticket--one of the few things I save.I'll start with a cliche..."words cannot describe how good this place was"....but I'll try anyway. You have to get a reservation ahead of time. e does not have a website--more like a landing page with an email address. We were fortunate enough to get the 5:30 time slot during the busy memorial day weekend. It made me nervous thinking that we would somehow miss the reservation--since there is a hefty cancellation fee--so make sure you can go!We got our golden tickets in the mail--that made us feel very special. e is a private room in Jaleo--a Jose Andres restaurant in the Cosmopolitan. When you check in, they ask you to wait near the bar of Jaleo where you get an iPad menu to select cocktails. Then they direct you into the back room--which is big enough for an 8-person bar seating area. Everyone has an intimate view of the chefs assembling the dishes. Yes, it's expensive at $200 per person without drinks, gratuity included. But this shouldn't be compared to a regular dinner. It's a dinner and a show with exceptional service. There are two waiters for the 8 diners--that's impeccable service. Despite the price tag, it's not a snooty atmosphere by any means. The chefs talk about the dishes as the assemble them--and we asked lots of questions. It was so refreshing to be around fellow food nerds. Not to mention the food is phenomenal and utterly indescribable. This is what i would think of as advanced molecular gastronomy (although they don't really like that label). They play with your senses--and whatever your seeing in front of you doesn't taste like what you'd expect. Everything is inspired from Spanish cuisine. Every time I ate one of the 20+ courses, I said "oh my god!" My favorites were the courses that incorporated cheese--dessert was a bit of a let-down after all the wonderful courses before it. But still very good. You do get full towards the end, but you can take your time. Just prepared to be surprised. I highly recommend it --think of it as once-in-a-lifetime experience.To call é a restaurant is a huge oversimplification.   é is a mix of high-end restaurant, stage show, cooking school, and private dinner party that's completely different from anything I've ever experienced before.Reservations were hard to get.  Phone calls are a no-go -- and you have to email at least a month in advance.  Even then, a signed form and credit card guarantee are required before the spot is officially yours.  The work is worth it once that beautiful golden ticket arrives in the mail 2 weeks later.  (There are only two seatings per night, 8 people each.  If you *really* want a seat, it helps to be flexible with dates.)I went to é on a Sunday night, my last in Vegas.  I showed my ticket to the hostess at Jaleo, and she sat me at a table with the other guests waiting to be escorted into é's secret dining room in the back (which is awesomely decorated like a surrealist's library).  What struck me is how the people visiting é are *not* typical Vegas tourists and gamblers.  Apparently, é is a magnet for critics, bloggers, food photographers, (Yelpers?), and general gastrophiles -- in short, people who adore good food and adore talking about it even more.  It's very easy to make new friends at é!Once inside, we were introduced to Chef Cody Jeffs and his team of sous chefs and servers.  A server took our drink orders -- a glass of Sauvignon blanc for me -- from Jaleo's drink menu.  (FYI, é offers a very elaborate and expensive wine pairing.  Don't feel peer-pressured to order it.  Nobody in our group of 8 did, and everything about the experience was still fantastic.)Then the show began!  And what a show it was.  Twenty courses of world-class molecular gastronomy assembled before my very eyes.  Throughout the experience, there was lots of banter, laughter, clinking of glasses, and questions and interactions with Chef Jeffs.  é may be upscale, but it's completely unpretentious.  It's lots of fun, actually!  (The word I heard most often was "whoa!!!".)There were too many dishes to detail, but here's the basic rundown of what I tasted:1. Rebujito cocktail2. Brazo de gitano3. Nitro almond cup4. Barquillo5. Olives "el vermut"6. Merienda7. Crispy chicken skin en escabeche8. Cava sangria9. Fabes con jamon10. Lobster with citrus and jasmine11. Kokotxas al pil-pil (cod jowls)12. Lobe of foie gras baked in salt13. Secreto of iberico pork with crispy squid14. Torta pascualete with cotton candy15. Flan with shaved ice16. Pan con chocolate17. Arroz con leche18. Cocoa paper with dried strawberries19. 25-second bizcocho20. Chocolate assortmentMy favorites?  The merienda (a ham-and-cheese pancake-type creation) and the torta pascualete (a sweet-and-savory cheese dish).  The kava sangia was definitely the most unusual -- a sphere of booze that seems to evaporate milliseconds after I put it in my mouth.  A close second was the 25-second bizcocho (a cone-shaped cake "baked" for 25 seconds in the microwave).  Oh?  And the flan?  I've never had a flan as smooth and luxurious as the flan at é.  But really, there isn't a single dish at é that was less than sublime.  Chef Jeffs and his staff deserved their standing ovation.  :-)All the individual portions are tiny, so 20 courses of them left me feeling comfortably full but not overstuffed.  The staff at é even let me take home the menu (and a bookmark with my own personal guest number on it) as mementos.  The menu changes seasonally, so a new menu awaits those who wait 3 months before visiting again.Thanks for the amazing evening, é.  It's one I'll never forget!  -- David (guest #7279)This was supposed to be my Holy Grail of food experiences. I had heard nothing but great things about é, I just had to find someone to go with that would be just as excited as I was to try it. Luckily, I found two people! We made our reservations 2 months in advance, knowing that there was 3 in our party, and they only seat 8 at a time, we thought it would be difficult since we had an odd number in our party. Finallly, the night came, I really couldn't contain my excitement for what was about to happen. We were led passed the bar area into another room. It was very quaint, dark and had a Spanish vibe to it. We were introduced to the culinary team. Cody, the sous chef was really good at explaining what dishes they were plating, and what we could expect when tasting the food. Out of the 20 tastings, a couple really stood out for me, #1 Lobster with Citrus & Jasmin, #2 Secreto Iberico Pork with Squid. My favorite dessert was the Pan con Chocolate. Two of my least favorites were the Foie Gras and the Fabes con Jamón, both were so salty I didn't finish either one. We all chose to do the wine pairing, which actually had beer and cocktails in the pairing. The alcohol was fantastic, although they were a little skimpy on the pours. Towards the end of the evening, we all felt they were rushing us a bit. There was a couple that showed up 20+ minutes late for dinner, so we thought maybe they were trying to make up for that time, but not cool to punish the rest of us. Reason for my 4 star rating? Everything was good, but it definitely wasn't mind blowing. Dinner, wine pairing and tax and service charge came to $416 a person. It just didn't match up. I didn't think what I had was worth it. Like I said, I didn't leave mind blown. I def wouldn't recommend someone trying this as their first tasting.Dinning at e is one of the greatest experience in my life. It was more like a cooking show to me. Every dish was very elegant and interesting. There were full of surprises during this 2 hours show. I can't wait to come back to try their winter truffle menu!!!I do not say this lightly, however this was THE BEST dining experience I've ever had in my entire life! Quality: 5 starsRidiculously amazing.  Every dish tasted better than the last.  Jose Andres is known for his unique dishes and cooking style.  Every dish was unique, complex and deliciousService: 5 starsonly two seatings per night.  The reservations must be made via email and then about a week prior to your reservation you recieve willa wonka style golden tickets.  It's fun, unique.  They correspond with you via email before your visit to find out about your allergies ahead of time so that they can custom make your multi course meal for you.   During the dining experience itself, the head chef would plate the dishes in front of us and explain alittle bit about how the dish is made, what inspired the dish, etc.  So much interaction with other guests and the chef.  This is part of the reason why then entire experience was amazing.  Quantity: 4 starsfor about $500 for two people post tax and gratuity, I felt "comfortably full".  Considering it is a 8+ course meal, the meals were tapas style.  I do have an incredibly large appetite though.  My tablemates were full, however I am a gluttonous pig :(.  Would I return?YES!!! Everyday if my wallet was big enough!Other places similar places i've tried in order of preference:1. e by jose andres2. Joel Rubicon - best bread and dessert cart 3. Bottero (las vegas) - alright.  great foie however the rest of the food felt very standard4. providence (california) - i was very underwhelmed5.  Picasso (las vegas) - I did not like this restaurant at all.  I could not finish my entree bc it was so overcooked.  I had a better dinner at Todd english's olives for a fraction of the costWe ate here earlier this month (May) and I wanted to wait for a few weeks to see if my initial reaction would change in time but it hasn't and I still feel the same. To be fair, here are a few positive adjectives that describe the overall time we spent at e: creative, friendly, intimate, knowledgeable, team work, and dedication. At the end of the day though, shouldn't all restaurants have the attributes I just listed? At the end of the day, OVER RATED! OMG! I read all the Yelp reviews below that gave this place 5 stars and thought "WOW, this is going to be amazing, I can't wait", and instead, we walked away with, "WOAH! We paid almost $600 for THAT?! What a joke!" Later that night, we went to Aria where we were staying and ordered a plate of nachos and fries that was 5% of the cost and much more fulfilling. You may ask, "What about the experience"? Well, if you've never been to a "classy" restaurant, paid for $75 for a nice steak, had a nice glass of wine or seen the Food Network, then I will say it again, over rated. Yes, the staff is amazingly coordinated, top notch and its a fun place to watch the staff at work, but I'd rather go to a Cirque show.  There are hundreds of restaurants in Las Vegas and on the Strip and this place would not even hit my top 20 list. Of the ~18 dished we had, I remember having one bite of a really nice piece of steak. The funny thing is, they actually showed us the entire cut grilled and we thought, shoot, what is that 10 oz, we can eat that whole thing, but instead, we got one slice each. The freeze dried sangria (1st dish) was a bit weird but interesting.  The beet pita with brie cheese was different but not something I'd prefer and would rather go to a cheese bar.We made reservations a week prior to date we wanted and were lucky to get in. They made it so hard to give the credit card to reserve the time because they don't take phone calls and don't respond to emails on Mon and Tues. Maybe they think this process adds to their mystery and exclusivity. It's more inconvenient and annoying than anything and who really cares about a golden ticket and piece of paper that says you ate at e, not me. They asked us to arrive 15-30 minutes in advance to our seating and in the end sat us 15 minutes AFTER our seating time.  When you arrive to the Cosmo hotel, no signs or anything to tell you where this dungeon is- we had to ask about 4 people who worked at the hotel and then finally found it at the top level in the main Jose restaurant.And be prepared to sit in a dark room with random strangers who may get drunk during dinner with their pairing and start having unwanted conversations with you.Throwback to 5 years ago - I was at Chipotle one the way to Vegas and as I was eating my salad bowl I started to chew on a piece of plastic. I brought the item to the managers attention and they profusely apologized and gave me 10 coupons for free meals. Ok cool. At least they tried. Just had dinner at é tonight. Before I rant - the chefs, the service was attentive and friendly. The ambiance was interesting. However during one of the courses - which was a cheese and ham mini sandwich - I bitInto this scrumptious piece and pulled a piece of plastic from my teeth. Must be my luck in Vegas. The staff apologized and told me that they would take care of me in some way. Fast forward - I spent over $800 on dinner plus wine pairings for 2 and I did not see any service to reflect any apologetic gesture. Not a smack on the staff but if we're supposed to be treated to a magical meal - this was definitely not it. Most of the latter courses were salty and not refined - i wouldn't have minded the saltiness but to spend that much without any gesture to apologize for a basic mistake by a high end restaurant is rediculous.I hope E can raise their game and take care of their customers some day - but I won't be there to experience it-A reservation by e-mail only. A golden ticket mailed to your house. A website whose script is probably shorter than the URL that took you to it. It's when you have no idea what to expect that your expectations run wild.é by José Andrés is nestled inside the less exclusive Jaleo restaurant at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Two seatings a night, nine people per seating. Arrive at your predestined time and through a curtain you go into a dimly-lit room lined with cabinets filled with fanciful items of your imagination.Two chefs, a couple cooks, and servers all work around an open counter to serve a small semi-circle of guests in what seems like a nearly even staff to diner ratio. The atmosphere is quaint yet unexpectedly casual as the wine unwinds, and you become fast friends with your neighbors. The chef will also answer questions as she assembles your dish.The food carries an artistic and experimental element. Some have been deconstructed then constructed, liquefied then emulsified. Familiar flavors will take on a new textures that play with your perception.As with all art, not everyone will have the same taste; as with all experiments, not every trial will be successful. One of the dishes, squid stuffed with chicken confit, was the single saltiest piece of food I've ever tasted. The main course, ribeye with asparagus, was disappointingly safe and had a piece of sinew I could have lived without.The dinner totaled at over $800 for 2 with wine pairing and gratuity, but it's hard to place a price on an experience this unique. A globe of sangria that jiggles on your spoon then bursts into liquid as it hits the roof of your mouth imprints on the memory in novel ways.The overall experience is five stars, however I'd only give 3 stars to most of the courses...still averages out to 4 yelp stars.Service is unparalleled: from the promptly-returned emails to make this reservation a reality to double-checking that no food preference was overlooked, I was wowed by Kathleen's efficiency & attention to detail. Presentation: Nine coveted spots. A secret back room in another one of José Andrés' restaurants. It all serves to give the illusion of exclusivity, when in fact $195+/per person and a fairly flexible schedule gets you a Golden Ticket...literally. Chefs plate & create in front of your eyes, & a few dishes are served in boxes that need to be opened -- who doesn't like to be surprised? Food:* Timing was more fast paced than I anticipated, but no complaints, I can throw down 20+ courses in just under 2.5 hours! * There was no shortage of appetizers/small bites & desserts, but I felt there weren't enough main courses to be able to compare their handywork to other prix fixe menus I've tasted. However, from what I sampled, many of é's courses were only in the 3-star range (i.e. the "merienda" ham & cheese on brioche, lobster course, chicken oysters on crispy chicken skin, etc,.) * Relied heavily on foam to flavor, & airy things like cotton candy for texture, which didn't particularly impress me, however, I understand that keeping bites light is a must in a multi-course to-do. * Stand-out courses were: the cheese course, which mixed pungent sheep's milk cheese with brown sugar elements; any dish which involved piqueo pepper as a sauce or emulsion; the "mushrooms en papillote," which was simple, but uniquely presented; and the last dessert course called "more things," which were four sweet bites that popped, crunched, or fizzed. Also, really loved the non-alcoholic pineapple upside-down signature drink.The room, which is said to represent the mind of Chef José Andrés, is exciting, intense, & romantic.Wow. Just wow. My friend decided to treat me out to E for my 21st birthday (I'm a lucky girl) as Jose Andres is my favorite chef. After being mailed our golden tickets in the mail, we eagerly went at 5:00pm for the first seating (5:30pm). They only have two seatings each night of 8 people- so a total of 16 people per night. Reservations must be made months in advance to get the seats you want as it is difficult to score the perfect ones. They first sat us outside at a communal bar/ table with the other 6 people, and give a brief introduction of whats to come (20 concept dishes that Chef Jose Andres has created) and what kind of pairing you want. Having been to Jaleo before, I was extremely confused as to where and how E could be so well hidden. But alas, it was right next to the bar on the left back corner, and the hostess had the door open for us as we walked through. Upon being seated, we were immediately given a warm towelette wrapped in lavendar that was placed in a mold of Jose Andres' hand. The chef of the day, Alex, explained to us that everything in the room had a story to tell- such as the uneven ladder with shoes which symbolized the girl who got away, to the doll trapped in the cage- the one who didn't get away. On the sides, there were ingredients that have inspired Chef Jose Andres throughout the years. We got the regular alcohol pairing which came with wines, moscato, vermouth, gin and tonic, sangria, and more. The La Tomatila (i think thats what its called) is an amazing tomato water infused drink- must order! I dont even like tomatos that much but damn was this good. All of the dishes are plated in front of you, you are free to ask as many questions as you want, an explanation is given for all the dishes, and everything is served at the same time- service at its best.I would go into a detailed description of everything I ate, but that would only ruin the surprise for future guests. I will however, give a gist of what I ate and let imagination do the rest~ Edible Sangria that came in a Styrofoam box 5/5Cotton Candy 2.0- Cotton Candy Dumpling with Foie Gras Mousse and Hazelnuts 6/5 (best thing all night)Beet-kini- dehydrated beet manchego cheese sandwich (Chef Jose's version of a grilled cheese, the perfect bikini for summer) 5/5Coca De Recapte- sausage and foie gras? crisp 5/5Merienda- after school snack that kids in Spain got- basically a bun stuffed with goat cheese (I hate goat cheese and this surpassed my expectations) 5/5Smoked Oyster and Chicken Oyster- Definitely unique and extremely different. 4/5 Pescado en Adobo- Codfish stick- the fish is much thicker than regular deep fried fish, not enough sauce for me. 3/5El Vermut- Mussels- 4/5Cava Sangria- sangria jelly in a spoon that bursts in your mouth. 5/5Fabes con Jamon- Jellied Fava beans in a thick rich broth- not a big fan of beans, but wow. 5/5Kokotxas al Pil Pil- Codfish Jowls- first time trying these, pretty chewy but delicious. 4/5 Mar y Montana- sea cucumber stuffed with pork. really interesting take on this dish. 4/5 The lady next to me asked the chef if the sea cucumber was a fish or a plant....Mushrooms en Papillote- Chanterelle Mushrooms- smoked in a plastic bag and when cooked, the bag is cut for you to eat. wow. This presentation... 5/5Chuleta- bomb but small piece of steak. I was so full at this point but still amazing 5/5Dessert- Pressed Cotton Candy with flowers and creme underneath- best dessert I have ever had. I wanted like 10 of these. 6/5Jellied egg yolk- with some cream. again, super impressed. 5/5Rum and coffee- this one takes 20 min to prepare, so you see a lady stirring the drink while it is on fire at the side for awhile. 5/5Chocolate cylinder that cracks open with liquid inside and crumble.. most delicious chocolate dessert ever. 5/5Ring Box with Hazelnut Ferrero Roche type chocolate- 5/5 The last dessert- it was okay. Dont remember it much. 3/5Mignardises- the four treats on the dish were so good- I couldnt choose what to finish first. Anyways, I felt so repetitive talking about how amazing all the dishes are, but thats the truth. Everything blew my mind away.The intimacy of the room and the environment made this experience unparalleled to any other dining experience I've had. Not only was the food and drinks on point, the service and decor only added the cherry to the icing. The only complaint I have was one of the guests, who made a huge deal of everything she couldnt eat, not finishing, and requesting substitions. At the end, you receive a book where you write a message to Jose Andres, and a bookmark saying what number visitor you are (11,788). You also receive a menu to take home, but it doesnt say much- just the title of the concept. Total came out to be around $900 for two (including tip), as the alcohol pairing was pretty expensive as well. Although this will definitely empty out your wallet, the experience is one you cannot receive anywhere else.As others have reported, you email for reservations.  Email, provide credit card to hold reservation, then receive your golden tickets in snail mail.  Willy Wonka-ish golden ticket not needed when checking in as they have your contact info...20 courses of Spanish cuisine.They asked us to check in 30 minutes prior to your reservation to explain beverage options.  This would have been fine except they seated us 22 minutes late.  Minus points--ask us to be early yet seat us late.Plating only.  Meticulous and detail oriented, yet including preparation would've been true theatre as other yelpers have griped.  Chef and his staff lacked charisma--need personality.  They need to build up our anticipation, add/increase fervor!  Anticlimactic delivery...The all-important taste test... Underwhelming.  20 courses but not many wowed me.  Their centerpiece for this evening--their ribeye--did shine but not brightly.  Is this what Jose Andres is all about?  Bring in your fancy ingredients, impress my eyes, tease my nose, but let my tongue down... =(Tip included (quick glance looked like 20%).  Service was worth the 20% automatic gratuity.Would I come back here again?  Not on my short list of Vegas restaurants to revisit....Truly a tour de force of Spanish Cuisine.Four visits, the most recent in the fall of 2014, e continues it's reign atop Vegas' culinary scene.Seated in the bar of Jose Andres, glasses of Cava in hand, getting to know your fellow diners.  The hostess for the evening (and the sommelier) discretely interrupt each party to discuss water preferences and drink pairings.  As is Spanish tradition, always a little beyond the appointed hour, you're whisked away past the roaring fire and pans of cooking paella and into a secluded private, whimsical dining room.  Seated at a semicircular stainless steel counter, surrounded by hard woods and trinkets; representing the mind of the chef.   A hard knock on the solid kitchen door, the music of Spain fills the room, the chefs and servers enter and take their positions.  The experience begins.E is about molecular gastronomy and modernist cuisine.  Perhaps a solid, foam sangria that magically dissipates on the tongue leaving the distinct flavor of wine and fruits, a thimble of soup with the pure essence of Spanish Jamon, liquefied olives that burst with the salty, briny taste of the real thing.  Artistry, flavor and pride are showcased in each dish as the head chef works in front of guest and describes each dish.  Tip:  Wine pairings are essential.  They tie courses together and greatly enhance the experience.  Standard pairing $130, select pairing $300.  Opt for the select.  Incredibly well though out, running the gamut from sherry to 20 year cellared brooding reds, impossible to find whites and dessert wines.20 courses grouped in three "flights".  Flavors of each small "starter" build on one another, as flavors of each and their accompanying wine pairing flow and compliment.  The progression makes the diner appreciate temperature and texture.  "Mains" provide contrast.  Flavors held together by the wine pairings that span more than one dish.  Finally desserts, with the boldest contrast between each to keep the palate yearning for more.As always, with meals of so many selections, not everything will be to your taste.  All good, the next bite awaits.Service is beyond reproach.  Unpretentious, friendly, very informative, perfect.The experience for three diners with select wine pairing, incidental drinks, water, service and gratuity, $2,100.Michelin three star worthy and a must in Vegas.Notes:1.  Reservations by emailing reserve@ebyjoseandres.com  beginning 90 day in advance.  No reservations or replies on Monday and Tuesday.  No phone in reservations accepted.  2.  Credit card required to warranty reservation.3.  Base price; $195 plus 20% service.Entertaining, fanciful, imaginative, and quite delicious, é by José Andrés is one of the best experiences at this price range! We had the pleasure of enjoying this 16 course tasting menu with a wine pairing. Some of the courses were outstanding while others were just okay...most were quite enjoyable though. This was not necessarily the best tasting meal I've had in this price point this year, but it was certainly one of the most memorable and all around enjoyable meals I've ever had.Some of my favorite tastes of the evening included:Cotton Candy Empanada with Foie Manchego DaisySherry Marinated Clams and Liquid OlivesWagyu RibeyeLa Marianda Grilled CheeseMushrooms in a BagBeet KiniCrema CatalanaCoca De RapateAfter Dinner Mintand GemetaAs many who frequent this website know, é is moderately difficult reservation to make based only on the small intimate dining experience that seat 8 or 9 people at a time. They have two seating a night--doubling your opportunity to get in!!!...but obviously still very limited. I took my wife here for her birthday and first reached out to them several months in advance. They weren't able to take my reservation at that time, but shared the reservation process with me. A couple months later when the date was now within the three-month range that they use to take reservations I emailed them and found the method practical and easy to use.I was thoroughly impressed with é by José Andrés. I have talked to several people about the experience here and through those conversations I've come to the conclusion that if you're only going to experience one meal at this price every year or two, é may not be the best option. The food is playful and whimsical at é. Other places take the food slightly more serious and put out a better product, but é is much more than 16 courses or tastes. It is an affair uniquely encountered...an event unto itself. I don't know if there is a Vegas food experience I would rather participate in annually more than é.This is my first experience with molecular gastronomy, and it was completely mindblowing. The creativity and execution of each of the dishes was perfect, and I really enjoyed myself watching the chefs prepare each of the plates and make the dishes come to life. There were many favorites that night. I enjoyed the foie gras chocolate tart, the squid with rosemary foam, the edible sangria, the scallop with black truffle cream and black truffle shavings, the cotton candy with foie gras filling, the wagyu beef, etc. In fact every dish deserves 5 star on its own.I was particularly impressed by the potato sheet that was served as a side along with the black truffle gnocchi along with the beef. I thought it was a sugar glaze initially, but was completely mind blown to learn that it was made with potato.Definitely coming back again in a year to try out their new menu.PS. We were guests #12129 and #12130. PPS. Love that they actually sent out golden tickets in the mail!If you would like to make a reservation for this restaurant email them 3 months in advance. This is the email I received from them:"Thank you for your interest in dining at é by José Andrés!é is available Wednesday through Sunday with two shows per night, at 5:30 PM and 8:30 PM.

We respond to inquiries in the order they are received and as promptly as possible.Thank you,  and we will be in touch with you soon!"I recently created a unique food bucket list. This place allowed me to cross some items off my list AND provided me with an extraordinary dining experience.So with that being said, I told my boyfriend about this place ages ago. The good guy that he is, he made reservations 3 months in advance to take me here for my birthday! When the reservations were made, we did not know that it was going to fall on the weekend of Mayweather fight. So, the place was crazy and the other 7 people we dined with were actually there for the fight and were from out of town. When we arrived, we were seated at a table to go over our beverage options. As far as the alcohol pairing, we opted out of it. I honestly did not want my taste buds to be under the influence in any way. As the meal progressed,  I saw that the other people at the table seemed overwhelmed with alcohol at times; sitting with 3 glasses and needing to catch up. So I was very happy that we just stuck with water, because I went to eat, not to drink.  Here is what my courses were comprised of since they can change:*Drunken Truffles - presented in a box, these fluffy balls with a dusty exterior were interesting. But honestly, thought the flavors were too much. *Branch of the Desert- edible rice cracker centerpieces in cacao nibs. That was so cool and quite tasty.*Foie Doughnut - this made me think of those fancy dog bakeries were the treats look delectable but actually do not have any sugar because they are for dogs. It was like that because it has sprinkles and you think it is going to be sweet but instead it is savory. It was an interesting dish. *Cheese Cracker- I have made these at home before. Nothing too extraordinary but still delicious. *Vidrio (potato Glass with anchovy butter) - I really dug the salty anchovy butter and smearing it on the potato glass as the glass itself did not have much of a distinctive flavor. *Beet Gazpacho - sort of like an ice cream sandwich. Very unique concept but the beets were too overpowering, so I gave up on this earthy dish. *Merienda- a touch of gooey ham and cheese on the inside. My favorite of the first grouping. *Clams in Escabeche- foamy clams that I really enjoyed.*Cheese and Nuts - this was another cheese course, the hazelnut "caviar" was delicious and the cheese had a hard sugary exterior. The cheese was deliciously stinky and the scent stayed on my fingers the rest of the night. *Cava Sangria - sort of like a jello shot in a ball form. Super fun!*Ibèrico Chickpeas - very home-style/hearty with the warmth of the soup and little pieces of Iberico. *Live scallop with Black Truffles-my favorite of the night! The scallop melted in my mouth and the paired so wonderfully with the earthiness of the black truffles. I could eat this every day if I could. *Squid with rosemary foam- beautifully plated. Not always a huge fan of squid personally, but out of the squid I have tasted, this was the best. *Fluke with squid ink flakes-the fluke was cooked perfectly, and it was interesting to hear that the squid ink is made into a flakes to create a crust for this fish. *Wagyu Beef - delicious and I loved that they had two pieces on the plate, as one of the smaller pieces was more marbled and I died eating that buttery piece. The potato gnocchi was also a perfect accompaniment. *Cotton Candy Empanada- such a fun concept and neat to see them come out with a pile of cotton candy. Crunchy surprise in the middle of it made it fun. *Santa Gradea-a dish with soft cheese and I believe frozen pomegranate seeds. So much work went into this dish for plating and was then scrambled all together. *Créma Catalana Egg - a dish with soft cheese that looked like a fried. I dipped my spoon into all of the individual parts to test separately and realized that you really needed to scramble it all together to get the piece to taste delicious. *After Eight Timbal- my favorite of the desserts, as when you cracked the barrel of chocolate, a minty liquid flooded out and mixed with the bed of granola-ish stuff. Once it was all mixed together, I dug it. *Ferrero Rocher- a delicate little piece of chocolate with amazing presentation in a box. The chef said that it is one of the most difficult dishes to make of the night. *Burnt rum drink- it was awesome watching them still and set this drink aflame from the start of the night. Warm and served in a delightful little teacup!*Yemita- cute little lemon drop*More things- collection of little things with a small piece of chocolate, a wafer type thing. I was so full at this point that I just took little bites of these desserts. Overall, it was a brilliant dining experience. All of the staff were efficient and professional. Even if I did not particularly enjoy some of the dishes, I still loved watching them plate the dishes and talking to the chefs about the dishes. I was also pleased to discover some things that I want to get my hands on again such as more live seafood and more Wagyu beef!Dine-in Date: 10/10/2015. Actual rating 4.5. The No1DP and I ate here for our 2nd-year anniversary.Think of é as both a dinner and show that looks into the creative mind of chef José Andrés. The interior of the restaurant reflect this as the walls are adorned with small drawers filled with assorted items. Like most shows in Vegas they have a twice nightly "showing" Weds-Sun at 5pm and 8:30pm. $195/person with three wine tiers.Pre-Show: Reservations are by E-MAIL ONLY. Through a long e-mail chain started late July I was able to book two slots. Remember that your reservation is not complete until the submission and receipt of a form that requires notification of any food restrictions and credit card information. I never received my Golden Tickets before the dine-in date but as the restaurant inquired if I received the tickets that day I was able to receive those tickets along with the menu as souvenirs when the bill was presented.Our restaurant experience began when the No1DP and I approached the host at Jaleo about our reservation. We were led to one of the side tables outside the restaurant proper as we waited for everyone to arrive. We had a glass of Cuba Libres and this was the best cuba libre I had without Cuban rum. The cinnamon garnish does the trick. Once everyone arrived we were led to the back of Jaleo, where our dinner/show began.We had about 21 courses presented in four rounds. We also opted for $100/person truffle supplement in 2 dishes, the Spanish Pizza and the Iberico Chickpeas. As the menu changes I'll present my thoughts as a summary of the four rounds as opposed to commenting on each individual course.Act 1: The amuses.- Sangria 2015.- Branch of the Desert - "Vidrio": "glass".- Filipino: the foie gras donut.- Pillow- Dado: "dice".This was the most experimental, aesthetically pleasing yet least tasty of the four acts. A lot of effort was put into the aesthetics - the black sesame branches looked like something out of the dessert and the pillows on the sofa just looked plain adorable. The No1DP asked for no foie on his donut and while his donut was served along with everyone else, the No1DP could not taste foie - must be one sprinkle different from the other donuts. There was a lot of salty bites to pick up the appetite - overall too much salt in these sets of courses to my liking.Act 2: Bigger appetizers.- Beet Gazpacho- Spanish Pizza- Vermut- Cheese and Nuts- "Chupito": the little shot of cava sangria.These courses have bigger food portions and are less experimental than the previous act but still not a traditional presentation of plates. The Spanish Pizza with the cured meat serving as the "pizza" was the cutest presentation - I asked to take the little pizza box with me. Truffle shavings were skimpy as the No1DP and another dinner guest noted. Gazpacho is typically served as a soup but molecular gastronomy techniques were used to make it as a sandwich - certainly did not detract from the taste but I had to be careful that the sandwich didn't go into my clothes. My favorite course is the cheese and nuts - eating it one after the other really helps combine the hazelnut and creamy cheese tastes together. The cava sangria is mean to be another palate cleanser.Act 3: The mains.- Brandada Bacalao- Iberico Chickpeas- Txipirones: squid- Platija: flounder- Chuleta: cutlet of Australian wagyu beef.- "Empanada": the famous foie gras empenada.My favorite act, which is weird because these are considered the main courses presented most traditionally. No1DP opted for chicken instead of squid in his txipirones dishes - ended up liking his chicken to my squid. Aside from that I loved each dish in this round as it was perfectly presented and tasted delicious. It was a tease presenting the wagyu as a whole steak during the squid course - giving us a tease as to the final meat. The famous foie gras empenadas are served in this round and it tastes like peanut brittle on steroids. Hint: These can be found in Bazaar Meats as an appetizer. Act 4: Sweet endings.- Santa Gadea: cheese course - named after high-quality cheese in Spain.- Menjar Blanc: the Catalan almond milk sweet. - After Eight Timbal- Ferrero Rocher- Yemita: little custard candy.- More ThingsSecond favorite act. Cheese course was okay due to the freeze-dried fruits but I liked everything else. Panna cotta served as a frozen brick was quite interesting. I loved breaking the after eight timbal and taking the Ferrero out of its red box. The hostess was also serving this rum drink to go towards the end, which is made to pair with the chocolate. The petit four served in a fan was cute. Jose's Gin and Tonic is served at the end but this just goes to show how much I hate gin and tonic.For 21 courses one dish would look and taste better than the others but overall the No1DP and I had a delicious meal and awesome dining experience - certainly ranking in the top 10 restaurants I've eaten.I spent so much time with my eyes closed throughout the 21 courses in an attempt to fully savor the amazing range of flavors bestowed upon my taste buds that I probably came off looking like Stevie Wonder's mentally challenged 3rd cousin as I swayed side to side to the other diners.  Overjoooooooooyed!  Sangria 2015: Frozen red wine accompanied by little bursts of fruit presented in a half bottle to be scooped with two little spoons.  This must be how Willy Wonka gets bombed while watching reruns of "Friends".  It was a terrific "beverage" to start the meal.    Spanish Pizza: I love burnt cheese like nobody's business.  These geniuses of food made it the crust for heavenly bites topped with Andres' fantastic "Jamon" and ricotta cheese.  How much would a full on large pizza like this be?  $1000?  More?  Unreal.  What is it like to be the duke/duchess here?Beet Gazpacho:  Appearing like a fancy French pastry sold at Jean Philippe, the intense flavor was pretty eye opening, not easy for an Asian guy :D  That they even pulled this kind of richness out of a beet, one of the most non-offensive, unassuming vegetables ever (the Greg Kinnear of veggies?) is beyond me.  The sorbet-like quality was surely a big reason. Iberico Chickpeas:  This gave me the satisfaction and entertainment of every Vegas show I've seen in the last year all in one bowl and in less than 5 minutes.  Through the spherification cooking technique, the garbanzo beans had an ikura quality to it where they would pop in your mouth with only slight pressure.  Mixed in with the rest of the ingredients (I may have blacked out due to culinary ecstasy when the chef explained everything), the explosion of tastes in each spoonful was otherworldly.  I was the last one to finish as I wanted to savor every bean to its maximum potential.  "Empanada": Foie Gras cotton candy gyoza.  Formed, pressed right before our very eyes and eaten by hand, the combination of the fatty duck liver, light candy sweetness and Corn Nuts (?!), was an incredible mix that floored me.  Sign me up for 100 of these.      Brandida Bacalao: Salt fish chicharron topped with truffle.  The fish air foam the chef delicately placed on top of each our pieces was like a fairy godmother granting wishes.  Light, airy and amazing, this could have probably been finished in two bites.  I ate it like a rat and managed six.  Are the employee dinners anywhere close to the magnificence of this stuff?  I would wash dishes for free.Fun, creative, and extremely delicious, I'd gladly go back in a heartbeat.  If forced to choose, I'd go with é over Joel Robuchon considering the similar price point and for overall entertainment factor, but you couldn't go wrong with either for a dinner and show all rolled up into one.  This was a fantastic meal for our 8th wedding anniversary.  We were lucky to get the reservation and our golden tickets less than 3 weeks out.

Tucked behind a secret curtain in the back of Jaleo, a restaurant in the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas, is an intimate 8 seat only restaurant that will transport you to one of the most unbelievable culinary experiences you might ever have. It starts with the reservation. You don't call to make a reservation. In fact, they don't even have a phone. You have to email them, usually months in advance to secure  a spot in one of the 8 coveted seats. When you finally get a response, you pre reserve your seats, by filling out the reservation request, and prepaying with your credit card at the time of reservation. I don't think they actually charge the card, but the reservation policy is if you cancel within two weeks, there is a 50% charge, and no shows are billed at 100% so be sure you are aware of that. About a week before, you will receive your Golden Tickets, a la Willy Wonka style and you bring those as your admittance to the restaurant. I'm sure you don't really don't need to bring the tickets, but it's a fun touch and goes to show that they really don't take themselves too seriously.When you arrive, you are seated in Jaleo, and the host comes over to give a quick explanation and to take drink orders. You may choose the wine pairing ($125) or choose from individual glasses of wine (about $25 each) for the dinner.You are then escorted in and sit around the 8 person table. The venue is quite unique and sort of a speakeasy in the back of Jaleo, tucked behind a curtain. The venue has interesting items like an apothecary wall and items that were hand picked by Jose Andres. You then sit around the kidney shaped table to start your experience.About 20 courses comprise the 3 hr evening and come in rapid succession. We started with a sangria cava that was an encapsulated ball that when placed in the mouth, exploded with flavor. Throughout the night, course after course was served , each on its own unique plate and masterfully prepared. The evening was as much a show as a meal. You got to ask questions, interact, and come away from the meal fully satisfied, wanting more more. The meal is pricey, about $500 for two, so not an everyday experience, but if you are looking for something unique, special, and out of the ordinary, keep this in mind.

***Ciao Ciao's gelato is pretty good but also very overpriced (even for Las Vegas)***Ciao Ciao is a gelato bar inside The Forum Shops at Caesars.  They have a good number of flavors and many of them appeared to be creative concoctions with lots of ingredients mixed in.  I went with the pistachio and the mascarpone with caramel and both flavors were good.  The gelato was creamy too.Service was quick and pleasant.Pricing was very high.  I ordered a medium size and it was $8 before taxes.  While I did not get the gelato at the more famous Jean Philippe in Aria, I think the gelato there was about the same price (maybe even less at Jean Philippe).Ciao Ciao's gelato was a satisfying frozen dessert.  Pricing was too high though.  Pricing is high for a lot of stuff in Vegas, but I think for the prices you will pay here, you should be able to find more interesting and more well known sweets elsewhere.The Forum Shops and Caesars offer complimentary parking (via valet or self parking structure).

Review Text :
Great place for a good pizza and a drink. Indoor on the family side or next door in the bar. They have a great patio as well. Basic pizza and Italian food menu, including salads. I had the personal sized pizza and it was excellent. VERY VERY Grimaldis type. Thin, nice sauce, great crust and ample Mozz cheese. I ate the entire thing. $ 8 for the cheese add $1 for the Pep. $9 lunch meh.. a little expensive.  Share a large with 4 people. LOLStaff was great, nice and friendly. I wish the owner would have been a little more proactive at meeting his customers. :(Prices on the drinks seem steep. I doubt I would go just to have a few drinks.Next to the Coffee place in the Costco shopping center. North west side of the complex facing Cave Creek.This place was very similar to Grimaldi's in Phoenix.They have a family restaurant environment with TV's everywhere. It is awesome I did not have to crane my neck to watch the Coyote's playoff game at all. The service was really good, attentive, the also have a party room with an absolutely MASSIVE TV in it, as well as a nice indoor and outdoor lounge. The outdoor lounge has nice plush furniture to sit on and relax, it would be a fantastic place to take a date!Their wine list is nice, I was sad they didn't have a moscato on it however the Reisling was really good so I couldn't complain. My husband and I always have the Pepperoni and Mushroom Pizza wherever we go. It was really good, Just the right amount of sauce and toppings and I have to save the left overs were really good cold. (Breakfast of champions right there)We also ordered Hot Wings and Teriyaki wings. Its a good thing I love my husband or I may have bit him for the Teriyaki wings, there were fantastic and I could have made a meal out of them by themselves.Certainly give this place a gander, I don't want them going anywhere soon, except for expanding locations!I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event.  Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant.  My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day.  I can't remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a Shiraz and it was good.  We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil.  It was all so delicious!  I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil.  Again, it was very tasty!   Everyone was very friendly and prompt.  I will be back to Upper Crust!When I was a kid, I used to look forward to Friday night pizza parties at the local pizza parlor. Since moving to Arizona, I haven't found many pizza parlors here that mirror my childhood experience. That is, until I found Upper Crust. Upper Crust sneaks up on you. Literally. It's located in a small strip mall just off of the 101 and Cave Creek Road but the second you walk inside, it's a whole little sports bar/pizza parlor experience. To the right of the restaurant sits a dining room complete with red checkered tablecloths and family style tables. To the left sits a bar with at least a dozen flat screen TVs, several high top tables and a large bar top. It's the perfect spot to watch a game. The pizza is outstanding. It's large and in charge! One slice is probably the size of 2-3 regular size pizzas. It's thin crust with soft bread, gooey cheese and any toppings you want. This is the ideal Friday night pizza. If you're ever in the area, visit this hidden gem for some delectable pizza!Loved the pizza here. I first tried their food at the Yelp pleY date event and it was delishious! Their meatball, ravioli, mozzerella cheese sampler at the event was awesome. I just had to come and check them out.The pizza is not quite what I would call a thin crust, but the dough is not too thick either. I may just be trying to convince myself that pizza is good for you here, but does thinner crust = less carbs? I think so, and thats what I'm going with at least. All their pizza's come topped with their home made mozzerella, and I finished mine off with meatballs, which seemed like a good idea at the time. I was right! The meatball pizza is nothing less than super. They seem to have different daily specials. Swing by on a Tuesday for buy one get one free pizzas and bring home some 'za for tha family.Great pizza!! This place was a great last minute pick!! We decided to bring in the big 2013 with a small get together celebration at this pizza joint!! The service was great!! We had a friendly and patient server with our undecided group. Also we loved the surprisingly good tasting white sauce on our pizzas!! Everything was amazing!! The Mozzarella appetizers and the Extreme Hot wings!! Oh so good, fatty food!! We look forward to coming back!!

Review Text :
Three Village Restaurant is one of the newest Chinese restaurants to be opened in Las Vegas greater Chinatown area (Official grand opening was on Dec 8, 2010).  It is located at the former Champion Gourmet site, which is on the second floor of the old SF Supermarket and in the same plaza as other restaurants such as Shuseki, Swish, and Ah Chung Noodles.  The food it features on the menu is mostly Northern Chinese cuisine, and includes house specials such as Pork Dumpling with Supreme Soup (aka Xiao Long Bao), Pan Fried Soup Bun, Sliced Beef Roll, Jung Dong Meat Pie, Onion Pancakes and Noodle with Pork Bean Sauce.Prices of the menu items range from $3.95 to $19.95, with most items with the price range between $7.95 and $9.95.  The restaurant also features an All Day Special Combo that costs either $6.50 or $7.95.  For this special combo you get to select one of three soup or soup noodles (Fried Tofu Thin Noodle Soup, Curry Beef Thin Noodle Soup or Hot & Sour Soup) plus another select menu items, such as Pork Dumpling with Supreme Soup, Sliced Beef Roll, Pan Fried Pork Bun.  The portions are generous and you will definitely be full and satisfy selecting one of the All Day Special Combo.Review of the food:Fried Tofu Thin Noodle Soup - The broth is pleasant and mild, didn't cared much for the fried tofu pieces as garnish.Curry Beef Thin Noodle Soup - Nice flavor with subtle curry taste.Pork Dumpling with Supreme Soup - Not the greatest I have had, but perhaps one of the best available in Las Vegas, it is however definitely the best for the price.Sliced Beef Roll - tastes good and fairly comparable to those offered at China Mama's, but I think the portion is more generous here.Décor - almost none, except the lucky Buddha statue at the entrance.  1/5Capacity - seats roughly 80 people, with 5 large round tables and 7 small 4-tops.Service - Friendly, but you can tell they are barely keeping up with the demand of the busy restaurant. 3.5/5Value - Fair to good. 3.5/5Taste - Good.  4/5

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm Sheperds pie!Absolutely delicious, with minced lamb, carrots, peas, onions, fresh herbs, savory gravy, mashed potato crust ($14.95) - pricey but worth every bite!The interior is pretty cool and our server Andy mentioned they have items and wood carvings and panels brought in from Ireland for the decor and ambience. Great atmosphere, good place to chill out with your mates or have a cozy dinner with your significant other.I also tried the shot of CHOCOLATE CAKE (Absolut Vanilia, Frangelico) - pretty darn good and tasted just like warm chocolate cake!Service was fast, friendly and with a smile.Ri Ra (translated means celebration and good fun) is located in Mandalay Bay -  this places is a total Irish Pub! They have live music on weekends (that's what the sign said outside...)This pub is right next to the Guiness Merchandise Store.I'd definitely come and eat here again, they had a ton of stuff on their menu that I would like to try!Super high energy and a friendly party atmosphere fueled by live music, good food, and alcohol make this the best Irish themed pub in Vegas.For pub grub, it has to be the burgers. the dubliner (ground lamb seasoned with rosemary and topped with onions, goat cheese and curry mayo) is incredible. So juicy and flavorful.  The Guinness BBQ burger is also excellent.  Topped with a house made Guinness BBQ sauce, Irish cheddar cheese and onion rings; what's not to love.The short list for entrees include the Moors & Bay (bacon wrapped fillet with Guinness glazed prawns), Shepherd's Pie (made with lamb), and the Guinness & Beef Stew (deeply flavored fork tender beef cooked in beer; how can you go wrong).Service is very friendly (remember, its a pub).  Great selection of Irish whiskey and single malt scotches. Decent selection of Irish beers.  Prices are slightly lower than most Strip restaurants.Highly recommended.WHERE: It is located inside the Mandalay Place Shops.WHEN: Monday through Thursday, 11am-3am. Friday, 11am-4am. Saturday, 9am-4am. Sunday, 9am-3am. (There is definitely plenty of time for you to stop on by, whether it be a drink or something to snack on! =D)WHY: If you are looking to experience a jolly, good old time! & some BEER! Beer's always good! =)WHAT: I haven't been to an Irish Pub in a while, and thank goodness my friend and I decided to walk into this one! There were many times I would come to shop at the Mandalay Place and noticed the pub -but this time I finally kicked myself in the butt and walked in.After we were directed to our table, I noticed such an amazing atmosphere! It was perfectly dim and a place where you can come in to socialize with friends. It was then time to make our order!-Pub Wings: We started off with this delightful appetizer! It was covered with Guinness BBQ sauce and Jameson honey glaze alongside bleu cheese dip. The flavors mingled so well (Probably a little too well because I ate about 75 percent of the wings, and left my friend the remaining 25 percent, haha). So... Hoorah!-Turkey, Bacon & Bleu Melt: Me! This was my pick. It was really good, but a little dry. I had to dip it in my bleu cheese, but overall it was still a great sandwich.-Publicans Reuben: This was my friend's pick (Oh, I forgot to mention that we traded half of our sandwiches with each other so we got to taste the best of both worlds!) I cannot explain how great this sandwich was! It was ultimately the best reuben sandwich I've ever gotten to taste! I RECOMMEND THIS SANDWICH UNDOUBTEDLY!During and after our meal, our server and busser came several times to check on us! (I believe their names were D and Fred, if I can recall). They were happy to grab us some more water, dressing, whatever the case was. This definitely made it such a positive experience! I loved all of the workers! They were all so kind and had plenty of beautiful smiles on their faces whenever they walked by.Overall, the space was very cozy, the people were awesome, the food was yummy in my tummers, and I will most likely be returning for some bomb dot com reuben sandwiches and probably some BEER! Watch out for me! hahaWith another couple, Diane and I ventured out to sample the offerings of Ri Ra for the first time, and departed full and happy, with three large, unfinished hunks of haddock packaged to go.  After pondering whether to be adventurous and try Traditional Bacon & Cabbage, I decided instead to stick with a dish I knew I liked, and thus opted for Emigrant's Corned Beef & Cabbage, preceded by a bowl of Seafood Chowder.  The soup contained good scallops and other morsels of the sea, but I found the broth itself to be fairly bland.As for my entree, the corned beef covered with Irish Parsley Sauce was of good quality, along with excellent-tasting softened cabbage and nice mashed potatoes.  I didn't enjoy it quite as much as my all-time favorite Corned Beef & Cabbage served at Three Angry Wives, but it was a close second.  The fish in Diane's Fish & Chips consisted of a huge single battered specimen the ends of which almost lapped over both sides of the plate on which it was delivered.  Its flesh was moist and good, with no undesired fishy flavor.  The chips, too, tasted good but were non-crisp fries.  Complimentary soda bread was good for what it was when slathered in butter.  And, although Irish Potato Cakes were very salty, they tasted almost like Crab Cakes, and I would order them again.  For dessert I had a Blueberry Whiskey Crumble a la mode.  I liked it but it surprised me, for I thought it would be a cobbler.  Not so!  There was no discernible dough amid the warm and saucy blueberries.  But this was still a tasty dish, and I learned that a cobbler and a crumble are not in the least synonymous.  All was washed down with refreshing Sweet Iced Tea. Service by Vanessa, who hails from Ireland, and, alas, will soon be returning there, was impeccable, and a friendly manager visited us once at our comfortable booth in the cavernous dining room to see whether we were pleased with our meals, which all of us were.  By the time we left, the place was completely packed with happy pub crawlers, and live Irish music was just beginning to be played as the football playoff games on the several large flat-screen TVs were winding down.  The large dining room in the back is a welcome bastion of serenity for those like me who are long past the age of active imbibing and carousing, and would rather savor a fine meal than chat with friendly strangers and toss a few.  But, as we worked our way through the crowded front of the house, it was clear that the young twenty-something revelers who were seated on stools or standing were enjoying their lagers and stouts.I will definitely be back!I actually made it out of The Tropicana by 8am for my morning walk this past Sunday. Impressed? You should be, as it was a tough go the 1st 100 yards or so, and it was already in the mid 90's. After a mile or 2 I doubled back to Mandalay Bay in search of a Bloody Mary. Whaaaat? Its Vegas damn it. Walked around the casino to discover the bars were not yet open at nearly 9am. Hey! I thought this was Vegas not Des Moines.I decided to take the air conditioned route through the mall thing that stretches through a couple of hotels and drops one directly across from "The Trop." Panic started to creep in as I passed a few more shuttered restaurants. Wait, someone up ahead opening their doors for business. Is it a clothing store or..?? OMG, its an Irish Pub. I thought the heat was affecting me and I was dreaming a desperate dream.Sure enough, 9am sharp and these Angels of Mercy were beckoning me towards the flashy bar. Some slick looking kat with (presumably) an Irish accent welcomed me like a long lost mate. Feeling better already.My new mate Tom made me a killer Stoli Mary, and soon some fellow dehydrated patrons showed up and it turned into your typical neighborhood Irish bar kinda place. Yeah, right here in Fauxville Vegas. Especially unexpected in this mall tunnel thingy. My intention was a one n done, but my other new mates seated next to me ordered some delicious looking breakfasts, and I was soon requesting that menu that I previously returned to Tom. He recommended the Irish Eggs Benedict, which listed Rashers as an ingredient, and he informed it was the Irish version of Canadian bacon. I just looked it up and found this definition: "Rashers (n): pieces of bacon; female genitalia."  Ahem, think I will move on without further comment. I also looked up Ri-Ra (n): Irish expression for fun and excitement.Great breakfast, great service, great vibe. If ever on this boring end of the strip, this is a must do.Let me preface this review by saying that I KNOW MY IRISH BARS AND FOOD. I was born and raised in that magical country and I frequently return for lengthy visits. Ireland is my favorite place in the world. And now, Ri Ra is my favorite Irish pub in the world that exists outside of Ireland. It is authentic and decorated perfectly. The rich, dark wood and the paintings and the lighting and even the Irish accents of some of the servers could not be more perfect. Walking into Ri Ra is like walking into one of the local Temple Bar watering holes in Dublin. Ri Ra has an absolutely astounding selection of beer and cider - the best of what Ireland and England have to offer and in my opinion, more of a selection than any other Irish pub in town. (HELLO! MAGNERS/BULMERS ON DRAFT!!!) Also, they've got a great whiskey list and flight samples that rival even the Freakin Frog's attic! We ordered the fish and chips to share and the sausage rolls as an appetizer. Sausage rolls are one of my favorite comfort foods, so I was really hoping Ri Ra came through with this one. And, THEY DID. The sausage rolls were perfect and tasty and crunchy yet soft - probably the best I have ever had. When our fish and chips came out, I knew I was in love before I even took the first bite because I could tell that these were freshly cut potatoes and a really great cut of fish - HUGE too. Without a doubt in my mind, Ri Ra has the best fish and chips in Vegas - definitely the best I have had outside of Ireland. They've also got a pretty awesome "late night chipper" menu that I can't wait to check out. If you visit the bar for a drink, they've got all the bar snacks you'd find in Ireland - Tayto or King crisps, chocolate, etc. You name it! This place is amazing. Although it might be a bit pricey, you get what you pay for in terms of quality and service! If this bar was closer to my house and not located on the strip, I'd probably never leave.Maybe it was the cider talking, or the fact that I have been on an Irish kick lately, but I truly enjoyed my meal at Ri Ra.  The waitress was very helpful with a killer accent.  The soda bread was excellent and I could have eaten more but didn't want to fill up. I had the potato cakes appetizer which was two large cakes with a vinaigrette sauce.  It was very tasty, it could have been a little crisper, but it did have a light fluffy texture.  For my main course I had the fish and chips.  The fish was light and flaky and the coating was crisp.  You only get one piece of fish but it was a decent size and after the ceasar salad, soda bread and  potato cakes, it was more than enough.  The fries were about the only negative about the meal, limp and soggy.  Ri Ra was a nice surprise and was a good place to watch the hockey games.LOVE Ri Ra! From the food to the service you really cant say a bad thing about this Irish Pub.With the majority of the employees being from Ireland they certainly know their whiskey... and how to pour the perfect Guinness. Theres always loud music, it really makes the place feel alive. A little on the expensive side, but its worth checking out.This is my favorite spot to visit after work. Especially on Fridays.. its 40% off food for locals! Ive tried the fish n chips, potato cakes, shrimp cocktail, salmon cakes, and the Guinness Burger and omg. i cant choose a favorite because theyre all amazing!We stop here every time we're at THEhotel or Mandalay it always exceeds expectations. If you want good pub food, good beer, a pleasant wait staff or an obscure Irish whiskey, you will get that, but just a little bit better because it's actually reasonably priced. The best value I've found in Vegas. Certainly the best value anywhere on Mandalay property.Having spent some time in Dublin, and in several "traditional" Irish pubs;  This place is probably about 60-70% close in authenticity.  The realism, of the bar and overall look and feel almost makes you feel like you really are in Ireland.  It's just the simple fact that you know you're in Vegas, and the newness of it simply out-weighs hanging out at an old bar that generations of people have relaxed in.  Anyways, here's what I ordered, and why I loved this pub:~ Deviled Scotch Eggs:  These were 4 pieces of breaded deviled eggs that were creamy and crunchy.  The yolk mix was slightly different than your mustard tasting center.  They call their center a creamy yolk mousse.  Truly a different starter choice.~ Dubliner Burger:  A ground lamb patty with a rosemary aroma.  Now this was a super juicy burger, combined with goat cheese, grilled red onion, and a curry aioli... Man I'm gettin' hungry just thinking about it.  The burger was nice and beefy, and the bun nice and soft.~ Fish 'n' Chips (small):  Now, the cod was cooked just right, soft and steamy.  The chips were also nice and meaty for fries.  The only thing is, this was not a Dublin sized cod in my opinion.  I regretfully wish I ordered the large.  I should've known better.  All about service:~ I'm so glad we sat a the bar.  Amanda, our server-bartender did a great job in keeping us company.  She shared some of her favorites from the menu, and made sure our water glasses were filled.  I asked for a Guinness, and she poured it pretty fast.  A "no no" in the process, so minus one star.  Yes, I was critiquing, haha!Atmosphere:~ As I had mentioned above, the set up was nice only you won't get that Irish feel.  The feeling of knowing you're in a pub that's 150+ years old.  You'll have an American watery Guinness, which was what I expected.  As nothing beats a Guinness made from the waters of Ireland.  A mix of people/tourist.  I mean, for the first time, I had wished there were more drunks singing along and mingling.  Oh well, no biggie, but I definitely a good time hanging out here!  Overall:I'd come back!  The food is good, and the prices are above average.  Worth checking out!

Ok, so I finally tried their acai bowls and they're AMAZING as well!  I especially love the Strawberry Passion, Go Green, and Raspberry Pecan!Come here to get an amazing ACAI BOWL. So many different flavors of delicious smoothies and shakes. My favorite is the original. It's a blend of strawberry blueberries banana ACAI Sorbet, and apple juice. It's topped with granola, strawberries banana, blueberries, and honey. Can't go wrong. I love their punch card system. Every 10 bowls bought you get a free medium and they're so filling. ENJOY

UMMMMMMMM...can I just say that this place needs to get more action!  The pizzas here are FANTASTIC!!  I discovered this place because it opened above SACKS.  It is around the corner from my house and I am so thankful it is.  The whole restaurant is open...I wish it had a little more space, but that is ok.  First, the Tuscan Pie is to die for!!  It has prosciutto, Gorgonzola, apple, arugula, a fig marmalade and balsalmic vingerette reduction sauce drizzled on top...at least I think that is what it is...I need to check the menu...but anyways its FABULOUS!!!  I wish I could eat it everyday!  I tried their Moroccan Pizza before they took it off the menu and it was awesome too!  Every single salad is great and the wine and beer selection is great too!  The staff is so nice and friendly.  I get this to go all the time and bring it home...and I have shared this with my friends too.  I love good Italian pizza and its great!

Super service et excellentes poutines ! Lors du passage à Montréal d'un couple d'amis américains, je me décide à leur fait goûter une spécialité bien québecoise. Quel succès ! Chez Poutineville, on customize sont plat: on choisit le type de pommes de terres (les maisons sont délicieuses), la sauce, les fromages, les viandes et les légumes. On peut l'avoir gratinée...En tout cas, mieux vaut arriver avec une grosse faim car les portions sont généreuses. Le restaurant propose aussi des poutines-spécialités avec des recettes déjà bien établies pour les moins imaginatifs ou aventureux, ainsi que plusieurs recettes classiques type burgers ou salade ceasar.Le staff était également aux petits soins et nous a très bien conseillé ! Bref, un super endroit que je vous recommande vivement lorsque vous en quête d'une soirée bien québécoise :)It would be sacreligious to visit Montreal without getting some poutine. I've had a few poutine experiences throughout Canada and even visited some wannabe places in the States. They are typically hole in the walls, but what would you expect when ordering fries topped with gravy and cheese?I was pleasantly surprised to find that Poutineville was a pretty nice restaurant. And even more pleasantly surprised to discover that they let you make your own poutine. You get to pick the fries, type of sauce, toppings, etc. This place should be renamed Poutine Heaven! Speaking of heaven they also serve fried pickles here, which is every pregnant woman's dream. I was happy that our waiter spoke English so he could help me navigate this new poutine world. I chose sweet potato fries, red wine sauce, a variety of vegetable toppings and even some bacon.  It was absolutely delicious! The red wine sauce was a bit gravyish for my taste, but guess that's to be expected since poutine is typically topped with gravy sauce.One of my dining companions mentioned she was never able to finish the massive "small" order of poutine, but have to admit I did a good job finishing mine thanks to the future linebacker currently living my stomach.

Sophie you were right!OH! MY! GOD!  That doesn't even begin to cover it! Very cute place, I sat in the center patio corridor with the market to the left and the dining room to the right.Everything sounded so delicious! I decided on the Artichoke and White Bean Hummus and the Butternut Squash and Corn Enchiladas which came with a wonderful salad (see pictures)Every bite was delectable, I couldn't bear the thought of wasting so of course I finished every last bite of it all!I know I must sound like a cow but unfortunately I'm lacking the 3 extra stomachs to take advantage of the rest of the menu.......those would have come in really handy because I didn't want to leave, I Was in Food Heaven!Deliciously Fresh and Gourmet!My 5 stars are for the food experienceThe service was actually awful, as I had to get up to retrieve my own silverware and even help my self to the Ice tea pitcher because some one never refilled my glass!They say Love is Blind right ,and I LOVED the Food so I'll over look the lazy service.Hate to say it, but I just didn't love it.   There, I've said it.  After tasting the mushroom risotto appetizers at Yelp's Birthday event, I couldn't wait to come to Herb Box for lunch.The restaurant has a nice layout with a dine-in area, a little market, and a patio in between.  We sat inside and started with the market cheese board.  There was only one cheese selection, I expected there to be at least two for some reason, but it was delicious--brie with a caramel-like sauce (fig, I think).  I also had the grilled chicken and sage pesto sandwich with goat cheese and bacon.  It was good, but it wasn't an "OMG, this is the best sandwich I've ever had moment."  I really think serving it warm would bring out the flavors.  Worth $12?  I think not.  Sweet potato chips were a plus!Where they really lose points with me was service.  Not terrible, but definitely left a lot to be desired.  I had to ask for utensils and napkins.  Also, she offered a box for half my sandwich and left the room, but came back empty-handed.  Empty hand, empty head.Just okay for me.  But I might have to have a party for one catered just to get those appetizers again!There's a hair in my arugula. A long, straight hair. I know what you're thinking ... 'well, that's better than a short and curly hair.' Although true, I'm just not in need of the extra protein. Plenty of that provided by the grilled tenderloin sitting atop of said arugula and beside aforementioned hair.I chose not to make a scene as the place - early afternoon on a Tuesday - was fairly full of fine female patrons. I removed the hair with surgical precision and proceeded to enjoy my lunch. And enjoy, I did.I saw many many savory items on the menu, but I can only speak to the Arugula-Gorgonzola Steak. Tasty. Oh ... and the sweet potato chips were the truth as well. The place is kinda' unique in that it shares two different suites - a "market" on one side and an "eatery" on the other - joined by a breezeway in the middle. One could enjoy their meal, or a glass of wine outside if one so desired. Four stars. I'm not deducting anything for the hair, but the 'Box is awfully proud of their prices and the service leaves much to be desired. I mean, the gal that occasionally tended to me was friendly ... just not necessarily well-versed in the art of prompt, accommodation of customer requests. Like the one I made for silverware and a napkin. Twice. That said, the Herb Box was a cute little joint and I'm sure I'll be stopping in again for lunch when I find myself hocking fenestrations mid-day in north Scottsdale. Next time I'll try a twelve-dollar sandwich. Brown Sugar Pork Ciabatta. Sans follicle, if I may.Time for an Herb Box update... this one is specifically for the catering side of the business.  Read on if you want details on the pre-pre-Wedding celebration we had at our house last Thursday night.I always knew that when the time was right, I'd have the Herb Box cater a party for me... and the time finally came.  We had about 40 people over at our house on the Thursday night before our wedding.  It was primarily our friends that flew in from out of town early and we really wanted to entertain.  So I reached out to Robert, Director of Catering, and explained what we were thinking about.  He responded in no time at all and he was extremely professional as we went back and forth a few times on pricing, menu, etc... the outcome was perfect.  We had a buffet style dinner including a chef and two buffet attendants.  Robert and Mary came over to the house a few days before to do a walk-through, and go over details.  On the day of our event, the team came early and went above and beyond, even running to the store for us to pick up lemons and limes.  I know you're dying to know what our menu was, aren't you?  Okay - I'll share!  Here you go:-Urban Market Salad with watercress, red pepper, dried corn, sugared pecans, avocado, and blue cheese vinaigrette (dressing on the side)-Citrus & Rum Free-Range Chicken with watercress, pear-gorgonzola salsa-Alaskan Salmon with maple-ginger glaze-Asparagus couscous with feta and mint-Grilled vegetable feast with farmers goat cheese and herbs-and of course my favorite, the Signature Sweet Potato Chips dusted with mild curryWe arrived at the above menu after looking through around eight pages worth of gourmet menu items that are all appealing possibilities if you choose to use the Herb Box to cater your event.  They worked within our budget and made it quite an evening to remember.  I highly recommend using The Herb Box whether you're catering a party for 12 or 100+.  Just trust me on one thing - make sure you get those sweet potato chips!I'm a fan of The Herb Box. I realize I'd been there once before and really enjoyed it then as well.Today the family came by to meet for lunch and I happened to have an email in my inbox with the new lunch menu at Shea. Talk about good timing. I'm trying to be a bit better at eating healthy and looking at the menu, there seemed to be a number of selections that would let me do that & still enjoy the food.From looking at the menu, it was nice to see that they buy local where possible and are part of the Slow Food movement.We started with the housemade sweet potato chips with sea salt and curry. These are ridiculously addictive. My 2  year old kept telling us "don't eat them all" and putting her hand over the basket. We all couldn't stop. While they might not really be, they even seemed healthy-ish (for chips anyway). I'd love to see if they had an extra curry version.For lunch, we ordered the market sunflower salad (with chicken, bacon, goat cheese, dried berries, sunflower seeds & balsamic vinaigrette), the blackened chicken caesar salad (with crisp romaine, cotija cheese, tortilla strips and a chipotle-parmesan caesar dressing), and the kids split the brown sugar pork sandwich (with watercress-jicama slaw).As our little ones have dairy and egg allergies, they were great about working around that and giving us suggestions. They were super nice with the kids too.The food was excellent all the way around. I'm not by nature a big salad guy but I went that way as I'm trying to lay off the carbs a bit. I really liked both and will be eager to order either of them again. I'm also eager to try some of the more carb-y items on the menu when I can. They had a couple of soups that sounded wonderful. The service was great. Our server was quite knowledgeable, super personable and very engaging. He also put up with our 2 girls flirting with him non-stop.As far as drinks, we did green tea and blackberry jasimine tea. Both were quite nice.As I'm committed to staying on this healthy train, I think there will be many, many more visits to The Herb Box in my future. At present, I'm hard pressed to think a better healthy/tasty lunch option.This was just...  OK.  After hearing and reading so many great things about The Herb Box I was sure I would really enjoy it.  Well, no.  Not so much.  Especially disappointing because my Mom was with me during an all-too-brief visit to AZ, and I really wanted to take her somewhere great.  We arrived around 1:30, purposefully avoiding the 'lunch rush'.  I thought this would be a good thing.  What we found was a disorganized and distracted staff and a lot of uncleared tables.  Once we were seated and given menus, we were pretty much abandoned for a good 10 minutes.  At last a couple of glasses of water arrived, but the waitress disappeared again before we could place our order.  She came in and out of the dining area, seating others and even taking their orders, but didn't acknowledge us until I was ready to A) fold the menu into a paper airplane and aim it at her head and B) leave.  Helloooooooooo????At last we were able to order.  Hooray!  Wait, don't get excited yet, she didn't enter the orders into the terminal.  Oops.  When we finally received our food it was not exactly worth waiting that long for, either.  I had the Market Sunflower Salad and my mom had the Blackened Chicken Caesar Wrap.  While good, I don't think either dish warranted the $12 price tags.  It is lettuce and chicken, people.  Really.Yes, the location is 'cute' and 'quaint'.  Yes the ingredients are fresh.  Perhaps if we had a different waitress I would have been happier.Amazing !! Amazing!! Amazing !!  -- Herb Box is becoming my new found meet for lunch / dinner spot.  Local food made fresh and delicious with savory spot -on flavors..you must try it! It's been awhile since I have wanted to write a review for anything, but tonight my tastebuds and I want to sing to the world! Hallelujah and Rejoice!  I have always loved the far north Herb Box which is a lovely place and a great place. But now Herb Box is more centrally located in Scottsdale at the  larger Southbridge venue. This promises to be a great place to meet friends for breakfast, lunch or dinner  when anywhere near the  area. The brand new look and feel says we have thought this out and we want you to be comfortable but feel impressed. Great spacing , lighting and seating make the place very inviting ...it just screams bring your friends over, meet me for a drink or appetizer,  stop in for breakfast after farmers market. Don't miss the girls bathroom .Regal feel with some sweet surprise...yes that is a sink...the mirror felt like I was Alice in Wonderland....Tonight  for dinner we enjoyed the lovely cilantro and crab dip with fried plantains ,that make me smile and plot how I can steal more...shall I say it accidentally feel on the floor and demand more ? I just might.  Shh don't tell.Mike and I split the flatbread/ pizza with pear and Gorgonzola that just excites the tongue...It is savory comfort food for sure. We also split the Thai Ribs..Oh my Gravy !!..wow!! ..ribs with BBQ sauce that is completely thai and spicy and burn  you but   in  a good way ..loved it! We also had the Gouda mac and cheese,  creamy , rich and make you fell like someone whipped the up just for you..Mom had a large piece of salmon roasted in honey with guess what?  super tasty parsnips ..yup I said parsnips...I thought they were a joke food but no longer, parsnips are now on my to do list. We finished off the meal with more mind grabbing tastes. biting into  a chocolate tart that had the right mix of sweet and decadence without feeling like you ate a spoonful of  chocolate frosting ,very cravable and a must for every diner. We also shared a sweet little Crostina with berries ...tasted great, without an over sweetness so common to many restaurants.I  must also mention the great blackberry jasmine green tea , so refreshing. The Herb Box is full of great tastes , and if that is not enough ,...there is an adjacent market  chocked full of great tastes to go with an emphasis on local fare. ( think CROWS DAIRY and QUEEN CREEK OLIVE MILL ) They have foods to go , cheeses , dairy and great out of this world baked goods.  My plan, next time I need a bite before heading to the mall, is to grab a delicious treat , a small wedge of chees and a piece of fruit , no more mall food for me. Yes I loved it .Yelpers keep your eyes open for the UYE soon to be announced   by me    ...You are in for a delightful treat.If eating at a place two days in a row says anything about the way I feel, then I might as well call Herb Box my new Old Town cuisine love. It's been with much anticipation that I've waited for the Herb Box to open in this prime real estate at the Waterfront. Was it everything I hoped for? Yes and it's finally given the area the jolt it needs.Upstairs Dining:I first dined here yesterday for a work lunch. During the midst of the BCS bowl madness, I noticed and nodded in approval for how calm, cool and collected the staff remained no matter the amount of chaos surrounding them. While deciding between sitting inside and outside, I did a quick walk-through of the restaurant and noticed that both atmospheres seemed appealing and comfortable for dining. So, after opting for outdoor seating, the dining experience began. First off, I was happy to see how fast they refill drinks. It probably wasn't good for my diet coke addiction, but it made me happy anyway! I went for the Mediterranean wrap with turkey and the sweet potato chips. Every ingredient was filling and fresh all at the same time. I could tell that I was giving my body the solid nutrients it needed while satisfying my hunger and typical love for fatty food. The sweet potato chips are temptation on a plate. They are salty, crispy and sweet all fried into one glorious chip. The meal was hearty but not too hearty and therefore perfect for an afternoon lunch that will get you through the rest of the day. The patio was enjoyable and although it was a little chilly out, they had heaters around to warm it up. I've definitely found a new lunchtime favorite in the Herb Box and will be suggesting a visit here whenever I have a lunch appointment!The Market I almost feel like the Herb Box dining room and market deserve two separate reviews, so I'm breaking it up. I have been waiting and hoping for more markets like this to open in Old Town! I am always on the go and sometimes I just want to run in and out and get a decent meal while avoiding the sit down service. Welcome Herb Box Market! For my second visit (for the second day in a row mind you), I visited the Market to place my order and I was pleasantly surprised to see that many of the options were pre-made and ready to go! I debated between another wrap or a salad but I went the salad route this time. The tuna salad looked tasty but I normally avoid tuna because of the mayo...that is until they told me that this tuna is actually relatively low in fat and doesn't have any mayo! Amen Herb Box! Now I know where I can go for my tuna fix without requiring an additional 30 minutes at the gym! I love hummus and they sell individual hummus there, so I made that purchase as well. Just like my dining experience, my meal left me satisfied and full but not feeling like a fattie. I noticed some delectable looking pastries as well as olive oils and other natural goodies too. The girl at the counter told me that they focus on making their meals in the healthiest way possible. That makes me and the inner fat kid inside me feel much better! I plan on staying away from the Herb Box for at least two days (hopefully) but I can't wait to visit again and again!And before I go, I have to mention the bathrooms...the bathrooms are as cool as I remembered from a visit to shop that lived in this location before Herb became the word. Each stall has its own setup including a sink behind closed doors...so be sure to check them out!I have a confession to make. When I found out that I'd be visiting Scottsdale for work, I secretly thought that the places where we'd be eating and drinking for the week wouldn't hold a candle to my favorite spots in other cities I've visited, like San Francisco, LA, Chicago or NYC. Well, I was wrong and I will happily eat my slice of humble pie, especially if it's from The Herb Box. The first thing I noticed about the spot was how open and stylish the space was. I loved the old timey bicycle decorating the back wall, I loved the funky upholstery, I loved the classy bathrooms even. My preconceived notions continued to break down as I perused the menu. For lunch, the offered row after row of amazing options, from fresh made sweet potato chips to a lunch plat du fromage to a whole array of salads and sandwiches. I went with the coconut shrimp salad and when it came out I practically dove head first into the bowl, devouring the ridiculously fresh veiggies and freshly fried shrimp. I think at one point I cried out, "It feels like a garden is blooming in my mouth!!" The meal was complete with a nibble of some of those famous sweet potato chips and a gulp of their mango lemonade. Then why not five stars, you ask? Well, the service was slow. Very slow. They warned us that it might be as we had a large party, but 40 minutes for your dishes to come out just doesn't cut it, I'm sorry. When we asked about the progress our waiter said that it was due to all of our special requests, "like asking for steak on your salad." This confused me, as getting steak on your salad was an option listed on the menu, so it didn't seem so special to me. Nevertheless, our waiter was a nice guy and I didn't begrudge him too much, or the ktichen staff, especially when the chef/owner checked in on us a couple of times to see how we were doing. Unfortunately for the first time we didn't have much to tell her as we had yet to receive any food. I think they may have felt bad because they sent out an amazing array of desserts. Everyone loved the cream cheese frosting on the red velvet cupcake but I found the cake very dry and tough. People also loved their dessert which was basically a giant Reese's peanut butter cup. We took their orange cream cupcake to our next destination as a gift and the recipient was one happy lady. So, while in good conscience I can't give a place five stars when it takes forever for lunch, everyone else had received their food, and we were late to our next appointment because of it, but everything else was on par so I'm going to hope that it was a one-time fluke and give them the props that they deserve!First of all, many thanks to the awesome Deb L. and her fun-loving hubby Michael, for hosting tonight's UYE at this elegant restaurant!  (It's definitely "date night" material-- and not only for romantic couples; I spotted a father and daughter, dressed to the nines, and they looked like they were having a great time!)  Nine of us were in attendance, and I'd say that the dinner was a huge success!  This was my first visit, and while I had to leave shortly after the food came out, I felt sad leaving this very lively group-- it was great to have caught up w/ Deb, Mike, and Heather C., and so nice to have made new acquaintances!  I hadn't even left the building yet, and I already knew I was coming back!  (Heather, we're definitely doing breakfast SOON!)While waiting for other Yelpers to arrive, I'd inquired about whether HB only served wines, since that was the only drink menu that was presented to us, but no, our friendly and very helpful server Chelsea said that HB had a full bar, and that she would return to let us know what specialty cocktails they had to serve that evening.  Besides their house red sangria ($9?), HB was also offering a Blackberry mojito ($9) and a St. Germain elderflower margarita ($11).  While both sounded delicious, I decided to go w/ the mojito since I have a large bottle of the elderflower liquor ($32!) sitting in my fridge back home (I was inspired to buy after having some elderflower champagne flutes at Chandler's Cork!)  Oh. My. God!  If you like berries, you MUST try this mojito!  It was so full of muddled whole blackberries, you'd think it was puree, and it wasn't overly sweet-- I felt like I was having quite a nutritious beverage!  I hardly tasted the alcohol...  I very much wanted to order another one, but I knew I had to leave early.  I cannot wait to come back for happy hour!  :DBy the time everyone showed up and had a chance to make introductions and make really interesting chit-chat (again, Deb and Mike were great hosts!), we were ready to order and eat!  I kid you not, everyone's selections looked amazing!  I'm sure we'll be reading about their selections soon enough, so let me tell you about mine...I was curious about the gouda mac 'n cheese from the very moment I read about it on Deb's prior review, so I knew to order these.  How fortunate to see that the Thai BBQ baby back ribs came w/ a side of it, as well as a green apple slaw.  I concede that the mac 'n cheese was good, but I think it would've been better w/ more cheese and slightly more crunchy breadcrumbs.  The sour apple slaw provided a nice crunch and just enough sweet-sour to counteract the spiciness of the baby back ribs.  Ohhh... those tender ribs!  The BBQ sauce was thick, sticky, sweet, yet had a great kick!  (I didn't find it too spicy, but others might... you've been warned!)  It was very fortunate for Mom that I had to leave the party so soon, or else she would not have had the chance to try the leftovers; there wouldn't have been any to take home!  (And yes, she's already eaten the rest of the meal!)Afterwards, I stopped at the adjoining market to take home a slice of Chocolate-peanut butter banana bread cake ($5), a Strawberry-blackberry handpie ($5), and a goat cheese-chive potato cake ($3).  (So many of the others had a potato cake as a side to their entree, and I was so envious-- they looked great on the plates, and everyone said they were delicious, and I completely agree w/ them!)  Loved the potato cake's great textures- the caramelized outer crust had enough crunch, but quickly yielded to reveal the buttery potato delight, w/ goat cheese crumbles all-throughout inside-- not at all greasy, and I loved the rich and creamy consistency that the goat cheese gave to the potato cake!  I will have to buy some of these to take home on every visit from now on!  FYI, the desserts were perfect, as well!  The crust on the handpie tasted almost like shortbread, the sugared top of the crust was exquisitely crisped, and the fresh berry filling also incorporated a citrus-y element-- my guess is orange peel/bergarmot oil essence.  The banana bread cake was so moist, had beautiful texture (see pics),  not too sweet, and packed full of banana goodness... Loved the peanut butter layer under the chocolate ganache "icing" (no powdered sugar used in their icings here!).  The cake also had peanut butter drizzle all over the top.  It's a pretty cake, and I wouldn't hesitate to order a whole one to-go...  Hey, Heather-- you free this weekend??Every single thing that I put in my mouth was sublime.No, seriously. Every single thing.Is that not all you need to know? I'd stop reading here and just *go* already.Still reading? Fine, it's my duty to back up such proclamations, isn't it.Specifics:First we have an *exquisite* lunch special. You won't hear me saying such things too often, as lunchtime for others is usually my breakfast time. When y'all are scarfing down soup and sandwiches, I'm on my second cup of coffee and a biscotti. But since the day I visited Herb Box it was, in fact, lunchtime, you can trust.The special I chose (there are several) was the soup/salad/sandwich special, which varies from day to day I believe. On this day it was a potato leek soup, a grilled sandwich with gorgonzola and vegetables and a salad of fresh greens, candied pecans and gorgonzola.My mouth dropped when it came out, for I expected a small offering of each, but received a large sandwich, a cup of soup and a generous salad.Vegetarian options? You bet. Several. I wanted to sample things, so I opted for the triple threat plate. Otherwise, if you're looking for something on the lighter side, you cannot go wrong with one of the bountiful salads.Speaking of healthy and light options, they have deep fried olives stuffed with bleu cheese. And amazing sweet potato chips (I'm not even a fan of sweet potatoes) Heh. Seriously, need I go on about the virtues of such things? Order a salad, splurge on an app. I do it all the time...But I didn't do it on the day I lunched at Herb Box. Come on, I couldn't! Remember, I don't lunch very often. I tend to treat my work trips as mini vacations, so all intentions of eating light are out the window. And, and...fried olives! I don't even think Rachel Zoe is going to pass up a fried olive.Herb Box boasts a glorious environs. You feel like you're sitting outside even when you're not. It made me forget, for a few moments, that it was January (perhaps I forgot until my plane landed in snow-ridden Kansas City). They've got the sophisticated, yet relaxed vibe going on, which I noticed is common in Scottsdale. I really love this.So, I think Herb Box wins as one of the best lunches I've had. Ever! If all places were like this, I'd so be on my way to becoming a Lady Who Lunches instead of a lady who coffees.Will Yelp ever bring us the 1/2 star? I know everyone would use it. I had a 3.5 star experience.We (Jim W, our daughter Abby and I) joined fellow Yelpers Scott W, Heather and Ryan C and organizer Aileen B for a brunch UYE this morning. So the company was five star.I would give the atmosphere and service five stars as well. The place has a really open feel and the patio looked very inviting. The service was unobtrusive yet attentive. My water glass never ran empty.The place they lost me was the food. I ordered steak and eggs. The steak was delicious, albeit petite. The fingerling potatoes were fine, nothing to write home about. But the eggs were not cooked right. If you can't get my scrambled eggs right (I order them scrambled lightly) you're not going to wow me. Especially if you charge me $15 for a diminutive steak and smattering of overdone eggs. I thought all the offerings a tad pricey, which my family attributed to Scottsdale Waterfront real estate prices, but this was the first time I have ever been hungry between brunch and dinner.Would I go there again? Possibly. I doubt I'd go for brunch. But the raves over dinner make me curious. Maybe they could wow me the second time around.Ok, so I rarely get to Old Town to eat.  RARELY.  I'm a CenPho grrrl.  But, when Chef Bec invites you out to try stuff, you go.  Pronto!!!!Sat at the bar, since it was a Friday and I guess that's where people sit.  Went with Kirti for happy hour & just to chill.  Not only was the service great (I rarely had to ask for a refill), but the chef even came out to introduce herself.  The place wasn't too crowded yet, which was good, because that's another reason for all the attention.  Had to keep the worker bees busy!  First thing we tried was the ribs appetizer.  They were falling off the bone and had an amazingly sticky-spicy-sweet sauce on them.  Also had the crab dip, which came with plantain chips.  I loooooooooove plantain chips.  Love.  The pork tacos?  OMG.  O. M. G.  I took a couple home as leftovers and my mouth watered all night, thinking about those tacos.For dessert, we had "crack pie."  I don't even know what was in it, but the crust was nutty, there was whipped cream, and it stuck to my teeth when I ate it.  And it was made from crack.  It HAD to be!!!!!!  The red velvet cupcake was also divine, but that crack pie...*sigh*Parking is a bitch in Old Town, but there is a garage right near The Herb Box.I'm going 3.75 stars here.  I really like the decor.  It struck me as somewhere between Cape Cod beach house and something you might pick up in Arcadia for 1.5 million.The service was great.  I went with buckwheat pancakes for my brunch meal although I did get to sample several other meals as well.My buckwheat pancakes were hearty and delicious.  The red velvet pancakes I tried were great as well.  I also tried the salmon hash (good but not my thing..)I found the prices top be slightly high but I'm sure that any restaurant in this vicinity has to tack on a bit to cover the real estate.Thanks to Aileen B for setting this brunch up!We went to the Herb Box to eat lunch over the weekend after doing some par-oozing through old town.  This has been on our list of "must try places to dine" after reading so many fellow Yelper reviews.  It was an awesome start with a few drinks listening some fantastic live music on the patio!Restaurant ~ the patio is the place to eat if available, especially when they have entertainment.  It's a wrap around patio so there are different options to choose from.  The inside is very nice, somewhat of a north eastern coastal design with comfy chairs unless your stuck with one of the plain wooden chairs. (I know these plain chairs provide more balance to the decor but they are they are not comfy!)  Service ~ was very good, not exceptional but good.  They are very attentive to your drinks however they are not as attentive to your meal after it arrives.  Food ~ 5 stars for freshness!  Everything we ordered was extremely fresh from the salads to the veggies.   We order their Flat-bread with smoked BBQ chicken, bacon, Gouda cheese, organic greens, slice cherry tomato and onions.  It was very good.  The greens on top of the flat bread were tossed lightly in oil and were delish!  Everything on the flat bread was very good however it had too many cherry tomato halves, which were picked off half way through.  We also order the gilled Kobe Feta Burger with lots, and I mean lots! of arugula, grilled onion, with a little bit of red pepper aioli with a side of sweet potato chips.  After pulling off some of the arugula so I could see my succulent kobe beef patty we dug in!  This is a very tasty burger but the feta cheese and aioli were very sparse, almost non existent.  We had to ask for more aioli sauce twice.  The sweet potato chips were very delish and became very addictive to everyone at the table.  We should have ordered more...   We also ordered the smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese with bread crumbs.  This was a miss for us since it lacked the creamy cheesy goodness it should of had but rather it was all pasta with some light shavings of gouda cheese and bread crumbs.  It was very bland and we think there was more bread crumbs than cheese... The Herb Box seems like a very nice place to dine with friends and family, especially on their patio when they have some entertainment.  We plan to come back for more sweet potato chips and to try something else on their menu.  It is A-OK.Herb Box tops my list for one of my favorite locations for lunchtime or dinnertime dining, but just recently I experienced Sunday brunch here for the first time. This is definitely a reasonably priced Sunday brunch option. In fact, it's the same price as it is any other time during the week, but on Sunday, in addition to several lunch items, they also offer breakfast options such as Cinnamon pancakes, Market BLTs, breakfast flat breads, goat cheese omelets. While sitting out on the patio and enjoying the breezy late morning environment (they open at 11 on Sundays), I enjoyed the Market BLT which was a fried egg topped with pancetta, ricotta and served on brioche. I only ate about half of the bread it was served on because it was such a large portion, but the meal was pretty good. I would have liked it to come with some fruit but I'll know to ask for that next time. I noticed a dog sitting on the patio, which made me wonder if they have a dog friendly patio. I will look into this and report back because I know a certain cockapoo in my life named Harley who would have enjoyed this morning meal as well!expectations - reality = disappointmentwhile i still think the service here is awful 85% of the time, the food and atmosphere are too good to keep us away. i have to update my review to be fair because in all honesty i eat here at least 1 or twice a week for lunch. food= 5 starspatio= 5 starsservice= 0just lower your expectations on the service so that when you do get someone great you are pleasantly surprised! things i recommend in the order of how often i order them:sunflower salad- my fav salad on the planetwhite bean chili- oh gosh!!!! they need to do like a soup+salad/sandwich combo asappesto chicken sandwich w sweet potato chipsthat's pretty much all i order but i can say that their enchiladas are the bomb and so is the quesdilla. as for the desserts down in the market, we have yet to try something that wasn't amazing. crack pie, chocolate mousse thing in a mini pie crust, cake slices...seriously whenever we go for dessert it's amazing. the service in the market is alwas good, too!july 8, 2012For my birthday brunch, I ordered four menu items to share amongst everyone, which included the red velvet pancakes (but of course!), the Herb Tomato, goat cheese, and chive omelet, the Market BLT (I've tried it before, and it was fantastic!), and a new addition to the menu, one I'd wanted to try for two years now, but I keep missing the opportunity-- the Bourbon-ginger peach brioche French toast!  I also ordered two mango mimosas for my cousin and me (Mom and aunt did not want any)...What more can I say about the red velvet pancakes that I haven't said before? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=25P_k0Ot6qR9aV5IYzGTVQ#25P_k0Ot6qR9aV5IYzGTVQ  Just order them when you go, and thank me later.  I skipped on the omelet this time http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=YO8Ft30ml8XwNW4K2Drq3Q#YO8Ft30ml8XwNW4K2Drq3Q, since I had only one thing on my mind, and it was the French toast... OMG! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=pC5n1Ejy5dpyvZQlY1uTBQ#pC5n1Ejy5dpyvZQlY1uTBQ  This is how French toast should be prepared-- crispy, yet not greasy, on the outside and tender, not fluffy, on the inside.  The ratio of custard batter to bread was spot-on.  Nothin'  soggy 'bout it.  Oh, and the bourbon-ginger peach compote that was the crux of the entree?  Superb!  Yeah, I had to ask for another pot of this.  Hey, I'll take a couple of jars home, if you got some to sell!  I seriously hope I never have to choose between the red velvet pancakes and the French toast, because I wouldn't, COULDN'T begin to contemplate.  The only disappointment during the whole meal was the Street Market BLT. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=L03fNbFT9uWaiI69ELoUFw#L03fNbFT9uWaiI69ELoUFw  While the ingredients- pancetta, wild arugula, tomato, ricotta, and a fried egg (mmm... there's something about arugula and fried egg together...) tasted fantastic, the bread was over-charred, and it just almost ruined the dish.  I just peeled the bread back and ate the goodness in between.  Hmm... yeah.  'Tis best not to go there.Mango mimosas for $5 a pop?  I see many more Sundays off from work in my future!p.s.  Thank you Shad, and THB, for my glorious red velvet birthday cupcake! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=dk-G0E6bgC4JoZOQBPaqfQ#dk-G0E6bgC4JoZOQBPaqfQ  Three of us kept going back to the plate for more, and there were still leftovers... You were so right-- the cream cheese frosting was spectacular!

Review Text :
The GoodThe Hostess and Waitress seemed nice and the place is cute modern neat and clean .The BadBread basket contained squishy bread (Italians don't eat this kind of bread) but they do get a point for adding an herb and salting the top . pizzetta (margarita) I don't know how to describe but the crust had that very similar taste to frozen pizzas not even like a bad pizza out and unripe roma tomatoes were placed on top , the addition of some fresh basil topped the pie but didn't save it from tasting sort of cardboard like this was not tasty and after a bite or two we didn't feel like eating more .Herb roasted salmon tasted farm raised and was cooked to approx well done not sure about herbs but it tasted like salt pepper and garlic just a notch better than salmon off an Asian Buffet . This salmon ($15.75) dinner only came with what I think was the frozen broccoli cauliflower carrot mix you can always taste frozen especially in the broccoli . If I had this same meal in a food court at the mall  I'd say it was OK for a food court meal but even fresh vegetables are served at Panda Express and I don't intentionally go out to eat and pay for meals that are far lower quality than what I'd eat at home .My husband had the penne pepperonata and he thought his peppers were raw and said the sauce tasted like crushed tomatoes out of a can without seasoning also the pasta was gooey and over done .I do feel sick and sad for who ever owns this place and I hope they aren't like this all the time .I hope they get help from someone on how to prepare better food .Last Night was our first visit here but even Wild Horses would not be able to drag us back for a second visit .as a slight update the owner contacted me and said I was a "mudslinger" and he said I HAD A GOAL in saying something awful about his place...Gosh I don't know what I set wrong in my Yelp for not getting his message posted.I am NOT endorsing not to visit his place.....he didn't say anything about what I said about the food. maybe I was there when they weren't at their best?maybe we've ordered what they do least well?and maybe? they've improved since...I hope sogive them a try......I don't know what to say to the owner other than that.also I will mention now...that I left out we took our unfinished pizza home and it was packed sent to us all stuck together so I had to throw it out...I wanted to retry in case I was too harsh but as I said before they had unripe tomatoes that day so it didn't taste good and the dough I think might be frozen or a mix?I've given this place more than a few attempts to redeem itself. I personally feel that just because I had a bad experience at first doesn't necessarily mean it'll be bad the second or third time. Could've been a hiccup of sorts or poor staff.That being said, my latest "adventure" was nothing short of a dissaster. Sounds a bit dramatic I know but let me explain. I walk in, look around, place is empty and there's no hostess or a sign that says seat yourself...nothing. My boyfriend and I look at eachother and shrug so we find a cozy spot in a booth/table. It was a chilly evening and some italian comfort food sounded pretty good to me. Funny thing is my boyfriend warned me we should have gone to Olive Garden or something but I didn't want to drive far. About 8-10 minutes go by and a waitress who looked like she was not enjoying her day looks at us and sighs heavily. I looked at my watch to check if perhaps we came in right before closing time. (I know I would hate it as a server therefore I try to never do that) ...it was 8:30. I shrug it off thinking she's just having a bad day so I'm super nice to her and ask her how her day was..."fine" OK I get it cool. I ask for some cheesy bread for starter and a diet coke. (I know it's bad for you and I don't drink it often but I was in the mood for one and so was my bf) She asked us if we were ready to order our dinner, I said no, and she says, "Well just holler at me when you're ready" K...Cheesy bread comes and it's cold, diet cokes are flat and I'm biting my tongue. If there's one thing I hate it's complaining when the server is already upset. I didn't want anyone spitting in my food. My bf looks at me and pretty much reads my mind. We agreed to stay and see how the main course goes. At this point, we're ready to order...I decide with the baked ziti and the bf orders just a cheese pizza. Thinking sure that should be manageable right? No...food was cold and the pizza contained onions? Never asked for them and they aren't even standard on a cheese pizza. I'm thinking at this point that someone is totally messing with us. Needless to say, I would not be giving this place a fifth chance. I'M DONE!

Review Text :
Roe deer, rabbit, partridge, grouse.  Yes, we ate Disney's Bambi and it was delicious!All joking aside, Castle Terrace, a Michelin one star and part of the Paul Kitchin family of restaurants, delivers.  Where the Kitchin focused on the sea, Castle Terrace is about the land.  Outstanding sourcing of ingredients prepared with great respect to elevate their natural flavors.  A charming ambiance and friendly, proper service round out a near perfect dining experience.The menu is seasonal.  Two prestarters whet the palette.  A trio of amuse deceptions (they look nothing like they are supposed to be).  The best being a liquefied Caesar salad.  Like the liquefied olive, this one filled with the essence of romaine, egg, anchovies, sitting atop a crouton of parmesan.  Popped in the mouth the flavor of a true Caesar salad burst forth.   The second prestarter, an intense, acidic roasted tomato soup with a crisp olive stick.  A refreshing start to the meal to come.The starters; a stunning ravioli of partridge atop seared foie, caramelized pear, braised celery in a partridge consume.  Mind blowing..  The distinct rich, mineral flavor of the foie brings out the game flavor of the partridge and harmonizes it perfectly with the sweetness of the tender pear.  Balance beyond belief in a simple dish.Not to be out shown, a simple broccoli volute with goat cheese ravioli.  The clean vegetal flavor punched up by tangy, creamy goat cheese pillows and walnuts.  Perfect.For mains, the grouse with chanterelles, bread sauce and watercress puree, simply outstanding.  Very gamy, lean, and fork tender grouse pairs perfectly with all accompaniments.  The watercress puree adds a green vibrancy that brightens the palate between bites.  The legs are plated separately.  Cooked in the bird with the innards, it has a pronounced game flavor.  Outstanding.The roasted north sea cod presented topped with finely diced mushrooms and basil atop root veg, mushrooms and a "pasta sheet" of broccoli stems a harmonious blend of texture and flavor.  Perfectly cooked, the essence of cod elevated by the use of root veg once again.Finally, a barbecued and braised shoulder of Ayrshire pork.  Barbecue equals Asian flavors.  A crispy piece of belly, a playful interpretation of a pulled pork sandwich in a chickpea bun.  All told, the deep, sweet porky flavor explodes in this dish.Dessert is not to be missed.  The caramel soufflé with popcorn ice cream, decadently rich.  Distinct caramel aroma.  Caramel coated popcorn adds a good textural foil, the distinct popcorn flavored ice cream, the perfect foil to reduce the sweetness of the caramel.Great selection of cheeses with an emphasis on Scottish producers from the cart.  Quince jelly a nice touch.Very good wine list although lacking vintage depth.  Heavy focus on old world producers.  Fair pricing with average bottle £100.Service is unhurried, friendly, knowledgeable, and very professional.  Somewhat of a splurge, dinner for three £650.Three month advance booking required.  Credit card to warranty reservation.  Well worth the effort.

Review Text :
This new place is not your average fast-food chicago/greek style gyro joint, at all.  It's so much better....This is a fast casual semi-fine dining version of one of those restaurants.  The place is an oasis of clean and cozy considering the strip mall location.  They offer several authentic and freshly prepared choices for lunch and dinner, and use beautiful pictures of the dishes as part of the menu.  This not only helps a person less familiar with the food to select an item, but also ensures that you see SEVERAL dishes that look splenderific, causing you to plan your next visit before you've even finished ordering today's meal !I've had their delicious gyro and falafel sandwiches for lunch, but also the unexpectedly exciting marinated chicken breast sandwich, and sampled a few other dishes.Every time Daren C and I have been in for lunch, they've offered a bowl of soup as an appetizer -- several flavors have all been tasty.The food is really good, 4 - 4.5 stars.  The service is what really takes this place over the top into solid 5 star rating territory.  The husband and wife team running the show are friendly and will chat with all the new customers and 'new regulars' (the place isn't that old, but there are regulars already).  Watch for the little boy, though -- maybe 4 or 5 years old.   This little charmer who hangs out in the dining area is not only super polite, but he is likely to give you a shy "Are you enjoying your soup?", with no prompting from either parent.   While Daren and I ate last week, we heard his dad telll the story of how this little guy suggested they get one of those sign spinners, since it would be a good way to tell people about their new restaurant.  That little dude will be running this place someday.  It's certainly good enough to stay in busniess long enough.Whahht. No review from me yet? Sorry GFG I failed you. Knee Nose and his family are the best. I am glad they decided to park at 19th ave and Greenway. The kids are amazing lil business partners too. Get the lentel soup, 2 meat combo, w/ 1/2 salad 1/2 rice. that is 2 meals for the price of one! Go once a week for at least 10 weeks and try everything. it is all sooo good!PS. Check in here and tell em Daren sent ya!What a breath of fresh fresh air. The owner of this restaurant actually took my constructive criticism and made some very positive changes based on them. How awesome is that?Regarding the rice, apparently the staff who previously told me that they used chicken stock was misinformed. The owner showed me the seasoning they use and it is all veggie!They're also now carrying a vegan lentil soup daily and it's delicious!The pitas contain no dairy, which is awesome.This place makes some great veggie food and the owner is very friendly and responsive to customer needs.Definitely recommend that you check this place out!Brought my family in for dinner on a Saturday, and we were literally treated like guests in their home.This great, family-run, independant, unique eatery is just what everyone hopes for in their neigborhood.  If you're not in the neigborhood, don't worry, you'll be welcomed whole-heartedly. Drive past as many local fast food gyro joints as you need to on the way, and you'll be glad you did.Sometimes I forget that NOT EVERYONE is a super freak and loves the GFG food. I wonder how this is possible? The realize because I forget to tell you all. Close your eyes and imagine this....well shoot that didn't work...um...ok... err.The gyro bread is a soft, chewy, perfectly flavored, life vest for a quartet of ingredients. Spread lightly, yet enough to know it is there, is a hummus base used to tingle the taste buds in the back of your mouth as the flavor mixes with the fresh and crisp salad/lettuce/veggies mixture that is seasoned and intertwined with the lemon juice and tahini sauce. The charred and seasoned hunks of moist chicken fresh off the skewer are places on top the bed of mouth watering delight happening below. The flavors are meant to satisfy your buds and you will gladly lick the drippings off your wrist as they drizzle down at a constant pace because you never let the sandwich get more then 4 inches from your face the entire time...Damn just drooled on my shirt.  As a freaking devoured the entire thing last night all i could think about was two things. 1. Imagine how good this would be with a bunch of other Yelpers, chatting it up about the quality of the meat, veggies etc. The passion of Ninos and his amazing people skills. The impeccable cleanliness interior, furniture, kitchen, and my gosh the Restrooms...Mom would be proud. 2. How everyone of the Sheeple passing up GFG to go to CHINO BANDITO....and the cheap quality, messy atmosphere, disgusting bathrooms...don't get me wrong I go there but...Eat at Good Fellas and have a cookie at Chino's. Best of both worlds!I finally had the opportunity to take the whole family to enjoyed homey greek/mediterranean food.  It was a success.  The twins tried everything and those are some picky eaters.  I love the lentil soup, and I have told before in other reviews, I am not a soup person but this one is so delicious.  I guess I must have become a soup person, but I digress.  My chicken was so tender and marinated to perfection.  My little girl ate all her portion plus some of her brother's chicken.  THey both enjoyed the rice.  I was supposed to be off of carbs this week, but I couldn't pass up this one.  It is perfectly cooked rice.  The garlic sauce that comes with the chicken goes so well with it.  My hubby had a salad with some gyro meat on it.  He really enjoyed it.  The only bad thing is that this place is so far from us.  I could see having take out at least a couple of times a week, if I live closer.I'll be honest, if it wasn't for Yelp (and Daren C), I would have probably never known that Good Fellas Grill existed and I would have never known the deliciousness I was missing! I've eaten here several times now and I am officially a fan! I love Mediterranean food and Good Fellas Grill lives up to my love. Everything here is juicy, fresh and delicious.My favorite meal is the Mediterranean salad with either chicken or lamb. The meat is juicy with the perfect about of marination that makes it tasty with every bite. The salad is hefty and could easily be two meals. The salad dressing is salty and yummy! However, I will say that I'm a sucker for carbs and I love their buttery rice as well. I like to order a side of the rice. Other go-to items are the lentil soup and one of the meat dishes. Good Fellas is a no-frills, homey food style place. It's perfect for lunch on the go, for a casual lunch or dinner with kids or just if you want to grab some takeout! PS - it's right by Turf Paradise, so if you're there for the races, stop by on your way home!Wow! Lentil soup was amazing potato chicken soup was stellar. Real Gyro Meat! Can't wait to come back and my kiddo's loved  it to.I love  a family local restaurant.I read all the good reviews for this place so I thought I would give it a try.My friend lives close, so I said I will meet you there.To see it, you would never think ,oh this place will be great.It is in a strange shopping center. Right next to Chino Bandito,or something like that. Though I must try that place one day as well.When you walk in it smells divine!My friend was already there and had ordered an Ice Tea.She ended up getting the Chicken lettuce wraps, and I the Gryo dish,which is on a bed of fantastic rice.We each got the chicken Potato soup. Oh my gosh, everything was fantastic! Plus we even got pita bread and they were nice enough to give me hot tea,even though it is not on the menu.I even got 2 Baklava's to go. Which we had for dessert that night.So glad I read the reviews or I never would of known about this place.It is very clean as well, with nice clean rest rooms and lots of parking.

All. You. Can. Eat. Crab. Legs.(We'll come back to that part... are you hungry yet?)I have had the lobster enchiladas and was a bit "meh" over them. Not bad, necessarily, but I expected more. The sandwhiches have all gotten rave reviews from my tablemates. A simple order of crab or lobster has always been good.The salad has always been fresh except, admittedly, one night I wanted a little coleslaw to go... and I got a very little sample-pack size and it was not fresh and way heavy on the mayo. That made me a bit wary. But each time since then, it has been crisp, fresh, and tangy without being doused in mayo. I love their bisque and clam chowder and, as I said opening this post, I love the AYCE crab on Tuesday nights.It's always hot, fresh, and tasty. You get a ton of crab and all the tools you need to dig into it. They offer all the extras if you want them: butter, coleslaw, fries, etc. Not for me, though... I am a purist. Give me the crab, and no one gets hurt. Legs, claws, and bodies; freshly steamed and brought to the table steaming hot and with a lot of lemon. A bit messy, and totally worth every paper towel and wet towlette on the table.There are no limits, as I have witnessed in a group setting... As long as you keep ordering it, they will bring it to you. A table for two? No problem. A table for 8? No problem. And always with a smile.Service has been slow on occasion, but it's always friendly, personable, and dedicated to making sure you have what you want and enough of it to make you happy.Oh.... Do not miss some of the pastas... the crab mac n' cheese my friend had a few weeks ago made me miss mac n' cheese something FIERCE! It was amazing! A great go-to-spot for eating in or taking out. Doc Holliday's being connected, there is also full bar service. It's handy to have, let me tell ya...... and I will; maybe I'll see you on a Tuesday!

I had a groupon for this place so I went there around 9 AM to check it out. I really wanted to like the place since I live close by and absolutely love chicken tenders.I went ahead and placed my order just fine, but once I showed her my groupon things went downhill quick. The guy in the back started saying something along the lines of "oh great our first groupon of the day" in a sarcastic tone like my friend and I were just wasting their time. He appeared to be one of the owners. So that made me feel pretty awesome. The lady then started writing down the numbers of the groupon and handed me back my phone. I was putting it into my pocket when she became very direct and in my opinion rude, accusing me of not hitting the redeemed button. I told her that I had hit redeemed and she then gave me the death stare and asked me to place my phone down on the counter. To say the least it was an extremely awkward situation. I was tempted just to leave but for some reason I truly thought the food would make up for the service.The food was ok. Chicken tenders were very juicy but to me they lacked any kind of real kick in flavor or crunch from the breading. The G-fries were pretty good though all the way around. Beignets were ok as well. I guess if you've never had the real thing then you would probably like them quite a bit. To be honest the service was horrible. I still can't believe how the owner who probably placed the ad would say something like that whether or not he thought I could hear him. As for the lady who actually took my order, I have no idea if it was just an off day or if she truly believes it's ok to talk to people and treat them like that. Maybe she's not a morning person but if that's the case they either should keep her off the morning schedule or just open later.Save yourself money and time and avoid this place. I'm being serious... run far far away.

Restaurant name  Umami Ramen & Dumpling Bar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Points for being a rehabbed home, but that's where most of the excitement stops. Staff has never been all to welcoming/friendly/warm/suggestion-oriented and honestly up and down Willy I can get some pretty mean dumplings at a number of places. Their buns are tasty though, I'll give them that, but I just don't think it's worth the trip for one specialty item.I think the best way to do Umami is family-style with a group of friends. Order everything, share it all, and split the bill evenly. That's what I did on a cool fall night. We sat out on the deck and ordered the following: pork buns, spicy pulled pork buns (the special), beef buns, pork dumplings, the ramen special (served cold with raw veggies), and the pork ramen.Out waiter, Spike, was incredibly helpful in guiding us along. He suggested that if we wanted to split ramen, they could separate the order into two bowls and add a bit more meat and noodles for a slight up charge. It was the perfect amount this way! He also was nice about informing us about he intriguing things on the menu that we weren't familiar with, such as the "garlic bomb" (puréed fresh garlic blended with butter... Add a touch to your pork ramen! Soooooo good!)My favorites were definitely the spicy pulled pork buns and the pork ramen, but everything was delicious. I loved the fluffy buns and the tender meat, with just the right amount of heat to everything. The warm, flavorful ramen was just what I needed outside on a night with a bit of a chill.I definitely was feeling the high salt content later, but it was so worth it. Just be sure to wash it down with some water and/or a pint!I'll definitely be returning with my crew for a no-fuss feast!Dropped by for a drink on 3/31; ended-up staying for dinner.+ Sat at the bar, which was empty at 6:15pm on Monday night+ Happy hour runs from 5-7pm; 2-for-1 taps, rails, and sake+ Bartender was prompt and eager to help- Bartender stayed *extremely* eager/anxious/persistent through entire visit, until it came time to pay the check; then she was M.I.A.- Bartender never exchanged any pleasantries - it was *all* business and only about getting more things for us; no "how are things?" or "you're welcome" - it was, "you ready for another round?" or "ready to order entrees?" - with as dead as it was, she seemed to be in a hurry to get us out of there+ Saketini was excellent+ Tuna Poke (essentially tuna tartare) was good; a bit over-dressed, but decent- Ramen was mediocre; despite being pork, it tasted more like seafood- Sorbet was ok- Overpriced. $12 for a bowl of ramen, plus $1.50 to split it into two bowls, plus $1 for "flavor bombs"? I'm sorry... a bowl of soup with some noodles and a smattering of super-shaved pork should not cost $16. Our light meal (one appetizer, splitting an order of dumplings and splitting an order of ramen, sorbet, plus a few drinks (all during happy hour)) cost $81 with tip. That's a tad outrageous in my opinion. I'm still not sure how it all added-up to be so expensive - I hate being nickle-and-dimed by places. For comparison, my last dinner at Forequarter was $74 with tip, and we had a much better meal and experience.

It's been quite a while since my first review and I feel the need to upgrade them a bit. They are still not my favorite place in town. The flavors just aren't dynamic enough and sometimes the food is a tad bit bland, but they are solid and have relatively reasonable prices for the portions they serve.The meats are well-cooked but a little under seasoned. I like the pastor and lamb. They are a little heavy handed with the onion, so if that's not your thing ask for it on the side.

being vietnamese and not looking to eat pho as i can just ask my mom for it, when i heard about an authentic vietnamese restaurant that doesn't offer pho, i had to try.banh xeo is a savory crepe with pork, shrimp, bean sprout and green onion eaten wrapped in lettuce and herbs dipped in nuoc mam or if you are like me and don't feel like making a mess, all mixed in a bowl eaten with a fork.can't be more authentic than that. it brought me back to my childhood days when i used to eat it the lettuce wrapped way.banh cuon is another safe dish to get. it's a sticky flour roll dish with shiitake mushroom and ground pork. eating as is or with nuoc mam. definitely better and fresher than what you'd get at the grocery storeif you are feeling a bit more adventurous, you could try the durian milkshake. the infamous stinky fruit. personally, i can't stand the smell of the fruit. it smells foul especially when ripped and humid outside. it's a combination of rotten eggs, #2 diapers sitting in the sun but apparently praised for it's custard like feeling and sweet onion vanilla taste. well, i tried the milkshake and it's not bad at all. made with frozen durian, ice, milk and condensed milk (and maybe some vanilla ice cream), you get a frozen concoction that has a french onion soup taste but without the foul smell (of the durian) associate with it. you do have the bad breath thoughif you are looking for traditional authentic vietnamese dishes and are tired of the usual pho, it's a must try place.me being vietnamese, i can just make it at home and according to my mom, for what you'd be spending there, better to make it at home but if you're lazy (i know i can be), it's a good placeps. like all vietnamese restaurants, closed on tuesday

Throughout history we have been plagued by deep philosophical questions: Why do you always want what you can't have? Why did the chicken cross the road? And why does the craving for Chick-fil-A hit on Sunday? No matter. Chick-fil-A is good any day of the week! Making it through to Monday for the deep-fried in peanut oil cravings to subside is well worth it just to indulge in those waffle fries once again. And the sauces: Buttermilk Ranch, Honey Mustard, Chick-fil-A Sauce, Honey Roasted BBQ, Polynesian. What is in those sauces that makes them taste so good? No, seriously, what is in them? Does anyone have a recipe that even comes close? 'Cause today is Sunday.

I asked a local where to hit up brunch in this hood and he directed me here. A little French bistro with a great menu filled with salads, sandwiches, egg and crepe options, this little place was packed on a Monday afternoon.I went with the sandwich and soup combo for $12. The chicken club and a cup of creamy tomato (though as the waiter mentioned, the soup was not too creamy, just a hint). The sandwich was large with delicious crunchy bread and what tasted to be a homemade garlic aioli. I loved it. The chicken was sliced thinly so you could actually get your mouth around the sammy (we are clearly not in Jersey anymore). The soup was perfect with chunks of vegetables; I couldn't have asked for a better lunch. It was large but not too big where I felt like death after. Service was amicable if not a wee but unprofessional, food was more than agreeable. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the neighborhood and need a nice little lunch spot.

Restaurant name  Ravella at Lake Las Vegas
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I'm writing this to warn potential visitors to avoid the Ravella and actually Lake Las Vegas in general. The entire area is depressing with very little activity (it picks up on weekends). Many of the shops in the village have gone out of business (or soon will). The Ravella is not a 4-star property-- more like 3.  We had horrible service here from almost every department. We booked a package and both the photos/description they provided as well as those on the Ravella web site make the area and resort look wonderful. We assumed since the hotel used to be the Ritz that it would be nice and offer excellent service, hence the reason we booked it. Having stayed on the strip most every other visit, we were ready for a change. I only wish I had done some research on the area first. Search the web for "Lake Las Vegas Foreclosure" and you'll get more information than you probably want. Here's a history of the opening of the Ravella. It used to be the Ritz Lake Las Vegas for at least 5 years. In 2009, the property got foreclosed upon (actually so did the entire Lake Las Vegas development). It is now owned by Deutsche Bank Group. Interesting note, this is the same group that owns the Cosmopolitan Hotel on the strip (which was also foreclosed on prior to opening). From what I've read online, the bank has no interest in running hotels but has been forced into it (no one will buy the hotels from them). After the Ritz left, the hotel was empty for almost a year before opening up under the Ravella name in February of this year ('11). It is now being managed by the Dolce Hotel Group.As for the specific issues we encountered, I've posted a detailed review on TripAdvisor should you want to learn more about our experience. Yelp limits the amount of characters for its reviews.In short, I recommend that you avoid this hotel as well as Lake Las Vegas in general. Don't make the same mistake we did.

We called ahead for faster seating and it definitely helped. The wait was considerably less than Egg Works up the street. The food and service were both pretty good. I wouldn't recommend the bloody Mary's though. They were horrible, basically bad tomato juice and a lime.  They are really cheap, but still not really worth it.  Orange Juice wasn't really anything to cheer about either. My Pacific Scramble was good, and I also enjoyed the Gluten free pancakes. The Bf liked his corned beef hash.  Our server was Mark, and he was very attentive. All in all it was a pretty good breakfast. I'll be back. Fair warning: It's not easy to ignore the desserts cleverly displayed in the front.

Review Text :
I did something different today. Whenever I try a Vietnamese place for the first time, I usually get the combination pho. It's my baseline dish for comparing Vietnamese restaurants.But thanks to My T's review, I just had to try their Bun Bo Hue. It's something I've never ordered before, so I have nothing with which to compare. That's really not a problem, of course. In the end, I enjoyed the soup. My friend, Lisa Y, says it's not her fave BBH in town. As for me, it was pretty darn good. I loved the tenderness of the beef. It wasn't very spicy--from what I understand, BBH is supposed to be spicy--but it had a nice hint of heat that enhanced the flavor without the usual runny nose effect.I should point out that the bowls did not come out with pig feet. I asked about them and they brought a couple right out. I guess they figure that pig feet probably don't appeal to non-Vietnamese people, but it's listed as part of the dish on the menu! Anyway, that's a minor complaint.The one weird thing about this place is the lighting. It's fluorescent, but many of the panels are blue, while a couple of them are orange. They just give the place a strange hue. Obviously, it's not a reason to avoid the place. But as a photographer, it's something that caught my attention.I was way out in the northwest today and decided to try a Pho place up in this area.  So based on YELP, I tried out Viet Bistro and walked away very happy.1.  If you haven't read My T. or Paolo D review of this place yet, do so.  I used it for my analysis and visit and I was happy!2.  Parking - strip mall, very easy.  Odd that it is near a cigar bar, which has a very distinct cigar aroma, however, once inside the restaurant, you cannot smell the cigars.3.  Ambiance - Small narrow place, with purple walls. Nice overall.  Small and cozy. Nothing fancy.4.  Drinks - I always prefer fountain drinks and they do have this over the canned sodas, so definitely a plus.5.  Food - Ahhh,  I tried the Bun Bo Hue based on MyT an Paolo D review an it was great. It was not too spicy at all, and in fact, was very subtle.  This is great as it is not too overpowering and you can always add more spices or the jalepenos.  The noodles were just right in terms of texture and firmness.  The serving size was just right and this is the first time that I drank so much of the broth. It was very, very tasty.  My son had P11 and he enjoyed it as well as with an Iced Coffee.I also ordered to sandwiches to take home and they taste great and better yet, the aroma is even better.There is a ton of stuff on this menu. I will come back again, although it is about 35 minutes from where I live in Henderson!!!6.  Service - As good as it gets.GK says, check it out.I've lived in Las Vegas almost 5 years and somehow have avoided the Pho craze until now. I always hear amazing things about it but somehow I never felt compelled enough to drive to a Vietnamese restaurant until a few days ago when I was getting a massage.The waitress/owner was great. She understood that I was a Pho virgin and wanted me to have the best experience possible. I ended up with a combination Pho and was very happy with my choice. I can't truly judge my overall Pho experience because I have nothing to base it on. However, I do know that the Pho broth was incredible and the friendly and attentive service was for sure worth 4 stars. I also added a 3 bean dessert that was as incredible as it was strange in both taste and consistency. I have NO CLUE what I ate.Half of my week is spent working in Summerlin, and the Vietnamese options are slim pickings, but this is my go to spot when the craving arises during my work lunch hour.  For quality of the pho, I would rate them around 3.5 stars since the stock is a bit on the sweeter side and not as complex but a step above msg stock from a packet of powder, and there does appear to be a markup of $1-2 from similar entrees in Chinatown.  I completely agree with other reviews regarding their Bun Bo Hue since it's a bit toned down for less adventurous palates (not inherently spicy, but using their housemade chili sauce really elevates the dish) and there is a lack of the blood-cake and random pork parts (pork hock included only by request) that make this dish unique. I know that some folks may make a general rating based on traditional items such as pho and banh mi, but I think the true gems on this menu lie a little off the beaten path.  The shrimp paste spring rolls are tightly wrapped like cuban cigars and have a nice ratio of meat and vermicelli/vegetables with the rice skin having a nice toothsome texture.  They also have some other intriguing items in the appetizer section such as a deep fried savory vietnamese crepe, carpaccio salad, and other items that I am excited to try.  One dish in particular was recommended by the manager on my most recent visit : the shrimp and crab udon soup (banh canh cua).   I was a bit skeptical since I expected some half Vietnamese/Japanese concoction with imitation crab and overcooked shrimp in a bland clear broth, but what arrived was an unexpected deluge of flavor that blew me away!    The broth is thick and  starchy like a good hot and sour soup with bits of real crab meat bathing unctuous udon noodles made with tapioca flour (not to be confused with the Japanese variety) that had a hybrid texture between italian bucatini and Korean dukbokki.  The manager strongly recommended adding a generous sprinkle of black pepper and I wanted to increase the heat with a dollop of the chili paste so I applied both.  I'm usually a fairly adventurous eater that likes to constantly try new things on a menu, but this was one of those dishes where I seriously contemplated never ordering anything else again because I didn't want to deal with the regret of ordering an inferior dish.  The noodles/broth ratio was great since I still had noodles down to my last bite and the thick broth is perfect to coat the udon with layers of umami since the noodle isn't capable of absorbing much flavor.  The only weak spot was the shrimp since they were indeed a tad overcooked and lacked the sweetness and snap of the recently caught variety.  Definitely earns a spot amongst my top 10 vietnamese soups in Las Vegas.More like 3.5 but I will round down due to the cigar stench from the smoke shop next door.  I understand it is not the restaurant's fault, but it doesn't change the fact that it is unpleasant. It is fairly spacious inside with a very standard, devoid of personality type decor. The service can be hit or miss, but even on the "hit" day it's the bare minimum consisting of a water refill. The pho is actually good. The broth is flavorful and they do not skimp on the meat. The prices are very reasonable for the quantity of food that you get. On my last few visits I had their vermicelli with grilled pork and pork paste. The taste is ok and they do skimp on the meat. I ordered an extra side of grilled pork for my husband and I to share just because the few pieces that come standard get lost in the mix quickly. I still prefer the pho and vermicelli at Pho Saigon 8 on Eastern and 215, but this one is considerably closer to my house.Location is clean, service is polite and prompt. I like how they use blue film covers over the fluorescent overhead lighting to keep it from being too harsh, gives the dining room almost a lounge atmosphere.But the food.Salt and pepper calamari order was $7 for 14 grease-soaked pieces, without any salt or pepper. Very bland, only tasted like grease, served with cups of sweet and sour sauce? Best part was the random pieces of fried carrot used as garnish.The "special combination" bahn mi, with a smiley-face next to it on the menu, was a huge disappointment. Meat was all stacked on one end of the sandwich. I opened it up to distribute it evenly, only to find several blackened pieces of meat- the type of coloration that looks like food that has gone bad, not blackened from cooking. Picked out several pieces, then bit in, only to encounter some crazy spicy sauce or seasoning that was so strong it made my eyes water. All I could see were jalapenos (one piece on the entire sandwich?), and I don't mind those. This place may be right next to my gym, and the pho may be delicious, but I will not be coming back. If you can't reliably serve unspoiled cooked meat on your sandwiches, I am not going to trust the meat cooked in your soups.

My man picked me up and we were in the mood for a sandwich. I was so glad we found a JJ's nearby! The store was clean and employees very helpful and friendly.I ordered a "Beach Club". It had Fresh baked turkey breast, provolone cheese, avocado spread, sliced cucumber, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I asked them to leave the sprouts off and they said they didn't offer them anymore so I don't know if that is just this location no longer offering them or all of them. This sandwich was delicious! I could eat one everyday! The cost for this sandwich was $5.75My man had the "Italian Night Club". He actually ordered 2 of these because he has a big appetite and the sandwiches are just 8 inches so not quite the footling you would get at Subway. This sandwich had genoa salami, Italian capicola, smoked ham, and provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, and Italian vinaigrette. This sandwich also cost $5.75JJ's delivers an caters. You can place orders online.I love JJ's! The prices are very affordable for what you get. This will make a great lunch stop while working on this side of town. I'm a fan and will be back!

Review Text :
Never in my life have I been treated so rudely. I visited the upstairs club section of Savoy on a Saturday night with a large group of friends. Upon going downstairs to use the restroom, I was prohibited from going back upstairs with no reason or justification. Upon calmly questioning several members of the management team, I was treated EXTREMELY rudely and virtually dismissed by the owner, who cited he did not need my business. Savoy has a nice atmosphere, but the customer service is seriously lacking. I'd prefer to spend my money at a place where my business is appreciated.This is another one of those: "where to start?" reviews...From the beginning.My husband and I had reservations for a Friday evening.  The restaurant was kind enough to call the day before and remind us of our reservation as well as let us know that there is a dress code.  Friday comes along and we are both VERY excited for our date night and to try a new place -- especially one that looks as nice as Savoy.  We got dressed -- me in a casual dress, him in slacks and a sweater, and we headed down to the Strip.  Now I understand that this is the Strip, but the parking situation was horrendous.  To make matters worse, where there could have been 5 or 6 parking spots in front of the restaurant, they were setting up valet parking so those were automatically out.  After driving around for a few minutes we found a spot about 2 blocks away and hoofed it to the restaurant.  I'm not deducting "points" because of the parking situation, but just want other people to know that it was a bit inconvenient.As we approached the front of the restaurant I noticed that there was a large group of people standing outside, a couple of "bouncer" type looking guys and a camera crew.  They didn't move aside when we approached so we had to kind of weave/skirt around them to get to the door.  It was very weird.  I felt a little like we were walking through paparazzi to get inside of the restaurant.Inside the restaurant we went to the hostess stand and let them know we had reservations.  They took our coats (which was quite nice) and told us it would be a few minutes for our table to be ready and that we could wait at the bar if we wanted.  Which would have been okay had there been a spot at the bar.  The bar/lounge area was PACKED and VERY noisy.  After a while, a couple moved from the bar and we squeezed into their place so we could order a drink.  I had a diet coke and hubby had a beer -- they only have bottles, no drafts.  The drinks were overpriced IMO, my diet coke was over $2 and DH's beer (a domestic) was $6 or 7.  After about 15 minutes we were seated.  We had to pay the bar tab separately, and could not combine it with our dinner.  (An inconvenience, but minor.)  I had hoped there would be a separate dining area away from the bar, but no, our table was RIGHT NEXT TO IT.  So all of the nosiness from the bar was in no way buffered from the dining area.  I literally could barely hear him talking to me.The waitstaff was quick and friendly.  They brought us water and bread with flavored oil and took our drink orders.  I asked them to refill my diet coke and I was surprised when we got our bill to find out that I was charged AGAIN for my drink.  This seems like a bit of a ripoff.We went ahead and ordered: we had the mini sliders for our appetizer and then my husband order chicken and waffles for his entree and I had the steak two ways.  The sliders came fairly quickly and were warm but a bit flavorless.  I couldn't put my fingers on what they were missing, but they could have been MUCH better.It took longer than I would have expected for our dinner to arrive.  When DH got down to the chicken and waffles he seemed unimpressed.  He actually told me the SYRUP was the best thing on the plate.  I've seen this man put away chicken and waffles.  He only ate about half of what they gave him and didn't ask for the leftovers to be boxed.My beef two ways was... interesting.  I was really excited to try the sous-vide beef!  It tasted (and had the consistency) of pot roast.  It wasn't bad... it just wasn't good.  The grilled beef was quite tasty and the garnishes on the plate were good, too.  I had also ordered a side of mashed potatoes and they tasted like they were about three days old and reheated in a microwave -- and poorly at that -- they were cold and lumpy.We looked at the dessert menu, but having been so uninspired by the rest of the meal we decided to cut our losses.  We tipped generously -- the servers were friendly and attentive -- but that is about all I can say that is positive about this place.  We won't be returning.I had heard about Savoy for years. About how beautiful the space was and how expensive the food was but, I had never went for dinner. I had tasted Savoy's food before at the Pittsburgh Magazines Best Restaurants Party multiple times and at the Yelp Tech Shop Event and at the Yelp's Soirée @ Savoy Elite event. Each time the food was very good.I saw a $49 Groupon Deal for Savoy that I couldn't pass up that included two entrees and one dessert of your choice. I decided to check them out for a date night with my wife Tamika so we could finally see what all the fuss was about. Now let me tell you about the space. All I can say is WOW! It is absolutely beautiful. Savoy has to be one of the most beautiful spaces in Pittsburgh. Once inside you fill like you've been transported to Atlanta, New York or Miami. It was created by Pittsburgh designer Luca Paganico and transformed an dated three story building into a posh and intimate restaurant with leather couches and chairs, a fiber optic bar, and walls with lighting that changes color as patrons dine. Upstairs in the lounge area was just as beautiful. With four separate sectional couch areas with TVs on the wall. I know it had to cost a fortune to build and furnish the space.We started off with drinks. I had the Peach on Peach and the Mrs. had the Blueberry Mojito. The drinks took a while to reach the table but, once they did they were worth the wait.Next we enjoyed a complementary bread basket with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It was very good followed by an amazing lemon sorbet to cleanse our palates.For our entrees I had the N.Y. Strip Steak with compressed mushrooms, Yukon whipped potatoes and haricots verts. The streak was cooked perfectly and just how I asked for it to be cooked. My only complaint is that the sauce for the streak was extremely salty. Also like when the salt was added the top was loose and salt got dumped onto my plate. My wife had the Pork Chops which was one of the dinner features that night. Her pork chops were even more salty then my steak so she only ate about a quarter of it and took the rest home. Savoy does offer quite a few Gluten Free dining options as wellFor dessert we shared the salted carmel chocolate torte. (Roasted banana ice cream, milk chocolate cashew bark and chocolate fondue) It was even chosen as Savor Pittsburgh's Dish of the Year for 2013. IT WAS AMAZING! Service was superb the entire evening. I also like the fact that you can make reservations right from the Savoy website which are a must as the space only seats about 75 people.All in all Savoy is a nice place that I would visit for sure for drinks during Happy Hour and go somewhere else for dinner. I just cannot with a clear conscience justify the prices without a Groupon Deal.What a pleasant surprise!!Here's the deal: I was apprehensive about going to Savoy. The prices are on the high end, there's no doubt about that. There's a recommended dress code, and the website describes the restaurant as being inspired by high-end dining establishments in cities far bigger than our little 'Burgh.So these are fancy things. And, well, I'm just not that fancy of a broad. I was a little apprehensive that I was going to be way out of place at a fancy restaurant.But once you're in the doors, you're treated like a regular, even if it's your first visit. Yes, Savoy is classy, swanky, and as fancy as a 'get on the list months in advance' New York restaurant, but in no way is it pretentious. From the friendly hostess at the front to the excellent attention from our server and assistant server to the managers strolling through and chatting with patrons, this place has service down to an art form.We went on Monday night, which is Jazz Night, and you should too. Great music while you enjoy your food and beverages - who can argue with that?We started with the fried calamari and shrimp plate. This could have easily fed 3 or 4 people (and yet the two of us managed to plow through it somehow, mostly because we are foodie troopers, I guess). The breading was so light and crispy, and it came with a little dish of sun-dried tomato horseradish cream sauce that was heavenly.For entrees, my husband got the shrimp and grits (because he just cannot pass that up on a menu). This dish was stacked: andouille sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms, and scallions on top of the grits, and all the flavors worked together. Very savory and creamy and filling all at once.For my entree, I got the pork chop (because I just cannot pass up a pork chop on a menu). The house preparation is 'medium well,' which is waaaay more well done than I ever order my meat (yes, even pork), but I decided to trust the chef and go for it. That proved to be a good decision: there was nothing tough about this pork at all. It was super juicy and accompanied by a sweet potato puree, mushroom ragout, sauteed kale & arugula, and little balls of apples. So very, very good.Throughout dinner, we also had baskets of bread delivered to the table. There are several different varieties: olive, rosemary, little sweet buns, all accompanied by olive oil & balsamic for dipping. We enjoyed wine with our meals, as well as the fabulous sounds of Roger Humphries and his band the RH Factor, the featured band for Jazz Night.Service was excellent: never was a water glass empty, never did a finished plate linger on the table. All of our questions about the menu were answered by our server Jared, and he was prompt, attentive, and friendly.The only negative I could find about Savoy is that yes, it is a little on the pricey side, and (brace yourselves) they make their Cosmopolitans with triple sec. Yes, this may seem a minor detail to some, but it is one of the Seven Deadly Foodie Sins According To Fox. And I wouldn't have minded seeing some bourbon on the spirits menu for after-dinner. Lucky for me, there was a solid selection of wines to choose from (both by the bottle and by the glass, as well as a tawny port for dessert), so I didn't have to worry if the spirits menu wasn't right for me.So, triple-sec-related-sins aside, Savoy is the real thing. Great food, great service, great wine, great atmosphere, and great music on Jazz Night (complete with middle-aged couples getting up and dancing, the best!). With an option like this, there's no excuse for not going out on a Monday!

Review Text :
Rocky's is the kind of place my family loves, and I look at them like they are crazy.  Extremely greasy, divey joints are not my thing.  At all.  But they dragged me here one Saturday morning, and Rocky's is what it is.  No frills divey breakfast.Exceptionally greasy food makes me ill, and Rocky's succeeded at doing that.  I don't eat potatoes, and every breakfast meal option came with potatoes.  There is no variety, the menu has 10 things tops.  To top that off, they were out of a lot of things.  But you know what?  Where else can you go for breakfast and eat for around $5 per person including a drink?No bathrooms.  They must be grandfathered in, or they are just running a super illegal business.  Either way, when you are feeling violently ill after eating a meal here or just need to pee from drinking coffee, you'll be miserable, if you are like me.Why three stars?  Because my dad is watching me type this and told me that I couldn't give them two.  So for my dad and the cheap prices, three stars.  Bring your family members ages 50+ here.  They'll appreciate it.

Review Text :
I would give this place at least 3.5 stars but they are a sold 3, not convinced they are ready for me to round up to a 4 just yet. As I leave my office for my typically late (130-2p) lunch, I decided I was craving a sandwich, after seeing the latest @sammich_es post on twitter. Knowing I would be hard pressed to get a true "sammich"around here I began my journey.  I had promised to give the Gyro at Coney Island another shot (they offer a $7.55 meal deal, hard to beat).  But I had also seen that this place [Spoonz] had opened up relatively recently and I am always one to try something new and spread my "wealth" around. They have a few tables outside, which is nice because for the most part this section of the street is shaded during the heat of the day.  I walked inside and positioned myself to the right side of the counter to see what they offered.  Their menu is simple but with a good variety, coffee drinks, teas, sandwiches, soupsand salads.  You can order one of their sandwich or salad creations or design your own from a list of options.  They also had a thick quiche in the fridge case and some yummy looking pastries.  Finally deciding on the Country ham panini with ginger mango chutney, tomato and swiss on multi grain bread, $6.95 plus tax, no chips...are they extra? I grabbed a seat in the colorful, relatively small diner and waited.  It didn't take long. I picked up my sandwich.  It was toasted, and generously filled with ham and the mango chutney was just right and complemented the ham quite well. I don't recall tomato and the cheese was one thin slice relative to the amount of ham.  But hey I guess I don't really need much more cheese than that anyway.  The service was no frills, no hello's upon entry, no "Dolores your order's ready.", even though they took my name, but they did say Thank you as I grabbed a menu and left, that counts.I'm sure I will be losing my Duchess status of Spoonz soon.  I have been going less and less over the last couple months, and they are housed on the lobby level of my building.The service has been just ok since Vita left.  The owner (female) is really unpleasant and doesn't seem to be happy about being there.The Scottsdale panini is decent, although the quality of the chicken seems a little lowered recently.  The owner (male) once told my coworker and I  that they cook the meat offsite and simply heat it back up at Spoonz.  Something about not having a proper oven/grill? An ex employee of Spoonz was an incredible pastry chef and made amazing desserts.  Not sure how the treats are now, as I'm skeptical there's a bunch of "boxed" desserts.For coffee, I'd rather walk a few hundred yards more for Starbucks.Wow, this review really is quite negative.  Spoonz is good when you're in a pinch downtown.  I doubt people are going too far out of their way to come here.

Restaurant name  La Petite France

Review Text :
A HIDDEN GEM OF SCOTTSDALE! located in a court area of the Seville Shopping Center. (no signs to let you know it is there)Authentic French Bistro dining with real French staff featuring baguettes, crepes,quiches, Flammekueche (French pizzas), crosty (stuffed potatoes) and possibility the VERY BEST DESSERTS in Scottsdale.The Bistro is quaint and charming with a large patio and the dishes are served on interesting plates. We decided to try crostys for lunch they came with interesting fresh salads served first. My companion had his crosty with sausage, provolone, Parmesan and mine was smoked salmon onions, cream fraiche & dill. Both potatoes came out piping hot and both were ooey gooey with cheese but potatoes were not fluffy and were brown on edges, also I wasn't excepting cheese on the salmon and would ask for no cheese if I ordered this again. So the lunch entree was really about 3 stars on this visit but dessert was on a level so much better I think 4 stars rounds it up.The STAR of this lunch was the lemon mousse perfection in flavors, texture a perfect mouth feel and design,I have to say this is the VERY BEST mousse I ever had and if I came in for just dessert this would have been FIVE STAR Yelp. The mousse was a cut round in shape topped with a strong  shiny orange under it was the thick layer of intense lemon mousse that wasn't too sweet but perfect and under that was a thinner layer of chocolate mousse that reminded me of pot de creme but wasn't. If you dine near that dessert case you will get hypnotized and fall surrender to one of the many amazing desserts they all looked wonderful.Service was very charming but clunky. Beverages ordered came after salad water was not refilled and we had to ask for check.Slight updateBusiness has been sold to a new French Owners recently.I came here for a Saturday night dinner with V and L.  V and I had a hard time locating the place.  We drove around the corner not knowing the place was inside the plaza so you can't see if from the parking lot.  HA!  We loved the feel to the place.  It is small but just cute!  The server was totally helpful and funny.  We ordered:La Classique Tartes Flambees - crème fraîche, onions, bacon, cheese:  YUM!Notre-dame Wood Oven Pizza - prosciutto, mozzarella, tomatoes, onions, crème fraîche, pesto:  Pretty good!Chicken, Bacon, Mozzarella Pizza: WHOA, greatness!!!Dessert:Crêpe hot chocolate:  NEED TO GETCrème brulee chocolate flavored:  GOODNESSCrêpe nutella:  Was good, but the hot chocolate kicked butt!!!How cute is this bistro! I absolutely love this place! Went to La Petite France with some girlfriends who wanted to celebrate my 40th birthday, and was very thrilled this was the place that was picked, have been wanting to try them for a while now!When we got their we were greeted with a friendly warm welcomed and showed to our table. The place inside is just so cute! I love the Paris Clock next the coffee maker.I ordered the La Jardiniere (spinach & mushroom quiches) and was exactly how I expected it to be. Light, fluffy, and very very tastly! The dough was amazing, come to find out, they make their own dough by hand and everything is cooked in a brick oven. My friends ordered the Vegetarienne Tarte Flambees, which was loaded with crème fresh, fresh tasting veggies and cheese, and that too was amazing. The food was c'est magnifique! Also had a Carmel Café, which was devine! Loved it!Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu! One for sure is the crème brulee!! It's one of my favorite desserts!La Petite France is so quaint and cute!!  It is pretty tucked away in a nice outdoor shopping strip (curse AZ strip malls), which is kind of nice to be off the busy road.  The down side is I am not sure how much impromptu traffic they get, which is why I need to get the word out.  It would be horrible if this place went away.  I found this La Petite France on a mission for a new brunch spot, some of the central Scottsdale/Old Town Scottsdale places are too packed with poor service and food that is just okay and like anywhere else.  When I saw fresh crepes and chocolate croissants on the menu I had to come check it out.  Take the effort to find it (many other breakfast options)!  Park your car and basically walk to the middle of the shopping corridor and you will find La Petite France.  I sat down and was immediately poured a glass of water and they set a full bottle of water on the table for me.  I was informed of the daily specials, which all sounded quite delicious.  I ended up opting for the croissant plate with coffee.  MMMMMmmmmmm I was not disappointed; the croissants were so buttery and flaky!!  Get the chocolate croissant.A friend of mine happened to be walking by on a weekend walk, so I invited her to join me.  It turns out my server was the owner and he told us all about new changes happening with the menu.  They have an actual French chef, meaning he is from France.  The staff is outstanding: very nice, professional, yet amazingly 'neighborhoody' for a Scottsdale restaurant.  Review #2:  Before I finished my review draft I came back to LPF!  That is a testament to how great this place is in my book.  The owner told me about the mussels when he was talking about the menu at my breakfast visit, so Friday instead of happy hour with my girl Kristen, we decided on wine and mussels.  La Petite France can do mussels 3 different ways...we opted for the traditional white wine, garlic, etc.  We wanted to lick the bowl clean!!! The bread is house made and fantastic!  The mussels were of course good, but it was the 'broth' around the mussels that we dipped the bread in that had us drooling.  I am going to have to come back and try the other two mussel dishes.  Also two tables near us had the Le Filet du Pechuer (serves 2 people), which is basically a soup with various kinds of fish, squid and shellfish that smelled AMAZING as it went by on the cart.  The one table told us we have to come back just for that dish, and said they come here regularly just for it.  Did I mention they have rack of lamb too...looks like I have quite a few trips back to La Petite France in my future!A bunch of Yelpers and I were craving for something sweet after attending Irene's UYE at Cuttlefish yesterday.  Chez Vous, across the parking lot, was closed, so Linda and I thought La Petite France was another great option.  We initially thought there were five of us going, but one couple didn't appear...Linda had mentioned last year that LPF had changed owners, so I was glad to see that Val (co-owner) was still there!  (I suppose Linda's last visit was before I had started going there.)  On to the food... I decided to go with a past breakfast choice of mine, the $8.95 Hot chocolate ("sugar, butter, chocolate, cinnamon"), which Yelp friend Judy F. had suggested in her review.  While last night's crepe was d'lish, it wasn't as good as I had remembered to be. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-petite-france-scottsdale?select=1CMIghOEB95KYwUxjrg8AA#1CMIghOEB95KYwUxjrg8AA  I think it was the addition of whip cream, which I normally would have requested to be left out.  (I forgot to ask if the crepe came with whip.)  Last night's dish also had more chocolate syrup on it.  Linda's choice, on the other had, was so delicious!  She had the $9.95 Suzette Flambee ("butter, sugar, honey and rum, vanilla ice cream, whipping cream"), which was set on fire, complete with the lights very briefly turned off.  The dish was still afire when the lights came back on, so it wasn't quite as romantic a notion as it could've been...  The rum-laced ice cream was the star of the show, I thought.  A must-order-again, for sure!  :)Update 8/29/2015:I called the restaurant today because I'm befuddled by it all.  We've never had a bad experience with any of the Valley restaurants in the 2 years that we've been doing this and I owe some explanation to the people who plan around the 3rd Wednesday of every month to join Monica and me for ISCUYE. Apparently, there are some illnesses in the business-family that are consuming their attention.  A small business like this relies on everyone in the business to operate at its best.  No doubt! I get this.  My family owns a small business.  When one person is out, everyone feels the heat.  Our August reservation was forgotten in a vulnerable moment for the restaurant.   I understand.  My review, which is not caustic by the way, will stand.  I have no hard feelings!  This review is an accurate account of the events that transpired.  BUT, at least we know WHY it happened.  We might consider this restaurant again next year.  I really wanted that bouillabaisse!  :-)  In my review below, I said "I'd never go here again", but ... I'd give a try some time next year if Monica agrees to try it out.  8/29/2015_________________________________________________________We scheduled the July and August 2015 International Supper Club UYE at this location.  Why on earth would we have the ISCUYE  in the same place 2 months in a row?   Welp,  definitely not because we liked the food that much.   We never actually had ANY of the food.  I'm so disappointed with the lack of professionalism by this restaurant.   The first try here we made a reservation on the 3rd Wednesday at 630 pm.   Hours prior to dinner time, they called Monica O to cancel because of an emergency.   OK,  fine.   Things happen. . So,  we decided to reschedule for August.   Someone pointed out that the restaurant might be closed on Wednesdays for dinner.   So,  I called and left a message  inquiring about our dinner plans.   I asked if LPF would be open and gave a date,  day and time (Wed Aug 19 at 630pm).   I stated that if they were open,  please reserve a table for a 10 for Aug 19 at 630pm.  A couple days later,  I received a confirmation call/voice-mail confirming the details of the ISCUYE.   We arrive,  on time and the place was closed.   As soon as I can borrow someone's phone to record a video with the audio from the voice-mail confirming our reservation,  I will.   I waited a week to write this review because I called 3 times and left 2 voice-mails asking for a call back from someone to help me understand why they would tell me we had a confirmed reservation when they were closed   Maybe there was a good explanation.   Maybe the manager forgot they were closed on Wed.   I am not sure.  I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt.   But,  alas, it has been 8 days,  no call back.   Sadly,  I'd never go here again!   Extremely unprofessional.  But what irritates me most of all is 2 months in a row we had to scramble our plans at the very last minute because of this place.  Monica and I take a lot of pride in choosing local businesses to patronize every month.   Our fellow Yelpers rely on us to choose good AND reliable AND professional businesses.   This wasn't one.Return Factor: 15%

Restaurant name  Icehouse
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Come early to get a table, Icehouse takes no reservations and is tiny. Recently we mosied in at 6:30 on a Friday with a group of 4, sat down at the last available table and had a pitcher of bourbon lemonade within minutes. We watched 3 other groups come in right behind us and then leave.Icehouse isn't fancy, it's just central, tiny, friendly and no fuss. Plastic trays, no plates, no menus but everything we tried was undeniably tasty. The prices could be better but the bill at the end of the night still seemed cheap to our Toronto friends, and the food is really filling and flavorful. The $20 lobster burrito got rave reviews, I loved the cheese stuffed jalapenos and my deep fried oyster po'boy.2nd Review: I've been to Icehouse on 5 different occasions so obviously, I've been a fan. But not anymore. I was quite disappointed in the way they handle their clients if they happen to be a pair. Here's what happened: On our arrival we were asked if we would like to sit outside but declined because it was windy and cold. Despite there being 2 free seats at the bar we were told to wait - I did mention them to the waitress but she didn't acknowledge me. I just figured they don't use those seats for customers. After 10 mins of waiting in the cold a table was freed up and we were asked if we would like these seats but that we could only have them if we're willing to share with 2 other people. We said sorry, no thanks.  So a pair of ladies came in and was promptly seated at the 4pax table because they were okay sharing tables. Another 15 mins go by and two guys show up and the waitress asks them if they would like to sit at the two seats at the bar that were  free (but we thought it wasn't available because she ignored me when I asked about it), to which they reply: "But these 2 were here before us"and she says"Ce n'est pas grave" (Oh don't worry about it)And in they go to sit to eat. Why didn't see give those seats to us before and why is she letting them in before us?!Needless to say we were getting annoyed as it was the 3rd pair of people who were seated before us. We felt like we were being punished for not wanting to have our dinner right next to two strangers.Shortly after a table for 4 becomes free and after 5-10 mins of waiting (expecting they would give it to us..) I ask the other waiter what's the deal. I tell him we've been waiting 30+ mins in the cold and that there's a free table inside that we could use. He says "We only have two 2pax tables and this is our policy." I tell him it's a ridiculous policy and he shrugs it off and leaves.What a terrible way to treat your customers, especially when there's no one waiting behind us in line. It's not like we were even holding bigger groups back or anything. We just stood there incredulous and decided to leave. Lesser patient people would have made a much bigger fuss much earlier. Instead I felt this review would be enough to let others know that if you're a couple and don't wish to sit right against 2 strangers, you better hope those 2 places inside are free and that the waitress doesn't pick favorites.Overpriced Mediocre Food. Pretentious Service.I only eat here because I live around the corner.None of the items on the menu are particularly memorable or remarkable. In fact, just about everything tastes like what you'd expect from a hipster who developed an interest in Americana cuisine and has watched too many YouTube cooking videos.The drinks, however, redeem a visit. They have a solid selection of local beer, and their bourbon lemonade and ice tea are better enjoyed by the pitcher than by the glass.When it comes to the service, though, it ranges from rude to condescending, and is always slow (which is odd given how small the place is). The staff just generally tends to treat you as though they're doing you a favor for letting you eat there.If you're in the neighborhood and you're looking for a quick drink and snack before you move on to something better, it might be worth visit. If you're looking to enjoy an actual meal, though, I'd urge you to look elsewhere.

Review Text :
Old times charm... A rare find, a tradition and recipes that traveled over seas and oceans.I was greeted with a smile and ushered to the nice large table with Tintin books stacked against the wall...Their specialty - Les Crêpes Bretonnes, or Gallettes - thin, crispy, salty, delicious crêpes with toppings that sooooo masterfully done.I opted for Brunch Breton, with coffee, small smoothie, cup of fruits, far breton with caramel sauce (it was amazing), and galette with ham, cheese and perfectly runny egg yolk on top of it. The combination of crisp buckwheat crêpe, jambon and egg yolk was divine.While my coffee cup was refilled, I asked to try their croissant. I always do this, I just cannot resist this buttery, flaky, airy goodness (true croissants it is). Is was just as I described above. Yummmm.Merci, cheri.Definitely recommend.

Review Text :
I am surprised no one has written this restaurant up yet.  It is located inside the Legacy Golf Club and is very reasonably priced, especially by Golf Club standards.  We have had breakfast here several times now and it is always excellent.  The view is incredible and the food and service are great.  Not much more I can ask from a restaurant.  There is indoor and outdoor dining available as well as a bar.  They are open for lunch and have recently added happy hour M-F from 4:00 - 6:00.  The happy hour looks to be a step above the usual offerings with some of the more memorable items being Bison Meatballs, Pastrami Sliders, and Pretzel Bread.  All priced with the discount at approx 5.00 and under each.

Restaurant name  The Martini
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I noticed no one has written a review for "The Martini" (previously known as Martini's). However, since they are under new ownership I took it upon myself to devirginize them on Yelp.First of all, it's been forever since my last review--I've been so busy (aka lazy LOL), but I honestly think the people who work here and run the place are terrific and I hope a favorable first review will inspire other people to try this place.I often make my rounds at the smaller gaming bars/ restaurants near my house because:1. I hate the traffic on the Strip2. I prefer cozier places where I can actually have a conversation3. The prices on the Strip are outrageous (yes a $20 martini is not just an urban legend)My roommate and I had heard that one of our favorite bartenders Al who had formerly 'tended at the Sedona Restaurant moved here so we decided to give it a whirl. I had only been to the old Martini's once after pulling one of my all-nighters so I really didn't remember it well. Regardless, I was excited to try "The Martini" for the first time.My first impression when entering the place is that it's elegantly laid out and immaculately clean. This goes without saying, but sometimes you go into a gaming restaurant/ bar and it feels dirty and ghetto and it goes downhill from there. This is not the case with The Martini--it's nice.The staff here is GREAT and I've been here several times and have always had great service. The manager Nick is also great and he always thanks everyone for coming in. He seems to go out of his way to make sure everyone is comfortable regardless of age, race, or orientation--which I find highly respectable. I've also met several other industry people who work at restaurants / bars in the surrounding area, which is always a great sign that the place is good.The Martini also has a extensive & diverse food menu that's way better than your typical bar food. In the 6 or 7 occasions I've been here since their reopening, I've tried several dishes and haven't been disappointed yet. I really enjoyed their cheese & salumi plate and they use a filet for their steak & egg breakfast, which i did find exceptionally good.Of course they are known as "The Martini" so they have a wide selection of martinis & martini-esque drinks to choose from. I've tried the traditional and the Pom, which were both good and balanced. They also have a pretty good wine list to choose from, both by the glass and the bottle and several beers on tap.The place is also a full gaming bar with several machines along the bar--I'm not a huge gambler so I can't really comment on the machines but I'm sure you'll find something to tickle your fancy if you're into gaming. Overall I really like The 'new' Martini and it's my new go-to place near my house. If you live in the area or are passing through, give it a try!Martini's was closed for a long time.  Not sure if it was because of the recession or some internal issue.  But it had been reopened for at least a month when I checked it out after a late night out.  Was told it is under new management.I only ate there once before the closing and was not impressed.  I ate there last night and loved it.  Whatever the new owners have done is working (except my Arnold Palmer which was way too sweet.  They must have terrible lemonade).1) Martini Sliders - some of the best sliders I've ever had.  High quality bun, a little blue cheese and caramelized onion, and thousand island dressing on the plate so you can put as much as you desire.  Meat was juicy with a nice seared crust on it.  Had that little bit of crispiness I like on a burger.  They seared it like a steak which is how it should be done.  Really just great.2) Chicken wings - served nice and crispy with either ranch or blue cheese dressing.  I got it mild so it was a bit bland.  Next time I'll get it hot.  But it was really well cooked.  Chicken was moist inside and the outside was nice and crispy.  They have the standard happy house menu late at night.  Great prices, great quality, great location, great atmosphere, and great service.Well done Martini.Next up for Restaurant Week was The Martini.  My junior-sized Shrimp Cocktail still appeared to be defrosting but was still tasty with a very good Horseradish-based Sauce.  Tomato Bisque Soup with Creme Fraiche and basil was zesty.  A Side Caesar Salad with Mozzarella shavings on top was also very good.  Grilled Rosemary Lemon Salmon with Risotto that tasted like vanilla, and al dente grilled Zucchini, featured a great moist hunk of salmon.  A gooey Fried Oreo Sundae proved to be an excellent, novel dessert.The atmosphere was comfortable in a large dining room walled off from the bar, with soft jazz piped in overhead.  Service was very good except I had to ask twice for Sweet & Low for my Iced Tea.  I expect to continue to frequent this fine establishment--not for libations for for beautifully prepared comfort food.I was here in January for our Yelp Book Club meeting and we decided to have our last meeting of this year at the Martini again.  I came an hour early and had dinner.  The dining room is small in width but runs the length of the building.  There's a nice wooden wall with some fireplaces that block the dinging room from the bar section and makes a great spot for our book club meetings.I started with the Caesar salad.  Good dressing with nice croutons.  There was a lot of salad.  It wasn't a starter salad but rather like a dinner salad without meat.For my main course, I ordered the chicken scaloppine.  While the menu says it's a chicken breast with artichoke, mushrooms, and prosciutto there was no artichoke.  The breast was very lightly breaded and fried and served with seasonal vegetables and risotto.  The dish was very good.  The artichoke would have added some to it, but it stood the way it was very well.For dessert, how could I resist the deep fried Oreos with ice cream?  Four battered and deep fried Oreos and a martini glass of ice cream.  It was very good, but the Oreos lose something in the deep frying.  The creamy inside got lost with the fried crust of the batter.  If someone should offer me this again, I wouldn't turn them down.My server was named Princess.  She was very good.  Great personality and good service.  She kept my iced tea filled all during my meal.  As I was tackling dessert, one of our club members arrived and we were soon discussion our book about living in a Mumbai slum.  I felt somewhat guilty.The Martini is a quality niche bar for me.  The drinks will not wow you, and none of the menu items put a craving in the bowels of your soul that needs satisfying...but there are several reasons why you should make your way in here from time to time.Upon walking in to the Martini you immediately realize that this is not your average Vegas neighborhood bar...it looks and feels too nice for that.  It is certainly aesthetically pleasing with a classy, warm feel.  They a lot of nice TVs here that make it a great spot to watch the game.  They also have an early Happy Hour with food and drink specials.  One of my favorite things is that the kitchen is open late, so you can head in to The Martini after 10pm when most other places have closed their kitchens and still order up some decent  food.  In general I would shell out 3 Stars for the bar & restaurant...but when you include these niche specialties it's and easy round-up for me.I am a fan and will come back to enjoy their fantastic happy hour from 3-6 again!They make an Amazing pink cosmopolitan martini, I was really enjoying them throughout the evening.This place is dark and cozy with a touch of class! The service is great with friendly staff who really complete your experience.This is a great spot to meet up for a drink and just unwind from a long day of work or sex. I only wish I had been a visitor sooner as this is a nice spot that I have passed a kazillion times however never stopped in.I will be back for happy hour for sure, with $5 Amazing strong cocktails how can you go wrong! Don't forget to try the pink cosmopolitan, you won't regret it I promise!We have been there a number of times.  I was attempting to try, at least once, every martini on the menu.  I must warn you that the martini menu has many drinks on it but only a few really are made well there.  I have gotten some really vile (as in too bitter to swallow) drinks.  So, stick with the really well known drinks, or you might be sorry.The music they have is determined by the customer who chose songs on the jukebox in the corner.  You pay for and select songs to be queued up on the jukebox (this can be done from you smart phone).  However, if someone has more "pull" with the bartender than you do, does not like your music selection you will not be able to enjoy your selection since the volume will be reduced or shut off completely.  As the bartender explained to us regarding our selections: "There is this women with a lot of money who does not like country music".We prefer to take our business where all the drinks are "safe" to be ordered and where if the music is truly customer selected the customer hears that selection and is not subject to the "censoring" of those who are considered too rich to disappoint.I LOVE this bar. But don't tell everyone, keep it to your awesome Yelp selves, because what I love about this bar is there is always a great seat to watch the game. Add to that consistent, exemplary service, and delicious food and drink, and we have a winner.Great Happy Hour food & drink specials, and interesting local beers on tap. Really relaxing lighting (very important). So important actually. Some of the 'new' startup breweries/bars could learn a thing or two from this spot.And smoke-free. Rare and awesome. (They didn't sell-out to the average chain-smoking mid-30s single mom with 2 kids that loses $1K+ a week to video poker machines.) A harsh generalization, but very real.Perfect volume for a bar. Not too loud, and quiet enough to be able to have a normal, private conversation. These folks know what they're doing!

What happened?!?!??!?! I ordered a pizza last night at around 1:30 am and I was pleasantly surprised. They were really fast, friendly, and communicated well. We ordered a 12" pizza with half cheese, and half tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic, pepperoni, and sausage. We asked for 3 ranch and a 6 pack of sierra mist, and all of it was brought to us within 30 minutes for a reasonable price.The pizza was amazing! The crust was crunchy and chewy, and the sauce was sweet and spicy. We were so impressed that my fiancee and I were talking about it all day and telling people about the place.The meat on the pizza was fantastic, especially the sausage, and it was overall so great that we ordered another one tonight.Tonight was a polar opposite of last night. We called a little bit earlier and the phone call seemed to go well. The person on the phone recognized our order and was really friendly. We got the same exact pizza and an order of mozzarella sticks. The food arrived in around 30 minutes, and everything seemed great, but once we got the pizza, I immediately noticed that there was no meat on it.  I had requested a lot of ranch since I ended up spilling all of mine the night before, and they didn't bring me the requested number, even though I had offered to pay for a lot.There was no marinara sauce for the mozzarella sticks, even though on the phone, they suggested the mozzarella sticks and that they were good paired with the marinara sauce. I was irked enough to call them around 1:30 am to express my displeasure with my pizza since we had planned to order from them tomorrow night as well. The person I spoke to on the phone was not helpful at all. When I said the pizza was wrong, he said "You wanted tomatoes and mushrooms right?"I told him I ordered a pizza with 5 toppings and read the list to him. I explained that all I saw were mushrooms and tomatoes. He had the gall to say to me, "Well, there's garlic on there too, you can't see it because it's cut up real small."Um, that doesn't explain the lack of sausage and pepperoni on there. He goes on to tell me that there's nothing he can do for me because they were about to close, and that I should call tomorrow. That's total BS in my book because he's dumping off his problem on someone else who won't know what's going on tomorrow, and I had ordered a pizza at 1:30 in the morning yesterday and had it delivered to me a little after 2 am. The pizza wasn't as good today, not only because of the lack of meat on the pizza, but also because of inconsistency in the crust. It's kind of soggy and doughy and as you pick it up, the whole slice starts to sag and the meager toppings start sliding off with the cheese. I'm giving this 3 stars for now because I'm going to call them tomorrow and see how they handle themselves. To be continued....

Cheap, delicious and open 24/7. This place is legit!*They have a salsa bar with unlimited red sauce, green sauce, cucumbers, the carrot mix and limes. *They speak English *It's clean and beautifully decorated inside *If you are a rolled taco person they roll them and cook them fresh to order chicken or beef. So far my favorite is the Carne Asada burrito, but since I don't want to look like a double wide trailer I've only had it's goodness once. My lifestyle is low carb so I get the grilled steak platter with no rice or tortillas. It comes with beans and a side salad with fresh avocado and a tomato slice for $3.99. I'm completely satisfied. Everything I have tried has been pretty damn good. I just wish they offered the free warm chips like the place before.

Restaurant name  Jaleo

Review Text :
Let me preface this by saying that Jaleo still has some kinks to work out, but it has 4 star potential.  If you're vegan, and don't feel like trekking to the Wynn, Jaleo has a ton of tasty vegan(izable) options for you.  I used to live in DC and go to the original Jaleo in my pregan days, so I was very excited to see Jose Andres open a restaurant here!I went there solo and ate at the tapas bar, which is fun, because you get to watch them make all kinds of little dishes and you can ask the sous chefs about what they're making etc.  Plus the people next to me were very friendly and we had a nice chat.  The atmosphere seems very laid back and conducive to such interactions.  (Note: it's not like a sushi bar; they don't serve you directly.  A server will come up behind you and take your order.)You would be well-advised to make a reservation if you want to eat there on a weekend night - it was completely packed with a line when I went.  I got the only seat left in the place!Note: the food here is VERY salty because they use a lot of finishing salts.  If you aren't into that, just request your food with "no added salt."  I had the pan con tomate (tomato bread), espinacas (wilted spinach with apples and shallots), papas arrugas (salted roast potatoes with red and green chile sauces - not spicy though), and the chef brought out a sample of the veggie paella!  I also had apple sorbet for dessert.  (For Bay Area people - they use the same Pacojet technology as Scream Sorbet to make an amazingly creamy vegan sorbet).Everything was very tasty, if a bit oily and salty.  Very rich!  (I will order w/ no added salt next time.)  The folks next to me shared their sangria, which was very tasty (although not made the traditional way... they add the fruit to your glass rather than macerating in the wine.)The service was very attentive at times, but hit or miss.  I had a great time and enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back with a group so I can try lots more things!For you non-vegan foodies, you might wanna check out e, the chef's tasting room at Jaleo.  They do a 20-course dinner (two seatings a night) for ~$150.  They can make exceptions for some dietary restrictions/allergies, but sadly don't do a vegan version (yet?). Here is a list of the vegetarian/vegan/veganizable dishes:Pan con tomate -tomato breadGazpacho - cold tomato soupManzanas con hinojo y manchego (minus cheese) - apple-fennel saladEspinacas a la Catalana - wilted spinach with sherry dressing and applesEscalivada - cold roasted eggplant and pepperSetas a ajillo - garlic mushroomsTrigueros con romesco - asparagus w/ Romesco sauceEnsalada de coles de bruselas con albaricoques, manzanas y jamon (minus the jamon - ham) - brussels sprout saladRemolacha con citricos (minus the cheese) - citrus/beet saladPapas Arrugas with mojo verde y rojo - roasted potatoesVerdura Paella - Veggie paella (they do not use chicken stock, only water)My last visit to Vegas we stopped by Jaleo for a late dinner.  We were sat immediately and given an iPad to order our drinks....very cool.We ordered a bottle of Wine and several plates of Tapas:Pan con tomate - Toasted slices of Bread with Tomato $5Chorizo Palacios - Spicy Pork Sausage $8Arroz de pato 'Jean-Louis Palladin' - Rice with Duck Confit, Duck Breast and Foie Gras Cream $11Patatas bravas - Potatoes w/spicy Tomato Sauce & Alioli $7The Tapas were very good and full of flavor.Overall, it was a great dining experience.Return Factor - 90%Oh Jaleo, you bring out the worst in me.I'm one of those eaters that: (1) has zero patience to read a menu, especially when most of it is in a foreign language; (2) if I can't decide what I want, I pester the server and neighboring diners for recommendations; and (3) knows exactly what I want and how I want it.  Jaleo, for better or worse, hits all four proverbial nails.Jaleo's menu isn't the biggest, but there are a large number of dishes offered.  And most of it is in Spanish.  Unless you read the English description.  Well, as I said before, I have no patience to read every description to settle on a handful of openers.  Which sucks because we ended up with the cod empanadas, which, oh, btw, doesn't really have any cod in it.  It's basically a fish cream that's been deep fried in thin and crisp empanada shell with some honey drizzled on it.  You might like it and love it, but my friends and I could not stomach this to save our lives.  We Fear Factored the shmuck who ordered it as punishment.  Yes, he smelled like fish after that.  The menu doesn't suck if you read Spanish.  Or you have the patience to actually read everything.  Deal killer?  Nope, because......I pester people to give strong recommendations.  Sucks for everyone else except me!  Using this method, we stumbled across a ginfully good Gin & Tonic.  They ship their ice sphere (don't call it a ball) from their sister ship in LA.  Seriously.  The care and attention that goes into this one drink suggests that they care about all of their products (apparently even that cod cream).  Speaking of attention, the food in the shoe definitely grabbed ours, as we promptly ordered the delectable pollo croquetas (sp?) that occupy the footwear.  Those little morsels of what tasted like really good creamed chicken in a crunchy fried shell are really yum.  Another great recommendation was that we try their off-menu paella (I don't know what it's called because we said we'd take it before the server even described it).  To our surprise it was loaded with a whole lobster tail, a giant lobster claw (a bitch to break open), a few prawns and a few muscles.  Killer good that dish, but......not as good as the Iberico Short Rib Paella recommended on my first visit.  It was so rich and tasty that we wanted another plate.  I daydream about it.  I drool uncontrollably.  My second visit to Jaleo was specifically to have this dish again.  Upon sitting, before ordering drinks or even water, we asked for, nay DEMANDED this paella.  To which our humble server replied they were not going to be making it.  At all.  For the rest of the night.  Once the tears stopped, I pulled myself together with a wonderful Gin & Tonic, had some pretty good dishes (like the potato wrapped chorizo and roast quail) then went over to Blue Ribbon for oxtail fried rice to dull the pain...but that's for another review.  Yeah, Jaleo, you've got a lot going for you.  Your food's mostly good.  But I think I need Rosetta Stone and some valium to get through the menu.  And you need to get some more damn Iberico short ribs for the best paella in the world!Snobbish foodies who contemplate with furrowed brow, the intricate flavors brought forth by the deft hand of the chef, EAT ELSEWHERE!!!  Jaleo is about great traditional and modernist tapas, and a fun experience.The long menu of unfamiliar sounding dishes can be intimidating.  Just remember, more = better.  The menu is cohesive.  Each dish compliments or contrasts with others building layers of flavors or creating flavor explosions.  You can throw darts blindly at it and every selection would work together.  Don't get caught up in the details.  Dining on tapas should be social and fun!After multiple visits, and tasting almost the entire menu, lets just say, my taste may not be the same as yours so rather than making specific dish recommendations, here are some general guidelines:- Follow Andre Zimmern's maxim:  if it sounds good, eat it.  Try, try, try.  - Do not pass on the jamones produced by Fermin (Spanish hams).  This is one of the few places that you can eat the real deal in the States.  The acorn fed, black footed pig has a very unfamiliar taste and might not be for everyone but try, try, try.- Spanish wines and sherries pair perfectly with the tapas (mixed drinks, beer, and new world wines don't).  Unfamiliar with wines Spanish wines?  Ask for a recommendation.  The restaurant has a great selection by the glass.  Try, try, try.- Keep it social.  Eat, drink (pass around a poron - just stick to the cava if you never tried it before so you don't stain your clothes), and enjoy!Note:  Jaleo houses the incredible E, restaurant in a restaurant.  It's Jaleo on steroids.  See the reviewsDining is an experience.  At Jaleo, your experience depends on you.  Live, love and enjoy!Three visits to Jaleo at the Cosmopolitan and each time I've left more impressed than the last time. This past visit was with a party of six. Their menu is always intimidating because of the number of dishes available, so instead of debating which to order we opted for a tasting menu. Similar to an omakase, we left the decision making in the hands of our waiter and the kitchen, although we mentioned a couple specific items that we wanted. Our waiter said it would be about $50 per person for the food.What followed was a gluttonous feast of about 13 dishes plus two desserts that were almost all amazing. Our meal consisted of:Pan con tomate (2 orders) - toasted slices of crispy bread brushed with fresh tomatoThree queso (2) - cheese platterJamon serrano (3) - 18-month salt-cured hamEspinacas (2) - sauteed spinach, pine nuts, raisins and applesBruselas de jamon (2) - warm brussels sprouts salad with apricots, apple and serrano hamGambas al ajillo (2) - shrimp sauteed with garlicPulpo a feira (2) - boiled octopus with potatoes, pimenton and olive oilMejillones al vapor (1) - steamed mussels with bay leaf, lemon and olive oilCalamares tinta (2) - seared fresh squid with squid ink sauce, artichokes and pearl onionsCarne asada (2) - grilled skirt steak with piquillo pepper confitCodorniz Catalan (2) - grilled whole quail with apple puree and pinenutsEnsalada Malaguena (1) - traditional salad from malaga of Spanish cod, oranges, potato and black olivesPaella Iberico (1) - made with the ribs of Iberico pigsFlan (1) - classic Spanish flan with espuma of Catalan cream and orangesPan con chocolat (1) - chocolate cake with hazelnut praline ice cream and salted caramel sauceThe spinach dish sounds simple but the flavors that they were able to coax out of those common ingredients was unforgettable. Even if you're not a fan of those leafy greens chances are you'll love it. Other favorites were the mussels (much better than the previous time I had them), quail, and the squid, a dish as beautiful as it was delicious.I could probably list all as my favorites because each was well executed. Some caught our attention with bold and complex flavors while others were more subtle, yet just as refined. It was an excellent mix that showcased the ingredients and the chefs' skills. The relaxed pace of the meal (about two and a half hours) gave us plenty of time to appreciate each dish and try plenty of cocktails and sangria.After it was all said and done, we walked out spending about $120 a person (including alcohol, tax and tip). For an outstanding meal on the Strip that's more than reasonable.Dear Jose Andres,Please stop making such delicious food. My bank account hurts.Jaleo has one of the largest menus I've ever seen. Factor in my inability to settle on just a few items, I will get just about everything that peaks my interest... Which unfortunately for me is everything on this massive menu T__T The food here is fabulous. It's not just delicious but creative, innovative and exciting!Jaleo has a 5-star selection of cured meats. I personally like to start my meal with these items. I consider the embutidos to be the money-waster section of the menu. Portion sizes are small. Zero bang for your buck but oh so totally worth it. If you're feeling frisky, opt for the kobe of pork products. You only get like 5-6 slices but the cured ham from the magical unicorn pig from the isles of... gotcha! In all seriousness, get the black-footed Iberico just once. It's supposedly fed only acorns and results in meat that makes your mouth water just looking at it.Vegetable-wise, Jaleo makes an amazing warm brussel sprouts salad with apricots, apple and serrano ham. They only use the outer leaves and they're cooked to perfection so they still have a bit of bite. Its a good enough portion for 2 but you'll want the whole bowl to yourself. Also noteworthy is their sauteed spinach. And where else can you get Liquid Olives? These little suckers are a result of some sweet molecular gastronomy. Little blobs of deliciousness that emulsify on the  palate. Sounds weird but I swear they're amazing. They're served with 'real' olives too. I'm a beet addict and always looking for new ways to prepare them. Their Beet Salad prep is 1. different from every place else (no generic roasted beets with goat cheese) and #2 has pistachios in it--the junk food of nuts.Some of my favorite fried items include the Bacon-Wrapped Dates (nothing special but still delicious), the fried eggplant, and the Cod Empanadas (they're served with honey which makes these totally addicting!)Seafood: Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp & garlic) and the Squid w/ Squid Ink. If you're craving mussels, order them elsewhere. The ones here are pretty uninspired.This review is getting a little lengthy so I'll just finish the food stuff by saying the carne asada needs to be ordered. :)How much you spend is entirely dependent on how much food it takes to satiate your appetite and how much meat you order in comparison to the potatoes.  I mean that literally and figuratively. We generally spend $50-80 per person when we come here. Most dishes run $10-20 but of course there are the outliers (like the ham and paella). And drinks are pretty pricy here too. When you have that WTF moment when you see Jose's $17 gin & tonic... trust me and Jose when we say it is THE BEST gin & tonic you will ever have in your life. Juniper Berries are the business. Plus, be endlessly entertained by the ice sphere (which I like to obsess over every time).We came back here for some Spanish tapas, food was still very delicious, it just they don't have any fish, people don't eat fish in Spain? A lot of meat choices, very few Vegetarian / Vegan and Pescetarian plates, so I couldn't order as much as I wanted, the choices were limited. But the plates I ordered were very very good! We decided to do small plates only, didn't want any Paellas. Started off with that famous Jaleo gin & tonic again, so sweet and refreshing, loved that ice cube! Hubby had a margarita drink, strong and yummy, two salmon roe cones for us, I just love that cone! Salty with a lot of flavors in one cone, amazing! Sautéed cauliflower, with chopped olives and dates: salty and sweet in one plate, unique taste, very delicious, loved it! Seared scallops, with romesco sauce: very tender with strong flavors, we liked it a lot.Shrimp sautéed with garlic: sooooo good! The garlic in it was amazing, shrimps were tender and delicious.Garlic soup: it came so late, don't know why? But right at the moment when hubby needed some warm soup, he liked it. Skirt steak from the famous black-footed ibérico pigs of spain served with toasted tomato bread, mojo verde and alioli: the portion was huge, good for 2 or 3 people to share, too bad I couldn't eat it, hubby loved it! Juicy, tender, great with the sauces came with it! The bread with tomato spread was so delicious! I had a Grey Goose martini twist after gin & tonic, the food was so good, the portions were not even small, especially that skirt steak, hubby couldn't finish it, we had it boxed, didn't want to waste a $60 plate. The tab was $200 ish. I like this fun looking restaurant a lot, colorful and playful, great service, great drinks, casual and relaxing!Ending up at Jaleo was a mishap, but dining here ended up being a pleasure.We thought we had made reservations for é by José Andrés, which is nested inside Jaleo. The Cosmopolitan's front desk had transferred our call to Jaleo, which oversees reservations for both dining experiences. Miscommunication ensued. The hostess was all smiles and apologies when we arrived. We were disappointed, but not shattered, seeing that Jaleo is still born from Chef José Andrés's creative mind, just less...avant garde. Compared to The Bazaar which I had visited in Miami, Jaleo's dishes had less pizzazz and showmanship, but still utilized fine ingredients, impeccably prepared. The menu offered a number of dishes procured from black-footed, acorn-fed pigs, like the Lomo Ibérico De Bellota Fermín, thinly-sliced cured pork loin. It was tender, rich, and flavorful. The Arroz de pato 'Jean Luis Palladin' was an impressive take on duck on rice, smokey grilled duck breast atop creamy, short-grained rice mixed with more duck. It almost didn't need, but was accentuated by, the foie gras cream.After some salmon roe cones, a cheese and fruit plate, and some pork mini burgers, we cleansed our palate with the Salmorejo, a chilled tomato soup garnished with a quartet of bacon bits, boiled egg, chives, and crackers. It looked like an impressionistic painting of a sunrise and tasted equally refreshing. The only two drawbacks from this dinner was that the Mini Pepito De Ibérico (mini burgers) were too greasy, and that the service slowed considerably as the tables filled up. Getting our waiter's attention by the end of the night was challenging, but enjoying a surprisingly satisfying meal we did not plan for was no challenge at all.The chef bangs the bell and then everyone yells PAELLA!!!!!!And with that, I knew the "Arroz Con Costillas De Cerdo Ibérico De Bellota" (made with the ribs of the famous, black-footed Ibérico de bellota pigs of Spain) was ready and would be coming my way any minute.  The paella was rich, flavorful and I gnawed on every rib until nothing was left.  I semi contemplated another order but then the manicotti/lasagnaesque/alfredoey pork and foie gras canelones with bechamel sauce shut me the heck up :)  My wife wasn't a fan of because it was too cheesy and creamy but I am down for anything foie gras related.  The seared fresh squid with squid ink sauce, artichokes and pearl onions was delectable.  Nice presentation!  It's rare for a place to serve the whole squid with innards and all.  I initially thought it was stuffed and couldn't put my finger on what was in it until our friendly server informed us.  I'd totally have squid ink as a hot beverage by the way.   Bottom line is I need to come back here with a bigger group to sample more stuff like a heckuvalot more black foot pig.  If they ever make Pulp Fiction 2, Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace might have a discussion over the $20 gin and tonics.  Oh wait, he was killed.  Nevermind.  I am ready to go to "e" asap!¡Saludos a volver por la buena comida! With so many wonderful internationally recognized chef owned restaurants located on the Strip, we returned to Jose Andrés' Jaleo for a Spanish lunch. We had just arrived into Las Vegas only a few hours prior to our noontime reservation and we were excited for a taste of paella and other tapas.  Our server, Jason, greeted us with friendly familiarity and described the lunch menu as an abbreviated or highlighted dinner menu that we were familiar with from previous dines. We started with cocktails and ordered their 3-course lunch special. Jason piqued my interest with a cocktail called "Con Membrillo" that was a Seasonal concoction of quince paste, rum, egg white and nutmeg. There were probably more ingredients in that cocktail that I don't just remember listing.  But, after a couple of smooth sips, I was transported to Madrid's Plaza Mayor in Fall. My husband ordered a Spanish beer, Estrella Damm Inedit Witbier to begin his "journey".  Meanwhile, our order of Jamón Ibérico Fermín with picos arrived.  It was a small plate of porky deliciousness that melted like butter as soon as it hit your tongue. The paper-thin slices were paired with crisp "picos" or mini breadsticks.  We both ordered the Complete Spanish Lunch that was a 3-course meal. It started with Ensalada Verde (Bibb lettuce, red onions and sherry dressing), Gazpacho estilo Algeciras (classic chilled Spanish soup made with tomato, cucumber, peppers and bread) and Paella del Dia (today's special featured chicken and mushrooms). It was a value for its price at $26 per person. Jason brought out each course in a timely succession...we weren't in a rush and had the time to savor the flavors. The food was well-seasoned and we were seated to watch the chef prepare the paella over the open-fire wood burning grill. We liked Jason's attentiveness, efficiency and positive attitude.Jaleo is great if you know what to order- I predict a second experience here would go far better than my first. We ordered several suggested dishes only to be underwhelmed and unimpressed at the beginning of our meal, but as we branched out and tried some of the more exotic choices, the quality and experience improved sharply. Learn from our mistakes!PLAY IT SAFEPAN DE CRISTAL CON TOMATE FRESCO: toasted bread with fresh tomato. Tasty but very basic, kick it up to something that's actually worth getting by adding Manchego cheese or anchovies.JAMON IBERICO FERMIN: if you're going to come here, you may as well try the famous ham. It's not all that much different from prosciutto, in my opinion. We were underwhelmed.COLIFLOR CON OLIVAS Y FRUTOS SECOS: the contrasting flavors of the dates and olives was enjoyable, but the roasted cauliflower that forms the base of the dish was treated as an afterthought. CROQUETAS DE POLLO: described as chicken fritters and served inside of a shoe, this will add some excitement to an otherwise tame table of dishes. One in our party described this dish as "like a mini hot pocket of chicken pot pie". It was tasty, but not the standout menu item other reviews (or even our server) made it out to be.ARROZ CON COSTILLAS DE CERDO IBERICO DE BELLOTA Y ALCACHOFA: The pig-rib paella is tasty but not particularly adventurous. This is the only paella I've ever had where the rice was extremely crispy- I am not sure if it was overcooked, if we just got the bottom of the batch, or if it was intentional, but I did not particularly like it. GO FOR THE GOLDJOSE ANDRES GIN & TONIC: $20 for a G&T is ridiculous, but luckily it is also ridiculously good.ACEITUNAS RELLENAS Y ACEITUNAS "FERRAN ADRIA": Olives two ways! One is stuffed with pimiento and anchovies, the other is a liquid olive using molecular gastronomy cooking techniques. It's essentially a flavored bubble and fairly fun to experience.BUNELOS DE BACALAO: Deep-fried salt codfish with honey aioli. The sauce is unlike anything else I've had, and the crispy fried fish is well-executed without being greasy.CAZON FRITO: AKA SHARK NUGGETS! I love this dish. Fried thresher shark with a garlic aioli. I've never had shark but now I'm definitely interested in trying other versions. This was battered without being crispy, fried without being greasy, and simple without disappointing. Would get again!PULPO ASADA CON CREMA CEBOLLA: Perfectly-charred grilled octopus, served with green cherry tomatoes, onion puree, and garlic oil. This was fantastic, the entire table considered it a top dish. Must order!COSTILLAS DE CORDERO MORUNO: Succulent grilled rack of lamb with parsley oil. Simple but amazing. One of my favorite versions of lamb in Vegas.PASTEL DE CAFE: "Chocolate, coffee, and hazelnut tart with coffee rum ice cream." The menu description doesn't do it justice at all. The base is like a crunchy cookie, topped with pure coffee-chocolate deliciousness, then a smooth ice cream with a delicious sauce on the plate. An indulgent, coffee-lovers dessert.We ordered the dishes above in nearly this exact order. Total with tax and tip was just over $250, for a filling dinner for a group of three. As later dishes kept impressing us, I began to get a better feel for the restaurant's strengths, and would come back to try new items.I really hate to give lower than 3 stars but in my opinion Jaleo flavors weren't all that amazing for very high prices, small portions and pretty bleh service. My bestie wanted tapas for her birthday and we decided on Jaleo since none of us had tried them yet. It was pretty easy to get a reservation for Thursday at 9:30. I was thinking it'd be a bit busier because it was leading up to fight weekend but nope! They had a normal steady flow of people. Ambiance is cute, a nice place to catch up with friends or family. The atmosphere didn't feel stuffy at all. However, I will say that the spacing between courses felt a little bit too long and when the food came out, all of them could have been a bit warmer. They all were lukewarm. As for service, our server was nice, however, he did not offer explaining the menu, did not ask if it was our first time or even talk about the portion sizes. The only thing he did mention was specializing in Gin & Tonic variations on an iPad lol which were $20 each! The menu is very extensive and a bit confusing since all the dishes' names aren't in English! I wish he'd mention what his favorites were. I also saw $55 & $85 chef tasting options available, which I'd like to come back to try.Cítrico Gin & Tonic $20: Oxley gin, Fever-Tree Mediterranean tonic water, grapefruit, lemon, coriander, mint. The birthday girl got this one but we all got to taste it and geeze, I've had better G&Ts from PT'S! Everyone agreed that no one could taste anything except for the tonic water. We really could not taste ANY of the supposed grapefruit, lemon, etc. And for $20? The flavor should be better than $17 specialty cocktails at the Chandelier Bar. 0/5Dátiles con tocino 'como hace todo el mundo' $14: Fried bacon-wrapped dates served with an apple-mustard sauce. These were okay, very underwhelming. I'd rather go to Firefly and have their bacon wrapped dates any day. The bacon tasted a little charred and the dates weren't sweet. The mustard sauce was okay, nothing special. 2/5Mini pepito de ibérico* $8 EACH!: Spanish mini burger made from the legendary, acorn-fed, black-footed ibérico pigs of Spain with ibérico bacon. These were really good! Super flavorful, soft buns and very tender! However, at $8 EACH?! What?! They're not THAT amazing, expecially for how small they were. 4/5Rossejat' negra con Cigala $27: Toasted pasta, squid ink, sepia sofrito, Norwegian lobster and alioli. This one was my "favorite" but again there were some big issues that shouldn't be in a $27 dish. Half of the squid ink pasta was burnt onto the pan that it came in, I know this definitely only had enough to split by 2 people but between the 4 of us, we got basically a tablespoon of squid ink pasta each. Also the body of the super skinny Norwegian Lobster was cut in half but left the claws with no cut so we couldn't even get in them! Flavor was alright but I'll go to RX Boiler Room for his squid ink entree instead for larger portion and more developed flavors. 3/5Arroz con costillas de cerdo ibérico de bellota $36: Basically the Paella with the pig ribs. I was super excited for this one but was very disappointed. Rib meat was not tender, more on the dry and chewy side and as for flavor, meh. 2/5Salmón crudo con huevas de salmón $5/cone: Salmon tartare w/ salmon roe on top. These were super good! 4/5Overall, I still feel bad giving a not so great review after seeing so many people love this place but the whole experience for us was pretty underwhelming and forgettable for basically all areas: specialty drink, food, and service. Maybe we just came at an off night so I want to give this place another chance just for the tasting menus but it probably won't be anytime soon.I loved Jaleo DC and I jumped on the opportunity to dine at Jaleo when I realized they're in The Cosmopolitan next door to The Aria where I am staying. However, it was a little different!Menu looked identical but it wasn't the same. Some of the stuff I had in DC weren't here and the portion was super small. I remember dining in DC and was completely stuffed and our tab weren't that bad. It seemed the prices were way higher here.The dishes were good but just really puny for the price. Our server was good but she kept recommending things that were astronomical in price and she got the manipulation down in getting you to believe you had no other choice or that was the right choice.One of the most disappointing item she recommended was the hand carved jamon iberico. It came as dried puny sliced up ham at $35. It was so not worth it. I had the jamon on the bread before with crushed tomatoes in DC, it was so much cheaper and better. It felt like a snow job in this dessert heat. What a rip. Also, we wanted the seafood paella and our server kept saying that wasn't available until an hour later and the one available was the most expensive one $38 which we sadly ordered because we were starving!!! However, the croquettas, the spring vegetables with duck egg, chorizo wrapped in potato, boneless wings, and the sliders were delicious. Still, I can't give it lower than four stars as I'm truly a fan. I was just disappointed that I brought some people to dine here and we left kinda hungry and the tab was over $500 for sharable food people had no more than a bite of each. It was kinda embarrassing for me and I was hoping they weren't mad at me for having to blow 3 days worth of per diem dinner money here and were still hungry.DC won.

Restaurant name  Popo's Fiesta Del Sol Mexican Food

Review Text :
Firstly, the people posting 4 and 5 stars are the only intelligent ones. Let me explain. The others are saying that the food is the same greasy Mexican food you can find anywhere. Evidently these people don't have a very developed palate. I don't think they can distinguish between fresh and frozen goods, proper spices and just extra cheese, or anything else. This was the best Ameri-Mexican food I've had in a LONG time.As for the service, we sat at a table in the bar because they were so busy and we were served CONSTANTLY by not one, but TWO servers.....This place rocks, the haters just came here with a predisposition to not like it....I was excited when my row mate on the plane told me that Popo's had opened a second location taking over an old Garcia's. I was totally bummed that this Popo's was kind of poopy compared to the original one in Maryvale. I ordered a cheese crisp and it was so sad I almost cried. The chicken taco was decent and the rice and beans were the requisite decent as were the chips and salsa. What totally sucked was the fact that their "guacamole" is something green (not real avocado mixed with sour cream). False advertising and I can just imagine what any lactose intolerant person would have to deal with if consuming this (thankfully, not one of my issues). I managed to order a couple of sides of avocado slices, some lemons and used their decent salsa to make my own guacamole. I grew up on Arizona Mexican food. This was not right on so many levels-except for our server who was adorable and accommodating.

So yesterday was my 2nd time attempting to go there and eat. But yesterday the restaurant was gone. The place was inside of another place. Ask the Bartender and he said they moved and dunno where they went. How lovely they moved without posting it on their web site and they don't like to answer the phone when people call to get more information. Waiting on yelp to refund my deal that I purchased from them.Grrr =T

Review Text :
As crazy as it sounds (pun intended), I am definitely a fan of Krazy Buffet. Tell me where else can you find another buffet that serves crab legs for 12.99? Besides their other location I dont remember anybody else doing the same thing. While most other places that charge you more for COLD crab legs, the ones they serve here are STEAMED. What's the difference you say? Well, besides the fact that you know it hasnt been sitting out from the night before, (hence refrigerating it is necessary so they can serve it again the next day and thats why a lot of places prefer to serve it cold), steaming it kills a lot of bacteria and/or any other germs that it may have with it. Most importantly, the crab meat tends to be more flavorful and moist.Not into crab? Well they have lots of other choices like crawfish, grilled fish, clams, mussels, oysters and even sushi. Soup choices from hot n sour to egg drop. Honey shrimp, spicy chicken, chicken wings, etc. and lots more that I am not putting here simply because of the fact that you are not going to eat every individual item. What you will end up doing just like me is sampling here and there which will eventually lead you back to those items that make your taste buds happy.A major plus for me is their Mongolian option. You put together on a plate your choice of meats which is shrimp, beef, pork, and chicken along with veggies like onions, green bell peppers, jalepenos, and mushrooms. You can top it off with minced garlic and/or chili sauce to give it that spicy kick. Then you hand it over to the cook who grills everything together until all is thoroughly cooked. He puts it on a plate for you and off you go to enjoy. What you want and how you want it to taste is obviously up to you.Service is pretty good. They do a good job of refilling your drinks and picking up your used dishes.Just remember the 12.99 price I am describing is for Dinner only. Here's the breakdown:Monday through Saturdays are as follows.Lunch: Adults are $8.29 and kids 4 to 10 years old are $4.29Dinner: Adults $12.99 and kids 4 to 10 years old are $6.99Sundays are all day dinner price.Senior Citizens and Military get 10 percent offSo in closing, the food here is pretty decent for the price you pay. They have another location off of Sahara but my preference is this one because its bigger and I think the service is a lot better. So whenever you are thinking of crab legs (especially steamed), then this is the place to go for the price is decent for what you get.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #108 "Feeling Crabby?"

Restaurant name  Black Chile Mexican Grill

Review Text :
Sorry, Black Chile... I just wasn't a fan!Jared and I felt like trying something new one night last week, and after reading about how great Black Chile's burger was from our friends at EaterAZ, we thought we'd give this place a shot.The restaurant itself is spacious, the hostess and service attentive and friendly, and the decor is tasteful.  But unfortunately the food was nothing special, and I won't be rushing back...We started with chips and salsa.  I think they bring these to everyone.  These weren't bad.  For our meals, Jared went with the burger and I went for the fish tacos (per our waitress's recommendation) and a side of corn.  I liked the sticky rice and beans it came with but the rest of the meal was underwhelming.  Jared didn't love his either.Since my visit, I learned that this concept comes from restaurateurs Michael McDermott and Jason Merritt, who have been involved with the development of numerous restaurants including the famed Kona Grill. I thought it felt a little chainy!  That explains it ;)I'm pregnant so I didn't have a Corona or margarita, which may have made my meal taste better, but regardless, I've experienced much better Mexican food before... and with so many other Mexican concepts to choose from in the Valley, I probably won't be rushing back. Lo siento again, Black Chile!Great deal on great food for restaurant week!

Restaurant name  La Shish Kabob

Review Text :
It was late on that hot and muggy Carolina Friday, and most places were closed, but their sign caught my eye. The smell of falafel was a delicious draw, so we decided to stop in. This is not a restaurant. This is a hub. The small restaurant was full of good sights, smells, and the chatter of friendly people in languages I didn't understand. Women in headscarves talked animatedly to eachother while scooping up laughing children to sit on their laps. Families talked to all tables as they sat down to delicious food.  Behind the counter, herbed beef, chicken, and lamb sizzled as music from Jerusalem sounded over the system. Meet Izzat. He opened La Shish Kabob about two months ago after moving his family here from Jerusalem. When he invites you into his restaurant, it's like he's inviting you into his home. We gladly took a seat.SERVICE: Astounding. Very pleasant and hospitable, and when I realized that I had accidentally ordered something with onions and green peppers (my friend is allergic), they instantly made another one and apologized even though it was my err. Instead of the original lamb kebab that was ordered, he made something that was a little different to better suit my friend's food requirements, without even being asked. And it was delicious.FOOD: If you've never experienced good Middle Eastern food, experience it here. They have all of the classics, from falafel to baba ghannouj. The tabouli was out of this world (so much better than I make, I'm going to have to snag his recipe), with that clean and fresh parsley, lemon and olive oil flavor. The kebab wraps (chicken and lamb) were flavorful and huge. They also sell the brand of mango nectar there that tastes like you're drinking a whole mango. Delicious. The baklavah and other goodies in the case looked mouth-watering, but I was too full. That comes on round 2.PRICE: This is the awesome part. A heaping portion of tabouli for two, two lamb kebab wraps, one chicken kebab wrap, and 4 mango drinks comes out to: $26. So cheap for not only the portion size, but the quality and freshness as well.When you walk into this place, you can feel that it's good people. If you stay, you'll quickly realize that it's good people, AND great food. When it's all over, you'll also see that it's all for a really affrodable price. I highly suggest giving this place some love, because it's one of the few places that will give it back.This place is everything that is RIGHT about the middle east. Great service, Great food, a crappy atmosphere that just screams "We are serving amazing food not supplying comfy chairs". I cant wait to return, truly a hidden gem.I'm kicking myself for not going here sooner!One thing Charlotte doesn't have a lot of is good middle eastern food.  If you find yourself in need of an emergency fix, get yourself to La Shish Kabob, STAT!  It's only a ten minute trip from uptown Charlotte.I had the mixed grilled kabob plate, which is a sampler of all their chunk meat and kafta kabob offerings over a delicious rice pilaf.  Very, very tasty stuff.  Make sure you ask for the red and green hot sauces (relishes, really) that they keep behind the counter.  That'll take your meal over the top.I tried their baba ghanoush and hummos, and both were excellent.To top it all off, the guy who runs the place looks like a characher from lord of the rings.  You'll know what I'm talking about when you go try this place out, which you should do immediately.

If I had even the slightest shred of self respect, I wouldn't come here. But I'm currently the duke, so make of that what you will . . .The service is terrible, the place is always cold and giving forks to Western-looking folks and chopsticks to Asian-looking people without giving you the choice is annoying. And just giving you one napkin. Is there a napkin shortage I haven't heard about? Just put the napkins and cutlery on the table and let us do it ourselves! That would mean fewer encounters for the rude staff to endure too. "One fork, one napkin and one menu," as John Lee Hooker didn't sing. Sort it out!So why do I go back? The food. Absolutely delicious. Under five pounds for a tasty stir fry or soup, with free green tea. Of course I always spend more as I can't resist the crispy chilli beef strips for a starter (see photos).It's just the kind of place that Edinburgh needed - no frills, cheap and cheerful noodle house in the centre of town. The menu is a crazy concoction of various Asian dishes, but it's better than Wagamama and half the price. The Singapore noodles (with the option of ho fun rather than vermicelli) are fantastic.I was going to give it 4 stars for the food, but last time I had to eat with my coat on because of the cold and one of the staff was incredibly rude (though the other was very nice). But I'll keep going back for the food . . .

Review Text :
Forget about all the ball jokes. This is one food truck that should be taken seriously because of their tasty eats. The Godfather was a hit -- 2 ground beef meat balls with fresh basil, parsley, garlic, onions, pomodoro sauce, pecorino romano, and plenty of melted mozzarella in a soft, chewy bun. The savory meatballs had plenty of depth in flavor and were perfectly tender, not mushy.The Zorba (ground lamb, fresh mint, oregano, parsley, garlic, served with a tomato-olive spread, lettuce, feta, red onion and homemade tzatziki sauce) was decent, but the taste of the lamb wasn't overly appealing. I did enjoy the olive spread and appreciated the subtlety of the mint, but I don't think it's a sammie I'd get again.The pricing is as follows: 1 for $5, 2 for $9, or 3 for $12. Two sandwiches should be enough for most people, but if you're really hungry, add on a side. I was starving so I got an order of skin-on fries ($2). I have no idea if they were made fresh or were frozen, but the portion size is quite large and they were crispy, light, and delicious.

Good consistent casual Chinese food at a great value. Located close to home, China Tango is on the corner of N Green Valley Pkwy & Pebble Rd. I've been meaning to write them a review for some time, so here it is. Whether I've dined in, gotten delivery or carry-out (I've done all three numerous times!) I haven't been disappointed with their food, service, and overall experience. It's been my go-to spot for fast, affordable Chinese food.What I love:- No MSG. Enough said.- They offer brown rice. Healthy!- Generous portions. Cause we're hungry people! Or we just love leftovers.- Lunch specials are till 4pm. Who can always fit lunch before 2pm?- Lots of vegetables. Crispy veggies too, not the gross wilted ones you get at other places.They have all the traditional orders, from chow mein, sweet & sour pork, orange chicken, honey walnut shrimp, fried rice, hot & sour soup, it goes on and on. Prices range from $7.25-$9.95. Lunch is from $5.95-$6.50, which includes fried or steamed rice & chow mein & egg drop soup (dine-in only). Complete family dinners start from $24.95 & they serve Thai tea or fruit smoothies with boba.Most importantly, they've always been timely. Food is served fast, carry-out is ready, and delivery is always punctual. Tasty, affordable, reliable. It's not gourmet, but it's fresh, clean Chinese for a great price! I'll be back soon :)

Restaurant name  The Arrogant Butcher
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Waiting for Arrogant Butcher to open, my patience was low, apprehension was high, and excitement was through the roof. Finally, the day has come when it was mine to try. Fox Concepts are hit and miss with me, as some of the ones I love are super cheesy (Olive and Ivy, Modern Steak, Bloom), and some that I don't love are ones that are extremely popular (Sauce, Blanco, and Zinburger.)What sets Arrogant Butcher apart from the rest is it is the first downtown Phoenix restaurant that Fox RC has put out there. I'm sure they are nervous, and you can tell that from the design of the restaurant... it's much smaller than normal like they are testing the waters, yet in other ways it excels in the money spent meter. Three beautiful private dining rooms, a chef's counter facing the exhibition kitchen which they spared no expense on, and a great four sided bar in the middle. The atmosphere is a definite throwback to the 40's and 50's, which is nice considering you can't find that in many places downtown. It's truly a feel of an old tavern and restaurant. Arrogant Butcher went out of their way to support local. Almost all of the beers on the tap as well as on the bottle list are Arizona breweries, there are pictures all over the restaurant of historic Phoenix landmarks and famous people, and they have done a great job of engaging the street with the patio and entrance. Yup, Sam Fox, the guy who is building a national empire of restaurants, brought downtown Phoenix a place that gives a nice sense of community.As for the food, all apprehensions were set aside when the bowl of mussels in wine sauce with spicy pork shoulder, roasted grape tomatoes, and french fries came to the table. The dish was outstanding and had me wishing I could drink the broth. My main course of the crab stuffed chicken, served cordon blue style, with myers lemon and capers was also a very well executed dish. It was served with sauteed spinach underneath which I ate ridiculously quick. Other items on the menu sounded great, and AB offers a list of meats and cheeses, as well as a daily special that rotates weekly, and a nice array of sandwiches and salads for lunch. The desserts are fantastic as well, especially the peanut butter cup dessert, which is not served the way you would think it is, and includes cookies for dipping. So no, this restaurant is not a locally owned, mom and pop style place, but rather it is a restaurant with a formula that is crowd pleasing, set in a location that could really use something of it's type, with the power to draw people in by the numbers. My biggest impression? on the first dinner service night, there were absolutely no hiccups in service. Our waitress, bussers, and drink people were all absolutely spot on. Keep it coming, Arrogance.I had the opportunity to take part in Arrogant Butcher's preview lunch and I was totally impressed with the restaurant's design and the staff's performance. The service in particular was nothing short of spectacular, especially considering the size of the event and the Downtown notables in attendance (Mayor Gordon, City higher-ups, media). I love the Butcher's view of US Airways Center and Chase Field and its vantage point will only improve if the city can just find a way to utilize that awful parking lot across from the basketball arena. With business reemerging in the warehouse district and baseball season fast approaching, things are definitely looking up for those blocks of Downtown.Anyway, back to the Butcher. The entrees were well-received. I found my pastrami sandwich on pretzel bread to be way too salty, but I figure I made my own bed ordering cured meat on a pretzel. The crab cake salad, stew, jambalaya, roasted chicken and salmon plates all received enthusiastic thumbs up from our table and the desserts (cheesecake and chocolate cake cups) were delicious.The bar is a huge square with heavy stone counters, plenty of seating and flatscreens, insuring that the Butcher will be a popular happy hour and pregame destination. There's also a wraparound patio.Prices seemed friendly, too. I'm not a Fox RC devotee but could see myself becoming a regular at Arrogant Butcher.Walking into Arrogant Butcher will instantly increase your swank level by at least 25.6%, seriously. This modern chophouse by Sam Fox puts a sexy spin on nouveau-nostalgic, and trendy flair on classic American fare in typical Fox fashion. Plus it's located in the heart of downtown Phoenix which is on the verge of a full blown revival, and right on the lightrail which makes it terribly convenient for anyone who lives in the area. The handcrafted cocktails were quite impressive. I'm all over house made mixers,  vintage spirits, and super fresh ingredients that translate into something really sublime in every sip. Don't miss the bourbon infused 'Candlestick Maker', and if you're in the mood for something sensational and eclectic look no further than the heavenly gin and chartreuse laced cocktail dubbed 'The Last Word'. Indeed.For the soft-opening we attended the service was spot on, actually more like exceptional. And the food they served up followed closely behind. We sampled the mussels in wine sauce with spicy pork shoulder with pomme frites (that's fancy for french fries), crab stuffed chicken, skirt steak and grilled swordfish with artichokes hearts.  Although slightly salty, and somewhat expected... it was still  flavorful,  delicious, and very satisfying. Yes, Fox is a somewhat of local restaurant giant and Arrogant Butcher does have a decidedly chain vibe to it. But why so serious, downtown/midtown/cenpho elitist diner? It's a chain vibe in the best sense of the term. It really was an overall a fantastic and festive experience! Definitely joining the ranks of lively new downtown establishments I plan to frequent often. Look for me at the bar, cocktail in hand, swag in full effect. Thank you very much.FINALLY!!! Downtown has a flagship restaurant. There are many fantastic restaurants downtown, don't get me wrong, but to me, The Arrogant Butcher now reigns supreme. The service was attentive and friendly, and they all looked sharp in their white shirts and skinny black ties. I'm a fan of Fox's other restaurants and have always been impressed with the food. I had Toast, which was some kind of bread from heaven covered in brie and apples and something else delicious. Then for 6 bucks I got a beer and a shot of Jim Beam. Best happy hour downtown?? I think so. The location couldn't be better. The patio is a fantastic addition to downtown streets. Now the city needs to develop those hideous empty lots across the street. Inside is open and airy with some areas for private parties and a huge bar. I could go on and on about how awesome the Arrogant Butcher is. (How I love the name!!) It's modern, masculine, urban, unique, and such a welcome addition to downtown Phoenix.This is a tricky one. AB is a really cool looking spot, really nice decor and ambiance, comfy booths, it even smells like a new car.My group was greeted promptly by smiling hosts, and seated in a nice booth. Drink orders were placed, and when our margaritas arrived, they were really, really off and tasted terrible. Even after stirring, and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough, and didn't taste good. Our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff. My replacement drink was a Polish Fizz, and it was perfect. Highly recommended.For an app we went with the pretzel fondue, thanks to Yelpers who recommended it. As advertised, it was delicious, and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips, and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty, but the price point, for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries, along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again, the food was good, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions, euro style, etc. but for a bar food staple? I wasn't looking for a Costco serving of anything, but either bump up portion size, or drop the price from $16 to $11.50.I really liked our server, but for some reason as things went on, he was more and more absent. To be fair, we had a really difficult person that joined us, some of the stuff this person said made me want to pull my hair out, so I feel his pain.Anyway, AB is a very attractive spot that might be great for drinks and app. but for this price point, I would hit Durant's, Hillstone, or Beckett's Table. It's nice to leave a spot feeling that you got your monies worth, and that just doesn't happen here.I think all the 5 star reviews are from people who work here, of which there must be 500.  Look at the trend all 5s then 2,3 and a few 4s.  I HATE that.First off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.Lets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.Next the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.Drinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.   Now the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here.No valueFood:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak.My mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.Dessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.Value:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!Arrogant Butcher is exactly what Downtown Phoenix has needed for awhile: a restaurant with a great atmosphere, yummy food, friendly staff and one that takes reservations! This afternoon, I dined here for lunch and was pleased from the get-go. I arrived a little bit before my fellow lunchers, so I put our name in. It must have been perfect timing because about ten minutes later, the place had a line out the door. So for note one, I say to come at off hours, so for example, come at 11:50 instead of 12. The atmosphere here is open, airy and fresh. I love the sidewalk patio and the windows so that even if you aren't eating outside, you can still experience the fresh air and outdoor feel. The bar is seated in the middle and I noticed several local brews on tap. I also noticed several tasty drinks such as a skinny berry mojito. Since it was the middle of the day on a Tuesday, I didn't get the chance to try it, but you better believe that I will definitely be back! Now let's move on to the food. Have you been to Culinary Dropout? If you answered yes, then you will be well familiar with this food. Sam Fox did an excellent job of mirroring the menu from his Scottsdale restaurant for the Arrogant Butcher. I saw that they have a similar Turkey Pastrami on the menu and I was told that the sweet potato tortellinis are to die for, more like dessert. Unfortunately, I personally didn't try either, but I did have the Grilled Chicken Tabbouleh with avocado added. It came in a rather large bowl and I will admit that I ate every last bite it was so good. The dressing is an Oregano vinaigrette and the salad is graced with grilled chicken, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta, almonds and a couple other secret ingredients they didn't list on the menu. After our "ladies who lunch" 'esque meal, the staff happily validated our parking (making my parking free!) and sent us on our way. As we walked out the doors, we were met with the carpenters union who decided that today was the day to protest, but that's what happens when you're in a real city right? And if that's the case, Downtown Phoenix...you are well on your way!This seems like the perfect spot to eat at before a game, especially since they accept reservations and they are across the street from the stadiums! I did overhear the hostess say that there aren't many tables that seat more than six, so if you are coming with a large party, you should probably call ahead to ensure seating. Bravo Sam Fox. Another job well-done.Arrogant Butcher. Arrogant Bastard. Arrogant Butthole. I don't care what the name is, I had a really great time here. Finding it, however, was laughable. This whole Cityscape thing is a big FAIL to me so far. Why they didn't choose to build an open aired mall like Kierland Commons is so Bed Bath and Beyond me. The signage is horrible. The curb appeal is non existent. But when we finally turned the corner and saw the big A, the sidewalk was bustling with guests and the inside was energetic, fun and most appealing. I had great service. Thank you Winston! The pretzel fondue was fabulous! The scallops with bacon and beans was okay. Not exactly executed as I would have liked. And the crab stuffed chicken was actually quite bland. But I washed it all down with a beautiful, buttery bottle of Carneros Chardonnay and all in all a good time was had. Arrogant? Perhaps. But certainly Insecure Butcher wouldn't work. So it's a winner so far to me and I will most definitely return.I'm teetering between 3 and 4 stars. In fact, I wish we were using Star Search scoring because I'd give 3 and 3 quarters stars. Really cool decor. Like a retro, train station kinda feel. There were these ginormous beehive lamp shade light fixtures that weren't cohesive and I wish they'd take them out because they were an eyesore as well. The restrooms were splendid, very clean, nice large stalls. Aside from the snooty hostesses, the service was splendid. My girlfriend and I came during restaurant week. It was packed when we arrived at 8:00 p.m. on a Tuesday night, I would recommend rezzies. For starters my friend had the soup and I had the cheese plate, both were delish. The cheese plate came with the cutest, tiny spoons and jars for jam and mustard... took everything I had to not put them in my purse. I can't remember what my main dish was called but it was two pieces of fried fish with a crab cake in the middle, topped with gravy and capers and a side of steamed spinach. It tasted like really good cafeteria food, nothing to write about here. For dessert I had the blueberry something or other. It tasted exactly like a pretzel torte I use to make in my early 20's, tasty but again, nothing to write home about. I will becoming back for sure. I know they're has to be more to that kitchen that what I was served, I just know it!Was at the Arrogant Butcher meeting up for happy hour with fellow Yelpers for the CMYE: Opening Night of Giselle and I have never been here before but had researched the reviews and knew right away I wanted to try the Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue, it seems Yelpers can't help by to Yelp about them, and let me tell you, OOOMMMGGG believe everything you read about them, they are soft yet firm bites (more like 2 or 3 bites) of balled up pretzel dough with the right amount of salt that gets to be dunked in this heavenly pot of provolone fondue, yes this is a perfect dish! Ok enough of them, everyone talks about them, now onto other things I tried.The artichoke hummus with olives & tomatoes and flatbread, yes that was good, was it memorable, no, it was ok.Also tried the chicken liver pate with pickled onions toast, my friend ordered these because she wanted to try it, I was game, my 1st bite was great, the red pickled onions and the pate mixed together was a perfect blend, but the 2nd bite, that's where it turned way too salty for me to enjoy. Now the local ricotta & roasted peppers toast was so delish! It was toasted perfectly, the ricotta & peppers with balsamic vinegar was omg cosmic, was very very sad when it had disappeared! Yep I think the next time I am their I am just getting the pretzel fondue & ricotta & roasted peppers toast haha oh and I heard The Fix is the drink to get!11/29/123.5 stars... First visit!Bookmarked this place months ago, and I finally had an excuse to make the trip from North Scottsdale... I'm taking Mom and aunt to see Cirque du Soleil's "Dralion" at the US Airways Center!  Thanks to friend and fellow yelper Dolores G.'s helpful info on where to park, I made the decision to choose Cityscape for both the chance to dine at The Arrogant Butcher and have my ticket validated AND take advantage of its proximity to the arena.  She wasn't kidding when she said that US Airways was across the street!  After waiting about 20 or so minutes for first availability, we were seated outside, and my views were of the four-way intersections, pedestrian traffic, and of the front of the arena, which were lovely given that most of my dining experiences have been in strip malls, Old Town Scottsdale, the Biltmore... suburbia.  I was able to sample a couple of reds before settling with a nice glass of Sebastiani cab from Sonoma.  While waiting for our table, we all decided we'd try the Artichoke hummus app http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=pMVWRf_4YH3y8gA7yX4NfQ#pMVWRf_4YH3y8gA7yX4NfQ, the Market salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=p8euqv1jrWI3dHs6F8Qw8Q#p8euqv1jrWI3dHs6F8Qw8Q, the Beef short rib stew http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=M50fqAft6N-pxOxsrjgaQA#M50fqAft6N-pxOxsrjgaQA, and the "Fish and Chips."  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=aaSSAu-_xck3KUofcyT-hA#aaSSAu-_xck3KUofcyT-hAWe all loved the artichoke hummus and pita bread app!  The bread was soft, yet had a nice chew, in spite of it not being warm and crispy.  The artichokes had great flavor, especially those that were touching the tomatoes.  We also adored the Market salad, which had so many textures to delight the mouth: mixed grains, chewy cranberries, sweet and crunchy gingersnaps, and creamy ricotta... Mmmm!  Loved the almost-nutty bite of the roasted butternut squash.  I plan to order this again on my next visit!  We also really liked the Beef short rib stew: I liked the smoky flavors of the beef and the green chile peppers, but my favorite were the beans!  Some were still chunky, while the others had tenderized down to almost like a dip you spread on crackers and crostini.  I didn't think the fried egg's presence made much of a difference...  I could take it, or leave it.  Since I couldn't sample the cornbread muffin (allergy), I had some of the fries from the fish entree with the stew, instead.  Mom and aunt enjoyed the crispy fish!  I really loved the batter, which was just the perfect amount to cover the fish and give it a very delightful crunch (and was the dish ever so pretty to look at!).  However, I found the pieces to be very salty, and I couldn't stand more than two or three bites of it.  I think my Mom would very much like to return, and so would I.  :)  I am going to try to make it here earlier for happy hour soon.  I really appreciate the location of Cityscape, its parking garage, and its easy access to many restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues!Arrogant Butcher continues to disappoint.  I came here on Friday to celebrate someone's birthday.  The pretzel/fondue appetizer was awesome, as always, but I'm beginning to suspect that it's the only good thing on the menu -- and really, that's not very impressive because how could they possibly mess up salted bread and melted cheese??We were headed to the art museum after dinner, so I decided to order an appetizer for my meal since I knew I couldn't finish a whole entree and I didn't want to lug leftovers around with me on the lightrail.  At first I ordered the steamed mussels, but sadly they were out of them for the night.  My second choice was the salmon rillette, which the menu described as "smoked salmon with crusty bread."  I was expecting a lox and french bread type of plate, but what came out was smoked salmon that had been mushed up into little chunks, soaked in some sort of liquid (tasted like vinegar maybe?), poured in a jar and topped with many capers.  I gave it a try and spread it on the bread, but after 2 bites I knew I did not like it.  it was mushy and sour and yecchh.I was waiting for the bartender (we sat at the bar) to come by and ask if we enjoyed our food so that I could exchange my salmon for a salad or something, but she never did.  she only came at the end of our meal and collected my plate (still FULL of food except for the 2 bites missing) and threw all the food in the trash.  you would think the plate full of uneaten food would've clued her in that I didn't enjoy my meal, but either she didn't notice or didn't care, but just brought out the check and gave it to us without comment.  I didn't want to be fussy, so we paid and left.My dining companion ordered the jambalaya for his meal and said it was really greasy.Arrogant Butcher, you make me angry that you charge so much money for bleh food.  I will not be convinced to come here again, no matter how good your pretzel/fondue is!After a "rigorous" evening of flow yoga at Lustre Bar upstairs, my friends and I were hungry and found ourselves at The Arrogant Butcher. I've always wanted to try this place and despite my friends wanting to get "salads" and the title of the restaurant didn't really yell salads, I made them come here and I was extremely glad I did!I learned several things that evening!1. Order the Candlestick Maker. (Well, if you're a bourbon fan like me!) It has Makers 46, lemon, Thatcher's Spiced Apple, honey and angostura2. Order the Old Fashioned. (They do it right here!)3. Share the Penn Cove Mussels with a friend -  Spicy Salumi, Charred Tomato,   Grilled Bread4. Enjoy the house soft pretzels with provolone fondue. - You may also want to share this one, but who knows, maybe you're extra hungry with those cocktails and want something to "absorb" the potency of those cocktails. We enjoyed ourselves so much here that we were there past when the kitchen closed. To my dismay, I didn't know that the kitchen closed at 9pm, and my husband, who was at home, wanted something to eat. When the waiter informed me the kitchen closed, I shamefully whined, "Wait! I was supposed to bring home something for my husband! You can't let me go home empty handed. He'd be so angry with me." The waiter then asked me if I knew what I wanted to order to go. I said, "The short rib stew!" He answered, "Well let me see what we can do.." He then proceeded to head to the kitchen. My anxiety reached all new heights as I awaited his response. It wasn't long before he returned and said, "We still have some stew, which means, yes, you can still get it to go!" I was so elated! I loudly exclaimed, "You and the kitchen just made my night!!!" I love how accommodating they were there! This is a great example of how great their service is!!5. So the whole point of this story above is... Spectacular food (at least the stuff I tried that night), stupendous service, and too cool to be kitsch décor yet almost farm like and trendy. I will always recommend and return to this place again, because I love them!Oh. They got me. They got me real good. Simply cannot wait to come back to The Arrogant Butcher.If I could write a short review it would say:+ Pristine Service+ Great Place to Hang Out+ Great Drinks+ Food hits the spot!Just go. Get your parking validated! Plan sufficient time!CUSTOMER SERVICEBuuuut I am a wordy nerd. And I have to give really give props to the customer service here. We showed up on a Thursday for lunch and had the fortune of sitting in Robert G's section. Showing an excitement level I don't think I've seen in a server *ever* he walked us through the delightfully robust menu. My taste buds salivated at the many options. Robert G. got more worked up as I ordered my porter beer. (They stock an excellent porter on draft! Deschutes Black Butte). When someone shows that much passion for their work it rubs off on everyone. OYSTERS | GET'EM!Based on Robert's elocution and delivery we, of course (!), had to sample some Boston oysters from Cape Cod. Oysters come with many accoutrement options beyond cocktail sauce and horseradish. We were sold on the jalapeño mignonette. It's this green, spicy heavenly goodness. The vinaigrette comes consists of cilantro, cucumber, shallot, jalapeño + red wine vinegar + v.oil.I'm sighing thinking back to how delightful an experience it was slurping my little raw guys down. I'm from the east coast. This Phoenix locale delivers raw oysters superbly. Had I not already placed a food order I could have contently eaten oysters the rest of the afternoon. (I'll come back and do just that.) GOOD STUFF.ENTREES | MM MMM!My friend and I ordered at the polar opposites of the palate menu. I went for something spicy (Jamalaya). She did something rather sweet (Pork Carnitas). Both were excellent. I'd enjoy either in a heart beat again. Warning: the portions are ginormous! When they say spicy, they mean spicy. The Jamalaya is just that! Generous servings of sausage, chicken and shrimp are provided. MISCThe bar is super! It's a central feature of the restaurant. Plenty of seats for everyone. Comfortable for anyone to dine solo. And (!) a number of televisions up high were showing work related content. (I imagine that changes depending on the hour.) I just really liked how unobtrusive they were.On our way out we noticed there were booths in the interior area of the restaurant. Something to consider checking out. The outdoor patio looks fab!Love, love, love!LOVE!We came here for happy hour and it did not disappoint they have a great happy hour and a large patio that's awesome for people watching. I got a specialty cocktail for $4 called the fix which was refreshing and delicious. Vodka with mint and berry puree. We ordered several plates of oysters, which adds up at $2.50 each. The mineit sauce came with the oysters was fantastic, but the oysters did have quite a few shells in them.  They need to be more consistent with the plating the first plate had yummy veggies on it second one didn't.The pretzel fondue was very good too. I can't wait to come back and try dinner soon.

Review Text :
Looking for a decent Sushi spot and came across YB from Yelp. Good reviews and my family had a sushi craving. So here we are and I was pretty excited to try YB. Walked in and I was a little confused if this was fast food or a sit down place. Anyways, the owner greeted us and he he seated us. Very friendly owner. I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Bento which had a small salad, rice with a very generous portion of white meat chicken teriyaki and five pieces of tempura including shrimp tempura. Chicken was moist and tasty, loved the little cabbage salad and the tempura was ok. Very different tempura. The batter used reminded me of the batter that's used for fish and chips. The tempura was a little greasy but I enjoyed it. My wife ordered the chicken Yakisoba. It was pretty spicy and my wife usually doesn't like spicy but was able to eat most of it. I tried it and it was really good. Nice kick to it. Of course we had to try the sushi. So we had the caterpillar and rainbow. Very fresh and good. Only problem is that the sushi rolls weren't cut very good so it was crumbling while we were trying to eat it. Presentation was really good. Taste good. As long as it's good I don't mind it crumbling cause once it goes down the chute it's yum yum. Interesting that YB looks like a fast food but yet it's not. We ordered at the table and were served. The owner even served us our water even through its self-serve. Overall, the food was very fresh and prices reasonable. Enjoy and have fun.I've been here three times; yesterday with Mom.  She had a craving for sushi bento, so I thought she could try it here while I have some ramen.  I ended up ordering chicken udon, after having some wonderful udon at Waikiki's Marukame Ramen.  It cost almost twice here in Scottsdale, and it made me wish I was back in Hawaii having fresh hand-rolled udon there.  Yoshi's broth was tasty, with a good amount of chicken, both chunky and shredded, complete with sliced roasted chicken skin (not crispy).  I wished the skin had even a hint of crispiness.  There were tempura sprinkled on top, but even those were not crispy at all...  Marukame spoiled me, I think.  Yoshi also added an egg in the broth, so it looked like egg drop soup with chunks of chicken, sliced of chicken skin, zucchini, nori, onion, and green onion.  My main concern was that the udon had a slimy texture.  Not at all like the texture of the fresh hand-rolled udon noodles at Marukame.  This made me think that the noodles here at Yoshi were pre-packaged.  I would order the broth to be served with ramen in the future, if that option is available.  Be careful to allow the bowl to cool off for about ten minutes, or you're going to burn your tongue (and in my case, my eyelid, as the hot and slimy noodle whipped across my face as I tried to prevent the noodle from burning my lips- ouch!).  Mom was already eating, and I was hungry, so I couldn't wait.  Silly me- I ended up with a tender, burnt tongue, but thankfully my eye was only slightly puffy.Mom enjoyed her sushi bento, priced at $12 ($11.95 to be exact).  She missed the miso soup and salad that usually accompany bento boxes elsewhere.   $23 for lunch that should've included miso soup, a salad, and non-slimy udon... We'll try elsewhere next time.p.s.  The ramen here is just OK.  I enjoyed the spicy pork more than the tofu miso soup, although both tasted good.  The latter needed more pork in it, while I had issues with the miso.  I had ordered it without mushrooms (and was told that corn was not a standard ingredient in it), but allowed the carrots and whatever else it came with.  My order arrived with mushrooms, which I discovered after they floated to the top after having many spoonfuls of broth already, so I returned it and asked for a new one sans mushroom, but the second one arrived with corn in it!  The carrots were also omitted, even though I didn't ask for the omission-- I think due to the cook/owner spying the carrots I had fished out and left on the table next to the first bowl.  Needless to say, I was not happy with the second bowl, but after having some tofu and soup and then seeing the corn rise up from the bottom, I decided I'd had enough of soup for lunch.  I'll need to be more specific about the omissions and to inspect the bowl for ingredients before eating next time.

Restaurant name  Dang Dee Thai Cuisine

Review Text :
First of all it's hard to walk into a Thai restaurant and only smell Subway bread baking. I've been here four times and it throws me off every time! Here's how I feel about Dang Dee.Prices- Cheap AND they offer lunch special on the weekends. Service- Really kind staff who always makes sure your glass is full. Beware- If you blow your nose because you are literally down one lung and should be in bed they will laugh at you and assume it was because the dish was too spicy for you, white girl. Hee hee, not funny. But, of course that didn't happen to me. Shhh.Food- If you remember anything at all about this review it should be to order the Green Curry Chicken. It's outstanding. Mad props to the chef for this dish.Eggrolls- Seems more like Lumpia to me in the shape of those party wieners wrapped in crescent rolls. Strange, meaty, but porkalicious good.Thai Iced Tea- I hadn't had one in a year. I'm not sure if I'm just super sensitive to sugar these days, but mine was entirely too sweet to drink. I dumped half a glass of water in it so I could get it down. That's what fat kids do instead of just not drinking it. You know it still tasted like shit with the water, but fatty "had to get it down". I'm sick, leave me alone. Tom Kha- I ordered it at the hottest spice level so there were pepper in my soup which I enjoyed. Other than the peppers I really did not care for this soup. Day 2 it didn't grow on me either. It was watery and the spices never really married the way they should. The quality of the chicken was nice, but the runny broth along with huge lemongrass rods and thick slices of ginger kind of killed it for me. Will I be back you ask? Absolutely. Dang Dee will stay in my rotation with the killer 5 Star Green Curry she's banging out. I do fear she's a one trick Thai pony. Ponies are still fun to play with and ride in circles every once in a while. Just don't step in their giant poop piles.

Restaurant name  Iron Chef
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Iron Chef is a Chinese and Japanese restaurant. Really. That doesn't make sense. Never heard of this combination. Ok so I was a little skeptical. Small little place. When we walked in I was looking for a hostess but to my surprise nothing. Someone just told us to take a seat. So we find our own table. Waitress is very good and tells us all the Chef's Special rolls are 50% off all the time. Very cool. We ordered the Dragon roll, Caterpillar roll, and Crunchy Shrimp roll. The rolls were really good. Very fresh. We really enjoyed them. Not bad for a Chinese/Japanese place. I also ordered the House Special Chow Mein which had a nice mix of veggies, BBQ portk, and shrimp. Noodles cooked very good. Overall, it tasted okay. Not great and also not the worst I had before so it was good. My wife ordered the Chicken Yaki Udon noodles. So I guess when you order one of their Japanese  dishes they give you a bowl of miso soup. Soup was really good. Have to say it was outstanding. My daughter and wife shared the udon noodles. They both loved it. The chicken was very moist and tender. My wife enjoyed he noodles said it was cooked right and wasn't overpowering. They gobbled it up. So I would have to say they enjoyed it. Service we really good. They had three waitresses running around helping out their tables. All were Asian women and were very helpful. Cup were filled in a timely manner and they were really kind and smiling. That's they type of service I'm looking for. Also, the food came out really quickly. They also have a nice little area outside that looked nice to sit at especially with this great weather right now. So we had a great time, good food, good sushi and good service. If you can handle a little self service to find your own table then this is the place for you. Choice of Japanese or Chinese food. Really. Iron Chef somehow makes this works. I'm not complaining and I'll be back. Enjoy.Iron Chef serves great sushi and cooked Japanese and Chinese dishes, the ambiance is pleasant, and the servers are extremely efficient and professional.I love the Golden Dragon Roll, which I get almost every time.  I also like the chicken yaki udon, and my boyfriend likes the kung pao chicken.YUMMY!

Review Text :
An interesting concept that didn't end up being what I hoped for.  I was pretty excited to try the Posh Noodles & Noshes Japanese street food as prepared by Josh Hebert.  I love Japanese food and was looking forward to the dishes that are not readily available in Phoenix.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food.The location inside the Lexington Hotel has definitely seen better days.  An attempt has been made to create a temporary generic space with chalkboard walls and butcher paper topped tables.  However, it came across as worn and dingy.Our waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offerings ('I didn't work here last night') but was friendly and did find out answers from other staff.  Foolishly thinking that we would love each and every dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day, we tried a large assortment.  An expensive mistake.Duck Gyoza w/ Ponzu - I prefer steamed gyoza over the fried presentation here.  Also, these had the tiniest, greasy portion of filling I have ever seen.Homemade Tofu w/ Ginger, Scallion, Cherry Blossom - this was good, with a sweet, dessert-like flavor but a somewhat runny texture.Okonomiyaki - this 'Japanese pizza' was among the better items.  However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eatTako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by 'breading' that fell apart easilyThe ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.   We left most of them behind, deciding not to take anything with us.The dessert, Green Tea Pot de Crème was a nice finish but did not make me feel better overall about the $100+ meal.

Restaurant name  Eddie V's Prime Seafood and Steak
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The new 8,800-square-foot Eddie V's at Scottsdale Quarter includes three separate private dining rooms, in addition to the main dining areas, each with its own unique personality.  One room is dramatically situated in a round rotunda, where my partner and I had a wonderfully romantic dinner. Soft live jazz music played softly in the background while we enjoyed a cross section of delightful menu items.Dinner was truly memorable with a starter of Tuna Tartare. Beautiful sashimi quality tuna was set an top of diced mango then topped with just the slightest amount of sliced chile. The heat was mild and only helped to accentuate the sweetness of the fish and mango. This was followed up by a gorgeous long plate filled with a mix of lightly dusted flash fried calamari, julienne carrots and daikon drizzled with a sweet soy glaze. My entree was on the lighter side but was heavy on flavor. Crab Stuffed Shrimp were excellent; extra large shrimp were grilled then topped with sweet crab meat, panko bread crumbs and a lime finish. I couldn't stop eating there plump crustaceans. I did however stop long enough to try my partners perfectly tender Steak au Poivre.Dessert was a new take on an old classic, Bananas Foster Cake. As our waiter dumped brandy on top of the cake and set it on fire, even head in the dining room was on us, was quite a sight. The cake was the best finish to a extraordinary evening of food and romance.This place is a bit stuffy. It's nice and all, but let me put it this way- this place is very age specific (like most of Scottsdale I suppose). You will have a lot of people in their late forties and up here- not that there's anything wrong with that.I like some of the food,especially the tuna tartare, but they do some sort of sushi-American fusion roll that really sucks. I complain because it is one of the most expensive small plates on the menu and the number one thing the bartenders recommend (more on the bartenders... ahem...  'recommendations' later). So this roll consists mainly of lobster and high quality beef but then they go and ruin it by smothering the 2 indulgent ingredients in a sauce that overwhelms the entire plate, and the sushi rice is gross and kind of mealy. That roll pisses me off. It needs editing, but I guess it reminds me of some of the unedited clientele I see at Eddie V's as well- like the bleached platinum blond girl with a hair piece, fake eyelashes, dark navy eye shadow, oompa loompa tan, injected lips, caked on makeup, fake boobs, fake claws, wearing a skin tight designer t-shirt along with a thousand dollar handbag and $400  jeans to coordinate with her stripper shoes and abundantly accessorized sterling silver Tiffany's jewelry that sat by me last visit. I mean each element of her style probably works on its own, but all together it looks like a Vogue magazine threw up on her. That's sort of what the roll was for me. (BTW, she ordered the same thing- the roll- and liked it, so what's that tell you?)Now, for my big gripe. I can describe the type of wine I like quite well. I will ask for something that tastes a certain way and immediately every bartender- no matter what description I give- will direct me to the 2 most expensive wines by the glass (around $25 a glass) on the menu. Price does not equal quality and I find it offensive when I taste the $25 glass of  wine and it in no way mirrors what I was asking for. I feel like they are just trying to up-sell me without considering my taste. I get it. I work in sales too, but I think it's more important to give the customer what they want rather than try to push them into spending more money. Also, if I don't choose the most expensive wines, they kind of shrug their shoulders as if implying that all the other wines on the menu suck. I'm of the thinking that nothing on the menu should suck or not be worth suggesting in one way or another, so for that they get 2 stars. I have a feeling it's the staff more than the menu that is the problem.Met some colleagues here for dinner one evening.  Located in the Scottsdale Quarter, this high end restaurant is a great place for dinner.  If you're price sensitive, this is not the place for you....don't even bother.  Our reservation was for 6:45 pm and it was jam packed, good thing we called ahead.  We were promptly seated in the main dining room.After browsing the extensive menu, I decided to order:Baby Iceberg BLT Wedge - (Bacon, Maytag Blue Cheese, Buttermilk-Chive Dressing), $9Twin Lobster Tails - Broiled, MKT PriceTruffle Mac 'n Cheese, $6 (for small portion)Godiva Chocolate w/Vanilla Ice CreamAll of the food was excellent.  The Twin Lobster Tails were perfect and came with Butter to dip them in.  They were so good, I used very little Butter.  I enjoyed the broiled flavor on it's own.  The Truffle Mac 'n Cheese was very rich & creamy, amazing.The BLT Wedge was very good too, but the portion was too large and I had to leave 1/2 of it because I didn't want to be full when my entree came out.At the urging of my colleagues, I ordered the Godiva Chocolate w/Vanilla Ice Cream.  It was awesome, but very rich.  I had to split it with everyone because there was no way I could finish it after the big meal.  The hot Godiva Chocolate oozed out of the center of the Cake....and the Vanilla Ice Cream complimented it perfectly.The service here was impeccable.  They have a great staff.  Can't wait for my next visit.Return Factor - 100%I've eaten at Eddie V's many times over the years and its always been good.  I organized my company holiday dinner at the Scottsdale Quarter location for last Friday night and I can honestly say it was one of the worst experiences at a high end Steak/Seafood restaurant I've ever had.  In this case, the reason for the poor experience falls on the service.  We had a party of 9 which we had a reservation for.  Of the many issues that went wrong a few really stand out.  First of all we only had one server who also seemed to have a number of other tables which was not enough.  The first issue came when I ordered a bottle of Bella Glos pino (a great wine if anyone is interested).  The wine comes with wax covering the cork and the server couldn't remove the wax.  When I joked if she needed help, she actually handed me the bottle and bottle opener.  Note to all servers...on an expensive bottle of wine, if there is ever an issue please take the bottle back and bring me another.  Having me help you open it is simply unacceptable.  The next issue came when our meal was served.  We ordered enough sides that they suggested we keep them on a side table and they serve us since there wasn't enough room on our table.  Not a bad idea, except that our one server individually served sides for all nine of us.  As the last one to get served my sides, I was almost done with my steak by the time she got to me.  If you're going to help us by serving the sides, get additional help so everyone is served at the same time.  The next issue came at dessert.  Only two of us were given dessert menus, me being one of them.  When the server came back to take our order I asked if everyone had menus (I knew they didn't) and her response was for me to pass my menu down to others at my table.  really?The final, final straw came when we were all finally ready to leave and we couldn't get our server to the table because she was chit-chatting with her other tables.  It literally took us 30 minutes to get our bill paid.  For the record we did alert the manager who I think was new.  She took my email as well as the CEO of my company, though we've yet to hear a peep from them.  You'd think that if she went through the effort to take down our information we'd at least get an email or call.   The group I was with eat at these types of places all the time (Oceans Club, Mastros, Capital Grille, etc) and this was by far the worst service I've ever had in this type of establishment.  All the others at our table agreed.  I sincerely hope this was just a one time issue and it doesn't happen to anyone else.Come here (any night of the week) if you're looking for live music and prefer a cool jazz tune.After a rained out evening outdoor concert, a few of us decided we weren't ready to give up on an hearing some live music. We popped into a place around the corner hoping to find some live Jazz, and disappointed with who was playing that evening, we asked the bartender if there was somewhere else they would suggest for Jazz on a Sunday evening.I'm glad we decided to take his advice on Eddie V's, cause I had one of the best evenings of great live Jazz in the Phoenix area sitting right at the bar. After some encouragement by our group, the musicians decided to really lay into it with their music and turn it up from the typical elevator music to something you could really dance along to. The bartender poured some excellent tasting drinks, the band ended up chatting with us for a couple minutes post set and it turned out to be a fabulous way to spend four hours with your gal.Happy Yelping Phoenix! :-)

Restaurant name  Spinato's Pizzeria

Review Text :
Spinato's just opened in Ahwatukee and you would think it was the first and only restaurant this side of South Mountain from all of the people there.  The place was packed!  However, it was our lucky day when our friends got there just in time to get us a prime spot at a bar table!There were servers and staff everywhere, so even though the confusion of opening night was obvious, everyone was having a great time and there were plenty of people helping out so it didn't really matter.  We ordered a few appetizers and four personal (7") pizzas.  The Trio of Meatballs appetizer was awesome!  Huge meatballs in a delicious vodka sauce (that is fantastic as a dipping sauce for any type of bread or pizza crust, so ask for a side) for only $3.99!The BF had the "Here's the Beef" pizza which looked meaty and delicious.  I probably would have had a bite, but my Da Greek pizza was overflowing with fantastic toppings (feta, kalamata olives, pepperoncini, spinach, and tomatoes) that I didn't want anything to mess with the flavors.Every day is a different daily drink special and $2 PBR all day, every day.I would say that I can't wait for the place to calm down so I can go back, but to be honest, I don't really care.  I'll go back even if it is just as busy as opening night.  The food was wonderful, the service was great, and the atmosphere is something I wanted to be part of.  The only bad part about Spinato's opening in the Tuke is going to be deciding which of my favorite pizza joints I'm going to pick on any given night!Super addition to the Ahwatukee scene!I've been here a few times now, and every dish I've tried has been very good. I've tried their sandwiches, their pizza, and their pasta dishes. Oh, and the spinach and artichoke dip is divine--you must try it. They have good drink specials and all kinds of stuff going on every day of the week.The service is very friendly--every server I've had has been great. One of the times they had a new person running food to the tables. After he was at our table, the manager came by literally 30 seconds later to ensure that he was polite and mentioned the things they wanted him to mention. I was floored.This place can get quite loud at times over the weekend, especially if you are seated in the side of the restaurant where the bar is. It might have just been the night I was there, as there were three different donkey beasts braying 100 decibel laughter at regular intervals one Sunday I was there. If you are looking for a quieter dinner, ask to be seated on the other side.I feel a bit bad for Bell'Italia across the road... they've already cut their hours, and I don't think Spinato's is going to make it any easier for the other Italian places in Ahwatukee...I had a great experience here. For starters, they have some good drink specials each night. On Tuesday, they have $5 glasses of wine and $3 beers. We ordered a pizza and it was really good. Lots of toppings and cheese and sauce and cooked to perfection! For dessert we shared a canollo (yes the Italian in me wants to use the proper term! lol. One conollo, two canolli!) Ok, I digress! The server found out it was a birthday and wrote on the plate in chocolate Happy Birthday and took the dessert off the bill. Very nice. She checked on us several times and kept our drinks full. The owner or maybe manager came over and he was very nice. Very genuine and you could tell that he really cared about what people thought and wanted everyone to have a great experience. Where I would have probably given this place 4 stars, his presence and personality easily put it at 5 stars. Service was impecable. Pizza and dessert was really good, and they made a new customer out of me!

Restaurant name  Szmidt's Old World Deli
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I've noticed this place while driving to the South Side via Greenfield Ave. One evening the boyfriend and I were looking for a bite to eat but neither of could decide where to go. On a whim, I pulled up to Szmidt's and man, I'm glad I did! The aroma of all the spices and fresh bread when you walk in the door is intensely pleasing. The deli case is filled with various fresh pasta salads and sides that include grape leaves, pickled cucumber slices, mac 'n cheese with jalapeno, apricot glazed meatloaf, potato salad, tuna salad, haluski (looked amazing, I will definitely be back to try it), and various other items that evade my memory at the moment. Have I mentioned that everything is made in-house? Breads, salads, sides, and pierogies - ALL home made! Speaking of pierogies...all your classics are here - Potato & cheddar, potato & kraut, potato & jalapeno, sausage, and plain kraut ($4.95/6 $8.95/12). In addition to these are "New World Pierogies" ($5.45/6 $9.95/12) - Reuben, thanksgiving with turkey gravy, southwest chicken with cilantro lime sour cream, buffalo chicken with bleu cheese, cheese steak with horseradish sour cream, and bacon cheeseburger with rage sauce. They also offer sweet pierogies like apple mango, granny smith apple pie, and a seasonal special. So much deliciousness in one place, we didn't know where to begin. After thinking long and hard, I finally decided on a spinach & feta doughbie (think stromboli) and Justin opted for the Frankie (sliced turkey breast, ginger mustard glazed ham, maplewood bacon, american cheese, mayo, lettuce, and tomato all on a toasted homemade bun. While our food was being prepared, we chatted with the owner. I told him we've been living here for a year now and can't believe we never heard of his place then he informed us that they just opened up a month ago and offered us some samples from the deli case. We had a little scoop of potato salad (better than my mom's - sorry ma), 4 grape leaves (the best I've had and I do love me some dolmas), sweet cucumber slices (JB was a huge fan and now wants me to try my hand at recreating them at home so he can have them all the time) and ziti pasta salad (which is great WITH the cuke slices)!! Everything we had was exquisite!! The entire experience was pleasurable - The shop owner was personable and inviting, the shop is darling and homey with pictures of the family hung on the walls and the food is delectable and very affordable. Sorry for such a lengthy review but I just can't say enough good things about Szmidt's. If you happen to find yourself in the Greenfield/Squirrel Hill area do yourself a favor and give this place a chance!!!Pittsburgh is rife with pierogies.  If you walk outside for any reasonable length of time, somebody will throw a pierogie right in your mouth, and charge you a quarter.  That's just part of living here.We had family in from out of town, and they had never had pierogies, so I did the laziest internet search in the world, and found that Szmidt's not only had pierogies, but was the closest location on google maps!  Much like the other places along Greenfield Ave, I've been driving past Szmidt's for at least two years, never even considering whether it was a place I would ever be inside.  But fortune conspired, and I found myself there on this glorious day.It's a tiny place with very little seating, but once I smelled whatever delicious mystery meat they were cooking, I lost all sense of space and time.  We ordered some sandwiches, and some old world pierogies, but...what's that other stuff?  New world pierogies?  Are you mad?  Who would ever want one of those...I'll take 6.  You will probably have a similar thought process.The sandwiches are huge, and messy, and quite possibly the best I've ever had in the city.  Each sandwich is special, because the final step in its creation is that a unicorn with a sparkling tail gives each sandwich a gentle kiss as it leaves the kitchen, thereby rendering said sandwich magical.Or at least that's what I imagined as I ate my sandwich so hard that I only paused to gasp for air.Oh, right, and we got pierogies.  Some traditional potato and cheese, and some buffalo chicken ones as well.  If anybody wants to challenge me to a pierogie eating contest, let's do it here, because Unicorn Kissed Pierogies (tm) are amazing.So everybody who loves sandwiches, pierogies and magic should come to this place and just go to town.  I honestly don't even know if this place is real, so I didn't check the hours.

Review Text :
I am so giddy because I luv crepes!I found out about the opening in the zip code magazine I get in the mail, and bookmarked it forthwith.  I knew that this creperie served crepes on a plate, not hand-held style, but so what?  They serve up YUM!Even though it was a late lunch for me, I opted for a sweet crepe.  I will definitely need to get back here to try savory and breakfast crepes, but The Avalon called out to me: buttered pears, goat cheese, candied walnuts....it was amazing!  So was the service.  I was the only one inside (a few brave souls were eating outside) and I had a nice chat with the two ladies working.  I am intrigued by the flavored mimosas and will come back for those (they have a 3 mimosa sampler for $10 or one for $6) - white peach, passion fruit, lychee, traditional, pomegranate. This would be a really fun place for me to get the yelpettes of Vegas for a crepe and mimosa brunch before my wedding (so keep your eyes open for that, belles!)Yes, I will be back...they have guacamole for savory crepes and lemon curd for sweet ones so I have to come back for those options!The interior is swanky, purple hues, fun art and mirrors on the walls, nice tables (I sat at the one by the crepe-making station), flat screen TVs, and even really nice flatware!Crepely speaking, you cannot go wrong here.Absolutely phenomenal. It has been a bit since I have been willing to give an establishment 5 stars after only one experience, but my initial visit to Crêpe Expectations was simply all around perfection. I met a friend for brunch on a Sunday at 11 am. The place was packed, with a line of people waiting to order and be seated. For a minute I contemplated leaving and finding a less busy place to eat, but we had been talking about trying the crepes (and mimosas!!) here for too long to do that... Besides, that may people willing to wait was almost sure to be a indicator that good things were to come to us if we exercised a little patience. The line moved surprisingly quick, we were seated at the 'bar' in front of the crepe making stations about 20 minutes after arrival. The bar is a prime spot to sit.. You get to watch every crepe get made. Based on what we saw, I already know what I will be ordering the next 2-3 times I go in. We started out our meal with some of the self-serve cucumber water (love that there is an option other then lemon!) and a mimosa trio. We tried the raspberry (ok), the blood orange (delicious) and my favorite, the nectar of the gods, aka the white peach. I have no idea what kind of bubbly is used at Crêpe Expectations, and I do not claim to be an expert on champagne either...  but these mimosas were some of the tastiest I have ever had. On to the grub!! I had the Sunday Morning with bacon added. This crepe slaughters every breakfast burrito I have ever had with regard to taste. It was amazing, the only thing it was lacking was a little salsa, but it was still excellent without it. Since we were debating between sweet and not sweet crepes, my friend and I also split the Berry Delight. Strawberries, blueberries and blackberries, all super juicy and fresh... with just the right amount of whipped cream. Honestly the ONLY thing I can say about Crêpe Expectations that isn't positive is that it's on the small side. With food and service this good, I think they could easily fill an area double, maybe even triple the current size. Regardless, even knowing there may be a wait, I'll be back. And for the days I can't wait, there is always the option of takeout! I look forward to warmer weather, as the outdoor seating looks right up my alley (and they are dog friendly at Crêpe Expectations!!) 5 star, all around amazing place.I have to say I was impressed. I'm not a big crepe or pancake person but this place was nice. We shared the monkey, our company got the berry delight and a breakfast yum (can't remember which). They all were huge! Can't imagine finishing one by myself let alone the little one and I shared and we couldn't finish The strawberries, banana and Nutella was really a good combo without being overly sweet. We didn't want whip cream and the guy who took our order recommended adding strawberries to the monkey which was awesome.The service was excellent, there was a mess made and the guys were helpful and quick to respond. You go up and place your order and get your drinks but they are quite helpful and attentive stillThe only reason a star is missing as not enough seating during crowded times, we got the last table.One time I got drunk at a wedding and had a crêpe. It was good and only filled with a mild amount of shame. From then on, I've been on the hunt for crepes. Luckily, located in what's quickly becoming my favorite shopping center, Crepe Expectations specializes in the craft. While the place is small (maybe 8 tables?), their menu boasts 23 ways you can eat this thinny pancake. I scooped up The Sunday Morning (scrambled eggs, seasoned potatoes, jack cheese and bacon added) and it was way better than expected. These things are large and the perfect size for lunch. With flavored waters and a side salad included, this is solid deal for under $8. Def worth a try for a croob (crêpe noob) or crêxpert (you get it).Items Selected:The Elvis - Caramel, Banana, Peanut Butter, BaconThe Avalon - Buttered Pears, Goat Cheese, Candied Walnuts, HoneyThe Greek - Grilled Chicken, Spinach, Feta, Tzatziki Yogurt, Red Onion, TomatoAlready planning to be in the area early Saturday morning, finding a breakfast buddy would prove an easy task and trusting the Henderson local despite the truly lame "Yum" menu and "Have a crepe day" voicemail I walked into Crepe Expectations with an open mind; the result an hour of gregarious service, great conversation, and some truly Parisian quality crepes.  A bit of an odd space, dim lighting and dark wood beneath big screen televisions orders are placed at the counter and arriving just as the restaurant opened our order of three thin pancakes was expedited on the open kitchen's three stones with each arriving soft on the interior with the slightest browning adding textbook chew enveloping bold, balanced ingredients.  With prices a bit higher than the majority of creperies Stateside or abroad but service and ingredient quality equally elevated it was with a sweet, a savory, and a special that our morning passed and although my tastes veered toward the complexity of the Avalon it would be hard to argue against the Elvis or the Greek, the former pure decadence with added whipped cream and the later finding balance for the slightly oversalted chicken in the punchy yogurt.

Review Text :
7/6/11Arrived early for the OYE party at bld, so I decided to check out their happy hour.  It's a good thing I did, too, bec. the margarita I had here (priced $3 on the menu card, but I was charged $3.50) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bld-chandler?select=-iHx38oezn6KQER2Aw8ytQ#-iHx38oezn6KQER2Aw8ytQ was one of the beverage highlights of the evening!  The meatball mac 'n cheese, however, needs a tweak-- while I enjoyed the mac 'n cheese portion of the dish, I found the meatballs and sauce to be too acidic. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bld-chandler?select=UFsIK9G_6MZxb-GvezRedA#UFsIK9G_6MZxb-GvezRedA  If I wasn't trying to slow down my body's absorption of alcohol (I'd just gotten a massage before, too, so circulation was revved up!), I wouldn't have eaten as much as did, and I left more than half in the bowl.Still, what I had tried was enough to keep my mind open for more happy hour adventures here.  Take a look at the interesting HH food menu!I cannot believe I have forgotten to review BLD!I am definitely a regular here. I'll start with Breakfast...My boyfriend and I eat here at least once a week for breakfast. He always orders the Green Chili Tostada and the few bites I've had were delicious!! I have ordered many things...the open faced sandwich is delightful, the waffle has bacon in the middle, the short rib eggs bene and the breakfast burrito. I normally go back to the waffle because it is so good! I don't normally eats sweets but the bacon with syrup is prefect and for $5 (if you order the waffle as a side) is a great deal!Lunch is another time of day you can find me at BLD. I love taking clients there and the food is always spot on. You must get the Prosciutto & Fried Goat Cheese salad. SOOOO GOOD! I can't really order anything else...Happy Hour is one of the best around. Great prices with unique food options (no chicken wings and potato skins here). Get the Ahi (See pic). Trust me!Had dinner here the other night and our server suggested the Braised Short Rib Pasta. It was unbelievable in a prefect Pesto sauce (see pic).The patio is beautiful and allows dogs. They actually have a dog dinner availble for your pooch.GO HERE ANYTIME. You won't regret it and say "hi", I'll probably be there.Here's the thing.  We're pretty big fans of Cork, so when we learned about BLD we were super excited to go.  Sadly, our first experience was really bad.  Because we loved Cork so much we decided not to write a review until we had gone a 2nd time.  Could be a fluke, right?  Wrong.  Here's the breakdown.Visit 1:1. We received chicken that was still releasing pink (not clear) liquids.  When we asked them to give us new chicken the server literally asked "oh, you want that more well done?" as if there is another way to serve chicken.2. After getting the chicken back we found that they didn't actually replate the dish, they just put new chicken on it.  So if the pink liquid did contain any bacteria it was definitely still there.3. Both my husband and I had some pretty terrible "digestion issues" that I wont go into detail on.4. The servers seemed genetically engineered to avoid their tables.  In the 2 hours we were there I'd say we saw our server three times.Visit 2:1. The service was a bit better today but...2. Both my husband, myself, and a 3rd guest had "Bridesmaids" style reactions to the food within a few hours of our visit.  I'm talking total upper and/or lower GI evacuation. Both visits I'd say cost roughly $30 per person and we ended up sick and annoyed.I will never return.BLD is the one place in Chandler that I really want to like, but after three visits, I just give up. They have a great-looking menu, a hip-kinda vibe, and all the promise in the world. And that's where it ends.A disinterested hostess will invariably seat you in the one table you'd least prefer. Near the kitchen entrance. Near an angry baby. Whatever.Next, one of several equally disinterested servers will arrive to take your drink order and by the time you've worked up a good thirst, drinks will arrive. If you're lucky, it'll be the drinks you actually ordered. If you're really lucky, they'll be good.The one saving grace on the breakfast menu is the Monte Cristo. A+, seriously. Everything else is average, despite how it reads on the overpromising menu. And don't worry about the prices: just pretend you're in Scottsdale or, say, Midtown Manhattan, for the entire meal. If you remember you're in Chandler, you'll just get angry.Like the breakfast menu, the lunch menu equally overpromises, but that's okay, because you'll wait just as long to receive your food. If it's not over or undercooked, you might as well just dig in and not think about how much you overpaid for a sub-par meal.BLD looks and act like they want to be a BFD (big friggin' deal) but they need to start caring about both their customers and their food first. A good menu doesn't make a good restaurant if you don't deliver the goods.Brunch: Making morning binge drinking seem classy since forever.I woke up this morning, checked my texts, and suddenly I'm at brunch with the guys and a boy [the cutest 4-month old baby boy at that!].  Everybody ordered their food, some bussers knocked over a huge trashcan, and suddenly champagne bottles were rolling across the floor.  Surprisingly, the baby doesn't cry.  Phew.  Our hostess was pretty unfriendly but the waitress was a peach!I had ordered The Cali Eggs Benedict [bacon, grilled tomato, avocado, topped with hollandaise, and includes breakfast potatoes.  $12.25] and it was alright.  The hollandaise was creamy and smooth but lacking that lemon juice tangy tartness.  Still though, those eggs were poached beautifully.  The bacon was also pretty fantabulous and cooked perfectly.  As for a random wedge of avocado on the side, it kind of felt like they forgot to put the avocados on top and just stuck it there.  Oh well.  The bites I had of the House Made Biscuits and Sausage Gravy [two eggs, apple wood smoked bacon with breakfast potatoes.  $12.75] were super flavorful.  You can tastes the fat in that sausage gravy.  I can see myself gaining 5lbs just eating that.  Oh man.  As for breakfast potatoes, there's not much you can say about them.  They're crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and needed some ketchup love.Overall, I had a decent brunch with great company.  Perhaps with all my attention on making faces at the baby, my meal wasn't too note-worthy.  I wouldn't mind coming back for brunch though!

Restaurant name  Tacos El Gordo
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Alright! Everyone is a winner when Tacos El Gordo opens up a new location on the strip. Whether you're a tourist, drunk late at night, a poor college student, or just simply looking for a quick and affordable meal. Actually if you're staying at a casino on Tropicana and walking is your means of transportation then.. sorry, sucks to be you, but at least you have Earl of Sandwich at the Planet Hollywood. HOWEVERRR if you're a beast and can walk 4 blocks or so in triple digit heat then you indulge yourself by all means.Why I love Tacos El Gordo:1. Corn tortillas that are slightly fried before you get them2. The asada is cooked when you order it (or at least in my experiences). That deserves a high five.3. ALL-YOU-CAN-DRINK HORCHATA for $1.40? Don't mind if I do.4. The spicy pork shawarma (adobada) looking thing, most definitely the star of the establishment. There is a slice of pineapple sitting on top of it, leaking all of its delicious juices into the delicious spicy pork. Plus you get a slice on pineapple added to the taco. 5. Plenty of meat is given, along with the onions, peppers, and green sauce (I'm not sure if its guacamole or not). 6. The bathroom is CLEAN! Be honest, you know how most cheap eats don't have the cleanest bathroom.They also have beef head (Cabeza), beef tongue (lengua), and tripe I believe. No chicken just in case you're wondering. Lastly aside from the tacos they have asada or adobada fries ($10), tortas ($4), and quesadillas ($4). All the essentials to a drunk meal.Random note: 3 tacos @ $2.00 each plus one drink comes out to be $7.99 after taxI've been searching for a new "go-to" taco place since Los Parados on W. Sahara closed a while back.  Their al pastor was one of the best things I've had in LV and seeing the Yelp pics of Tacos El Gordo's adobada on the spit posted had me salivating in front of my laptop.  Must. Go. ASAP!We ordered 4 adobada, 1 carne asada and 1 beef tongue.  We really liked everything except the tongue.  Maybe it was just our mood that day?  I was freaking starving so I was ready for more.  As soon as I'm about to speak to the guy manning the adobada, he grins and asks "How many more do you want?".  I'm sure this happens every 10 minutes there.I got 2 more adobada along with a brain taco.  The guy automatically perked up when I ordered brain.  The person in charge of the internal organ taco dept went to work digging out some to chop up and put in a corn tortilla.  They also assumed it was my first time trying it.  They assumed right!It wasn't bad although I didn't love it either.  It was like a beef pate with a lobstery taste to it.  Not ready to order another the next day but we're glad we tried one.     I might be in the minority of reviewers eating here while sober.  I definitely see how this place would be even better when you're loaded like a freight train at 5am.  Certainly look forward to when I am here in that condition.Sorry to all of the people who rave about this place, but it's exceedingly overhyped. I was actually really looking forward to this place and had high expectation for what was popular which was the adobada and carne asada. Since there was 2 lines to order, I told porky to wait in the asada line while I wait in the adobada line. I made the big mistake of trying to make an order to a wab without porky there. I asked for a big adobada fries without cilantro and he replied OK. I waited there for about 10 mins....My bf already got his order and finally, he asked the wab where my order was in spanish and he replied that I never made an order with him, putting the blame on me, and trying to make me look stupid.. gtfo -_- I finally got my fries and I went up to the cashier. Without realizing it, the cashier girl gave me an attitude and my bf had to defend me telling them that I'm paying for the fries and he's paying for the tacos since I don't know spanish and I didn't understand the situation. how RUDE! I do not appreciate the fact that I was being put down for not understanding any spanish when we are in a country that English is the primary language, especially from people who sound like they don't even have their citizenships!! *slam fists*In any case, on to the food. I looked at my food and I specifically asked for no cilantro, and of course they would fuck it up by leaving little pieces of it all over our food. I don't mind the cilantro but porky hates it. -1 point there for making me put the effort of playing hide and seek with the cilantros. The carne asada was ok. The meat was tender and juicy but bland. The only thing you could really taste in it was the guacamole since they slapped on a handful of it on the taco. The adobada tacos had no flavor whatsoever. I read that there was some pineapples sliced in it, the sauce was amazing but I did not taste anything on that taco. The best ones I have had was the stomach and the shoulder. I should have fought porky more for the brain, tongue, and head tacos since they were all cooked in the same way as the shoulder and stomach, but I gave in since porky was so adamant about not trying anything else. Never again will I let his closed mind affect my choices in food! Anyways, the fries were awesome! I love the sauce in it and the fries were the thin and crispy ones, not those disgusting steak fries. I just wish I got the carne asada instead because the adobada was flavorless and dry.Anyways, I really want to like this place because I want to come back and try the other tacos, quesadilla, and tostada but I wouldn't want to come back here by choice because of the rude workers and there's nothing really special about their popular stuff. 2 stars for their stomach and shoulder tacos and fries!One of THE BEST carne asada tacos I have ever had, hands down.  The juices and everything about this taco is worth every penny.  I usually get mines with no avocado, since most of the time they usually put a spoonful of avocado & i really dont need to taste that much avocado in one sitting.Not only do i order the carne asada tacos, but also the carne asada fries. The carne asada fries can either come in half ($5) or a large order ($10). I ordered the half ordered and OHHH GEEZ it was pretty BIG! I couldnt even finish it, it was good but not THAT good. Needless to say, I could always come back to this taco eatery. Yumm yummI finally made it to Tacos El Gordo after hearing rave reviews about it for ages. The place was pretty empty, but service was fast and efficient. I ordered one adobada taco and one carne asada taco to go. They were pretty small and they packaged them on tiny paper plates and wrapped them in foil. Not the best form of packaging I've ever seen and definitely not cost efficient for them, but I assume most people eat them there.Everyone always raves about how cheap this place is, and it is for the most part, but for the price I felt they skimped a bit on the meat and filling. They were definitely tasty and I really enjoyed the flavor of the adobada. Nicely balanced heat and sweetness. The carne asada was good too, albeit a little on the dry side. The condiments definitely enhanced the flavor of these for me. I'm a big fan of the adobado and I'll definitely be back again to pick these babies up next time.This place is the real deal y'all.  If you're like me and want a couple of tacos or maybe even a burrito to end your night then there is no better place in Vegas than El Gordo.  My mouth is literally watering as I type...I have seen this place popping up on yelp and decided to look through the reviews and pictures. I was happy to learn about the 2 separate lines since I would be wanting both asada and adobada and thanks to Nelson Q's picture that I can add pineapple to my taco.The seating inside this location is limited. They have 2 tent type things outside were you can eat. If my memory isn't too foggy this location used to be a taco bell when I was a teenager. The car clubs would hang out in this parking lot and drink etc. Well, the parking lot being ghetto fabulous hasn't changed a bit. Maybe more ghetto then anything. The inside was kinda chaotic. I know it is on the strip so a lot of tourists especially drunk ones are going to want some of these $2.00 crack tacos. They are addicting and delicious! I like that I can get adobada tacos on either side. They have more then one line for the same thing since they get so busy at times.There is a parking lot so if you can find a spot then you can just go back and eat in your car if you can't find a spot at the tables.THIS IS A GEM OF A FIND ON THE STRIP!Once you are all buffet'd out and are looking to save money without sacrificing quality, then this is your spot! It's perfect walking distance from the Riviera and the Wynn. These guys are open late into the early hours especially on fridays and saturdays. They have some booths inside but most of the seating is located outside in two decent sized tents which you cant miss if you're driving by on the street. On cold nights they have those gas powered heating elements for those of you that think Vegas doesnt get that cold.The parking is decent and on some nights you have street racers meeting up here just to hang out. Im suprised this location doesnt have an armed security guard like the Charleston location.As for the food, the three most popular items that I usually get here are the El Pastor tacos, Carne Asada tacos, and the Adobado Fries. The tacos are 2 bucks a pop and the Adobado Fries are 5 bucks for the half order and 10 bucks for a large order (the half order is virtually a meal in itself!). You have the option of having everything on your tacos and fries at no extra charge. These are the guacomole sauce, onions, and cilantro for your tacos. For the fries you can get sour cream, guacomole, and extra cheese. You can even ask for grilled green onions and jalapenos on the side. Also you can have them put grilled pineapple bits as well, BUT YOU HAVE TO SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR THESE so if you dont than they will not give it to you. That's why I love these guys, no extra charge for all those mentioned above.I also like this place better simply because of the fact that they have TWO service stations meaning they have twice the amount of food servers and cashiers (yes they take cards and there is no minimum) which equals faster service although on really busy nights you cant tell. Plus, it seems that they speak better english here than the other location. http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-gordo-las-vegasIf you are up for it, there is another place that serves an even better El Pastor. They are a couple miles away on Charleston just down the street from the other Tacos El Gordo. They are called Taqueria El Pastorcito. When you go East on Charleston, look for the trailer with the bright lights on the left side of the street just right before Los Tacos on the right side.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-el-pastorcito-las-vegas#query:Tacos%20El%20Pastorcito$2 dollar tacos on the strip? AWESOME!!! I tried to place recently due to the rave reviews on yelp. I was pleasantly surprised! I come from Los Angeles, and know all about "King Taco" and "El Taurino" and been to taco places in Mexico itself. I would say this place is in the same category as "El Taurino" if not better. Their Adobada (spicy pork different from Al Pastor style) with everything on it, is my favorite! I can eat 6 of these easily lol. I tried the "Taco el Lengua" (cow tongue) and was thrown off a bit. (I love cow tongue in Japanese and Korean BBQ) but the taco version is a little... well tastes like a mushy tongue lol. I wouldn't order that again.Avoid this place on Friday nights and Saturday nights unless you want to deal with dozens if not a hundred drunk loud clubbers who are literally throwing up outside in the parking lot... :( Also their "Horchata" and other mexican drinks are not made fresh or from scratch.  (kind of a bummer really), they use the mixed syrup machine dispensers. I guess I'm spoiled because where I come from the Horchata is always made fresh daily.This is my go to spot for late night tacos after work. If you are just visiting, I definitely recommend this place if you are a taco lover such as myself.Oh my goodness....THIS...is freaking amazing!!!! Pretty much every review below mine has covered everything. From the price, the flavoring and taste of these tacos....I know I'll be addicted to these. I've already gone twice in the past week alone.Street tacos to the max! Small in size but packed with flavoring.This is located on the Las Vegas Strip, so all your drunk tourists can stop by here after a night of drunken nightclubbing and sober up with these tacos.For you So Cali peeps: You know King Taco? Yeah...that infamous place with bombass carne asada tacos. Well....TACOS EL GORDO is giving King Taco a run for its money. Maybe this surpasses King Taco. Who knows? I'll let you decide. So if you had KT before, you got to try these tacos out!!!!!! These won't disappoint, I promise.BEST TACO EVER! Adobada Pork!Ask for extra salsa. Ask for the plate of veggies.EVEN BETTER WHEN DRUNK!Right next to the Wynn. They had live music at around 2am...!So SooooooOOOOooo GOOOOD!-Give it a try!This spot seems like one of the best deals on the entire strip, and with all the great reviews, how can you pass this place up?After a day spent strolling around aimlessly, it was time. Time to eat. It's been a bookmark for a while now and decided we'd make a stop this time through town. We were passing right by it - so why not?The lines were kinda hectic, at first I wasn't sure what to make of it, but after a minute, I saw that there were about 8 lines for ordering your food; direct from the kitchen staff. Watch them cook up your order, then take it to the register to pay. Pretty simple once you realize how it works. Finding a place to sit and eat on the other hand, was a challenge. Five minutes of hovering around the tables, and a spot finally opened up - this place is packed with customers enjoying their meals.The Carne Asada tacos were excellent, but the disappointer here were the Adobada (spicy pork) fries. Usually a fan of pulled or shredded pork dishes, the Carne Asada would have likely been the better choice to top that huge mound of (half sized) fries; I certainly am glad the lady and I didn't order the large. The pork was good, just not awesome or over the top delicious - I'll plan to stick to the Carne Asada if I stop in again.With four tacos, a (half) order of fries, and a coke our bill came to about $15 - I dare you to try and find that anywhere else on the strip for less than $30. If you do, please let me know - I'm always down for some tasty tacos.Happy Yelping!WHY DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE SOONER???What's wrong with me! I'm usually on top of these things, and I've been missing out this entire time. During my trips to Vegas, I spend most of my time at Encore and for the longest time I did not know about Tacos El Gordo. The boyfriend heard from a friend about this place, because it was one of his favorite places in Vegas in terms of food. ARE WE AT THE ZOO?The boyfriend and I came during lunch, and the place was a zoo!!! Where to order your food may be quite confusing at first, but if you look there are signs at each station that tell you what they're making. So, you just go to the correct station and tell them what you want, and they'll make it for you. While we were waiting for our tacos, I noticed an employee wiping the stainless steel walls by the grill stations down with a towel. Then my eyes started to wander around the entire kitchen, and I noticed that the ENTIRE KITCHEN WAS SPOTLESS! Holy crap!! This place was clean as hell, which means NO DIARRHEA. YES!!!After we were given all the food we ordered, we walked over to one of the two cashier stations to pay for the food. Yes, so you get your food first and then bring your tray to a cashier where they will ring you up. This is where you can order your drinks. OUTDOOR SEATINGWith the number of people inside, I was surprised that there was a good number of tables available. I was expecting the table and seats to be filled with leftover food from the people who previously sat there, BUT there was nothing. Again, spotless! The tables are sitting under a big tent, so don't worry about birds crapping on your head or trying to steal your food. LUNCH IS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE DAYBetween the boyfriend and I, we had one spicy pork taco, 3 carne asada tacos and one half order of their carne asada fries. I've been to so many taco trucks and taquerias in San Francisco, and usually the dirtier the place the better it tastes. But Tacos El Gordo was clean, and it tasted even better than most of the taco trucks and taquerias I've been to in SF!! =X CONCLUSIONLike I said many times in this review, and I'll say it again, this place is very clean. Even their stainless steel garbage cans sitting outside are clean, not a spot to be found! With that being said, if you're afraid of getting mud butt, Hersey squirts, bubble guts, the runs or whatever else you want to call it, because you've eaten dirty tacos from a dirty taco truck or taqueria, you won't have to worry here! You can get the same delicious tacos without worrying about having the run to the bathroom later. Haha, that sounded like a commercial. Anyways, I'll definitely be coming back for more tacos in the future. I love tacos, and I love that there is a legit place on The Strip I can go to, to get it! :) I want a taco now.EGG-cellent inebriated location for those late night munchies. I had Tacos El Gordo in San Diego...and they were absolutely delicious...and I was sober. One can only imagine how much more I would have enjoyed them if I werent sober.So remember this...It has been a long and fun night of fist pumping to insane EDM music...your drunk because for some reason your liver thinks its a god in vegas...you dont want to travel far becuase your lazy...and you dont want to overpay because your cheap. So where do you go?TACOS EL GORDO is your solution!-TACOS EL GORDOs is probably the best tacos in Vegas-TACOS EL GORDOs is as authentic as it gets-large variety of proteins to choose from-closes late!-located at the end of the strip-taste absolutely amazing...especially when drunk-cheap!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!UNTIL THEN!! ^-^Tacos El Gordo is the only place to go for real authentic tasting tacos at very affordable prices!  Located right on the strip, this is a very popular spot and is usually very busy.  They have a tasty selection of food to choose from.  I ordered the Tacos Adobada (spicy pork) and Tacos Asada along with a Sope Asada .  The Tacos Adobada was sooo mouth watering delicious! The pork was so tender and the salsa sauce was flavorful.  The Asada tacos and Sope were really good too, but the Adobada was the winner.When it is crowded (which is usually all the time) ordering can be a little confusing, especially if it's your first time. They have several counters where the meat is prepared.  Above the counters are the menus the items you can order from that counter. You pick up a tray go to the counter and place your order. They prepare the food in front of you. While at the counter you can also order grilled jalapenos and green onions. Very yummy.  After you visited the counters you go to the register to pay and also order any drinks.   Then you find a place to sit and enjoy. There is also a salsa cart with a variety of salsas fresh radishes, and limes. They offer free refills on the fountain drinks.  The inside seating is limited, but they also offer outside seating as well. Family owned straight out of Tijuana! They keep the prices affordable, $2 tacos! So please don't forget to Tip!! If you like the authentic feel and taste of a real taqueria, then Tacos El Gordo is a must stop when visiting Las Vegas!Where can you get authentic, fast, cheap tacos in Vegas? TACOS EL GORDO. There's one on charleston, but this review is for the one on las vegas blvd.Typically $2 tacos for a variety of meats: cabeza, lengua, adobada, and many more incarnations. Sad thing is I've waited so long to have amazing, real tacos until I've been introduced. Been here many times since then. WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU'RE A TACOS EL GORDO VIRGIN/TOURIST: Standing around awkwardly trying to figure out where to order. HOW TO ORDER: It's simple: one line for all other meat (cabeza, lengua etc.). One line for adobada (at least at this location). I believe they have more lines open to order, but I've come here a few times when it was just two lines. To those griping about the format of the lines, get over it. It's understandable that you want instant gratification and to get all your tacos at once, but the food comes out quick enough. If anything it's a bit more efficient. If you come with at least one other person (and chances are you're here with someone else) here's an idea: have one person stay in one line for a type of taco, and another person in another line waiting for the other tacos. Simple. Meet up at the register to pay for your tray. For $2 tacos and this delicious AND on the STRIP (lots of overpriced food places on the strip), it's not all that bad. You're free to try swankier places on the strip if you're that peeved. PERFECT FOR: Drunk people! Tipsy people! People-watchers! Night owls! Broke people! You might get a heart-attack if you ate here everyday, but you cannot beat the prices and the prime location. It does get super busy, but luckily, it's got late-night hours for that after-club/after-party bite. FOOD: The adobada tacos are deliciously marinated. It's fun watch it turn spit-style on a pineapple as it's being sliced for you. Flavorful, fattening, quick, and cheap. They don't skimp on the tacos either. Loaded with marinated meat, lettuce, tomatoes..my mouth is watering just remembering it. Carne asada fries are disappointing, yet still tasty for me. Crackly, torn adobada instead of soft mixed with guacamole and green sauce loaded (key word: LOADED) with cheese, sour cream, and fries. Nothing too special, but very filling and good for sharing. Wished it had more guacamole and green sauce. Might be a miss for some people. VERDICT: For the price you can't beat it. For the flavor, it's some of the best tacos in town. Overrated? Yeah. Best tacos ever? No, but it's better than Roberto's or a taco bell. This place has performed consistently for me that it's always perfectly moist, flavorful, rich meat. For others, the rush hour and lines might throw some off. Not a bad place for tourists and locals alike to try out for late night eats.Oh Tacos El Gordo. Really sucks that you're located on Las Vegas Blvd where every tourist and their mom wants to try your delicious tacos. And it also sucks that you have bad air circulation, barely any AC, and barely any place to park. However, your tacos are the boooommbbb diggity and this is why you deserve all the stars. Nothing about the food needs to be changed... the adobada, lengua, and tripa tacos are all seasoned perfectly and melt-in-you-mouth and I would recommend them to anyone. What you do need to change is the ordering process. Long lines with bad air circulation and sweaty people do not make for happy customers such as myself. Thus, because of this I will not be coming back.Vile. You steered me wrong, Yelp.  El Taco Gordo is disgusting.  You show up and there's a giant flat-top griddle.  You have to go to a different station for each meat you order.  (Annoying.)My asada ("steak," in theory) tasted like little gristly chicklets of shoe leather.  I spent the rest of my night cradling my stomach in agony.   AVOID AT ALL COSTS.--------------------------------------------------IMPORTANT NOTICE:--------------------------------------------------THIS LOCATION HAS CLOSED DOWN. I just walked over an hour ago hoping to get an adobada (spicy pork with pineapple) taco, but l left empty-handed.Go to the one in Downtown if you still wanna go!I'm so behind in reviews that I never got around to reviewing Tacos El Gordo before they closed this location. Well, I just wanted to say that while the food was okay, the dining experience as a whole was rather forgetful.First, what is the reason for having multiple lines for different kinds of meat? It makes zero sense to me. The lines are slow and you can forget about getting multiple meats if you come alone. Luckily, I was able to try several meats because we got in different lines. We waited over an hour at the two popular lines but there were other lines that had much less people. Why don't they make things more efficient and let people order any meat at any of the stations?The adobada, which is the meat they're known here wasn't all that interesting to me. I don't understand why everyone is crazy about this red pork. Don't forget to ask for the slices of pineapple off the top of their spit. You can also ask for the grilled veggies and peppers with your tacos. Out of adobada, asada, cabeza, and lengua, I liked their lengua the most. It was probably one of the best lengua tacos I've had, actually. Unfortunately, I didn't think much of their sauces.Even though the tacos weren't bad or anything, the whole waiting in line forever and having different lines for different types of meat marred the overall experience here. It was very difficult finding a table to eat at as well. Hopefully some of these issues were particular to this location. I'm hopeful that I'll have a better experience at one of their other locations.

First sign of a good restaurant: I wanted everything on the menu because it looked so good!Second sing of a good restaurant: Everything on the menu actually turns out to be great!Look closely for this place, because in the dark, you can easily pass it by.  It's totally adorable inside, and come to find out it's actually registered a historic landmark.  Makes it even quirkier!  The owner is super friendly and helped us pick out some awesome menu choices, being our first time there.  As soon as she said she had just cooked the ribs, for the rib taco's, I was in BBQ heaven!  I also chose the brisket taco, from reading all the other reviews, it seemed like the smart thing to do.  Both were incredibly tasty, with the fantastic BBQ marinade.  I was more into the rib taco than the brisket, but both were awesome.  I was also torn by the sides, because they all looked so yummy!  I decided to get the Jalapeno Apple Coleslaw. I love coleslaw, but it's one of those sides you can very often get wrong.  Too much mayo, not enough mayo, not enough vinegar, too much vinegar, etc.  This was perfectly marinated with a touch of vinegar and mayo and delicious apple slices mixed in.  I also sampled my friends white cheddar mac n' cheese.  WOW.  Obvious next time side item for me, it's incredible!  A couple things to remember:  It's BYOB, so bring it!  CASH ONLY. Also, they're only open until 7pm mon-wed, so make sure you're in before then.  She was nice enough to serve us and not kick us out...and was very nice all the while.  She even brought a sample of this delish cantaloupe drink, get that too on your trip out, because you must stop in!Holy SMOKE!    First up in the list of wonderfulness to be experienced is the service.  I'd called ahead to check whether or not corn tortillas were available to accommodate my gluten issues. I was lucky enough to have my first opportunity to talk with Nelda, the wife half of the Smoke duo.  Nelda said she'd be happy to set some homemade ones aside from breakfast service for me....just let her know when I get there and she'd take care of everything.  And she did.  Warmly.  With Nelda's help, we built a couple of tacos without any gluten problems at all. The brisket.  Everything you've read here about the brisket is true.  THE BEST BRISKET IN THE CITY!!!  Mine came with avocado cream, pickled onions and fresno hot sauce instead of the porter bbq sauce (porter = beer = verbotten gluten).  I can't imagine anything being better than the smoky, creamy, spicy taco that was created.  I didn't stop there, I also had one of the new tacos...the Chicken, Apple, cheddar, smoked jalapeno mayo and house cured and smoked bacon taco!  Loved it.  It made my taste buds dance!  My husband really enjoyed the Philly taco....brisket, onions, hot peppers and a sharp white cheddar sauce.  I wasn't able to sample it, but he was a very happy camper!  He agreed it was the best brisket anywhere.  He enjoyed the mac and cheese while I enjoyed the apple jalapeno slaw...both measured up to the tacos....outstanding!  The horchata was sweet, spicy with cinnamon and delish....I think a shot of spiced rum would be an awesome addition.  And since SMOKE is byob, you could do that!  The hubby - as cautious as he is about new tastes - enjoyed his agua fresca - a strawberry version - quite well.  Again, maybe a shot of tequila would take it over the top?Our SMOKE break on way to Kennywood Christmas on Saturday evening. was one that will be repeated....often  We can't wait to go back and give everything on the menu a try.  Next time...breakfast at SMOKE!  One last thing...SMOKE has not only the best brisket in Pittsburgh, SMOKE has the BEST TACOS IN PITTSBURGH!!!!

This café is the reason I like to wander backstreets for hours on end, because when you find a gem like this, all those hours are worth it. Every single one. The only thing, literally, the *one* thing that makes me not want to yelp this place, is that I'm afraid I won't get  the owner's undivided attention when I go back and it's packed. So I sat down in the dining room, completely alone. Some Ben Harper came on and the chef/owner/waiter handed me a menu. He asked me what I was in the mood for and I rattled off random thoughts (filling but not heavy and a little spice perhaps?)...I ended up getting a cranberry sausage dish smothered in a sweet sauce with hits of cayenne and topped with brie. I know, I know, food porn. It was even better than it sounds. Not one flavor was overpowering so every bite was a perfectly balanced little world.The owner hung out with me after cooking and we talked about his travels (roasted goat in Africa is where it's at!) and future menu plans (gorgonzola cheese cake topped with bacon!). We agreed that if the world ever runs out of bacon you can throw us in the river because who wants to live without the sweetest of all meats? Everything (including an ice tea) was under $15. The menu is probably best classified as "New American" or "Modern American."It was nice (it was better than nice, it was awesome) to find real foodie dishes being served in a relaxed atmosphere where I felt comfortable walking in off the street in my lazy Sunday clothes. And next time I'm getting the deep friend gnocchi because that's so genius it can't be ignored.Talk about off the beaten path!  The place is in Lawrenceville nestled between houses off Butler St.  But once you walk in, it's an adorable little cafe with tiny homemade Kaleidscopes on the tables and giant colorful triangles all over the walls and ceiling.The menu was actually larger than I thought for lunch with salads, sammies and main dishes like pasta (surprisingly a lot of pasta's actually!).  The people next to us had a huge dish of pasta that looked good, but the fries the other person had smelled even better!  So I opted for the Veggie sammie and fries.  The veggies were eggplant, zucchini and a portobella cap.  The bun was so good!  It was fresh and soft.  I hate when sammies are served on sour dough because, number one, I don't like sour dough, but number two, it's hard to eat!  The fries were just as awesome as they smelled, nice thick cut and crispy!  So the veggies totally canceled out the fat in the fries, right?!Ever since I first found Kaleidoscope Cafe two years ago when I was looking for dinner in Lawrenceville and they couldn't seat me, I've been wanting to come back and try it out.  When I saw that they were participating in PGH Restaurant Week, I made a reservation for Fri. evening at 6:30 for CM and I to ensure that this time, I'd be able to try their unique culinary offerings.  Because of the PGH Restaurant Week promotion, CM and I ordered more than we usually would, so we were able to try a good portion of the menu.  We ordered the following: Deep-fried gnocchi (shared), Kaleidoscope salad (CM), autumn harvest salad (me), miso glazed salmon with risotto (CM), chicken cherry pot pie (me), and flourless chocolate torte (shared).  Additionally, the chef included a complimentary serving of pita bread with pineapple-mango (?) infused butter.In general, I was quite impressed with the flavors and quality of the dishes that we ordered.  The deep-fried gnocchi was quite unique, and the marinara sauce that accompanied it was tasty--Darren W.'s description of this dish is very apt.  The bright, citrusy notes of the butter made for a wonderful accompaniment to the pita bread, with a mouthwatering sweet-salty balance.  The salads both had a nice variety of flavors and textures, and were quite fresh and pleasant.  Unfortunately, the Kaleidoscope salad was missing avocado due to a kitchen shortage, so it wasn't as texturally balanced as it would have been, even though CM subbed in walnuts.  Although a bit small, the flourless chocolate torte was rich, smooth, and creamy, and was one of the best renditions I've tasted.For my entree, I was originally planning to order the sweet potato tagliatelle per another Yelper's recommendation, but the chicken cherry pot pie also captured my interest, so I asked my waitress which dish she'd recommend. Without hesitation, she recommended the pot pie, so I decided to order it instead. In terms of diameter, this was the largest chicken pot pie I've ever eaten at about 10," and it was quite tall as well, due to a light-as-air puff pastry top. While it was delicious and unique, the overall flavor turned out to be a bit sweeter than I'd have liked due to the cherries in the filling.  CM's salmon, on the other hand, had a great balance of savory flavors and textures, and was more to my taste.Aside from the food, service was on point, with dishes being served and cleared at a perfect pace, and attentiveness to our needs.  The one disappointment was that the chef didn't come out to greet us--it's my understanding that he usually does this, and I saw him do it for the next table over as we were waiting for our entrees, so perhaps he was too busy (?).  I really enjoyed the decor and the intimate setting, as well.Overall, despite a few small hiccups, CM and I had a wonderful dinner at Kaleidoscope, and enjoyed sampling the menu.  Our check came to $63, which I felt was very reasonable, given the amount of food that we received. I'd highly recommend Kaleidoscope to anyone looking for a cozy, intimate, and delicious dinner in L-ville, especially for dates. 4.5 stars.

What in the hell is there not to like about this restaurant?  Listen, for $10, $10 measly dollars I could bum up from strangers outside of CVS within an hour, I can get a three course meal during lunch.  Instead of going to the movies, you can redirect that money and come to Technique and get shrimp risotto, halibut and chocolate mousse for dessert.  Or, if you would prefer, you can get a caprese salad with fried mozzarella, a sandwich with handcut fries and housemade mayonaise and a caramel creme dessert.I might complain about my food taking a bit too long in the kitchen, but "might" is a distinct impossibility and in a world where I would make such a complaint, gravity makes things fall up, cats drink purple and I'm a complete bastard.  It's time consuming, but it's inexpensive and the food that you get is legitimately delicious.What a great way to enjoy excellent food.  You must put this place on your must eat here list.  I really enjoyed the dinner service and so did everyone at my table.  Imagine great plating, excellent choices of protein, a starter, and a dessert.  This is what you will get here and on a shoestring budget.  At only $16 per person for dinner service this is an excellent value.  If you must spend more, bottles of wine, by the glass, cocktails, and beer can be had as well. I still am in shock at the bill, it was literally nothing for the 3 courses of food provided.  Bread is also part of the meal, which was quickly devoured by myself and my guests.  With 3 types of butter to sample and enough fresh bread just to get you excited for the meal to come.  I enjoyed the pork belly starter and also sampled the pizza starter by one of my guests.  Truly excellent pork belly and the pizza had fresh mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes. The tomatoes had a nice sweetness to them.  I would personally pick the pork belly again or try the scallops for a starter next time.  I assume the menu changes every month so get down there if you want to sample the same dishes. :)For the main course I chose the flat iron steak.  It was a  great dish and no steak knife was provided.  No worries, the butter knife provided cut the meat well with no effort.  Looking for a flavorful steak? Try it here, I was most impressed and yes I eat it rare plus.  I would never cook it rare plus at home, but I am always excited to try it at a restaurant.  Finally the dessert course.  We all were full at this point.  However we must not let the sour cream ice cream go to waste.  Yes the most delicious part of the desert, yes the hazelnut chocolate was rich and very good, but the ice cream was different.  That difference will bring us back.  We could eat the ice cream without anything else.If you did not know this it is a school and most likely you will get waiters, waitresses, and I assume even the chefs are students.  Not a bad idea and most likely the wait staff and chef is trying to do their best.   Also this is a nice restaurant and reminded me of typical fine dinning.  The only thing I will request for next time is a window seat.  It would be great to be by the huge glass windows at night during dinner.  Give them a call and set up a reservation.   Hope you have the opportunity to enjoy dinner here, cheers.

Amazing meal.  The dishes were inventive without being cloying or overly complicated. We had six seafood dishes each better than the last. They were all light but filling. I loved the tuna tartar, hamachi, and scallops min particular. Great atmosphere and service as well. Not cheap but worth it!

This was a good week for food.Great Mexican food, I think I'm swayed by free salsa and chips. For a place that isn't really conducive to sitting down and eating (seems less like a restaurant and more like a takeout) I was surprised by the presentation of the food as well as the pleasant service.  It had all the benefits of being a quick to go restaurant and a proper sit down. +Speedy +Cheap+Huge portions to last for days+Pleasant staff +Complementary chips and salsa (really got me) +Relatively Clean and Quiet +Convenient Nothing to hate.When anyone asks about Mexican food in the city and someone starts to say Mad M--smack them (unless you're just trying to get a bigazz marg!). And then bring them here.This place is that So-Cal Mex done perfectly, filling my rather pathetic size self with a burrito larger than any (and have been doing so for at least the last five years). I used to even trek here from the South Hills for my shredded chicken before moving to the East End. A pilgrimage from a south 'burgher is rare. Between the family running the place that is constantly here with sincere, friendly service, and the enchilada sauce (yes, seriously, just this sauce by itself), you can't get better.Enchilada sauce. I could live off this stuff. I've had enchiladas elsewhere and been like, cool, tomatoes. But this! Red gold. It covers the huge, tender shredded chicken burrito that shares its huge shell with corn, lil' peps, rice, green beans, and is totally finished by me every time.. and these are massive. Those shredded burritos are under the radar it seems.  Everyone else gets the beefy Pittsburgh burrito, which I have to salute if only for the use of french fries.You also get to begin your meal with their salsa and chips, and while free, are also some of the best. I do think they make everything themselves and will not believe any word otherwise. My only draw back is trying to stop by for late night, and they are often already closed before the listed hour. Maybe I just like the chase.. The elusive burrito. Good to note a few of the local food delivery services will also drop off your puppy sized lunch to the surrounding neighborhoods.I can't compare it to others anywhere in the area (maybe a joint or two while living in AZ, but that's a given). Not saying Western PA is a hot spot for Mexi, but we hit a gold mine here. This is a Penn Ave sauce covered gem.

So, this is owned by the guy who owns Stumpy's down the block, and I want it to succeed, because I think he's a good dude who always greets customers and seems genuinely concerned about all of us.I dropped in for Happy Hour one Friday evening (which ends at 6pm, btw) and the crowd was mostly people in their mid 40's-50's out for Friday night to kick off the weekend. The bartenders were friendly and they were busy. I had some cold draft beers and the salmon flatbread, which I thought was great. Anything with capers and horseradish on a pizza crust (and it's the same crust as at Stumpy's which I do enjoy) I'm all in and not only did it taste great, it looked appetizing. Everyone else at the bar was eyeing my grub but I told them to get their own.Thirteen North is walking distance from my place, so I'll likely be a regular, even though the crowd is 10-15 years older than I am. I love to support a local business that cares about its customers.When a restaurant manager says "Of course we can make a grilled cheese sandwich for you, even though it's not on the menu.  We have cheese and we have bread.  What type of cheese would you like?  What type of bread would you prefer, sour dough or wheat?"  I am forever sold on this place.  Customer service lives and thrives at Thirteen North !!!Chili Chicken Mac and Cheese was very, very tasteful, while entirely different than I expected.  Beverages were refilled before we knew we wanted more.  I will go back to try the Ahi Tuna salad.  Long live excellent food coupled with divine service!I hate to leave a terrible review for a restaurant in our neighborhood, but unfortunately, the following is what they earned.We drive by Thirteen North often as it is located near our home. We love to eat local and tried this restaurant once many years ago, but for whatever reason never returned.  More recently I noticed they were offering Groupons, so I made a mental note that the establishment may be struggling and that we should go in and support our neighbors. Big mistake.Upon entering (myself, Husband, and 3 year old daughter) we were walked toward a 2 person table and offered a high chair. Possibly the hostess has never had children...possibly?...so I kind of understand why she may have thought that a 3 year old will sit in a high chair. Mine definitely does not. We declined and she was so kind as to offer us a larger table so we could all sit in a chair. When our server arrived we each tried to order a drink. She had no problem with my tea or Husband's water, but when we asked for milk for our daughter she replied "this is not Denny's". (WE SHOULD HAVE LET AT THAT MOMENT)We stayed and ordered our food. While waiting for our mediocre entrees to arrive, the server yelled from a few tables down that we "need to drink in unison" so she doesn't have to fill my drink and then come back to fill his later. It was most likely meant as a joke, but that is the type of thought she should not articulate. (I told her she does not need to fill mine anymore...wouldn't want to take time away from her leaning on the bar doing NOTHING).When we were finished eating (I only ate half of my pasta) she took the plates away quickly, did not offer a box, and dropped the check.We will NEVER be back.

HAPPY HOUR IS AWESOME! They do it twice a day, 3:30pm-6:30pm and 9pm-close.  The evening one is packed from what I've heard, so I went tonight and was pleased that there was open seating on the patio.  So nice out tonight, too.  Restaurant is open until 11pm on weeknights and 12am on weekends, so it's a good late night option for food.All dishes are $2.95, and there's 10-12 dishes.  I tried the shrimptini (shrimp cocktail), which was ok aka great for $3.  I also had the steak bruchetta per my waiter's recommendation, which was really good.  There's two flatbreads on the menu, which is a steal for the price, as is the burger.  Also a few other unusual items like a shrimp & eggplant dish.  Going to have to try that one next time.On Thursday nights they also do $5 martinis, which I didn't know about.  Got a razztini to complement my meal.  Total bill was under $12 with tax.  Not bad at all.  See ya soon, Brio.I liked the Town Square location the one or two times I was there. But the food I got at the Tivoli location was mediocre at best. The sweet potato and chicken risotto ($16.25) was gummy and tasted like paste. The fettuccine napoli ($15.95) was better, but nothing stellar. The best thing I tried was the kid's cheese pizza. Yeah, that means the place is kid friendly. The prices are reasonable -- although from what I hear happy hour is the best time to go since apps are $3 each.WTH BRIO you broke my heart.I have visited brio in town square numerous times. but the Brio on Rampart is so much closer to my home. I came to enjoy their wonderful happy hour and great sangria and was heartbroken by the WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.1) it took the waitress 35 minutes to take our order. fine fine i'll let that slide..2) the waitress didn't bring us any bread. we thought it was because it was happy hour but all the surrounding tables had bread. 3) we were sitting at a tiny cocktail table with 3 cups of water pitcher of sangria with 3 wine glass plus the salt/pepper sugar... summary. Not much room. when our food came he wouldn't take other dishes away. we asked him nicely to if he could take some dishes away and even passed it to him and he just walked away! HOW FREAKING RUDE. i thought he was going to put something down and come back because we CLEARLY had no room on our tiny little cocktail table to put 4 giant plates on the table and eat comfortably. but guess what. he left. like the jerk he is. 4) when we needed the bill to get out of this place the waitress was no where to be found. this was suppose to be a quick drink eat and go that ended up taking over 2 hours because the waitress forgot we existed. the food was still consistent and delicious as expected. but nothing ruins an eating experience worse than bad customer service.the worst part of this visit was not only was the waitress terrible and inattentive. the food server guy was also terrible. it wasn't just one person that ruined my night. it was TWO. TWO TERRIBLE WORKERS. i couldn't believe the lack of customer service we received at this place.I'll never come back to this Brio again.My wife and I have been to Brio in Tivoli Village and Town Square for happy hour, lunch and dinner many times over the yrs, sometime with our friends, too, and always have good experiences. This evening my wife and I went for an early dinner. The pleasant hostess took us to a nice and quiet corner table. The dining room was not crowded, yet, so was pretty quiet, although the bar area was hopping, as the patio was a bit too cold, even for the tough young crowd. Our server, Kim, was very friendly and helpful, and got our beer orders (Blue Moon, $5.25) started immediately. Good thing she did that for us, too, because the barkeeps were kept super busy by those happy yuppies, who "never seem to have to work!"  Boy do I envy them!  ;-)  The wait staff quickly brought us our favorite bread basket with warm and delicious rolls, which we enjoyed over our beers. And I started feeling great!BTW: Brio's STILL  DON'T serve Blue Moon on DRAFT, yet, only in a bottle! SIGH! For dinner, my wife ordered the "Sliced steak salad" (15.95), and I had the "Mediteranian shrimps" (15.95). Both were delicious! The steak was tender and juicy and in good quanty; shrimps were cruchy fresh and very tasty! Their presentations were quite appetizing - I totally forgot to take any pics of our dishes, being distracted by our hunger and discusions on our travel plans for 2014! Trust me, our dinners looked good! Our sweet server Kim (no, she is NOT Korean) was attentive and pleasant; her crew was efficient, keeping our water glasses full, and putting our finished dishes discreetly away. Kim also did us a great favor, taking the time to straighten out the mistakes with my Brio's reward account and honored my $15 reward credits - very nice of her!During our dinner, the hostess (perhaps also mgr) came by to say hello, and later helped the waitress out with our check. [i.e., taking it to/from the cashier, but NO, she did NOT really help out with the $Check, You Silly!]  ;-)   - A nice business practice! The Brio brand is characterized by its reliable, good italian style cuisine of VALUE; spaciousness, comfy ambience; vibrant bar scene; excellent service. Hmm...table cloths also add a touch of elegance. Of course there are other comparable restaurants, but I think Brio stands out in ITS CLASS. - My friends say, it's like dining in a "Mid-Upscale" restaurant at Olive Garden prices. For me, the Brio's in general and this locale in particular is one of the places I would go on a whim for happy hour (their $4 tasty small plates, Wed Martinis...are hard to resist at times) and/or for a tasty meal - NO SURPRISES!Jan 2014

So Akahana what's up? Do you hate me that much that you always pair me up with the very inattentive waiter that messes up my order every time?Leanne C.'s review pretty much sums up our experience there. I got told I could have cake, then the cake was a lie, then there was cake again. Quit playing with my heart! I would've ordered some food to go with the cake if you hadn't taken almost an hour to bring it out of the freezer. My love of dessert for dinner is unrivaled, but this was really crappy cake that I ended up giving away because I couldn't stomach it's frozen sickly sweetness. I suggest that you inform people next time you're serving them cold chocolate cake because I kind of envisioned a warm fluffy moist piece of chocolate yumminess.Service was awful, bad, below mediocre, crap, pick any negative adjective you like. Sake was ordered at the start of the meal and came out near the end after we had said we didn't want it anymore since it was so late, at least our server realized how big of a mess that was and comped us for it.I hate the stupid BOGO deal, just price your stuff reasonably because I don't want to always eat 2 rolls when I come here. I think I'll have to end my relationship with you here for a while Akahana.Where Akahana isn't an incredible location based on locale, they definitely pack a punch with a sushi menu of note. Checked these guys out for lunch after a long awaited and needed visit. The decor is actually pretty swanky. I really like the waterfall with the glass logo behind it. Pretty snazzy. Cool bar setup, too. We ordered a ton of sashimi and a few basic rolls. Check out my photo from the sashimi/nigiri platter. Gorgeous presentation. Fresh, flavorful and service was very fast and direct from the chef over the counter. My biggest dislikes are the prices and the TVs. Prices do seen a little steep, but for the amount of food we ordered, it was well worth it. Can't say the same if it weren't for the buy one, get one half off deal. Probably wouldn't go back if it weren't around. And the TVs. Just yuck. Jerry springer and other garbage channels on all of them and the sushi chefs were glued to it. Kind of funny, but really disappointing. Daytime TV + sushi = no thanks. I can say I'd be back, but maybe for a change from the regular sushi go-tos. Cheers!

Très bon resto français!  Situé dans une belle maison (probablement centenaire), l'ambiance est chaleureuse et intime.  Les coupes de viandes et cuissons sont excellentes, servies avec des sauces très aromatiques, et se marient vraiment bien ensemble.  Tout est vraiment très bon, de la soupe au dessert!N'oubliez pas votre vin! Le resto n'est pas très grand et bien connu dans le coin alors réservez tot!

This place is unprofessional in every way possible.It's really a shame that for a place that serves up very decent, authentic indian cuisine, that the customer service is so deplorable. My parents and I went in today to pick up an order of undhia and bhajia at 6pm. They had pre-ordered it and arranged the pick up time. We were told to wait for 5 minutes, which we did with no problem. 5 minutes turned into 10, 15, and almost 20. When it finally came out my father rightly expressed concern about the timing since we were ordering a very large amount for a special event. The owner snidely replied, well, if you are so concerned, then why are you even ordering from us? Ummm, say what? First rule of customer service, the customer is always right. And even if they are obnoxious, which we were not, you APOLOGIZE for being late. And you don't make snide comments. And here's the kicker, we let it slide because there were other people in the store, and when we got home we realized we had gotten the WRONG order, we had 2 orders of bhajias. So we called the owner, Hetal, to note this error. Instead of an apology (at this point we were owed two) we got her adamant denial that she was in the wrong. No, it was us who had placed a wrong order. My father expressed his disapproval of her behavior and you know what she said? I don't have to listen to you, I've opened restaurants before, I don't need to be told how to run it. UM, actually, you do. Because you are RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, and cocky enough to think that just because your food is good, you can get by with the worst service I have ever encountered. This is America, you can't treat your customers like this and get away with it. And it's such a shame, because in this small indian community of Charlotte, one wants to spread the word about their fellow indian's business and help them out. But this place is not worth all the undhia in the world. It left a really bad taste in my mouth and we will never step foot in there again.Holy god, this place is delish. But if you're stuffing your face with deep fried, hot toddy S.Indian goodness, tables in full 95 degree sunlight don't work as seating - an umbrella, perhaps, would make this an easier lunchtime sell.Fav? Lilva Katchori - tiny nuggets of buckwheat groats and mustard seeds, turmeric, curry leaves, covered in pastry and fried. Crunchy, textural, rad. Comes with their house hot tamarind sauce - a sweet, gradually crescendoing spice experience, thin, and everything tastes better dipped in it.Got some sort of sandwich, let's go with curry and lime pickle and chickpea spread - and damn, it was awesome. A slider by way of Punjab. Killer.Prices are low to mid - and there are things being made here that you can't get anywhere else, plus the classics are fab - samosas, two huuuuge pastry-covered piles of fennel seed, potato, unidentifiable delish, for 3 bucks. A garlicy, smoky dal, multiple legumes, a cup or so of Paneer Masala, a perfect amount of rice, papadum, and thin, pancake-like Naan, for 7. Sweet.

It's been almost 2 years since I've been here. the fact that they're still open is a good sign. I tried the to slice in a drink combo again today.The crust is amazing, thin and crispy yet chewy at the same time.The butter garlic sauce on the back of the crust was excellent. The cheese was fresh the sauce was light but good, I would recommend extra sauce. Service was good, the owner asked how everything was and made some suggestions. Too bad I am outside their delivery area.

First, I want to say thanks for opening a great pizza place near me in the Southwest. It's right off of the 215 and Town Center. It's next to Hokkaido and Rachel's Kitchen. Next, the restaurant is very cool looking with a covered outdoor patio. I'm sure they are waiting for the weather to get warmer but they have heat lamps out there so they can use it now... hint hint =) The interior is sleek and urban with orange and brown accents that match their logo/theme. The restaurant is split into two sides, the dining area and and the bar area. I like this because there is a separation between both which has a different vibe for each. Dining area is much more family feel while bar is casual cool wine lounge with yummy food. OF course the centerpiece are the two pizza ovens in the kitchen area. And if you are wondering, that's the kitchen... that's it, all open. Isn't that crazy?And you can if you want, stand up at the glass partition to watch them make your pizza. I watched them for a bit and that's when Chef Carlos said hi and told me about the open kitchen. I just got off work and was hungry so I went straight for the good stuff.. the pizza. There are two kinds of pizza: Neapolitan or Roman. I was like, what is Roman style. Apparently, it's like a cracker crust. I will try next time. I ordered the Picante (cuz I like it spicy), and added garlic and an over-easy egg. I love pizza places that add egg to the top of the pizza! Well needless to say, the pizza was amazing and spicy. The Sopressata, red peppers, garlic, San Marzano tomato and egg all worked together. The crust is thick enough to hold the toppings and probably a couple more. I usually dip my remaining crust in olive oil and I ended up pouring the olive oil all over the pizza - some good olive oil. Next time I will need to try the app, esp the Carpaccio, Gnocchi, Scampi the Mozzarella Bar, and of course more pizza. Ciao!Really cute restaurant on Town Center near the 215.  Nice décor.  Our server was really enthusiastic and, at one point, did an ode to sea salt that I cannot do justice.  We had the tricolore salad ($9.95) which was very light and refreshing.  I believe they added some pears to the salad, which was nice.  We also tried the mozzarella bar ($10.95) where you pick one mozzarella and one side.  They have three different kinds and we went with the classica and the anchovies as our side.  Don't get the anchovies unless you are serious about anchovies.The great thing about this place is they have two different types of pizza, which is rare for gourmet pizza restaurants.  They have pizza ovens for both Roma and Neapolitan.  Figure out which one you like before you go.  Roma is thinner crust, kind of like Grimaldi's but not as greasy.  Neapolitan is thicker crust, like Settebello.  We prefer Grimaldi's so we went with the Roma Due Forni pizza ($15.95) and it was really, really good!  It comes with tomato, mozzarella, sausage, bacon, and pequillo peppers, which are roasted red peppers.  The mozzarella had a good, slightly smoky flavor and the bacon and sausage were delicious.They offer Moretti on tap ($5.95/glass) and have a good variety of bottled beers.  They also offer all wines by the glass and have an enomatic machine behind the bar.  Our red wine was served warm so I think the enomatic machines are reserved for the more expensive wines.  Some of their wines cost $50 a glass.  We had the Educated Guess Cabernet ($13.95/glass) and the Suri Barbera ($11.95).  Very good wines but I just wish they were served at the right temperature - slightly cool.The dessert menu is pretty cool (see pic) and they have a chocolate pizza that I would like to try.  We had the tiramisu gelato and it was very delicious.They are open until 11pm on the weekends, which is pretty late for Summerlin.  We usually don't make it out until 9pm to eat so it's nice to eat somewhere that isn't trying to close while we are eating.I'm so happy this place opened in Summerlin and I can't wait to come back!I've been looking for a place that cracks an egg over pizza. Thanks to Debbie N's review, that place is Due Forni.The name means Two Ovens in Italian. When I walked in, the owner showed me the two ovens, which are both on full display from the dining area. (I just assumed he's the owner because he seemed very welcoming and grateful that I chose his establishment). On this occasion, I was just there to pick up a take-out order, but the interior is very classy. There is a bar area on one side with a dining area on the other.We decided to go with the Tartufo because it's the one with the over easy baked egg. The other ingredients are black truffle, parmesan crema, fontina fontal, and roasted cremini. I didn't realize it at the time, but based on the menu description, I guess we had the Neapolitan style pizza. Each of their pizzas can be ordered Neapolitan or Roman. That's why they need two ovens. The Neapolitan is baked at 900 degrees for no more than 90 seconds whereas the Roman is baked in a 500-degree oven for 3 minutes.Although the egg was extremely undercooked, the pizza was oh so good. It is certainly an expensive pizza if you look at the size versus the price ($20.95 for the Tartufo), but the ingredients were high quality and the crust was cooked to perfection. We paired that up with a Tricolore salad, consisting of farmers market greens, taggiasca olives, artichokes, avocado, and white balsamic. Wow was this salad excellent. Great flavor throughout with (again) high quality ingredients and a reasonable price ($9.95).It's not in my area of town, but I would return to Due Forni in two heartbeats.So I'll have to preface this with the fact that I don't eat undercooked eggs. In fact, I have a fear of them and can't even watch people eat "egg goo". I'm sure I'm missing out on part of the magic of this restaurant by not ordering the egg-goo pizza, so perhaps this would be a 5 star review if egg-goo was my thing. The decor of this place was awesome - chic, clean, and modern. Service was quick and polite. We ate here on our lunch break so I appreciate good service when I'm trying to dine quickly. We settled on the gnocchi and the prosciutto pizza . The gnocchi wasn't dense like most gnocchi I'm used to, but was utterly fabulous. The bacon was divine and the peas and light sauce were perfect. YUM. The pizza was pretty damn good, but I like Settebello FAR better. The crust was very similar, but I found the cheese/topping ratio at Due to be off. I didn't really taste any cheese, but my pizza was covered in tons and tons of proscuitto and salad. I will say, ounce for ounce, you're getting a ton more meat on the pizza here, but it was in obnoxiously huge pieces there were impossible to eat without cutting. But then cutting the meat ended up making the entire pizza fall apart. Settebello just holds together better. Also, I love the Carbonara pizza at Settebello featuring a FULLY COOKED (and goo free egg!). Additionally, the prices at Settebello are much better. I felt like I was eating good pizza dough with tons of meat and salad on it here. The balsalmic on it was tasty, but just added to my meat salad feeling I was getting. Truffle oil and more cheese would have served this pizza well ! I do love Italian style pies, so I'm pleased to have another option in Vegas. Don't miss the fabulous pasta, this place has many exciting options besides pizza !A little wine and pizza for lunch. And although a lot looked great on the appetizer end of things..we got what we came for. One roman and one Neapolitan. Ordered the prosciutto e rucola for the Neapolitan pizza which was awesome. The smoked buffalo mozzarella really brought it to a whole new level. Crust was light, chewy and just the way we like it. The roman margherita was just ok. We weren't crazy about the crust but I think that's just our preference. Will probably be the one and only time we get roman. Glad we tried it though. Nice wine selection. Friendly service. Atmosphere was great. We'll definitely take advantage of the outdoor seating when it isn't windy. Definitely top 5 pizza for Vegas but there's another place that begins with "S" in Henderson that's still #1 for me.Amazing selection of Italian wines by the glass.  We dropped by on  Friday evening after dinner to enjoy the wine bar.  My only regret is not trying this place sooner.  Right out of the gate you notice the wine selection is standard issue.  Don't worry if you're not an Italian wine expert, the staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  Our server, Alexander, was more than eager to describe and talk about all of the wines, as well as explaining how the wines are selected. Between the two of us we tried 6 different wines.  Not a single one fell short of stellar.  I was most  surprised by how much I enjoyed the Grecante, mostly because the texture put me in mind of melty butter on my tongue.The Due Forni wine set up is like no other wine bar I've visited.  It is pretty rare to come across some of the higher end wines offered by the glass.  And you can even get a 2 oz pour at 20% of the glass price.The owner stopped by briefly to check with us, which is always a nice touch.  I highly endorse this lovely little spot.  You can tell that a lot of thought and effort have been put into Due Forni.  The ambiance is warm and welcoming, and we got a kick out of the silly Spaghetti Western that was playing on the TVs above the bar.On my next visit I am looking forward to trying their pizza, which can be ordered with a crispy crust (Roman style) or light & chewy crust (Neopolitan style).After a long Labor Day weekend of Tropicbeauty bikini modeling all I wanted was some really yummy pizza. Due Forni came up on my Yelp with good reviews, so we decided to give it a try.We arrived late, around 9:40pm (they close at 10pm) but the host and sole waiter were as sweet as ever. I did not feel rushed in the slightest, but did try to be conscientious because I can only imagine how annoying it is to wait around on people when all you want to do is go home after a long day.Our order:-Beet salad-Buffala mozzerella with roasted tomatoes-Due Forni Neopolitan crust pizza-Speck Roman crust pizzaYum! Everything was very tasty. My favorite was the buffala mozz with roasted tomatoes. The mozz was creamy and beautiful, so good.The beet salad and pizzas were all very good, but my only complaint was that the speck pizza was a bit soggy in the center. Perhaps it wasn't cooked all the way through? When I picked up a slice from the pizza plate to move it to my single serving plate the crust didn't hold up, it started to slip downward and the toppings began their slow slide down until I rushed the slice over to my plate. However, the taste was fresh and I really did enjoy the meal.Service was excellent, especially considering we were there after closing and there was only one other pair of people in the restaurant (they seemed to be regulars/friends of the waiter). Their wine selection look varied, I would love to come back and try some wines next time.Scratch one off the personal bookmarks. Been meaning to hit up Due Forni for quite some time. Heard about it from my yelp social group who had nothing but good things to say about the place. Highlights seems to focus more on the braised octopus dish that's so tender it's not like any octopus you've ever had. Well...i've had a lot of octopus and i do enjoy octopus...CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!!! - Polipo The revered octopus appetizer...The description on the menu honestly does not do this dish ANY justice. How much does the menu description downplay the epicness of this dish? Well it's kinda like calling a nuke a typical explosive...it goes boom things get fucked up u know how it goes...Whoa where do i start...Okay first impression was the smell that hit me. I was confused at first because it sorta had a fish sauce smell and i was raised around fish sauce. Seeing the greens in the bowl and the smell of fish sauce my mind already determined what this was going to taste like. Not saying this is a bad thing it's just from my prospective my mind was playing tricks on me based on what the senses were collecting. Imagine seeing the lid pulled from a plate of steamed veggies and you smelled steak...kinda like that...confusingAnyway first bite of a piece of octopus it was just...WOW it's tender. Not too salty and was well balanced with the dressing of the small salad. I gotta be careful with this dish in the future because it may just raise the standard for my future octopus experiences. - Speck Pizza in a Neapolitan Very nice and well balanced. Only thing i hated about it was the difficult of getting enough prosciutto with every bite. Not exactly a pizza friendly ingredient but...what ever..file it under First World Problems. Very balanced and i enjoyed the layers of flavors from the order of toppings, to cheese, to dough. Noticed half a slice in that there was no sauce. My first reaction to this was 'well...why not?' then i started to realize that adding a sauce would have added another layer of flavor and it was just perfect without it. Apart from the cheese, i was thoroughly impressed with the crust and dough in general. Granted it's not as crispy as i'd like it but it did have a fresh taste to it as well as a decent chewy texture. There was no discarded crusts at this table we ate it all.Overall the ingredients are just top-notch. I dont know exactly where their cheese comes from but i'd love to brush my teeth with it.As real and authentic as it gets!!  As good as it gets!!Terri R and I were planning our next meal together and when she found out that I haven't had a good pizza in at least 3 years, she gave me a choice of 3 different places out here.  Not knowing where to go (remember I haven't had a good pizza in awhile), Terri suggested Due Forni.When it comes to pizza in general, you have your branded commercialized choices (i.e. Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, etc), NY Style, Chicago deep dish, and the authentic stuff.  Due Forni is the authentic stuff for sure.Their easy one page menu, descriptions of the pizzas, and the pictures from other Yelpers immediately reminded me of my last visit in Italy.  I even knew what to expect; a thin crusted, a little runny, and a very tasty pizza that wasn't overwhelmingly saucy. If I got anything different, I would be disappointed.  We chose the Quattro Formaggi which consisted bufala mozzarella (cheese from water buffalo milk), ricotta, parmesan, and fontina fontal (cheese from cow milk).  Your crust choices are Napoletana (cooked in their 900 degree oven, result is a chewy crust with crispy outside) or their Romana (cooked in their 500 degree oven result is a thin and crispy pizza).  We got the Napoletana and it was simply delicious.  The pizza was just what I expected and exactly what I've experienced in Italy itself.  The inside decor, seating, and colors even reminded me of some restaurants in Firenze.Service was great and the waitress took the time to give me, since I am the noob here, a detailed description of everything on the menu.  She also reminded us that we can add any type of topping on our pizza of choice.  Authentic pizza without the European prices equals a perfect a deal. You really can't go wrong with Due Forni if authentic pizza is your thing.  If you enjoy the Americanized branded pizza, Chicago Style or New York Style, then Due Forni may or might not be for you.  But if you ever experienced a pizza the way it's suppose to be made and loved it, then Due Forni is a can't miss, a must try, and as good as it gets.  Visit again or bookmark it, you can' go wrong.PS: Thanks Terri R.  Pizza slump cured!!!500 or 900 degrees.  60 or 180 seconds.  Yup, great Italian style pizza.The pizzas.  Two styles of crust made from a lightly salted, uber elastic dough.  The pizza Romana has a distinct crispier bottom crust,  the pizza Napolitana a chewier crust with blistered / blackened edges.  Personally, I like the bitterness from the blackened edges.  Note: as the pizzas cool, the texture becomes the same.  Refrigerator or AC chilled slices in the middle of the night don't cut it.Tried them all.  The quality topping combinations work well, there is just too much of it.  All the excessive "stuff" obscures the crust and isn't that the point of using these special ovens?  That said, the simplest is the best (the Margherita - San Marzano tomato, bufala mozzarella, fresh basil).It's not just about the pizzas.  Great starters including the roasted beet salad (roasted beets, arugula, goat cheese, pistachios, basil pesto and drizzled with a fig vincotto).  A contrast in sweet, tangy, nutty, earthy flavors and textures.  Delish!  Do not pass up the polipo (braised octopus topped with a mint vinaigrette).  Fork tender with the perfect "octopussy" flavor (sweet, salty, briny, oceanic goodness).The mozzarella bar a nice touch.  Three selections (classic bufala, smoked, and stracciatella - soaked in heavy cream) offered with various sides and pizza bread.  The classic pairs well with marinated artichokes.  The sour notes of the brine make the sweet milk flavor come alive.50 plus Italian / Italian varietal wines by the glass.  Nice pours, prices are fair.  Friendly, off the Strip service.  Bottom line, Due Forni makes it easy to have a good time.I have been wanting to try Due Forni for a while so I was glad to finally try it. Here they offer pizza, appetizers, salads, mozzarella bar and have a selection of wines.  They have 2 different ovens for 2 different types of pizza. The "Neapolitan" had a crust that is more soft and thick and the "Roman" had a crust that is thin and crispier. Since I was here having lunch with a fellow yelper who has been here several times, I asked her suggestions as far as portion size and what was good. She said the pizza was huge and filling so we decided to split a pizza and salad. I can't remember the name of the salad, but it was the special of the day and delicious. The figs were very tasty and I'm usually not a fan of arugula however everything paired well and tasted great. Then came time for the pizza. We ordered the "Quattro Formaggi" priced at $15.99 with the roman crust. This pizza had buffalo mozzarella, parmesan, fontina fontal and ricotta on it which made for one cheesy delight. All the cheeses were perfect together and tasted very good. This pizza usually comes white, but we requested red sauce made with san marzano tomatoes be added and the sauce is boss! The crust however I wasn't a fan of. I found the roman crust very chewy and tough to eat so I would try this pizza with the neapolitan crust next time. Another thing is I was still hungry when the bill came so I wouldn't share again since I could have easily eaten 3 pieces of the pizza and all of the salad *oink oink*. Service was great and I will definitely come back to Due Forni. **Happy Hour is from 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm 7 days a week** Current HH menu: $5-Oven Baked Goat Cheese-Dates Skewer-Meatballs-Gnocchi-Vegetarian Flat BreadI really can't say I was impressed -- especially not impressed when comparing it to my beloved Settebello. I came here on a Saturday night with some friends. Molly was kind enough to make reservations for us because some reviews mention that it was an absolute must. That was not the case. The restaurant was about 3/4 empty. It is a very elegant restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. They were patient with us while we waited for out fourth person to arrive. In the meantime I opted for a Moretti beer, he brought me a Hefeweizen (about $3 more). I can't speculate on whether this was intentional or a simple oversight, but it still annoyed me. We started off with a Capraccio appetizer (thin sliced prime beef, arugula, pine nuts, parmesan, cremini mushrooms, black truffle) - for $11.95 it did nothing for me. It actually was fairly tasteless even though I was hungry.We then opted to share three pizzas --Due Forni, Bianca Al Prosciutto Cotto, and Prosciutto E Rucola. That was roughly $50 worth of pizza alone. Had it been as amazing as people rave it to be I would not have minded this price tag, but it was not. The neapolitan crust was still too thin and hard without too much flavor. Everyone had piles of crust left on their plates and that says a lot. When Molly and I go to Settebello for our neapolitan pizza fix, you can bet your life there will not be a drop of that pizza left. For the price, this place just isn't worth it. The service was fine, the food was adequate but overpriced, and I would not go out of my way to dine here again.We popped in for dinner one night after the gym. It's located in south Summerlin off of town center, across from the gardens park. The restaurant itself has a great feel. It's pretty casual and comfortable. The music... Well that needs some help... Really weird melodies playing on a Monday night:/ We were greeted at the door by a very friendly and well dressed older man. I'm assuming he is the manager. He held the door and sat us promptly. We opted for patio seating and I was so glad we did! The patio is covered with fans to help keep it cool. The seating was comfortable and the tables were sturdy. Our server was nice. He told us about the menu and went over the beers and wines. I ordered a red blend, nothing fancy... Still tasty though. My boyfriend and I opted to split the beet salad (made vegan) and the veggie gluten free pizza (also prepared vegan). I'm not one to complain... But... $4.95 extra to prepare a small 8inch pizza gluten free is just a tad bit pushing my limits. Our pizza was around 23.00 dollars after tax. It was pretty delicious though. I would order it again... When I want to splurge on pizza. The veggies were fresh And the dough was not overly spongey or crisp. We did mention sharing the beet salad... And they split it for is on two plates (nice gesture) ;) It was really good. One of my favorite beet salads thus far... The pistachios added a great crunch. Our friend ordered a chicken Caesar salad. It was a pretty standard portion... Not very difficult to mess up... He said it was good. The server gave us our bill without an itemized (something I really despise). I like to look over everything on the tab. I can not tell you how many times I've been over charged, under charged, didn't receive add Ins I was charged for, and auto grated on tabs I would of really just never questioned without the itemized. If I could knock half of a star for this... I would. Overall, it was a good experience and we will definitely be back.

Review Text :
What a little gem of a find this bakery is! I was in the parking lot headed to Subway when I noticed it. I thought I would stop in and see what they had for bread. I was surprised at the appetizing variety of goodies they had!I got a "Apple Danish" and a "Bear Claw" to enjoy for dessert :)They were so tasty! I wish I noticed this place before but now I can at least stop in and get a danish after eating my healthy Subway right?! *wink wink*The store was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful.Items Selected:Bear ClawBee Sting CakePretzel CroissantApple StrudelAlmond TwistOwned and operated by two of the most pleasant ladies I've yet to encounter in Las Vegas one would be hard pressed to name a more 'authentic' ethic destination in the city - Asian, European, Latin American, or otherwise.  Featuring a wide variety of baked goods and imports both sweet and savory straight out of Deutschland at prices representing a veritable bargain compared to many of the area's artisan bakeries it was plain on entry to the small shop that things were bound to be good when I heard staff and patrons communicating nearly exclusively in German and with no less than two dozen offerings available the only difficulties presented by German Bread Bakery was not ordering too much...eventually settling on a mere five selections at a total of $10.89.  Focused on the classics, particularly those most familiar to me growing up to a Hungarian-German heritage, it was with an apple strudel that my tasting began and reheated quickly in the microwave I'd strongly suggest others do the same, the result a light trickle of butter running from the flaky dough as fresh apples and light sweetness found balance in hefty cinnamon notes and delicate pastry.  Moving next to two almond options it was perhaps an effect of my 2pm arrival that the sole remaining bear claw was found to be a bit doughy though the frangipane was well utilized and moving on to the laminated layers of the almond twist I'd wager that no better exists in the city, a light glaze overlying toasted almonds as each shattering bite made a mess of my table and floor, a similar result found in the signature 'pretzel croissant' as buttery salted layers gave way to a soft crumb speckled with seeds and flavors harkening the Bavarian classic but ever more delicate.  Last but certainly not least, my final taste of German Bread Bakery on this day was the classic Bienenstich - a dish rarely found but always astounding when done well and in this case done perfectly with light vanilla pastry cream proving a marvelous balance to rich almond/honey/butter crunch topping all anchored by the yeasty yellow cake - a must order more than worth a trip to both fans and those (unfortunately) not yet familiar.Beesting cake and pretzel croissants. You're welcome.Just about everything is phenomenal here, and I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong no matter what you get, but the two items above are my favorites.Staff is super friendly: if you don't know what to get, they're happy to suggest some items and explain what's in the different pastries. Don't forget to check the discount table for 30% off of day-old bread loaves.Pricing is super reasonable and quality is astounding. Location is a bit of a drive for me, but I'll go out of my way to come here. Heads up that sometime they forget to turn on their OPEN light, but they are open til 2PM on Sundays.This is a must visit Bakery. Located in the Smiths shopping center on Lake Mead and Rampart, The German Bakery is addicting. The hubby is from Germany so when I found out about this little hidden gem i knew I had to surprise him with a treat. I ordered a Cherry Strudel, German Cheesecake, Nugat, and pretzel. Me being allergic to gluten unfortunately I was not able to try anything but he ate everything in 1 day. If i would have bought more he would have eaten that too haha.He said everything was very traditional in German baking. Not too sweet like a lot of American bakeries. He even went back the next day... Ive created a monster!There really isn't not much you can write about a small German bakery considering all they offer is German pastries and pretzels. Me and Ellen F. came here after a hearty breakfast next door and decided we weren't finished stuffing ourselves yet. We've been here several times and we always get pretzels and pretzels rolls, they are to die for! These are some of the most authentic German pretzels I've had since I've been to Munich. They are cooked just right and have just enough salt on them that isn't too much. Along with the pretzels I also get a Berliner which is equally awesome. Good amount of powdered sugar and not stingy on the filling, these are puffy so to me you get more bang for the buck so to say. The lady that helped us is always friendly and courteous. She was extremely patient while I picked which Berliner I wanted from their glass display and rang us up promptly. If you like German pastries or snacks this is the spot to go to, there aren't to many in town.Though my visit to the German Bread Bakery was brief lasting only about 5 minutes, it was a good 5 minute first impression.  I was struck first by the smell of fresh baked goods.  I love that smell.  It reminds me of growing up when I would bake with my mom and my grandma.  Especially around the holidays.There was nobody up front when I first walked in but the lady came out almost right away and asked how she could help me.  She was not a Chatty Kathy but not unfriendly either.  Just very professional with her answers in a German accent.  I asked her about a couple of things and told her it was my first time to the shoppe.  She told me about the bee sting cake which I had heard about through Yelp.  I was already leaning towards trying that and she just pushed me a little closer to the decision.  Close enough that it was decided and I ordered one of those.  I also was eyeing the rum balls.  I like rum and I like chocolate so that was a no brainer.  I ordered one of those as well.  Next thing I know I was being rung up ($4 and change) and instructed to keed the bag on its side so that the sweets inside would not get all messed up.I took these treats home with me and broke into the rum ball first.  It was the smaller of the two and I was kind of full from lunch an hour earlier.  This was the perfect size for a mid day dessert.  The first thing I notice is that it does not appear to be baked at all.  It seems almost like under cooked brownies with some grit.  Not in a bad way at all.  Infact, I loved it 100%.  I looked up some recipes to see exactly what it was.  The best I can figure is chocolate, sugar, butter, ground hazel nuts, and rum.  Perhaps even some toasted coconut.  There aint nothin' wrong with that.  It was so good.  A little sweet.  A little drunk.  Divinely evil.I tried the bee sting cake later in the day for my after dinner dessert.  I was only going to have a few bites of what was actually a rather big piece of cake.  That plan was quickly tossed aside after the first bit proved too much to ignore.  It was not overly sweet as I expected it to be.  The cake is more of a yeast bread and is a little dry compared to traditional cake.  There are two layers of this baked good with a Bavarian cream in the middle.  On the top is a caramelized almond cap with honey.  That is where the bulk of the sweetness seemed to be but even that was not too sweet.  It was just right.  Before I knew it the entire piece was gone and I found myself wanting more.  I love almonds. honey and Bavarian cream.  This is like a trifecta of goodness.I will have to go back for some other baked goods.  Like pretzels and rolls.  There are many other desserts to try as well.  It may take me a few more visits to try it all.  Oh darn the luck.Since moving to Las Vegas in June my husband and I have made the most interesting and serendipitous discoveries!! We were driving from the Ace Hardware on Cheyenne toward the Dog Supply Outlet on Sahara today and a teenager was spinning a sign at the northwest corner of Rampart and Lake Mead near the Smith's. The sign said German Bakery with an arrow. I got the young man's attention and he confirmed it was in this shopping center.We did a safe but rapid turn around to get back to the bakery. (as safe as a Bulgarian-German who was up late last night and did not have lunch can do at 1pm...)We found the bakery and it had some of his mother's family's traditional berliner pastries, cherry cake, crispy sandwich rolls, cinnamon and raisin rolls, chocolate and almond corner bars, and almond marzipan pastries. My husband's eyes were glazed over and he started relating all the familiar items to the very sweet woman at the counter. She is warm and welcoming and very helpful. I love it when a storekeeper truly appreciates the visitors who chose to come to her shop. There was an older woman there whose mother in law had made the same German delicacies and she too was very excited to have her first visit to the bakery.We slithered out to the car with our treasures and gobbled down one of the almond marzipan pastries plus a cinnamon roll. Oh how fresh they are! This is truly a great find.Well now I have no worries where my husband goes when I am working from home because he is either at the dog park or at the German Bread Bakery.  We cannot wait for the Christmas goodies either!!Lovely lady, lovely bakery and amazing pastries. I came here this morning to pick up some goodies for my work. As soon as you walk in, you get excited. The smell is amazing! They have all sorts of breads, pastries, desserts, etc. I got an assortment of pastries - poppy coffee cake, almond coffee cake, cinnamon roll, chocolate croissant, etc. My branch is crazy about them! Everything is so soft and you can tell it's fresh. Love this place! I can't wait to go back to try more things.

Review Text :
This is one of those spots I would probably deem a 3.5 if there were half star options, but since there aren't, I decided that it was worth rounding up. I got the chance to check out the newest Grimaldi's while on the way to a graduation party. We wanted a casual atmosphere in North Scottsdale and decided Grimaldi's was it! It was around 6 PM on a Saturday and we got a seat on the patio right away without a wait. The decor of Grimaldi's has the same vibe as the others but with a North Scottsdale feel to it. They have split patios that hold about six-ten tables each. Red checkered table clothes line the tables and apparently they are even on hand for for customer's who get chilly. Seriously, I saw a customer eating at a table while wrapped in one of the red checkered table clothes. I really liked the private room they have with about six tables and big enough for a group of probably 15-20. For those who want to drink their dinner, they also have a bar in the front with bar seats. Moving on to the food, this is the same Grimaldi's food as other places. We started with the Cesar Salad which tasted like your typical Cesar Salad. For the entree, we went for a sausage, mushroom and pepperoni pizza. Now the only problem I have with the pizza is that sometimes it doesn't have enough cheese or sauce, so to fix that we asked for extra cheese and sauce and that absolutely helped! I really like the pizza but only when I eat it at the restaurant. Every time I get the pizza to go it gets cold and loses the taste. This is a great addition to the Scottsdale Quarter and I think it adds a family atmosphere option to the area. Parking here is such a hassle though that I will probably stick to the Old Town location for the most part, but when I'm in the area, I will definitely keep this as an option.Mmmmm...  garlic!A recent Sunday afternoon found us wandering around the Scottsdale Quarter.  It was around 3pm, and many of the restaurants were in the lull between lunch and dinner - a great opportunity to try the newest Grimaldi's location without a crowd.  It is no secret that I am a fan of pizza.  While I am typically a 'pepperoni and mushroom' kind of girl, having visited the Grimaldi's DC Ranch location I knew exactly what to get - the White with Garlic pizza.  It is a simple sauceless combination of flavorful cheese and garlic.  Lots of garlic.  And that is a good thing.We ordered the large, which proved to be much bigger than expected - it nearly covered the entire high-top bar table, making it interesting to juggle plates, pizza, wine (house Montepulciano) and water glasses.  Hey, there are worse problems to have!I look forward to enjoying more of that coal-fired garlicy goodness soon!

Review Text :
Full Disclosure: My brother works here. Lucky for you, he tried to drown me when I was four years old, so I would never let that influence my review. If anything, I would dock them a star or two for employing someone who would so callously throw a toddler into a pond.* But I'm far too levelheaded to let anything like that color my judgment, or to hold a grudge for twenty-something years. Anyway. I could drink here all night. Because I like this bar. 1947 is a simple space. The decor is all dark wood and back-lit bottles, and the vibe is warm and friendly. There's a long bar that runs the length of the space, and as far as I can tell, it's all about the whiskey. I appreciate that they've got at least 25 different bourbons back there, and that the bartenders will mix you a mean Manhattan with any one of them. I haven't had a chance to try any of the food yet, but I did see a man going to town on a burger I gladly would've stolen, and the mac & cheese smelled amazing. Either way, a fireplace and lots and lots of bourbon was all I really wanted anyway.  Although, as a general rule, lots of alcohol and no food can lead to you making an ass out of yourself. I know a guy that once vomited directly onto the shoes of a police officer. Definitely wasn't me. I don't care what you heard.__________*It was a lot like this: http://whatshouldwecallme.tumblr.com/post/19239895670/my-relationship-with-my-siblingsWe headed out here after my bff's birthday dinner this past weekend. It was my first time at 1947, and I was pleasantly surprised. Inside, the restaurant itself has a bar area, booths and a long table...during our visit a group of at least 14 or 16 people came in and were seated in the middle of the restaurant at the long table. So, pro: they can accommodate large groups; con: it's right in the middle of the place so difficult to maneuver around people.Since it was a nice night, we opted to sit outside in the 'beer garden'. Place is cute and comfortable. I can't comment on the food, because we just had some drinks. I usually just go for a beer, cause I'm a simple gal, but I chose to get a frozen bourbon lemonade with framboise (which was lemonade and raspberry) because it just sounded so good. And it was! But, it was super sweet....so, for me, one was enough. Our waitress accidentally made my friend the wrong drink so she gave us a second frozen bourbon for free and I could only get a few sips down. Anyways, prices seemed reasonable, the staff were friendly...overall a decent experience. Due to the positive reviews on their meals, I would definitely come back for dinner!My first time at 1947 Tavern was a little mixed.  The drinks were good, but I found the service to not only be inattentive but downright rude.  So when my friends and I headed there after having dinner I was a little suspect, but I noticed they had their Biergarten open and we really wanted to sit outside so no brainer we headed toward the door. We were greeted by a very fun and colorful hostess/server.  He was upbeat and kind of dancing there as we came in.  I asked if we could sit outside stating it was my birthday.  He happily went out to find a table and treated me very nicely saying anything for the birthday girl!  It was cute.  The outside is very quaint, but open, I liked it a lot.  The other server working was also just as friendly.  My girlfriend and I started off with a frozen Bourbon Lemonade with Framboise, where as the men ordered a couple beers.  They were very refreshing but also very, very sweet.  I couldn't drink another so I ordered a Manhattan (shocker).  I asked for the Manhattan and she accidently brought another Bourbon Lemonade.  I said quickly that I wanted a Manhattan.  She apologized and went to take it away then said, just take this and I will bring your Manhattan.  That worked out great, since my girlfriend was drinking the same thing, though she couldn't finish both either, just really over-the-top sweet.  1947 Tavern proved to be a great stop on Saturday.  With great service, nice atmosphere, good drinks, and best friends, I can't ask for much more than that.I visited 1947 Tavern this evening with a friend for happy hour.  We were looking for a non-dive bar in Shadyside with a good happy hour, and 1947 fit the bill.For drinks, my friend and I both ordered frozen bourbon lemonades ($3, HH price).  My friend described this drink as an alcoholic slushee, and she was right on!  The texture reminded me of water ice, but was finer and melted more easily.  The flavor was quite sweet, though, and lacked the characteristic tartness of lemon water ice.  I couldn't taste any distinct bourbon flavor, but it was definitely there, given that my head started to tingle after drinking the last third of the drink.For food, I ordered the mac and cheese, which was half off for happy hour ($4.50, HH price).  Although it wasn't the best mac and cheese I've had, it wasn't bad.  I particularly enjoyed the noodles, which consisted of Fede pasta, according to the menu.  Thanks to the crispy top, the cheese sauce had interesting textural variation, but its flavor was mediocre.  If you're looking for a good mac and cheese, I recommend Harris Grill's across the street.  Unfortunately, I don't believe that they discount it for happy hour like 1947 does, though.Overall, my experience at 1947 was solid 3.5 star quality.  The HH prices were right, but the drinks and food leave room for improvement.  We sat at the bar, and service from the bartender was great, despite being the only customers for awhile.  If you're in the neighborhood and are looking for an alternative to the Harris Grill, consider giving 1947 a try.

If you blindfolded me and put me inside this modern, newly renovated space, I would never guess that it used to be Cafe Carumba or Jacqueline's!  OK - maybe I would, but only because of the layout... they did a great job urbanizing and upgrading this restaurant!I went in for an early dinner with friends recently and was pleasantly surprised by the new decor, service, and of course, the food.  Being welcomed by Zoran, the Operating Partner of Tommy V's, and former GM of the (now closed) Estate House, was a treat as well.Service was top notch as our party of five made our way through a variety of menu items family style.  Highlights for me included the following:-Legume Spinach Soup (lentils, beans, garbanzo, spinach, vegetable stock) - I know it sounds very healthy and boring, but it was delicious!-Manila Clams Linguine (a tad on the buttery side, but I didn't mind)-Spinach Ricotta Ravioli-Veal Parisienne (I'm not usually a veal person, but I enjoyed this breaded preparation)-Grilled Asparagus (you can never eat enough veggies)-Potato-Hazelnut Truffle SouffleAnd, finally, we shared a dessert plate, but I think I ate the majority of the lemon dessert that was served with fresh strawberries.  I don't know what exactly it was, but Baby M was all about it!I noticed Tommy V's "happy hour menu," served Monday - Friday from 11am - 6:30pm a little late in the game, (it includes a solid variety of $5 wines and discounted appetizers), but I plan on returning soon to check that out.We decided to come to Tommy V's because of some of the reviews from Yelp friends.  I don't know if I should thank you or curse you,  I am supposed to still be on my Hcg diet, so I was not having anything.  However, my hubby decided he was doing the Restaurant Week dinner.  It looked amazing, so I took a little bite of his beet salad, ohh, perfectly roasted golden and red beets with arugula and goat cheese.  Then he had the Eggplant Torta, OMG, it reminded me of the Melanzana (italian for the Eggplant Torta) my daddy and I used to make on Sundays, I had three bites.  Then it came the Lemon Torte, my willpower caved and I had to have two bites.  I guess I will have to go on the treadmill a little longer this week.  Michael behind the bar was fantastic.  I had a taste of a few wines before settling for the Heavyweight Cabernet.  Zoran, stopped by to say hello, we have something in common, he also has twins.   I can't wait to come back with friends and have the Eggplant Torta again.My husband is going to need a second job to support my love affair with Tommy V's.  Love the new decor (clean and modern) and the staff.  Our visits were almost 2 weeks apart, and we were surprised that not only did the bartender (Lisa) remember us but remembered what we had to drink!And the food...Fantastic happy hour that sadly runs only Mon-Fri and is really more of a lunch menu with salads, pasta dishes, and sandwiches.  The very happy hour menu offers select $5 apps, $5 well & wine, and beer specials.  First time we shared the short rib sliders from the $5 menu as well as risotto carbonara and smoked salmon bruschetta. While the bruschetta was perfectly fine, it was the only thing that didn't wow me.  The sliders (2) were worth twice their price tag and the risotto was incredible with pancetta, parmigiano, and peas.  Weekends offer only the dinner menu.  My husband had the grilled shrimp risotto (yes, he's into risotto thanks to all the Hell's Kitchen viewing this summer).  Although a little pricey ($18), it was well worth it.  Because good things come in threes, I had the hand-made pasta trio ($19):  mushroom and mascarpone tortelli; brie and asiago gnocchi in a brown butter sauce, and spinach ricotta ravioli.  The only bad thing about this dish was I had to offer my husband a bite of each.My diet had been going so well, too.  What a shame it's all over.  See you soon Tommy.02/07/12Met up w/ Violeta for happy hour today, and what a nice change in atmosphere from former Cafe Carumba's!  I really liked the all-glass wine closet display behind the host's desk- what a nice touch!  Cool indoor atmosphere/vibe, as well.  I wouldn't mind spending more happy hours here in the future.I was hungry and thirsty, so I ordered two apps, the short rib sliders and roasted butternut squash ravioli w/ brown butter sage sauce, and a glass of their white wine blend, which had a bit of moscato in it.  Everything was very good!  I'd order all three again, most definitely.  Especially the ravioli and the glass of white blend.  :DHmm... I'm thinking another happy hour here is going on my calendar soon!

Little chunks of dead animal bits on bamboo sticks with seasonings thrown on it then left on a fire for a few minutes...SMART!!Cool new place for Yakitori, a pretty decent selection at decent prices for a decent size. What's not so decent: The flavor. Plenty of deliciousness if you know what to orderLamb - Not very gamey (i like gamey), good fat to meat ratio. lightly dusted with cumin after it's grilled. Very niceChicken Thigh - Not dry, generously seasoned, damn tastyChicken Gizzard - a table favorite, ate over 6 of theseChicken Hearts - they've been butterflied and are slightly on the dry side but not to the point where they're hard and chewy, still perfectly tenderChicken Cartilage - I assumed it was going to be the cartilage from the breast since other places i've been to served it that way. Instead i received the cartilage from the joint of what i'm assuming to be the drumlet. This is a hit or miss depending on personal preference, for me it was a miss as i was expecting something else.Beef - I think it's the ribeye skewer, honestly didnt compare to the others, ribeye is an excellent high quality cut of beef but in my opinion doesnt do very well in this application. chunks of boneless short ribs would have been my choiceScallop - What they lack in size they make up in flavor. these are DAMN TASTY and juicySalmon - SalmonFish Ball - mehBeef Ball - Whoa these are good, lightly brushed with some sauce they're slightly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Some good stuffShiitake Mushroom - Nicely seasoned rehydrated mushroom caps. Garlic Butter Mussels - Order the 12 piece...6 won't last. Passion Fruit Brain Freezer Slushy - Got this with the BeeGee mix which is the Lychee Jelly and the Passion Fruit Jelly. Very good on the size to cost ratio and even a better deal with paired with an entree. I like it better then Tea StationWhat i'd like to see on the menu:- Okra - Chicken Liver- Chicken Cartilage (from the breast)Overall Beegee has a lot of potential once it decides what it wants to be. The menu is part Tea Station part cheaper Ichiza (limited to the Yakitori obviously). The location itself takes advantage of the drive through but i wouldnt consider or recommend ordering anything drive through or take out. Yakitori is ment to be served within minutes of cooking it.Portion sizes are small and priceing is fair and out of everything we ordered there was nothing to complain about taste wise. Everything was nicely seasoned, sometimes overseasoned but not to the point where it was too overwhelming. I would LOVE to come here to snack and socialize. There's enough variety and flavor as well as an comfortable atmosphere to bring a few friends, order a bunch of dead animal parts and share a few laughs. Now if only beer was on the menu and instead of a closing time of 11pm it was adjusted to 1am...oh well wishful thinking.

Review Text :
I've been twice this month. A pretty good sign that I dig it. And although I've oft compared dumplings to lovely lady food, the place is filling. I will agree with many who've said the prices are high given the ingredients, but I'm happy to pay for things that take a gentle hand. I wouldn't dare try stuffing delicious meat and veg into a small pocket, sealing that up, then lightly pan frying it. No way. And so I'm glad someone else has it down. I do with the menu was more protein rich, but on my last trip, I discovered you can take whatever protein they have and add that to whatever dish you like. So for example, if the spicy noodles get you going but you'd like some chicken... ask them. They seem happy to accommodate.

I've been to Kitchen 56 for a couple of happy hours before and the experiences were probably about 3.5 star-worthy.  The outdoor patio is cute, the wine selection is decent, and the happy hour is better than the Vig's if you prefer wine over beer.  This solidly-decent streak was broken last night when seven of us showed up and were told there was no room for us on the patio.  Fine, we took a table in the dining room.  A manager stopped by to apologize for not being able to accomodate our desire to sit outdoors.  We forgave her.Our waiter was surly, telling us he was the one who was "forced" to help us.  I get that it was a wry joke (maybe!) but there was zero humor behind it, and he seemed more genuine than not.  He then informed us that we did not "qualify" for happy hour because we were not seated at the bar or on the patio.  He was so unapologetic that I thought he was joking.  We asked if we could have the special anyway as we were there specifically FOR happy hour and had intended to sit outside if the few tables had not already been taken.  He disappeared to ask and returned with a solid N-O.  We decided that this would not stand, and walked out as multiple members of the waitstaff and the manager watched, expressionless.  Guess they had already made too much money that day and didn't have any more room for ours.The dining room was empty, by the way.  WTF mate?  Seven of us could easily have racked that tab up to $200 in drinks alone, if only they had let us partake of their flimsy happy hour deals (which do not include food specials) for the one hour that was remaining of the special.  Real nice, Kitchen 56.  REAL NICE.They really deserve one star for that as my previous experiences weren't exactly shining examples of service, but, unlike the staff at Kitchen 56, I am feeling a little generous today.The four of us were piled in my brothers car, I grabbed shot gun, as I'm instinctively want to do, quickly plopped into the passenger seat, only to have my little sister backhand the crown of my skull from the rear seat. "Let Mom sit there dick!" she said peevishly "Whose birthday is it again?" my brother chimed in. I let out a groan and climbed out, my mother and I exchanged positions.She sat down next to my brother in the front, as I cast a sidelong glance at my sister. "SO! Where are we going?" My mother asked impatiently.  "It's YOUR birthday, where do you feel like eating??" I asked annoyed. "Oh I don't mind, where do you kids feel like eating?"My brothers knuckles tightnened on the steering wheel, my sister and I exchanged glances and rolled our eyes. We three knew this could go on all night, and the further we pushed her the more she wouldnt budge. I knew personally that the blame would fall on me. Being I am the oldest, and the birthday dinner/movie was my idea. I scrambled in my brain cataloging the bookmarks of places I thought she might deign to eat at."FEZ? Maybe FilmBAR aftertward..?" Weeks earlier I'd made this suggestion to which she responded enthusiastically; and true to her nature, the day her birthday rolls around she's completely forgotten we even spoke about this. I began the routine again. "Fez?" I ask. My sister groans, my brother is silent. "Mmmmm nah.." my mother mused. "How about Durants, we could..." "OH NO NO!! Too expensive!" she said in abject horror cutting me short. "Whaat..? No they're not.." my brother pleaded my case, he obviously wanted steak. "Yeah!" I concurred almost getting offended "I could buy us all filet mignons and a bottle of red wine for under $100!!" I boasted. "No you couldnt." my mother said defiantly. We argued over the price of steak at full volume, my mother screeching at me from the front seat, my brother pivoting his head and joining in. My sister stared out the window until she was just too annoyed to contain her silent fury, a friday evening wasted with her brothers and mom was almost too much to bear.  "LETS JUST DRIVE UNTIL WE FIND A PLACE" she commanded in an imperious voice unfitting of a 14 year old girl. We drove on in silence, passing one good restaurant after another as the street numbers climbed higher and higher. I was quickly outta my element. We came up to 56th st. and The 56 Kitchen stood out like a neon monolith, hewn from rock by the brawn  and sweat of men long dead, it stood there in the distance like it was born to host our evening repast. We all knew, without saying, that this would be our destination. My brother pulled up the car and we wordlessly agreed and filed into the restaurant like a mock execution. The 56 Kitchen. I'd never heard of it, not even the merest bleep on Yelp, yet here it stood. I wondered afterward how a place so tasty could be so far off my radar, it wasnt even, to borrow that piece of shit Guy Frieri's phrase, a 'diner, drive-in, or dive'.  We all ordered like champions, ironically only my Mother's dish wasnt very good. We started with appetizers of "drunk bread" and some hot cakes with pulled pork. The hot cakes were a def. crowd pleaser, the "drunk bread" was..interesting, and while not bad, was...eccentric.  I ordered an "Arcadia Pie", a tasty artisan style thin crust with leeks, bacon, and big dollops of ricotta. My brother ordered a bowl of housemade Pepperdelle style pasta with a creamy pork gravy. My sister opted for the house mac 'n cheese with a side salad. Mum ordered a pizza that my lil' sis' described as a "totino's frozen pizza", underwhelming but tasty and edible none the less. We ordered beers and sat and leisurely enjoyed our meals, sharing from one anothers plates, I ended up eating most of everyones, and even finishing off my brothers pasta in the car, his dish was the obvious winner. When the dust settled the damage came to about $90 some odd dollars. Mother let out a hyperbolic gasp, and I nearly had to find smelling salts, bro and I split the bill down the middle and we all drove back home.Meh! =I Totally neutral is how I left Kitchen 56.  We arrived with reservations and were promptly sat at a high top table in the middle of the restaurant. I was surprised to see It was pretty busy for 8PM on a Friday.  Our server greeted us very briefly and took Hottie's drink order (I wanted to look over the menu) and then left. He seemed pretty frazzled.  About 5 minutes later our drinks were dropped off by someone else, who did not ask if we needed anything.  Another 5 Minutes pass and a female server comes to our table and asks if we are ready to order. No, "Hi my name is"... "let me tell you about the menu", nothing!  I told her I would like to order a drink and she seemed annoyed, like I was being rude.  She took my drink order and our appetizer order and left.  We started with the Onion straws, a little greasy but overall pretty tasty especially because the sauce was fantastic.  For my cocktail I had a Maple Manhattan, which was so delicious one of the best Manhattan's I've had.   For dinner I ordered their tofu and vegetable stir fry with Soba Noodles. This had received good reviews from fellow yelpers so I was excited to try it.  I was greatly disappointed. The noodles were over cooked, it had no flavor except ginger and there were no vegetables in it except red cabbage.  I never send anything back, but I did. This of course took about 10 minutes, because our server never came back to check on us. I flagged down a manager and she suggested the green chili macaroni.  By the time this came out, Hottie had already finished his meal and his plate had been taken. This kind of kills the dining experience.  When the macaroni came out, it was much better, great flavor and just the right amount of creaminess and spice. Again the noodles were a little over cooked; they were breaking apart, but still edible. Overall, the service was pretty poor, but being a former Server I could tell that they were all "In the weeds" so I gave her a break, and still left a 30% tip.  The food was good, but not great.  I think I would try Kitchen 56 again under the right circumstances, but with so many other options in the area, it won't be anytime soon.Totally disappointed on so many levels with this place.  I went there last night  excited to finally try the place since I drive past it on my way to and from work everyday.  When it is all lit up at night it just seems so inviting.  I was meeting a friend to talk business and we arrived a bit before 830. My experience started off bad and just went downhill from there.  When we walked in all the booths were taken but none of the tables in the dining room nor the 2 tables along the back wall that each seat 6 but have the comfy booth seats on one side.  We asked to be seated there but was told they needed to keep them open in case a large party came in.  Seriously?   It was a Wednesday night at 830, there would have been plenty of seating if a party larger than our meager 2 top came in.  Strike 1.Next our server Lissa did come by quickly to ask if we wanted to order, we asked for a few minutes.  I also asked what the soup of the day was, butternut squash, mmmmm! Those few minutes turned into more than a few and another server asked if we needed anything and ended up taking our order.  I ordered the soup and tuna tartar.  Lissa then came back to the table to inform us that they were out of the soup of the day.  Strike 2.  I order a side of vegetables instead.Lissa refills my water glass, brownie points for that, but spills some not only on the table but my hand.  She doesn't apologize, clean it up, nothing, just walks away.  Strike 3.My companion gets the edamame, which were not bad but the bowl that they were served in had a serious chip on the rim.  It was bad enough to cut someone if you weren't careful.  Strike 4.My tuna tartar was pretty terrible, a few chunks of chewy fish that were somewhat grey in color hidden among some greens that had way to many capers which made it super salty,  I ate a little less than half of it because I was so hungry and didn't want to deal with sending it back.  Strike 5.Next up the sorry ass, poor excuse for a side of vegetables,  When Lissa set down in front of me this tiny dish with wilted spinach and 1 piece of squash that was quartered and 1 piece of zucchini that was quartered I couldn't believe it.  There was a layer of spinach water at the bottom and it tasted like it was seasoned with Mrs. Dash.  Again I ate it because I was starving but realizing that each bite basically cost me a dollar, it was 5 bucks. Strike 6.Not even done yet......At 9:30 Lissa asks us if we want anything else, my companion informs her that her boyfriend will be joining us in a few minutes to get some dinner.  We are informed that the kitchen is closed.  There were still people in the place and from what I gathered from the website the kitchen closes "when the party is over."  So now my companion is on Yelp trying to find another place to go meet him so he can eat,  Strike 7.She finds a place not far and is going to meet her man by 10 because we still had some business to discuss.  I said she could just go so he didn't have to wait but always the professional, she stayed so we could wrap up our meeting.At 945 some people walk in, are seated and given menus.  I ask the server that helped them, a very nice gentleman, if they were going to be eating because we were told the kitchen was closed.  He went and checked and apologized for the mix-up but the kitchen was still open.  Strike 8.  I wish that guy was our server because he was great. I also see him speak to Lissa, who glances at our table but she never comes over herself to apologize.  I think she was in a hurry to clock out.  Strike 9When Lissa brings us our bill, the soup that they were out of, was still on it.  When I point this out to her she states since I got the side of vegetables, which wasn't on the bill, she just left the soup in place of it.  First, from a management prospective, you have to keep track of everything that is served to figure out your food and production cost.  Second, it was just plain laziness to not correct the bill.  Strike 10.Furthermore the soup was 7 and the vegetables 5, a cost difference that I pointed out to her.  She said she would take care of it.  She brings back the bill and say, "Ok they took a dollar off."  Are you kidding me?!  You can't subtract 5 from 7?!  Strike 11.I am so done with this place at this point I leave a chintzy $5 tip, I really wanted to leave nothing, but the old school server in me wouldn't allow it.  I left feeling cheated out of $70 and will never go back.

Restaurant name  Mozart Cafe & Bakery
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I stumbled into Mozart Cafe unexpectedly with twenty five minutes to spare mid-afternoon on a week day. I had pulled into the shopping area where my nail salon is and was positively ravenous. My eyes caught mention of "kosher, vegetarian and wifi" as I walked past the outdoor seating.I didn't mean to make an entrance. Conversation stopped as an orderly room of eyes peered up at me. I'm not quite sure what prompted it. I can only explain my observations of the patrons, and then my wonderful dining experience. My only regret is that I was short on time and couldn't linger. The food was fresh, delightful, prepared efficiently fast as was my strong turkish coffee. As I stood in the entry way my first thought was, "Oh dear. Where am I? Should I be here?" Stunned silence filled the room. I felt shy looking for a hostess. (I wasn't sure if I should approach the bakery counter, or seat myself. You can seat yourself.) I noticed women wearing head coverings, which ranged from scarfs, wigs to small hats. The men that day were wearing button down shirts.Seated, an incredibly gracious host helped select the Spicy Tunisian panini to go with soup. A complete steal for $8. (1/2 sandwich.) Albacore tuna (ala the style from my childhood), boiled eggs, kalamata olives, potato was presented on a crispy panini. Perfectly grilled. I enjoyed it so much I almost forgot to eat my large bowl of soup. The soup itself is worthy of a meal. Dining solo I was privy to the conversations in the room. Bits of French and German wafted my way. Patrons ordered loafs of kosher bread from the wall. The Torah was discussed.And then, just as I was wrapping up my meal, a gentleman right behind me. Clearly hailing from New York answered his phone.  (I'm from there and familiar with the accents.) "Yes Mom! YES. It's me. You called me, remember?"[Loudly]"Ok. OK. No. NO.You'll have to ask Ira to do that.I said IRA.Whaaat?Ok, never mind. I'll do it myself.I SAID. I'll call IRA. I'll Call IRA."So I think this is a place you can meet a nice Jewish boy.Some folk go broke from gambling, other folk go broke from indulging in luxury. I'ma be, I'ma be broke from eating out.  $7.00 for a small slice of old cheesecake. Daaayum! Well I was feeling a bit inebriated when I walked in, but I sobered up quick.It's hard to think of Mozart as a cafe because the menu offers breakfast and supper plates which include salmon, tilapia, pasta, and pizza dishes. There are also several choices of salads. It's a perfect - restaurant - for vegetarian and pescatarian foodies. Everything on the menu sounded good and I really wanted one of each item, but they would have had to lock me in overnight and return the next morning to find me still sitting there trying to finish eating.  Decisions...I went with a couple of easy prep sandwiches.The satisfying one:Sabich Pita ($11) - eggplant, potato, tomato, cucumber, hummus, tahini, mango curry sauce, sans egg- skimpy on the hummus- not like the mango curry- good tahini but it was light coloured and creamy as if something was mixed in.Couldn't get no satisfaction:Eggplant Chile Panini ($11) - eggplant, garlic, tomato, basil, chili sauce, parmesan - did not taste basil- did not taste chile sauce- did not taste parmesan- oily eggplantBoth sandwiches came with side salads made of fresh field greens and radish. Good salad, but didn't care much for the lemonish oily dressing. Would have prefered more tahini.

Restaurant name  Ah Hai Sushi & Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I am always afraid to try out new Sushi restaurants, but thanks to a recommendation from a friend and some good Yelp reviews I decided to give Ah Hai a try. My son and I are the only ones in our family who like sushi so I persuaded him to come to lunch with me today since I had a Val-Pak coupon for 50% off a second lunch bento box. I really enjoyed the miso and salad that started off our meal. My only suggestion is maybe to order the dressing on the side since there was a pretty fair amount on there even though it was delicious. The bento lunch itself was pretty large and everything tasted very good and the California rolls tasted very fresh. In fact I can't wait to go back and try some of the rolls.They have a great happy hour as well and since this place is right around the corner from my house I am sure I will be back to give it a try.Food (from HH menu):Albacore Nigiri: 3.5 starsSmooth, good sized piece & tasty. Tuna Nirgiri: 3 starsFresh, no fishy smell / taste & good portion size.Salmon Skin Roll: 2.5 starsThere wasn't much salmon skin inside of the rolls but more rice surrounding all of the rolls than anything. Squid Salad: 3 starsThe squid in this salad tasted exactly like the squid salad mixture that Costco has, except this had extra greens on the bottom of the mixture.Dynamite Roll (Cali roll w/ baked crab on top): 3 starsThis had way too much rice & sauce on top which overwhelmed the whole roll. Overall: clean place with good atmosphere & good sized portioned food here. If you like rolls more than sashimi then you'll like this place. =)  Service: Very slow, they forgot to check on us during the meal & we had to wave them down several times for water. -1Tip:HH: M-F 4:30- ClosingSat & Sun: 3PM - Closing

I just stumbled across this hidden jewel today by accident! I saw it and decided to walk in and grab a menu to check out their offerings. The smell was irresistible, I then decided I must order something and give them a try! I had my Sister and friends with me and we were hungry so it was the perfect time to taste some of the goods! We ordered the special $7.99 for a 16' pizza with one topping, so we ordered two an Italian sausage and a pepperoni. The toppings were generous and delicious! The sauce fresh and flavorful indeed! The crust was good as well, tasty with a nice consistency for all of you crust eaters! lol The restaurant is very hip and is a very comfortable environment to dine in and eat as well. Not only can you dine in and enjoy a meal, they also provide delivery and take out. The Owner is super nice, not to mention easy on the eyes! :) The staff is Amazing and friendly and the food is great! I can't wait to get back to try one of their strombolis or a gyro or a greek platter or sandwich! So many delicious options!Check this place out!!!!! They are new have only been around approximately 6 months or so. I will be back for sure!!!

Review Text :
My wife has become addicted to the Cook Out "peach cobbler" milkshake. So when I was visiting her near Uptown, I popped over to this Cookout to pick one up. Firstly, this is a sketch neighborhood. I did not feel at all comfortable here with a "bars on the windows" vibe. But the Cook Out itself is a bright shining diamond in this rough.As for the shake, she pronounced it "meh." Unimpressed with not enough peach in it and the few bits were too small.Note that there are TWO drive through lanes. The outside one is a bit complicated so if you don't get it, stick with the inside one.

Restaurant name  Rush Espresso Cafe and Wine Bar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Rush is my go-to coffee spot when I'm at the office and can get away for a little while. When you walk in, you immediately notice the modern, European aesthetic: lots of sleek black and metal accented by splashes of red. Most coffee shops tend toward the cozy, which is not a bad thing, but Rush's approach is welcome.Fortunately, the coffee is high-quality as well (and also European). I have to admit, I didn't really care for the brew when they were serving Illy, but LaVazza is a much better label according to my taste buds. Two more things I appreciate about Rush: the loyalty punch-cards and the fact that the owner remembers my name, even though I am sure he has customers who are much more frequent visitors than I.If you're in Ballantyne, Rush should be high on your list of coffee options.This place is adorable. I am a coffee addict and especially love a good locally owned shop. I came in here early before class to grab a quick study session. There are probably ten to twelve tables but they do have a wonderful outdoor seating area that is a pretty decent size. They have great food and coffee (duh!)  I came in and had the power bagel. I think it was called that. Anyways it had ham, Swiss, avavado, tomato, spinach, an cream cheese. What a great way to start the morning! I have had coffee wise two different drinks. The vanilla latte which was so amazing. They serve their coffee drinks in clear glass glasses and do a beautiful little design on top of the foam. I have also had the chai tea latte. I found the chai tea to be a little more sweet than I typically like it so I didn't finish it. They have a choice of vanilla spice or regular spice and maybe I had the vanilla. The location is great and seems to be convenient to everything!! Love this place and look forward to trying every drink they offer!I always enjoy having coffee when it's not from the green lady people and Rush does an excellent double espresso. Just as good? The lemon cheese pastry with a side of sweetened cream cheese. Delicious!I sat here at Rush for about an hour and used a good amount of their wifi while drinking my coffee and eating that pastry. Mostly decent music played and there were several interesting conversations going on that kept me entertained.Cold morning, so the outside seats weren't occupied and there were still a couple of two-tops available inside. I liked this place!

Did the waiter just asked me if I wanted ice water? Yes, yes he did! How dare he ask such a foreign question! It should be automatic if you know how the real Viets roll!The unusual warm service was smothering my nonchalant, I-just-want-to-eat-good-pho mood.  Its very uncharacteristic when you compare them to the rest of the Viet joints in the valley.  No big deal, I guess, but if you are going to impress me, do it through your food. ;-)I also didn't expect the waiter to sell me on trying the ever so popular Spring Roll that exist in every Viet menu.  I appreciate the smiley attitude and extra mile but I GOT THIS! I'm Asian afterfall! ;-)Anyways, I ended up ordering the Banh Xeo and #1 Pho Dac Biet.  + The Banh Xeo had the right texture and taste.  The pork and shrimp filling was seasoned and cooked nicely.  The veggies that came with it was pretty fresh.  The homemade fish sauce tasted perfect.+ The Pho that came with the usual tripe, beef brisket, steak, and meatball was a bit of a letdown.  The most important element in a Pho is always the broth, which in this case lacked the beefiness.To compound the blandness even further, the steak meat was too well done while the rest of the meats were mostly mediocre.   Some minor PROS went to their semi-swanky bar with a few LCDs and DirectTV subscription for watching sports and a spacious, sparkling clean decor.  The question remains, would I return? Sadly no, Pho truly does make or break my decision on every Viet establishment.  Sorry PD! Its just that those other places know how to please me! :-)A new favorite! Excellent service, clean, great prices and delicious food!I had the fresh spring rolls and white meat chicken pho. The chicken was in manageable pieces (almost "pulled") and the noodle-to-broth ratio was perfect. I will definitely be back!(minimum $10 for debit/credit cards)

Review Text :
Peaceful, bright and pretty space full of greenery in the middle of a contentious and crumbling cavernous strip of industrial de Gaspe. I didn't expect to notice the subtlety of the coffee - I guess I suspected I'd swilled way too much to have much sensitivity left - but the layers of flavors did stop me in my tracks. I sat down on the steps in the sun to savor it slowly, and was thankful for the moment of zen.Beautiful siphon coffee - just beautiful. A rare perfect cup in the city. The open, concrete, warehousey space is nicely designed with a clean, pared down black, white and grey colour scheme and some vintage industrial decor items like old cast iron sewing machines, loved leather chairs and drawing table swivel chairs at a large wooden table in the centre. Also, fab large scale art. I haven't yet tried the food, other than a brownie (which was good but it's hard to go wrong with brownies), but I know I'll be going back to try it out. Wide open kitchen, and everything looks fresh and clean. If you're looking to hang out sipping coffee with your laptop, don't go at lunchtime - there's no wifi during lunch and there are no outlets anywhere, so go fully charged when you do go. Bonus: lots of galleries on the street to also visit.

Restaurant name  Big Wong Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I like Big Wong and I cannot lie. This strangely named restaurant just opened today. If you happen to catch this review soon enough, you can drop in and get a free entree with the purchase of a $1 soda or bottled water. It's for dine-in only and is valid through May 18.I stopped by for lunch and ordered the Authentic Curry Chicken Over Rice. This dish normally costs $4.95 but was free with my $1 can of ginger ale. So how was it? It was actually very good. For $4.95, it's a great deal. For free, it's a steal!Everything on their menu is $4.95 with one item coming in at $3.95. You'd think that you were looking at the lunch menu, but no my friends. This is their regular menu. If this place was open after midnight, it would be the new unquestioned late night king.I'm inclined to give this place four stars based on the one dish I've tried so far, and the extremely fast and friendly service. Add in the fact that everything is under $5 - oh and that's tax included - and I'm glad to bump that up to a fiver.I went to Big Wong Restaurant for a Meetup (Sushi & More) gathering, met some diverse and interesting folks and we for the most part enjoyed the meal we had during their opening $1 promotion.My first visit was on the evening of the opening day.  The place was packed already by about 7pm, and I was glad I grabbed a 6-top for our 7:30pm get together.  Service was hectic, but that is to be expected with the place being so slammed from everyone and their coworker's grandmother stopping by to check out the new Chinese restaurant near the corner of Decatur and Spring Mountain, which serves basically Malaysian, Taiwanese, Cantonese and a little Asian fusion food.The thing I immediately like about Big Wong is that it has a very basic menu of 17 entrees, which can be consolidated to just 7 main items (i.e., steamed chicken, fried chicken, fried pork chop, curry chicken, wontons, thin ribeye, shrimp). Personally I think the biggest common  mistake restaurateurs make is having way too much items on the menu, where their kitchen is not able to perfect them all.  Better to have a smaller menu and make them all perfectly, I say.Anyway, I ordered the Hoi Nam Chicken (boneless dark meat) Over Rice - dish with origin in Chinese's Hainanese regional cuisine, which is also very popular in Malaysia and Singaporean due to Chinese immigrants to those countries. The chicken is fine, but I prefer my rice to be more "seasoned".I have also tried the Fried Chicken Over Rice (boneless) - I really like this one, as the chicken is fried well and is still juicy.  I know I will order this in the future.The Fired Pork Chop was disappointing for me.  I was expecting it to be more tender and juicy, but it was on the tough side. The minced pork sauce that it was served with help me finish the entree, but I will most likely not try this again.The Curry with Roti looks good when my dining companions ordered it.  I will try that next time, besides what is not to like about Roti!  The curry itself can be a little less on the "greasy" side, but other than that I heard the flavor was good.Now that the $1 drink + free entree grand opening promotion is over, we will see if the restaurant can sustain the buzz and continue to draw in a steady flow of customers.  I think at $4.95 (inclusive of tax) it is hard to find a better meal deal cheaper at a sit down restaurant.And for those who are expecting this to be just another typical Chinese take-out restaurant, you will most likely be disappointed with their menu selection.  You will not find Kung-Pao Chicken or Egg Rolls here. But if you are down to try some different kind of Chinese regional dishes, this is a good place to start without breaking the bank.------Version 1.0.1 Update------Came here after hearing about their House Special Shrimp Wontons from Nelson Q and reading his review.  When I arrived I was told that they also have new menu items that just got added today (Beef Ramen, Shrimp Ramen or Udon and Malaysian Beef Curry over Rice).I was pretty set to try the shrimp wonton, which was pure shrimp in wonton wrapper.  Yum! The Shrimp Wonton Udon also comes with vegetables, so it is a pretty complete meal.The new Beef Ramen (made with tender braised beef briskets and tendons) was very good.  The beef broth has a nice flavor, and the brisket and tendons were braised for hours until they are perfectly soft and tender.  It also comes with a really generous portion of ramen, the same kind sourced by Monta Ramen. At $5.95 it is a very good deal, based on the combination of taste, portion size and good culinary execution plus the hours and TLC dedicated to braising the chunks of beef brisket and tendons.  I can see this new Big Wong Beef Ramen as the new featured franchise item for the restaurant.5-29-2011------Version 1.0.1 Update------Note:  They also have Japanese ramen noodles, which you can substitute for the odon noodles. It is not on the menu, but the manager told me it is available.------Version 1.0.2 Update------Big Wong still serves up solid and wholesome Chinese food, my many repeat visits are proof enough.  One of my favorite is the Steamed Chicken, Mushroom and Chinese Sausage. The congee is great, especially on days when I am not my usual ravenous world devouring self. 12-1-2011 (Update reminder courtesy of Warren P)------Version 1.0.2 Update------Decor:  3/5  More attention was used in fitting the 68 seats in the restaurant than the overall look.Food:  4/5  Now offering soups, appetizers, congee and even desserts!Location:  4/5  Pretty convenient for those working, shopping or living near the Chinatown area.Price:  5/5  $4.95 including tax is a good deal for a full meal.  They are definitely going for volume and not high margin per order.  Great for customers and I hope it works out for the restaurant.We couldn't resist Big Wong's Grand Opening special - Purchase $1 beverage and get your meal free!We were concerned with how packed this place would be during their opening week, but we easily got a table with no wait.  Lucky us...the news was just spreading!What surprised us most was the pleasant and welcoming reception we received when we walked in.  Yes, it may have had to do with the non-Asian face smiling at us as we walked in, but it definitely gave us a different impression of how our meal was going to be.Getting our drink beverage orders out of the way, it was easy to decide amongst their 15 item menu.I went for their Hoi Nam Chicken ($4.95).  They have three variations of it and I went for the Boneless Dark Meat version.  It was surprisingly moist and decent portioned.  Yes, I've had better and I've also had a lot worse (especially in Vegas) but it was decent.  The seasoned rice that accompanied it could be a bit more seasoned but it worked.The Husband had their Shrimp Wonton Soup ($4.95).  This soup came with six generous all shrimp dumplings and some Chinese vegetables.  You have to give them credit for making it a very shrimpy dumpling with no filler.  We didn't realize that their grand opening special was limited to one per person per visit, so we went ahead and ordered another beverage to score a couple more free entrees.This time I went for the Curry Chicken with Roti Pancakes ($4.95).  I loved their version of the roti, not overly greasy and had a nice flaky texture and crunch.  The curry with chicken and potatoes had a good flavor too.The Husband tried their Deep Fried Pork Chop ($4.95) and found it to be disappointing.  It wasn't quite what we expected and it was dried out.  Too bad about that one.  (Apparently you have to request crispy if you want it that way...but that's news to us!)When it came time to pay, we then discovered that we were going to be charged for the second entrees.  Due to a waitress's mistake, they took it off the bill without any hassle, which is something we really appreciated.  They didn't even charge us for the second round of beverages, rather telling us to leave it for our server instead.  Now, you gotta love that! Overall, you can't complain for the price you're getting.  A decent size portion for less than five bucks, and that's including tax!  (I heard they are adding to their menu next week, so we'll see how that goes.)  A quick bite without the fuss - a simple and straight forward menu!3.5 stars.Its a little awkward telling someone you just ate at Big Wong...."You just ate a big.....what?" HA HA HACheap Chinese Food doesn't have a positive ring to it. But this place is all about good food, good prices, good quality. Most Chinese restaurants are overly greasy and leave you with a less than satisfactory taste of MSG. But you'll leave Big Wong's with a full tummy and they won't put a dent in your bank account.Right next door to Monta, they're not there to have a ramen battle. Their ramen is NOT Japanese style; its a cross between pho & oxtail soup with ramen noodles thrown in. But there's so much variety, be sure to try the rest of the menu--99% of it is $4.95. So don't be cheap and order a few different dishes. A few suggestions: crispy shrimp wontons, salt & pepper wings, & the chicken curry.Happy NOM-ing.TIP: Call ahead! They do take-out and they use quality containers, not those cheesy chinese-y boxes.We went here for the first time after the Elite Event at PJ Clarke's with a bunch of other Yelpers.  The predominant thought running through my head after looking at this menu was "Why the hell did it take me so long to come here??".Super cheap prices!  You could spend more and get far less at any fast food restaurant.  I got the Hai Nam chicken and my wife for the shrimp soup with udon.  Both were very tasty and filling.  We finished up our meal splitting an almond jello dessert for a whopping bill of $11.20.Great, friendly service too.  The staff knew a lot of the guys in the group by name.  The owner came in to say hello and gave us a few plates of shrimp wonton appetizers on the house.  There were so many other dishes that looked great.  A lot of people in the group doubled up on entrees since they were so cheap and I look forward to trying more of the menu.  Consider me a Big Wong believer!!I haven't been back to Big Wong's since their grand opening. I finally made my way back last night in need of some cheap eats and I'm sad I haven't been back sooner. We ordered the curry chicken with roti, beef ramen and sweet roti for dessert. They have a much more extensive menu than before and they also have daily specials that look delightful. All the food is still incredibly cheap for the portions and quality, which you just can't argue with. I enjoyed this visit quite a bit more than our first visit and I'm already craving some more of their cheap eats. There aren't many places that you can have a sit down meal, including dessert and a drink for under $14 and still leave satisfied. Sometimes good prices makes food just taste that much better.Big Wong can get in this belly anytime.Their menu is simple, easy and cheap.After reading several reviews and seeing several of yelp friends visit this place, it was time for me to give this place a try. What I loved:The desert rotis.The plain rotis.The chicken curry.The shrimp wonton soup.What I liked:The salt and pepper chicken wings. The beef and tendon ramen.What can I say? Good, decent food at cheap prices. I will definitely be back time and time again. To go ordering is simple and so fast and painless.Like a dubbed old school low budget kung fu movie, Big Wong keeps it simple with good menu selections and low prices.Was gonna go to SnowFlake Shavery but didn't have dinner yet so we decided to check out this Wong place. After looking over the menu, I was astounded by how simple it was laid out and explained. Most dishes were around the 5 to 6 dollar range. I was excited that it was pretty cheap and at the same time cautious because of the quality you might get because of it. First visit I ordered the Shrimp Wonton with Udon noodles and the wifey ordered the Rice Vermiccelli Noodle Soup which she shared with my youngest son. We were all amazed at how hot and fresh both dishes were especially with how fast we received it too. The Shrimp Wonton mixed with Udon Noodles were some of the best Wonton I have had in a while. As for the the other dish my wife and son shared, it was basically a pho bowl, which was pretty good as well.I was impressed so we came back the next day for lunch to try some of the other items. Our second visit verified that this place was gonna be one of our go to places for good, cheap fast food. What we got this time was the Beef Ramen, Salt n Pepper Porkchop, and Thinly Sliced Ribeye over Rice.  The Beef Ramen has your basic Ramen Noodles accompanied by tender chunks of Beef Brisket which gave the overall taste of the soup tremendous flavor. The Salt n Pepper Porkchop was exactly that. A deep fried Porkchop lightly coated in salt and pepper, then sliced and garnished with thinly sliced sauteed jalapenos. When you bite into it, all the flavors put together are like a really good orchestra playing in your mouth. I asked for some sweet chili sauce on the side to dip it in and some steamed white rice to accompany it. As for the Thinly Sliced Ribeye, it comes with an au jus type of of gravy to dip it in and then you eat it it with the steamed white rice. Really good flavors from this as well.The overall total with tax and tip was around 20 dollars. Not bad for all the food I just mentioned! Service was decent. They would come around refilling our drinks every so often so I never really had to ask for any refills. So if you want good food at low prices with decent service, you can't go wrong at Big Wongs! (Pun intended)Great place to come for good, cheap food but because of recent service experiences I'm sad to have to downgrade them because it's no longer of 4 star quality overall when you factor in their terrible customer service. If you want take out be sure to call your order in before showing up to avoid being questioned why you didn't call in advance. And when dining in, don't ask for split checks because this just pisses off the lady too and she'll likely tell you off like she did to us. Prices also have gone up in the last few months because they now charge sales tax, whereas before it was always included in the price.I usually get the same few things when coming here: hoi nam chicken w/ seasoned rice, fried chicken or the chicken wings. I've been avoiding the fried items lately because I'm always told that it takes an extra 20-30 min...is it never prepped in advance? Very odd. The only thing I would NOT recommend getting is the beef ramen because this is a Chinese place and they don't make it right. I think they're only offering it to compete with Monta next door and it's definitely not worth getting despite the cheap $5.95 price tag.People think this place is fast but it's really not. I'm always waiting a while for my food whether I'm dining in or taking out. There is usually only 1 server and a couple of kitchen staff which is likely why...Not sure why the people working here are always so grouchy...especially the lady that serves the food!We're two of the few Yelpers who are not habitues of Chinatown, mostly because when I eat out I like atmosphere, and when we want Chinese food we usually do take-out from the local place.  But we came here after our Airbnb friend and fellow Yelper, Chan, hosted a Meetup for LV Airbnb hosts and also set up a UYE for Big Wong.  And we were delighted to participate in this trifecta:  meeting new local hosts, meeting Yelper Antonia R., and getting to try a new Asian restaurant to add to our woefully inadequate go-to list.True to form, Big Wong lacks atmosphere, but makes it up with an interesting menu and very cheap prices.  Sure, some of the dishes are small, but the low cost lets you try a greater variety of their offerings.I ordered the Shrimp Soup with noodles.  My husband, who was suddenly gripped with some mysterious illness (not food related!!), needed some broth, so he ordered a plain cup of chicken broth and I shared the huge quantity of noodles in my soup.  But after seeing the wonton in someone else's shrimp soup, which looked fabulous, I was sorry I hadn't gone for that one.  Still, my soup was amazing, and a great size for the 4.95 price.  Next time it'll be the wonton version.  We also got a Curry Chicken with Roti pancakes, and I loved that combination; it was a big change from the usual rice. Unfortunately for me, the hubs wasn't so sick that he gobbled it all up before I could get more than one bite of chicken, but that one nibble was moist and tender.  I also got to sample the baby bok choy in garlic that Chan ordered, something that I had never knew existed, and it was astounding.  We probably would have ordered another dish if hubby had been feeling better, but it was a good start to what I know is going to be a regular stop on the Silk Road.Today I received an email from Yelp HQ advising that my review of Big Wong, from last March, has been removed due to not being detailed enough about my experience at this restaurant. The purpose of me sharing reviews is to share my experiences; whether it be Exceptional, Good, Bad, or Ugly.  So now as a Yelp "Newbie" I've learned that a one liner is not enough. My review read..."The food was cheap and good tasting, but the service sucked!"Big Wong is a small hidden gem of a place near ChinaTown located in a crowded U-shaped strip mall off Spring Mountain, just west of Decatur, on the north side of the street.  We went for dinner last March in search of inexpensive Chinese food that would taste great! Thanks to fellow Yelpers, we got what we asked for, and then some...The restaurant is small and the tables are crowded together. The food were small appetizer portions and we sampled at least a dozen types. Most people would spend $10 bucks or less to eat here, but our bill came to over $50 because we sampled foods we were familiar with and foods we never heard of. Overall, the food was good, yet as mentioned; appetizer portions.  One lady serving at least 20 tables packed with people. She had zero personality, despite me trying to hopefully cheer her up with some jokes, etc. I asked if they had Big Wong T-shirts for sale, similar to the one she was wearing. She apparently thought I was making fun of her, as my question was ignored. I was sincere, as I would honestly wear one of those T-shirts offering them free advertising every time I wore it. When asking about the most popular dishes on the menu, she told me to make my own decision and walked away. Perhaps, she was just having a bad day as her fellow co-workers called in sick or something. I suppose it would be fair to read other reviews and look for references of the wait staff service.One guy working in the back as the chef. He was hustling with the woks and pots and pans, really producing some efforts for the hungry patrons that were pleasured by our lovely waitress. He really did a good job, but clearly understaffed for some help.Would we return? Only if they decide to sell T-shirts and we were once again in search of a Chinese restaurant that was cheap and good tasting, but the service must NOT suck!Better than a 1 liner? If you think so, please review with a U for Useful, F for Funny and/or C for Cool.  Thanks for reading my review of Big Wong.

Restaurant name  ShinBay
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
In one word, ShinBay is AMAZING!!!  Let me preface this review by saying that this is NOT a typical sushi bar, it is a gourmet Japanese restaurant, so if it's specialty sushi rolls that you're looking for, head to Geisha A Go Go or any of the other sushi spots that serve deep-fried, cream cheese laden, Americanized sushi as you will not find such fare here.  Rather, what you will find are some of the highest quality and most unique dishes that I can honestly say I've ever had paired with exceptional service. We decided to sit at the sushi bar, at which the manager had graciously reserved us prime seating.  My husband and I opted for the seven course chef's tasting as we've found that this is usually the best way to get a feel for what a new restaurant has to offer.  The courses that we had are summarized as follows:1.  Chilled asparagus soup - light and flavorful, left us looking forward to the courses ahead.2.  Scorpionfish carpaccio - the fish itself as well as the sauce it was served in had excellent flavor, I could have eaten a whole plate of this as an entree.3.  Sashimi sampler - a beautifully presented plate of six entirely different preparations of six different sashimis (including things we'd never had before such as giant clam and Japanese sea scallops), each having it's own unique flavors.  We watched this dish being prepared while we were consuming the first two courses and it took over 15 minutes just to prepare this one course.  The attention to detail and presentation was unbelievable!  4.  Steamed manilla clams with 5 types of Japanese mushrooms, served in their own broth - this dish actually derives its incredible flavor simply from steaming the clams and mushrooms together.  So delicious!5.  Foie gras wrapped in halibut - this Japanese "fondue-style" dish was incredible!  Our waiter brought out bite sized pieces of foie gras wrapped in a thin piece of halibut and served on a pick with a variety of dipping sauces and then brought us each a wooden box which housed the flame that heated a paper-lined wire mesh basket containing sake and water in which we placed each skewer for approximately 30 seconds before eating.  The foie gras absolutely melted in my mouth!6. Nigiri sushi - two separate plates (perhaps even two courses) of the highest quality Nigiri that I've ever had.  We inquired with the manager as to where the chef gets such high quality fish and were told that he has his fish flown in daily, which explains how such a small restaurant can have such amazingly fresh fish.7.  Japanese egg custard with fresh fruit - light, fluffy, and the perfect end to a perfect meal.  We aren't typically "dessert people" and rarely order dessert at a restaurant, but this was delicious!The chef's tasting that we had was $130 per person and without a doubt, was worth every penny.  We typically don't splurge quite that much when dining out and it would certainly be possible to order items a la carte and keep the cost to $50-$70 per person.  If you've read any of my other Yelp reviews, I think it's apparent that I do not gush about mediocre restaurants and am probably a bit harsher in my reviews than most are, but I can honestly say that if it were possible to give ShinBay six stars, I would.  We will be back soon and often.  I'm so glad that we found this gem!I have to agree with every word that Michelle G. said...AMAZING only scratches the surface!  My friend and I usually go to another sushi restaurant, but it was closed on Sunday, so I pulled out Phoenix Magazine Best New Restaurants and thankfully we found ShinBay!  The restaurant is tucked away in the Scottsdale Seville, and the atmosphere is very clean lines, modern, fantastic!Our server Meredith, and another server (I'm so sorry I forgot your name) helped us navigate the small menu...when I small, it is not to offend.  I believe a menu should reflect one cuisine and every single item should be able to done to perfection.  In this case, this small menu does not disappoint!  Meredith suggested a wonderful wine, a crisp, fruity Sauv Blanc to go along with our ShinBay tasting menu.  1.  We started with a trio of cold items....Tuna tar tare with pine nuts and avocado (melt in your mouth, the pine nuts added a different spin on the typical tar tare), Halibut sashimi in miso, and a charred Scallop on heirloom tomato with truffle oil, truffle salt, and thinly sliced truffles.  I am normally not a truffle lover, but this knocked my socks off!  Each item was seasoned to perfection and delicious!2.  The hot course was Wagyu  beef served with a Japanese ceramic grill.  It was accompanied by oyster mushrooms, Himalayan sea salt and ShinBay's variation on steak sauce.  This was an interactive course.  The grill is presented sizzling hot, you add a bit of the beef fat to the grill to season it, then you start grillin'!  Cindy and I had a great time preparing everything, and I am sure the expressions on our face were priceless to the staff!3.  The third course was a compilation of fresh nigiri.  You will have to forgive me, I can't remember their exact names...each piece was meant to escalate from lightest tasting to the fattiest.  Again, I don't intend to offend by stating "fattiest".  In this case this was Toro, which literally melted in my mouth!  We actually started with the Toro and went backwards.  Next was shrimp, a "sardine" like fish but less oily, tuna, and then something similar to yellowtail.  Each piece was seasoned again to perfection to enhance the fish.  There was just enough ginger to cleanse your palate after each piece!  No need for wasabi and soy sauce AT ALL!!4.  The final course was a Japanese custard with black sugar cane syrup and fresh fruit.  I love Creme Brulee and this was light and delicious, the perfect ending!On a Sunday night, we were the only patrons, so we chatted with everyone there.  They were all so kind and we had a fantastic time!  You have to forgive me for not remembering everyone's names, but your wine selections were spot on!!Thanks for an amazing Sushi experience!!I broke my cardinal rule of dining, which is never eat sushi/sashimi/Japanese food outside of California or Manhattan in the U.S., because the reviews of this place were so solid that I had to try it.ShinBay blew my mind (in a super fantastical way). We did the 4 course tasting menu (we couldn't call ahead to reserve a bigger tasting menu because we only found this place online 3 hours before dinner on our last night in Scottsdale). We also got a bottle of sake from the less expensive menu. Every course was ridiculously amazing. The uni alone changed my world. It is the best sushi I have ever eaten in my life, and it may have ruined me for lesser places.I will seriously fly back to Scottsdale just to eat here again, and I'm not that big a high roller. It's just worth it.

Restaurant name  Winghart's Burger & Whiskey Bar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
As most of you all know, this burger joint is my jam! I will argue with anyone who crosses my path and tells me this place doesn't have the best burger in the Burgh. So don't get in the way of me and my Winghart's burger!The real deal behind my update is that they've updated... their space! Yes, it may still be a narrow space to wiggle yourself into downstairs, but now the upstairs is open, which offers you even more space to squeeze into! I say squeeze because it's still unbelievably busy, regardless of the day or time. But that's the price you pay for having legit tasting food.I say legit because everything here stands alone. Burgers aside, I've had a stellar pizza and now an awesome veggie Stromboli type offering that rocked my world just as much as the burger. And don't even get me started on their double fried fries! If you like crispy taters, you won't want to pass these bad boys up.They of course have a massive whiskey list and pretty impressive draft beer line up. With two bars now, they're fully loaded and ready to go. Can't wait until the summer so I can sit out on their new upstairs deck and spy down on the square below. But, I'll surely be back before the warmer weather. Heck, I'll probably be back next week!When I start picking about the decor of a restaurant that means I am in trouble.  That means that I am not enjoying my  meal. Here's what I didn't want to notice but noticed while dining at Wingharts. The music that was being played was coming out of a visible iphone that was hooked up to a juke box.  One of the high top tables was stabilized by two dish rags folded and propped under the table legs.  We all jerry -rigg from time to time.   But I expect more from a resturant that sales $9.00 bugers. Moving on there were some horrific looking paintings on the walls. One which reminded me of the movie the Ring. Yes  the shipwreck burger was delicious.  The pizza I got was not so great. While the toppings were good and the crust was warm the artichoke paste that was spread on it was only slightly cool.  The crust of my pizza did nothing to heat the artichoke paste. That was very distracting.So why 3 stars and not 4 or 5?   I really wanted a meal I could sink my teeth into but that's not what I got. It's probably my own fault for going to a buger joint and getting a pizza.There aren't enough words in the English language to convey how much of a fan I am of this place. There are two reasons I say this: the food, and the service.I guess I'm getting in the long line of fans exclaiming that the food here is fantastic, but, it really is! If you want a great burger, then hightail it over here for the Shipwreck, a masterpiece combination of Brie cheese, caramelized onions with bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli. They had me at 'Brie'! My friend snagged a bite of this and said he wanted to come back just to have a whole one.Not a burger person? These guys do veggie burgers (I've heard good things about these) and also offer pizza and wraps. As a note: their incredible fries - which taste like real potatoes, quite a rare feat when you think about it - are not automatically included with the burgers, but considering they're 1/2 pound masterpieces, you don't necessarily need an order of fries, do you? If you want an alternative side or appetizer, I've had the spinach dip and pita twice and absolutely love it. There's a nice kick to the dip and it's nice and thick, complete with freshly baked pita chips. I think I'm drooling just thinking about them right now...And the service? It doesn't get better. My friend and I were actually here for a special event, and the bartender was fantastic. From checking in on all of us in our massive party to offering us specially made drinks on the spot invented just for our special occasion, this guy went above and beyond the call of duty for a bartender. I feel like I haven't said enough about Wingharts yet but I don't know what else to say. The staff is wonderful, the food is fresh - they told me they don't freeze their ingredients and go for local whenever possible - and my next meal here can't come soon enough!

Restaurant name  Cibo E Vino
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Please don't waste your time or your money. For half the price, you would be better off with Domino's - which tastes better. The only positive thing I can say for Cibo E Vino's pizza is that the ingredients are fresh... but the freshness of the pizza does not make up for the lack of taste.Three pizzas and a batch of those pepperoni rolls (not sure the name, I didn't put in the order) and the total was around $60. A little pricey, but we were feeding 7 total, so I figured that was justified. Until I saw the pizzas, that is. "Dainty" is a nice way to describe them. Any other company would call them small. Flavor? It's there, but you have to concentrate to find it. If you had told me they were just using a fancy frozen dinner, I would have had a hard time disputing the claim.The food itself is meh, but two stars seems a bit generous for a pizza place that's robbing its customers blind. At this point, I'm just going to believe that location is cursed - no matter which business occupies it.Drove through the parking lot and decided to "take a chance" and not look at the reviews. Sat a dirty table with a frenetic, attitudy-waitress who informed us that she was the only one there and it's going to be slow. Not even apologetic, more like a "sucks for you that I'm the only one here, deal with it!" kind of thing. The entrees were quite expensive for the dated pizza joint decor, topped with the notion that we would probably never eat (based on her warning... Sat there 10 minutes without a glance), we left without ordering. Never even got water, but the place was just depressing and I couldn't imagine spending a dinner there.Back open for a week after renovations.  We got here at 7:05, and after several follow ups on our pizza, we stil had nothing at 8:27pm. We gave them 5more mins, the pizza still wasn't done. So i  ran over to Sesame Inn (which is excellent) to try and catch them before closing, while hubs paid bill at Cibo. They ended up pulling a nearly-raw pizza out and giving it to my hubs, no Charge for our drinks, salad, or pizza.  So Sesame Inn stayed open longer, just to get food for us after Cibo wasted an entire evening of ours, waiting for a meal that didn't come.. (We weren't the only ones waiting 90 mins for pizza; they claimed it's a new pizza oven and only heats to 300' instead of 600'....but I'm pretty sure my 300' oven at home can cook a pizza faster than 90mims). Other notes of importance: the chef/owner left at around 8....and left his staff to deal with this mess. At the time he left, I commented that I hoped he'd put my pizza in before he left. We were not offered bread until 8:15....70 mins after we ordered (and after multiple complaints). The Caesar salad was average. They have no fresh pepper in the building. The bartender didn't know what kind of beers they had on tap (and we sat at the bar). Could it get better after they were open longer? Maybe, but this isn't a new restaurant. They're just reopened after a remodel...??WHERE TO BEGIN?We received a slick and shiny full-color Grand Opening announcement from Cibo e Vino. Great food photos. Intriguing menu. Famous chef. 10 minutes from home. Saturday night dinner with another couple. BaDaBing!   THE GOOD:Outstanding waitperson. Superb Chicken Parmigiana.    THE BAD:Upon arriving, I asked for coffee; they were "out," deeming it cost prohibitive to make a new pot. It was 8:30pm, 30 minutes before their late Happy Hour started--we weren't THAT late--don't people often have a cuppa after a meal?   One of our party requested Arnold Palmer, but they didn't have/were-out-of iced tea too.   Ironically, there seemed no "supply" issues with alcoholic drinks   Two of our party ordered Vodka Penne ("Penne tossed in Homemade Vodka Cream Sauce, Peas, and Prosciutto") which arrived sans Peas and Prosciutto. We alerted our server who returned with The Chef's response: they were "out" of the recipe's ingredients. We let her know we expected, at the very least, a discount on those dishes.   THE UGLY:After dinner, having received our check, we requested to speak with the manager. When she arrived, we explained A) The "outs"--coffee and tea and peas and prosciutto; B) that a $2 discount on a $17 dish, that should never been served, was a joke; C) We had come as a result of their Grand Opening announcement and were extremely disappointed; and finally, D) We would not be coming back.    Without taking personal responsibility or offering even one solution/option, she said "I'm sorry" and could not have cared less.   DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON Cibo e Vino.

Review Text :
I haven't had such an amazing meal in a while!  No lie!I kept saying that over and over again as I was stuffing my face with the delicious food served tonight!  I swear to you I was so stuffed half way through my entree and I had to keep going because it....was...so...good....The place describes it's dishes as comfort food.  I imagined the offerings would have a southern flair.  But the GM, Wil,l describes it as food that comforts you.  I love that!  It comforted me so much that I felt like I had to roll myself out the door!I started with the Root Salad, which was a mix of red and golden beets, candied walnuts, goat cheese with sea salt and lime sprinkled on top.  Have I told you lately, that I love beet salads?  Like, so much!  It was incredible!  My main dish was the Ricotta Gnocchi with peas, parm, mushrooms, cherry tomato and an egg on top.  I'm usually a fan of red sauce with my gnocchi, but this blew away any red sauce I could ever have had!  The gnocchi was just how I like them, like pasta/potato cloud puffs of amazingness.  All the ingredients complimented each other so well.  No red sauce needed!  The gnocchi comes from a local hook up, so you know it's not from the frozen section of your local Giant Eagle.  The place is Incredibly intimate with seating for about 40.  Be sure to make a reservation because this place is going to fill up fast!  If you want comfort food style, look no further!I have been waiting for the perfect moment to write my review of Root 174. Since I woke up this morning craving the fried brussel sprouts (read: salivating over them), I figured this was the perfect time.The head chef, Keith, personally invited us to the opening party, after we creepily stood in the doorway peering in the night before. I noticed that he was going around to every table, introducing himself and making sure everyone was taken care of. He believes in "giving back" to the community and offers a discount to those livin' in the 15221 (my hood, holla!). The guy is just super nice, period. Will, the manager, I also no slouch- he came over, chatted us up, and really made use feel welcome. Great guy. Ok- now on with the food:Fried Brussel Sprouts. Oh lord in heaven, they are so good. Crispy, tangy and the perfect balance of salt an sweet, topped with a bacon chutney. The tostanoes, a flat plantain with refried black beans and corn exploded with flavor- so tasty, perfect sweetness. They have a seasonal menu, so these goodies may not still be on there but TRY them if they are. I cannot wait to return for the entrees!They are BYOB, which is always a plus. Root 174 is the perfect spot to bring out of town friends who you want to experience the best that the 'burgh has to offer. I am so pleased that these friendly, innovative folks have graced my neighborhood. I am hoping that they do a brunch, but will contInue to love them regardless!!It would have been hard to be more impressed with the meal I had here.My wife and I came for dinner at about 6pm; luckily, we had a reservation, because the space is small and the dining area and bar were packed. As soon as we got a look at the menu, though, I realized why. There was not a single dish on the menu that did not intrigue me.After much deliberation, I settled on my app and entree. I began with the "bone marrow creme brulee" -- holy crap, it was delicious. It wasn't soupy like other bone marrow I've had -- more like it had been churned, making it easier to spread. And of course, it was caramelized on top like any "creme brulee" ought to be. The caramelizing brought forth a sweetness that was unexpected, and a great counterpoint to the saltiness. It was a great spread which I enjoyed on buttery crisps of bread.For my entree, I was a little less adventurous, opting for the eye of ribeye, served at a perfect medium rare, with creamy potatoes and Brussels sprouts. It was a lot to eat, but I bravely soldiered on and downed every last bite, just so I could tell you about it. Okay, I'm lying. I ate every last bite because it was freaking fabulously prepared, and I couldn't even stand the thought of allowing it to get cold.For dessert, I had a pumpkin roll that was unlike any I'd ever tasted. It was spongier, not heavy at all, with toasted pumpkin seeds and a nifty whipped cream cheese. I was truly blown away by every aspect of the food, and our service was stellar. Our server just seemed to anticipate what my wife and I would need, and was always at hand without seeming to hover. I can't wait to come back here and have another meal -- perhaps I'll dive in the deep end and try the headcheese next time?Culinary creativity is a rare entity to encounter in Pittsburgh.  However, thanks to photos uploaded by fellow Yelpers, chef Keith Fuller's gastronomic work caught my attention during one of my random nights perusing this site.  The next step was to verify my curiosity, by making a visit to Root 174 and indulge myself with the multi-course tasting menu.   Food (9.5/10) = 1) Watermelon soup with cantaloupe, peach, ricotta cheese, pistachios = A very refreshing way to initiate the multi-course dinner on a summer night.  The pistachios provided a balanced nutty component to the natural sweetness of the fruits, while the ricotta cheese added a non intrusive creamy/savory element.2) Crispy brussel sprouts with bacon-black pepper jam = Big fan of brussel sprouts!  Root 174 excels with this dish.  The name of the dish says it all.  It's crispy.  There's the fattiness from the bacon.  There's the sweetness from the jam.  A true winner.3) Black caviar caesar with parmesan, baby kale, egg, white anchovies, focaccia = I'm usually bored with caesar salads, however the execution of this caesar salad was impressive.  Note, I'm also a sucker for poached eggs!4) Figs with blue cheese, beets, brown sugar crumble, and a gastrique (forgot what kind of gastrique) = One of the best fruits to indulge in during the summer months.  It doesn't get any better than pairing fresh ripe figs with cheese.5) Apple fennel salad with  macadamia "cheese," maple black pepper vin, grilled radicchio, walnuts =  Another outstanding refreshing summer time salad.  Certainly a great dish to have before moving on to the more savory dishes on the menu.6) Pork belly with rhubarb, strawberry apple compote, savory rice crispy, jalapeno, barbequed pop rocks, banana = Love pork belly.  But to pair it with rice crispy treats and barbequed pop rock candy?  WTF?!  This was the most creative dish of the night, and was I immediately intrigued when I saw it on the menu.  All the components work well with each other.  This dish was absolutely fun and playful, and I wonder if this dish best exhibits chef Fuller's personality.7) Grilled octopus with romesco, olives, pickled potato salad, pesto = I rarely...RARELY order octopus, since most of my prior experiences were overcooked, tough octopus meat.  Wow, was I pleasantly surprised when my fork sank into the meat with little effort.  I did not expect to find octopus this tender in the middle of Pittsburgh.  Bravo.  The brininess of the olives were well balanced with the octopus.8) Coffee confit chicken wings with curried creme fraiche, dried banana chips = The only other time I've had coffee rubbed into meat was with steak.  I've now been educated that coffee can work well with chicken.  9) Chorizo stuffed chicken leg with mole sauce, creamy grits, pickled cauliflower, and peanuts = My favorite dish of the night.  The chicken meat was hella tender, and married well with the spiciness of the chorizo.  Also, some of the best grits I've had since I left the South.  10) Hanger steak with halloumi, apricot, cardamom, black rice puree, kale, cream corn, tomato, bread = The hanger steak was very tender and well executed.  The black rice puree looks just like chocolate.  11) Beignets with ganache and orange chips = The only dish of the night I was not impressed with.  Having lived in Louisiana for several years, my palate has been spoiled by beignets from down South.12) Bread pudding with ice cream dessert = Soft.  Moist.  Warm.  Sweet.  Chocolate.  Ice cream.  Need I say more?13) Celery sorbet = Second time in my life I've encountered celery sorbet (first time was in San Francisco 6-8 years ago at One Market Restaurant).  This dessert was a fantastic way to conclude the night, and was just as exciting and refreshing as the watermelon soup, Service (9.5/10) = Our waiter was fantastic.  Not overbearing, and he knew the menu well to describe the components of these complex dishes as they were brought to our table.   Ambiance (8.5/10) = A very simple and small yet cozy environment. Overall Opinion = Chef Keith Fuller's tasting menu is an absolute killer.  $67 for all the dishes I mentioned in this review?  What an awesome experience.  I'm surprised this restaurant doesn't share the same level of popularity as other restaurants in Pittsburgh (e.g. Meat and Potatoes, Butcher and the Rye, etc.).  Is it location?  Is it the simple ambiance?  Is it the level of creativity that Pittsburgh palates may not be accustomed to?  Who knows... What I do know is this restaurant is a true gem, and if you have been in Pittsburgh for a while and haven't visited Root 174, get your ass to this place ASAP.  Why didn't I give this place 5 Yelp stars?  Well, it was the beignets.  I only give 5 stars when everything has been perfect to me.   Ideally, I would've given this restaurant 4.5 stars.  Regardless, bravo to Chef Fuller!I like the trend in restaurants that started some years ago and is now really taking off in Pittsburgh; namely, locally sourced produce and meat thoughtfully put together by people who are serious about food and willing to not only try new things, but return their kitchens to a time when most things (like pasta and bread) were made by hand. Throw in some fun and delicious cocktails, and you have Root 174. We made an early dinner reservation for a Friday night, and, while the place was empty when we arrived, it was getting busier by the time we left. It's a small space, so reservations are recommended. Both the drink and dinner menus are brief, so choosing was a fairly quick affair for me. I had the Royal Oligarchy, a very good cocktail made with Remy Martin, Jim Beam Rye, St. Germain, house bitters and Cava (Spanish sparkling wine), served straight up and ungarnished. I tasted every element present in this drink, and enjoyed it thoroughly. Caesar salad is a favorite of mine, and their Black Caviar Caesar arrived to the table somewhat deconstructed, with the baby kale dressed, topped with a large crouton  and liberally sprinkled with parmesan, and the poached egg, anchovy and caviar off to the side. This is a very good salad, and the well balanced flavors in the dressing, as well as the egg and parmesan cheese crisp, somewhat mellowed the stronger flavors on the plate. For my main I chose the Tuna Bloodline Bolognese, the description of which (olive infused pappardelle, tomato, zucchini, poached fennel) I found very intriguing. I did ask the waiter about the whole tuna bloodline thing, and he explained that the dark red meat that cuts through a tuna steak is the bloodline, and they take that part and create the sauce with it. Interesting. This is obviously not a typical Bolognese sauce, and the tuna was either pureed or melted into the sauce, which was thick and tasted of, well, tuna. I'm not sure what else goes into this sauce, as it doesn't say on the menu. The other parts of the dish...pappardelle (either house made or hand made locally, but brilliant either way), zucchini, poached fennel and tomato, were all done perfectly. The sauce got a little heavy for me after awhile, and there was a lot of it on the plate, so I didn't finish it all...you really have to like the somewhat fishy taste of bloodline tuna to enjoy this dish. And I did enjoy it. Dessert, a lemon and lavender infused cake, sounded simple, but was completely different than any cake I've ever had, both in texture and taste. French press coffee completed the meal. Everything I tried here was delicious, beautifully presented, and just a bit different from my expectations, which is a good thing. Service was low key and helpful. I'll be back.After eating next door at the Thai Cottage, we ambled on over to Root 174 for cocktails. Little did we know that we should have parked ourselves here originally and forgone the Thai!! The small, unassuming storefront opens up to an intimate dining room with a half bar at the back. Though there were many tables open (rather surprising for a Friday night at 8:30), we opted for the bar. We typically enjoy talking to the bartenders, and they always give great recommendations. Root 174 has a unique list of cocktails. I started off with the Royal Oligarchy, a slightly sweet blend of rye, St. Germain, and Cava. I loved the added bubble provided by the Cava. My boyfriend chose the Mezrita as his first (he is currently nursing an obsession with mezcal) and enjoyed the bitterness of his drink.As we sipped our drinks and looked over a local pittsburgh events magazine, a heavily tattooed man showed up behind the bar and asked how we were enjoying our drinks. After we assured him that they were delicious, we realized he was the chef and owner! We then asked him for appetizer recommendations (who better to ask, right?). We needed some food with substance after our subpar dinner next door. He told us to try the coffee confit duck wings, and when they came out we were so happy to have taken his advice. They were crispy and literally falling off the bone. The coffee rub was slightly sweet and gave the duck a lovely flavor. The skin melted in your mouth. The wings normally come with a vanilla creme sauce, but since it included dairy we asked for it on the side. Our waiter was very helpful and gave great suggestions on other options for me with regards to my numerous allergies.While we ate, the owner walked around the space and spoke with patrons, even sitting down with some to enjoy a drink. I appreciated his hands-on approach, and his eagerness to please his customers. He has an obvious obsession with Star Wars (you can purchase a Star Wars koozie,ha) and will unashamedly tell you all about it. After one more delicious drink each, we headed out into the cool night, already planning our next visit to this unique and fun place.

Stumbled upon this place when looking to turn around to go to someplace more familiar.  Decided to eat there just to shake things up.  I was not disappointed.  Country Boys on Greenway is a smallish 24-hour diner and their menu is typical diner fare.  My party experienced breakfast, so no comment, yet, on other meal offerings.  Caveat: I was looking to dine out cheap.We took some time to peruse the menu and made our decisions.  Notably, our server asked us if we had any coupons, which we did not.  We voiced our lament, me more so (remember, my goal was to eat cheap?)  She proffered to take our order and determine if there were any options that would save us money.  Cool!  I liked this place already.  Once she knew what we wanted, she had suggestions for us that saved a few bucks for my dining partner and shaved 1/2 off the cost of my meal.  The concessions from our original menu choices to gain those savings were minimal.  I hadn't taken a bite and I was already happy to be there.Our meal was served quite quickly, almost too quickly.  I had ordered pancakes as a side and I know they are typically made from premixed ingredients.  Note: I don't like restaurant pancakes.  Grandma taught me how to make them and restaurant pancakes are no substitute.  However, I occasionally try the pancakes at a new place to use my relative level of dissatisfaction as a gauge of the overall quality.  It's a tough measuring tool, but it works for me.  Overall, the meal was quite satisfactory.  I was not expecting innovation or dining nirvana from a 24-hour diner and I did not experience either.  I did receive my food promptly, hot, and in quantities sufficient to satisfy.  It met and, in the case of the pancakes, slightly exceeded my expectations.  The bacon, in particular, was perfectly cooked, thick cut, and quite tasty.  Home style potatoes were very good with none of the onions or other crap restaurants add to try to make them special.  The eggs were perfectly cooked to order - I can't tell you how many times I've differed with cooks regarding the definition of "Over-Medium".  Overall, I give Country Boys a rating of 4 stars.  Fine dining it is not.  Good quality diner fair, with friendly and knowledgeable service?  Absolutely.  Oh, they have a drive-through too.  That's just icing.

The servers are so confused they do not have a clue who ordered what. And the Owner ( I assume) says I am not sure what happened ?        I know what happened you should not have quit your job at Walmart and who ever told you you knew how to run a restaurant  was A) A Family Member looking for a job  or B) Drunk  c) A Drunk family Member looking for a job.

Review Text :
I really wanted to like this place as I heard good and bad things about it. Maybe last night they were having a rough time, but alas here is my review.I met other yelpers here for pre-theater dinner. I will say there were about 20+ of us give or take at various tables. At the larger table of about 12, for some reason they just couldn't seem to get it together. Drink orders got mixed up, food orders came out very late or not all. Yes you read that right, not at all.  It got to the point that we were scrambling to eat the food some of us did receive and pay our bill to get out of there to catch the show. The table across from us, the entire party came in later than we did ( table of 6) and yet they were served there drinks, food, and checks in a very timely fashion. (and yes they were part of our group)I will say this, the food that we did receive was good and the staff was friendly enough but still it does not make up for the service. The restaurant was not busy and we had reservations so it was not like they didn't know we were coming  which makes this even more puzzling. Maybe I will try again if and when I am downtown and just sit at the bar. Maybe it was the fact that we were a large party, but again the restaurant was not busy. Maybe they were just having an off night.According to Calvin Klein, the key to looking young is remaining thin. I certainly agree! Portions at this restaurant are definitely not big which is fine because I don't like to eat that much. My roommate and I had dinner here a few nights ago before seeing a show at the Herberger Theater. We met some of the lucky yelp elites who scored tickets to the Daddy Long Legs performance which, by the way, was enjoyable. We thought our service was efficient and attentive. We didn't have the same experience as Linda, but we were at another table, so everything seemed to run like clockwork. I don't drink spirits, but they do have a very interesting wine list. The food was also good, and reasonable. I certainly enjoyed the chilled cucumber soup. All of this plus a nice atmosphere makes Province a place worth, returning to time and time again.

I'm kind of worried about this place. First, this is for the new location Downtown. I guess they have another one in Park Central, but I've never seen it. When you call for takeout, they remind you of which location you're calling. I like that because some people are idiots and will probably go to the other one.I loooooooove the curried noodle dish. I've eaten it in the restaurant and ordered it for takeout.The service is super friendly and the place itself is really nice. Call ahead before going, though. I drove down there one night after checking their hours and they were closed. Who does that????? That's the main reason I'm worried about this place staying open. It gets a good lunch crowd, but they need to work on dinner, too.Prices are reasonable and on par with the 87 other Thai places Downtown.

This update has been way over due.But they have made several changes to their staff and thank God. It makes a world of a difference when you have customer service oriented employees. Some days it is still crowded and the service should be a little faster. It is FAST food. However, there have been several improvements and we have little to no problems now.

Restaurant name  Leoné Café

Review Text :
Leoné Café is a step above the chain coffee houses and cafés.  I think they fall a little short when compared to the 4 star coffee establishments we have in Vegas...They are a strong 3 stars or a weak 4 stars in my book though.  They do a better job than most at offering gluten/dairy/soy free options for those with dietary needs.  I only end up here if I am already at Tivoli though.  I have not been impressed enough with any drinks, salads or breakfast items to come back specifically for them...nothing was bad, just easily forgettable.This review is for coffee and the pastries. I came in with Amelinda L. and Teresa S. last week after we had just grabbed dinner at View Wine Bar. After walking in, we were informed by one of the staff members that some of the pastries were 1/2 off. Great. As we took a closer look at the cakes and tarts at the counter, we were appalled to see a lot of not-so-hot looking little guys there. We're talking smudged frosting, and fruit that had been sitting out too long, i.e. strawberries that were shriveling and browning, plus a dried kiwi. Oh wait, no, it's just a kiwi slice that has seen better days.When looking at the pastries we asked a couple questions:Us: What is this pastry here? Guy: Uh...this is the caramel, and this is the strawberry, and I'm not sure (runs off to ask a coworker)Girl (who swoops in): That's a caramel, this is the strawberry chocolate, and that's the chocolate. It's my favorite!I love nondescriptive answers! Thanks for the enlightenment. Like I couldn't figure it out by the caramel drizzle, the strawberry sitting atop the second choice, and the chocolate garnish on the third. Worst of all, the conversation when ordering went like this:Me: I'd like two Nutella cappuccinos and the pumpkin latte - all medium size please.The same guy as earlier: Um, what size do you want the latte?Me: A medium? Guy: OKMe: I'd also like the strawberry chocolate cake and the carrot cake.Guy: OKMe: How much are those?---Guy runs off to check, and at this time the girl in the front proceeds to tell me again that some of the pastries were 1/2 off---Terrible. Hot mess express. When I pointed out that some of the tarts were severly dried out to the girl, she said "No, those are fine!" What a lie! Seriously, is this amateur hour? The two stars are for the barista..who seems to actually have a clue, since our drinks were totally on par. The rest of it though? No thank you.This is honestly the best coffee I've found in Vegas. I absolutely love the atmosphere and the employees are always so sweet. Amazing pastries too! Try an iced cappuccino, delish!!Hanging out at Tivoli with my kid, he wanted to stop by Cafe Leone for a snack. Who am I to say no? Especially when desserts are involved. Their display is on the small side while prices are on the high end. We can blame their Tivoli location for that. Everything here seems to have a sizeable mark-up compared to other off-Strip spots.The tiramisu ($5.75) was not good. It was almost all cream with very few lady fingers and lacking the liquor or espresso flavor that it should have. The cralin ($5.75) was much better fortunately. Chocolatey, crunchy, sweet, but not overwhelming, it was a huge step up from our first dessert, but still not on the same level as desserts found in the top tier bakeries on the west side.A year later, this spot deserves an update- and an upgrade!I'm not a fan of the Tivoli Village area but proximity to work makes it a good spot for lunch now that I've discovered (and thoroughly explored!)  their salads! The Champagne Chicken Berries is my favorite, but the Apple Chicken is a close second. Both are ~$11 and served in a small boat. No joke, these salads are massive, enough for a hearty lunch AND leftovers. And while they may not be the healthiest, you can request the dressing on the side and ask the to go light on the bleu cheese (or sub feta). But what's the fun in that?! Dine-in service is attentive, helpful, and happy to bring you anything you need. Can't believe I underestimated this place! Or used so many exclamation points!

Review Text :
There seems to be three types of pizza.  Chicago style, New York style, and the pizza that we actually buy and eat.  These days you go to a pizza joint and ask for thin crust and they say, "Sure, we've got non-existent crust."  And you say, "Yeah, I'll get the non-existent crust." Maybe I'm watching my weight; maybe I just don't like that much bread underneath my cheese; maybe it's none of your business.  And they say, "Yeah, that's good because our crust sucks." So it's great that there's actually a pizza joint where I can get some crust with character - crust with taste.  And the fact that I can get a slightly healthier pizza for my daughter is a plus that is hard to pass up as she could live off of pizza if one could actually live off of eating only mushroom pizza.  How a five-year old ever convinced herself to like mushrooms I'll never know.  My wife loves the skinny pizza with pineapple, feta cheese, hold the mozzarella, jalapenos, and onions.  Yeah, I know, that pizza makes even less sense than a five year old eating mushrooms.  Personally, I'm settling on a peperoni and basil combo with full crust.

Restaurant name  Pasta China
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Pasta China immediately caught my eye the first time I drove past it.  The name tells you everything you need to know going into the place, it's a mixture of Italian and Chinese cuisines.  There a few Italian-only and Chinese-only dishes, and five fusion dishes.  All are priced between $4.00-$6.00, so no breaking the bank here.I wanted a little kick in my meal, so I went for the Szechuan Angel: angel hair pasta with chicken tossed in a spicy peanut sauce (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z57kLRRnYXcaIhFZnxNJCA?select=mOwNIOGbhJLhNgWX9NUVFQ).  My entree came with a side salad and two pieces of garlic bread.  The salad had an odd dressing that I couldn't quite place; some bites tasted of sesame, others of citrus or orange.  The garlic bread was good as it was also topped with pesto.The real downside to the Szechuan Angel dish is that it wasn't spicy at all.  That was the main reason I ordered it, so that was a bummer.  The peanut flavor was a lot more subtle than other peanut sauces I've had; this can be a good or bad thing depending on your palate.  I was fine with it, I just wished it were spicy.  The entree is a generous portion and decent deal at $5.00.Many of the sides are only $1.00, so I also ordered the Curry Beef Puffs (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z57kLRRnYXcaIhFZnxNJCA?select=gUUVV5Zuapt7sL3TXNHq5g).  The filling is ground beef cooked with a yellow curry.  I've never had ground beef with curry before, but it turns out better than you would think.  It would be better if there were a stronger curry flavor!Overall you're getting a well portioned meal for no more than $6.00, and sides are cheap enough where you can order one while still eating for less than $10.  I think the food is decent, but your mileage may vary depending on your expectations and palate.  I'll be back again to explore the rest of the menu!Just came back from there and I kid you not, I have 3 to go boxes like I ordered take out. Funny thing is, me, my wife, and two kids actually ate dinner there. Here's the simplest way I can describe these guys. Pasta China is a Chinese/Italian fusion restaurant that serves you big portions at really good prices.Their entrees average 4 to 6 bucks and can easily feed 2 very hungry people. Since it was my first time here, I made the mistake of having everybody order their own entrée. Since the prices were decent, I decided we also needed to order an appetizer just in case it wasn't enough. I was so wrong. Every entrée comes on a huge plate. If you refer to my pic, my entrée was the Kung Pao-Ghetti. Its Kung Pao Chicken with Spaghetti Noodles. I chose a spiciness of 4 out of 10. Whoa. It was pretty spicy. For all you spice lovers you need to get this and make it a 10! My oldest ordered the Combination Fried Rice which had Shrimp, Pork, and Chicken. He could only eat half of it and he usually finishes his food. My youngest got the Bowtie Pasta with Chicken. He got it because it had Alfredo Sauce which he loves. His plate didn't even look like he touched it. Good thing my wife didn't order just yet because she was on her phone. After she saw all the food, she knew she didn't need to order anything at all.As for the service, there was this nice Asian lady that greeted, seated, took our order, and brought out our food. She even came around constantly to refill our waters. The only thing that she didn't do was cook our food. The location of the place is not bad at all. I see this place all the time driving by it on Craig Road. So when you drive by this place you cant help but wonder, "Chinese food with pasta?". The inside is nothing fancy. If anything, you just have basic chairs and tables. Doesn't bother me because I came there to eat, not to look at expensive paintings or high end wood flooring. Random info: They have a minimum of 5 bucks to use credit/debit cards. There is free wifi. The password is on the soda machine. There are separate solo bathrooms for men and women. Hours are Monday thru Saturday 11 am to 9 pm. Closed Sundays.Bottom line is, you get decent food, great portions, and nice service at decent prices. You can take your whole family and friends here without having to worry about the check. Im coming back for sure.

I like the freedom to pile up as much or as little as I want and they have a nice fresh selection!  ASK for sourdough bread, you won't regret it!Good service.  Nice decor, not over the top but very fun and lighthearted. You get Onion Rings OR Steak Fries OR Potato Salad as a side, no price difference.  Good thing I brought my Lunch Buddy - we  ended up with Fries AND O-rings...........life is GOOD.  Gnarly is a Great Addition to the neighborhood.  Definitely added to my list of favs.I'll start this review by divulging that "Build Your Own" concepts really stress me out. I don't go out to restaurants to BUILD MY OWN. That puts WAY too much pressure on me. I much prefer having someone to blame if I don't like what I'm eating, and with Build Your Own the only person I can blame is myself. If I wanted that kind of pressure, I'd have children.Also, how can you really accurately review a "Build Your Own" place. It's impossible! The quality of the experience is based on the reviewer's skill at building stuff! I don't want to know how good you are at making burgers, I want to know how good Two Hippies is at making burgers, AMIRIGHT?  That said, in effort to write a review of this establishment in a way most unaffected by my own culinary skills or lack thereof, I decided to order what I believe should be considered the quintessential "Cheeseburger". To me, that Cheeseburger is clearly: Bun, Burger, Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, PICKLE (Some say the pickle is debatable, and they are what's wrong with America) mayonnaise and ketchup.The burger was okay. I asked if I could get it cooked to order, medium rare, and they said yes but the burger was not medium rare. The meat didn't have a ton of flavor and I didn't even get a lot out of the cheese. But the toppings were quality and it was a good size so all-in-all, I enjoyed it. I did not enjoy the fries. I did not receive one fry that, when held vertically, could stand upright on its own devices. They all looked very sad. And it made me sad. I did enjoy the fact that they have Coke Zero and the fact that everything is a reasonable, set price, no matter what toppings you get (including good shit like mushrooms and guacamole). I also enjoy that it's BYOB (Bring Your Own Beer, not Build Your Own Burger. We've already discussed my thoughts on that). Though whenever I see a place is BYOB I always mentally note it and then never do it! I really need to be more proactive in my BYOBing. But it's still nice to know.Overall, while it wasn't the best burger of my life (through no fault of my own), their price and topping selection is good enough that I'll probably come back, even if it means I have to accept full responsibility of the outcome of my burger. Oh, and I'm going to bring beer.4.5/5This place is really fun and has great food.  I have had it bookmarked forever and finally have been up in their area for a training class so I gave it a try for the first time on Friday.  I took a couple of coworkers with me and we all enjoyed our food.  We called in the order when we left the office and they had it ready when we got there.  I had the mushroom and Swiss burger with pesto on a potato roll.  I love that blending of flavors and my burger was really good, but decided at the time that the next time I would get a double.  The burger isn't really too small for the bun, but they are good, hearty buns and a double would really fill it out well.  The homemade chips are just like I like them, light, crispy, and brown.  A couple of them were soggy, but overall they were very nice.  I got to try an onion ring and knew I wanted to order them the next time around as well.So...the very next day I brought my husband up to try it out.  We ordered a double and he chose the toppings.  It was something like mushroom, Swiss, bacon, and lettuce, with the onion rings.  I decided to try their brat with chips.  Everything was delicious.  The fresh buns really are a nice touch and we like the fact that you can bring up to 2 beers with you and drink them with the meal, as long as you are sitting inside.  I can easily handle and appreciate that.  The two gals working there are super friendly and helpful and add to the positive experience.  The only reason they aren't a perfect five stars for me is that the burgers do have a pressed look to them that leads me to believe they might have been frozen.  If they did freshly-ground, never-frozen beef for those burgers, they would really be over the top.  Aside from that though, as a whole, they put out some great food in a fun environment with funky album covers, posters, and memorabilia all over the place.  I love Billy Joel with those bedroom eyes staring at me while I'm in the can.  All the reminders of when the best music was created.  I look forward to my next visit.

After a few hours hanging out at the bar, I was in the mood for a Fatburger.  I ordered a Large Fatburger with Cheese.  The wait was the usual 15+ min....standard for Fatburger.  I appreciate the fresh food, so I don't mind the wait.  The Burger was awesome as usual.....it didn't have a chance.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EzUypdlXXX75D_Cj14DnuA?select=ZlevLbfaM4ZX2BkAxIQNowReturn Factor - 90%

I stayed at this hotel during last year's Spring Break.The pools overall looked okay, and the hot tubs were very comfortable.As what some other people mentioned, there's no shade here at all. Make sure you have your powerful sunscreen with you when you're out there. Also, the pool area closes really early. It would be nice if they stayed open until the extreme late evening hours.You get a 42 inch tv, snacks, nonalcoholic drinks, upgraded chairs, and a mini fridge all for the $25 winter cabana rental fee.How can you beat that anywhere. I agree that this isn't the best pool in Vegas and they close the slide in winter. My kids are able to play as long as they want and I can relax and read a book as I watch them. I can tan on the upgraded chairs or sit in the shade. You can't beat the price and for twenty five dollars you can't go wrong. Even if you only use it for an hour you got your money out of it. It's January and the pool isn't even cold. The hot tub is empty because everyone is in the pool. One really good thing about this pool is that it has a shallow spot that kids can play on. If you don't like kids I say avoid this pool at all costs. They have an adult pool that you can use.One of the top kid friendly pools in Las Vegas.There are multiple pools and a lot of lounge chairs at the 30,000 square foot Excalibur pool area. The most exciting and family friendly of these pools is the Slide Pool which has a cool "rock" formation along one side of the pool that includes a very fun water slide as well as waterfalls flowing from the rocks onto the edges of the pool. Another pool has a very shallow area which is good for lying out in the sun while in the water or having your non-swimming kids playing in the water. You can upgrade to two plush lounge chairs, an umbrella and a bucket of ice with 3 small water bottles and 3 bags of chips for $50 until the pool area closes at 6pm.

A friend and I came here on a Tuesday and were seated right away. The ambiance is really cool however I wasn't a fan of how close together the tables were. You could hear every single word coming out of the mouths of those around you.Save the far too intimate seating, the service was great. We got our order in quick and the drinks and sushi came out very fast. And thank god it did because these people know sushi. Edamame - same old same old, but good.Super volcano roll - dynamite. It combined all of my favorite things into one roll. Only bad part was it was so hard to eat - I had to eat the roll and toppings separate, but I did not mind.Tropical roll with spicy tuna - if you're a fan of the traditional spicy tuna roll, this is for you. They combine our favorite spicy tuna with delicious and fresh mango. Awesome sauce. I can't remember what my friend ordered, probably because I was so focused on my delicious rolls. But she said hers were just as fantastic. I don't know if I'd venture here on a busier night, but I will definitely be back!Okay, so it took me a long time to finally write a review about Red Sushi. Why? Maybe because I wanted to keep all the fresh sushi to myself. I've been here quite a few times and have had mainly their sushi. For lunch, you can get 2 rolls for only $10; add miso soup for only $1 more and you have a meal ;). The cool thing about their rolls is that they offer the good stuff and at good quality/freshness. For example, there's the Spicy Scallop or Crab (yes - real crab not crab imitation on their lunch menu), Duck Tempura Roll, Red Snapper, Yellowtail, Spicy Escolar...etc. My point is that they continue with quality even during lunch specials; majority of sushi joints here mainly offer crab imitation, shrimp, salmon and vegetables only during their lunch specials. Other than sushi, I've had their Grilled Black Cod, Calamari and P.E.I. Mussels (creamy bacon garlic white wine sauce) that were all pretty yummy. I've only had the cod once since $13 for an 'appetizer' portion hurt my wallet more than it filled my stomach, but the flavor is pretty worth it.All in all, it's a great place for lunch and dinner. Note: make reservations for dinner during the weekend or you'll find yourself on a 1hr+ waitlist.Check out more food photos here: http://www.getnmahbelly.com/2013/12/red-sushi/We had a pleasant but nonetheless disappointing experience at Sushi Red. While enjoying our cocktails, we watched one of the chefs craft one meticulous, gorgeous roll after another. But when served, we realized that he was stationed there for a reason: to impress diners while less talented chefs assembled rolls to his right in a less visible spot. Our rolls tasted good but were sloppily made compared to other places in town like Takumi. The rolls were sliced unevenly so each piece varied significantly in size. The end pieces were tiny and didn't have any fish. Between those problems and the pulsating music, I'd probably opt for Takumi or Muramoto over Sushi Red.

Talk about a small place with big thai flavors, this is where you want to be for thai food. The owner, Sabi, is very nice and friendly and keeps her kitchen clean. Sabi dishes out some of the best thai food in Las Vegas. Prices are low & very affordable by anyone. Serivce is very good and fast. I am a chicken pad thai fanatic and a pineapple fried rice guy. So, I chose those items to eat. The pineapple fried rice was delicious and seasoned well. Rice was not mushy, had the right amount of curry and all the ingredients mixed well. The chicken pad thai is my favorite thai dish and Sabi sure knows how to cook it right to satisfy my taste buds. Not salty and seansoned to perfection with a little sweetness and the right amount of spicyness. Food tasted great and fresh. Winning!Okay, make sure you don't pass this place up. If you are near Arville and Hacienda or not near, stop by for a legit Thai food experience presented by Sabi.

You know.. It amazes me how a night can be going so well and how you can rate your experience very highly in your head until in one split second the manager ruins it all for you.Unfortunately that was our experience here.I had plans to come to Deville with a few girlfriends last week and was so excited to try it out because the reviews looked great.We were seated, and right away you could feel a funky vibe from the diner with bright purple lights and cool oldschool booths lining the space. After looking at the menus, we were told that the mango mojitos were the special of the day so we went with those and they were pretty good.We then ordered our mains (I had the Adam's Ribs) and received our food in under 20 minutes. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious, the cornbread sweet but well made, and the coleslaw was good too (not too smothered in mayo). I wasn't a fan of the matchstick fries, but that's just me.Others at my table also really enjoyed their food and overall experience.Once we finished dinner, we asked to see a dessert menu and were approached maybe 5 times by our server asking if we had made a decision. This was a little bit annoying because he was hovering but even then, I wasn't mentally taking any stars away from my review. We ordered the apple pie ice cream sandwich to share which was also very very well made.By that point, we had been at the diner for about two hours to 2.5 hours and had been chatting as most people do (9:30pm on a Thursday). We paid around that time also and proceeded to continue our conversation. Around 10, the manager came to our table pretty much kicking us out saying that she had reserved our table for another couple who had been waiting over 35 minutes for us to leave, and that she could seat us in a corner (our booth had access to the TV) because they wanted to watch the game, or we could just leave.Now you can imagine our disdain....no one had said anything to us about our table being reserved. We were paying customers who didn't really overstay their welcome in terms of going out for dinner, drinks, and dessert. And you can't just kick people out because they've paid their bill and now someone else wants our particular table (which was nothing special by the way).So, as you can imagine, the three of us left with a very bad taste in our mouths, and although I was really excited to bring other friends and family to try out the food here, it's safe to say that I will definitely not be back. There are tons of delicious options in Montreal with excellent service as I've mentioned before in another review or two. Bad service or being spoken to as we were for no reason is really not acceptable in a city where competitors are a dime a dozen.But to those of you reading to see if the food is good, it is. The service was quick and the decor is well done. Before the manager came over, I was planning on a 4 star review, but two stars removed for this unneccesary action on her part........

I recently gave this place 3 stars for good food, great service, but not so awesome prices.  Reasonable review right?  Apparently, wrong. What I am reviewing with ONE star is the message I received back from the owner.  Not only did she accuse me of being a certain customer who used happy hour, restaurant.com and a yelp check in, she acted as though I had given her restaurant a horribly undeserved 1 star review instead of a more than half 3 star.  As it is, I am NOT that certain customer.  Not only am I not that person, I, as a customer, am extremely put off to learn that the management looks down upon those that use the very coupons they put out to draw people in.  I now realize why this place was completely dead the night we went in.  I do NOT appreciate being put down by ownership.  I thought my review was fair and honest.  Not only will I never be back, I will never recommend this place to anyone, ever.  Fresh food or not,  I don't like to be treated as such!

DH literally dragged me here, ALMOST kicking & screaming.  I had read over their menu several times, and then read it over once again :P.  Nothing jumped out at me or grabbed my attention, not like Alma Pan.  I kept insisting that if he wanted to have Peruvian food that we go there instead, but he insisted.  So off we went on a late Friday evening with a bottle of Spanish wine in tow.  They are BYOB with NO corkage fee to my delight, I thought if the food was bad at least I could drown out the taste in my mouth.  I was delightfully surprised.  We ordered two appetizers, the "Torrejas de Choclo" & "Causa de Langostinos".  Both were bursting with flavor, and beautifully presented.  We were thrilled with the appetizers.  DH & I however shared an entree, which we did not like.  We got the "Paella Latina" which was bland bland bland, and oily!  Why the four stars?  Their appetizers were exquisite and I'm sure their other entrees are good, and I'll definitely be back to try them.  We finished off the meal with an amazing dessert "Port Wine Whipped Cream" on top of dulche de leche.  I could have inhaled it, and well I sort of did :).I also have to say the service is a huge plus here.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and talkative.  She explained the menu well and gave us suggestions.  We even got a free glass of chico morade on the house, which was refreshingly good.  It did not taste like it came from a mix at all.  I would highly recommend it!This review represents many "firsts"...a) my first post as Yelp Elite (in San Francisco such a status requires much relationship building, review writing, and general hobnobbing whereas in Cleveland you're invited to be Yelp Elite just by friending the right Yelper...oh, Cleveland), and b) my first post back home on the East Coast.  Living in Cleveland, I get to spend one or two days a week with my mom back home in Pittsburgh, where I'm discovering the foodie scene is pretty. damn. awesome.Take Aji Picante, for example.  We walked in post Bikram Yoga Squirrel Hill class around 8pm on a Friday night, no reservation, clutching a bottle of Trader Joes wine I'd brought with me, and they were able to squeeze us in.  And the experience was PERFECT from start to finish.  Our half-Peruvian waitress was just the right amount of attentive, genuine, and friendly...she provided the sort of service where you wonder if a 22% tip is enough.  The ambiance was warm and inviting and only a little loud.And the food...oh, the food.  The Causa de Langostinos was strange and spicy and delicious, a mushy blend of mashed potatoes, avocados and shrimp that somehow works perfectly.  We devoured our Torrejas de Choclo and scooped out every last bit of that minty sauce.  But the highlight was the special of the evening, a squash and vegetable stew that came served in a little pumpkin.  The perfect dish to warm up your insides on a cold night.And because it's BYO, with two appetizers, an entree and a dessert (the rustic creme brulee, not too sweet and very, very rich) the total cost was not bad at all.  I'm starting to think that the food snobbery I've built up after years in the fine dining industry in Philadelphia, and years eating my way through San Francisco, will be well satiated in Pittsburgh.  Cleveland better step it up!

From the Jerusalem kids next door comes Aly Baba - all the cheap, tasty hits (falafel, shawarma, kebab, etc) in a sit-down, less linoleumed setting. Still 4 bucks and still my fav in town - ze falafel. One of only a couple veggie staples on the menu but a sweet rendition - 3 fried chickpea balls, chopped tomato, hummus, pickles, hot sauce, wrapped in lavash like a mini burrito, 4 bucks. If you're eating this on the go, you're going to need napkins (pita-stuffed 'lafel doesn't suffer this fate, rawr). Hummus and ganoush delish. A larger, more comprehensive (read:meatfull) menu for the rest of ya.Service smiley and efficient. Palatial side yard full of running fountains, wrought iron and stonework - comfy and gorgeous, with some goldfish darting around for added awesome factor.We lost a rad Viet place. But this'll do just fine when the falafel need hits.

This place is probably closed by now.  Heard it was from the rumor mill.I hate to say it makes me happy because I really try to support local spots.  This one is so close to my house and I want it to be good so badly.  Its been through at least three different names/owners over the last couple years (Hammerheads, Portofino's Beach Bar, and Dirty Pelican).Every one of them were horrible.  Mediocre food at best.  Decent drink prices but the ambiance is just atrocious.  Ever want to have a beer at Wal-Mart or your local aquarium store?  Me either.  This place is a cross between them.  Unappealing, uninviting, just poor all the way around.Advice to the new owner...  Change the beach theme and lose the aquariums.  The place needs to be gutted.  Make us want to come in and when we get there give us service that makes us want to stay.The last time I was in there we had pretty bad service from the bartender.  He didn't notice us for quite a while sitting at the bar after we arrived (it was slow).  Then it was just poor from there on.  He didn't seem to know the food specials.  My wife and I both gave each other the "wow" look.  How does the bartender not know the happy hour specials?Turns out we get our bill and the guy (bartender) tells us he is the owner and to come back again soon.  WHAT!?If owned a bar...Such an unfortunate waste of space. The place has huge potential to be a phenomenal neighborhood bar. The staff had me waiting long enough to order a beverage that I was playing on my phone in order to waste time. They were too busy chit chatting about their personal life drama out loud instead of tending bar. When they finally did help me both bartenders had zero clue on pouring the proper 4 count. I ordered two different shots and they made up their own recipe. As a former bartender I would not recommend this place to anyone. Sorry Dirty Pelican but I recommend a phone call to bar rescue...

I hate to slag on this place since their location on West Flamingo is one of my go to spots.  But I gotta call it like I see it.  For reasons I won't go into..I'm vegetarian for the month of January.  I am pretty much hating it so far and I'm only 5 days in but I figured I would try this place out since they offer a few things the W.Flam location doesn't.  These things include gyros, beef shawarma and FALAFEL.  I got the falafel plate since the only alternative was a "falafel burger".  I would've ordered a falafel sandwich w/ pita had that been a choice.  The atmosphere is pretty much set up for people on the go.  I imagine people on conventions might get a quick bite here.  Drunk bastards/bitches would be fine here since they're open til 3am daily and all their furniture is plastic.  So I was a bit excited when they brought out my plate.  4 huge falafel balls along with the usual things Shish Kabob House offers like the roasted pepper and tomato.  But they don't include salad at this location and the rice isn't as good here.  My excitement completely died as I had my first bite .  Dry, bland..almost like eating an overdone oatmeal raisin cookie and it kinda crumbled like it too.  They also served a side of super thick kinda tzatziki sauce which didn't go too well with it.  I would have much rather had tahini or hummus but I am not shelling out $4.95 for a side order of it.  Really unsatisfying.  I have no question that their kabob menu is just as excellent as the original location but they shouldn't be serving falafel here.  The W. Flamingo location is better to go to..ambiance (even though they use folding tables), side salad with your entree and music from their country as opposed to Fuse TV playing at the strip location.I might be back here...but it'll only be for LAMB CHOPS!!!

Review Text :
I just docked a star from my review of BRGR. There's a new sheriff in town, and he's telling BRGR to suck it. My brain is still spinning from so much awesome, so I'm going to have to enumerate everything I love about Burgatory. 1. Someone at Burgatory stole my iPod and hit 'shuffle'. I spent as much time singing along as I did chatting with my friends. Either my taste is becoming progressively more mainstream as I get older or there are some very cool (and aggressively non-hipster, I hope) people in charge of the music.2. Spiked milkshakes. Spiked Milkshakes. SPIKED MILKSHAKES. Heavens, what was I thinking when I foamed at the mouth over BRGR's? I wasn't thinking. I hadn't yet experienced Burgatory's Apple Pancake and Bacon shake. Did you absorb all the Awesome in that shake's name? Again: Apple. Pancake. Bacon. There's also alcohol in there, but it's almost secondary to the chunks of apple and bacon floating in the heavenly swirls of Happy. The whipped cream tasted homemade and worked surprisingly well with the slice of bacon (A SLICE OF BACON!) adorning the side of the glass. Oh, heavens. I'm having heart palpitations just thinking about how amazing it was. My friends' milkshakes were equally swoon-worthy: the bourbon and caramel soaked Grandad's Secret and the rummy banana goodness of Monkey Business.  3. The menu burgers were insanely creative, and unlike BRGR, you can create your own masterpieces. A little gouda here, some Kona rub there; Cabernet sauce here, applewood bacon there. The possibilities are endless... and DELICIOUS. The only area Burgatory seems to fail is with well-done burgers. A little too dry. But not enough to take away from the overall experience. And even if the burgers totally sucked, the milkshakes would've made up for it. Seriously. I would go to the restaurant just to drink myself into ice-creamy oblivion. Word of warning: because Burgatory is still in its infancy, it gets packed very, very quickly. We waited over 75 minutes for our seats. And every minute was worth it.Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness! These burgers are delicious! I absolutely love burgers! My wife heard about this place and decided to take me here. I love her! We went on a Friday night and the place was packed! We had a 25 minute wait but it went by quick. (thank God for Angry Birds!) So the hostess came and took us to our booth. FYI walk slowly or you will bust your ass. Their floor is extremely slippery. I don't know if there's grease on the floor or what. We looked over the menu and started off with the Berry Lemonade and the Bourbon BBQ Sriracha Wings. They were both delicious! Next we both had the Standard Deluxe Burger. It's a burger with White American Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and their House Burger Sauce. It was huge and outstanding! The homemade potato chips are really good also. I also like the fact that you can build your own burger in 7 steps . Step 1. Pick your burger. You have a choice of beef, chicken, bison, sausage, lumb crab or veggie patty as a burger. Step 2. Pick your bun. Next you pick your bun with Brioche, Wheat, Baguette, Focaccia, Topless or Full Monty Style as choices Step 3. Pick your rub. Choose from Angel Dust, Kona Crust, BBQ, Kingston Jerk, Cracked Peppercorn and Bayou Cajun Step 4. Pick your cheese for $1 more Choose from Cheddar, White American, Horseradish Cheddar, Sharp Provolone, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, Smoked Gouda and Buffalo Cheddar. Step 5. Pick your sauce. Choose from Bourbon BBQ, Dijon Mayo, Banana Ketchup, House Sauce, Spicy Marinara, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Roasted Garlic Mayo, Sriracha Remoulade, Buttermilk Ranch, Spicy Ketchup, Whole Grain Mustard, Avocado Wasabi, Bleu Cheese Dressing, Buffalo Sauce, Relish and Chipotle Sour Cream Step 6. Pick a topping for $1 more. Choose from Fried Egg, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Avocado, Chicken Chili, Caramelized Onion Marmalade, Grilled Pineapple, Sautéed Mushrooms, Maple Cured Ham, Onion Straws, Roasted Tomatoes, Grilled Onions, Brandied Peppercorn, Cabernet Sauce and Roasted Red Peppers. Step 7. Pick a free topping. Choose from Iceberg, Romaine, Field Greens, Baby Spinach, Arugula, Red Onion, Tomato, Poblano Peppers, Cucumbers, Banana Peppers, Bread & Butter Pickles and Jalapenos. Lots of choices and ways to customize your burger. Burgatory is my new favorite burger place!We came in late on a Saturday afternoon.  The place was busy, but not overly packed.  They were advised of a 25 minutes wait, they took our number so they could text us and sent us on our way.We got a table in the "patio" area.  Our server greeted us right away and I went straight for a Monkey business shake.  The shake wasn't very thick and I was surprised by the weird pieces of banana and the mountain of whipped creme.  But still, very yummy.I am a fan of the build your own burger.  Loved their whole wheat buns.  My burger was very thick and perfectly cooked.  I got the angel dust and bourbon barbeque.  BJ got the Crab Shack.  Not exactly jumbo lump crab meat, it was very flavorful.  I really wanted to try the What-A-Jerk chicken burger, but was advised this isn't wasn't all white meat.  The only downside was the potato chips.  They were just taking up space on my plate.  We didn't like 'em.   We really liked it here and will visit again.I just have to share with yinz how much I LOVE their spiked milkshakes!  I know, I know...it's a burger place.  It's called BURGATORY for gosh sakes!  But, gosh darnit, those shakes are killer!  I just had my second one today, the S'Mores, and it was beyond amazing...They bring it to you with a huge seared marshmallow in a large 20oz glass, with a tin of the extra inside.  It's supersize American all the way, and I love it!  It's made with vanilla ice cream and chocolate liquor, with tiny graham cracker crumbs inside.  The first milkshake I had was the Almond Torte, which is made with Prantl's Burnt Almond Torte with vanilla vodka and amaretto.  I'd have to say this is a close call between which one is better.  Either or are gonna satisfy your sweet tooth.  Okay, so the burgers.  Still good.  Still a lot to decide on!  They give you a whole sheet of options to make your perfect burger.  Seriously, any way you've ever thought of making your burger, I'm sure you could get it here!  I always go with the whole wheat bun (to make myself feel better about that shake) and my only gripe is it falls apart as soon as you pick it up.  So I usually eat the burger with a fork.  I had come here when the place first opened and I wasn't too into the chips they server with the burger.  They were a little limp.  Now they're nice and crunchy, still with the mix of sweet potato and regular.  I just hope they bring a Burgatory closer to town...although that boozy milkshake will be calling for me!What can I say that hasn't been said. Outstanding burgers, should be enough to say.Went for lunch Saturday of memorial day weekend. Got there at 2 and the place was pretty full with at 15 minute wait for a party of three. But actually got seated in a booth in 10 minutes.Service was pretty quick, I'd say within 3 minutes or less after seating. Got the drink orders in right away while we looked over the menu and the build your own configuration sheets.I ordered the standard deluxe with white American, and their own house burger sauce, done pink. I also ordered the fries instead of the chips which come with.Jody ordered the bison burger and Linda the Crab Shack.Jody, who has been around and is hard to please gave his an 8 or 9 out of ten. That's a real complement. Linda said she loved the crab shack. Also we had two shakes, one just plain chocolate shake and Linda had the Espresso Love which sounded great and was except it was just kind of too sweet.Funny thing happened while we were here when the power went out for a few minutes. Just a little added excitement.Well we will all be coming back here again to try and work our way through the menu and all the options. This place is highly recommended by usens.Some people say that everyone is creative, that even the small choices that a person makes are his or her art--the fruits on our breakfast plate, the washed-out blue denim with the herringbone blazer, the scenic drive over the straight shot. For people who appreciate this, the Burgatory menu is a thing of beauty. It's like sitting down with a skilled artist who has laid out all sorts of materials--oil paints, watercolors, pastels, charcoal, googly eyes--and you get to choose all of your favorites for them to create a masterpiece. Charcoal with deep red paint. Pastel pinks with glitter. Except, you know, this involves food, which is the actual best thing ever.Caramelized onion marmalade, truffled shallot aioli, angel dust rub, cabernet sauce, bacon jam. Literally anyone can be made happy with meat choices including elk and bison, regular beef, chicken, crab (!?) and veggie burgers. Traditional white bun, whole wheat, or no bun at all--among other options. If you're not up for trying to pair BBQ with sriracha and horseradish cream and just want food in your mouth stat, there are some predesigned burgers that are their own works of art. Help yourself to a Monet. And it's always possible to get a regular burger on a white bun with lettuce and tomato. But then there are the shakes: s'mores, caramel pretzel, apple pancakes and bacon, Nutella crunch. Some are spiked. This arrangement is actually too ridiculously wonderful to exist, but there you go.

I should preface that this was the first time I have eaten in at Burgatory, as other attempts were halted due to extreme wait times.  In the past my office has ordered takeout from the Waterworks location.  The take-out was still yummy, but through transportation and whatnot the burger arrived pretty messed up.  So eating in is my preferred method.Last time there was a real treat as I usually don't get to go out to eat for lunch due to time constraints and this chain they have on my leg attached to my desk, however I was in luck this day.  My Operations Manager was in town that week and asked if he could take me out to lunch to talk about some things.  I happily excepted and strongly suggested Burgatory, so off we went.  When we got there we didn't have to wait for a table, which is something I had yet to experience with other attempts to eat here.  Seated I looked at the menu and decided on the build your own burger...  I went with the Dry Aged Wagyu, on a wheat bun, with Diablo Dust, Smoked Gouda, Sriracha Remoulade (on the side) with lettuce tomato, onion, and jalapenos.  I like my burgers cooked medium rare, I think Burgatory cooks closer to rare in the middle but that doesn't bother me, but as a tip I would suggest most people would like it a little more cooked.  I on the other hand was extremely pleased.  The burger didn't take too long to come out so we spent the next 10-15 minutes in complete silence as we ate...  Oh so much better than takeout!  This is up there with one of the best burgers I've ever had, and since it's on the boss it was also the cheapest, meaning free.  Can't turn that down ever.  Can't wait until they finish their new location east of the city, 3 miles from me : )Burgatory is probably the most hyped burger bar in Pittsburgh.  I would reccomend coming at non-peak hours or when the store opens... This place gets packed.I ordered the hard Espresso shake ($8.50) at 11:00 in the morning because I wanted to try it.  The shake was quite good.  It wasn't an overpowering amount of alcohol, nor negligent.  If you do order a shake, they are large, and you will want to be prepared to take some burger home with you.  I tested out a fairly standard burger.  I ordered a Standard Deluxe Burger ($9.50), which came on a Brioche Bun with Smoked Gouda, Lettuce, Tomato, and House Sauce.  The burger wasn't overly memorable but tasted good.Is it worth waiting hours in line to eat at Burgatory?  Absolutely not.  But if you want a quality burger and the wait isn't too bad, check it out.

While at Vegas StrEATS downtown, I sampled a pulled pork sandwich that Ben's BBQ brought to the VIP yelp tent. It was pretty good so I walked down to Ben's food truck and purchased a "Hot Link Sandwich" priced at $7. It tasted good but it should have been called a hot link slider because it wasn't very big. I don't mind that it came on a hamburger bun however for the $7 it cost it should have been a bigger hamburger bun with more links in it. The bbq sauce on it was decent but it was just a drizzle and could have used some more. It was just too bad that the guy taking the order was in such a hurry (there was no line BTW) that he didn't realize my husband who was standing right next to me might want to order something. I guess he thought the $7  mini sandwich would fill us both up!? The food is good but the specials they had going on during this visit to their truck left me still hungry and feeling like I payed too much.

This is a welcome dinner destination after practice with my swim team in the nearby Student Recreation Center of ASU.  The place is small, clean, and basic; service is fast. Simple menu and tasty, healthy food at a good price. My favorite is "The Works" - beef, chicken, veggies, and rice, topped with green onion; I jazz it up a bit with sriacha because I like this kind of food spicy.

Review Text :
The good old  Las Vegas bar and grill, the place where the end of the work week merges into the weekend. This past Saturday, Rocky's Bar &  Grill (abbreviated Rocky's) was the bar and grill where my work week merged into my weekend.   Rocky's is located in the small shopping center at the southeast corner of Maryland Parkway at Windmill Lane. The locally famous Grouchy John's Coffee Shop is the landmark.   For a couple of years I had been parking near Rocky's when I hung out in Grouchy John's. I never stepped inside until this weekend.   In similar style to many bars and grills, Windows here are nonexistent. Once I stepped inside the heavy brown doors, I left the outside world for an isolated world of dining, gambling, and moderate drinking. In similar style to several bars and grills, the layout is a dimly lit restaurant separate from the smoky bar and lounge.   From the time I walked through the doors, I waited a few minutes to be acknowledged. The host and only waiter Roland arrived a few minutes later. He was friendly and professional. He invited me to sit anywhere. I chose a comfortable booth in a room that was sporadically populated and quiet to the degree that it is a nice place for a date or me time. The primary sounds were the hard Rock classics playing at a soft volume.   My mind was set on the chicken parmesan sandwich. When it came time to ordering, Roland let fall that it is a hero style sandwich that doesn't come with fries. Okay. I'd order the fish & chips.   The three large pieces of cod and the steak fries were tastational and filling. The portions were large to the point of Roland placing a second plate containing  bowls of tarter sauce and cole slaw. The cole slaw was out of this World. Rocky gives the knockout punch with the cole slaw. I give Rocky's kudos for including cole slaw with the fish & chips. In my opinion, fish & chips without cole slaw is like nachos without cheese. Yet, it amazes me that there are so many restaurants that just don't get it and exclude cole slaw with fish &  chips. A few restaurants that I lately reviewed that are guilty of this are Village Pub and Red Robin. This delicious cole slaw rounded up my rating from 3.5 to 4 stars. The fish &  chips with bottomless Pepsi came out to $14.47 before tipping Roland.   If I was still hungry, I could of ordered a homemade apple cobbler or vanilla ice cream. Subsequently to the end of the work week dinner, I  headed for the beginning of the weekend revelry in the bar/lounge.   The bar/lounge is a long rectangular space with sofa style chairs and a bar with monitors above showing sports and video gaming below. I played my video Keno while enjoying a $3 PBR and watching the UFC. I shared the bar and lounge with a friendly clientele.   Time went by fast. When I opened the heavy brown door to return to the real World I had a few thoughts lingering on the isolated World of Rocky's. As I put the thoughts to words they are that this is a good spot in the Southeast Valley to enjoy tasty fish & chips that include delicious Cole slaw before a cold one and some moderate gaming or watching a sports event.         I                                                                  I        I        Pictures of the food &  menu       I    \  I  /                                                           \  I  /      \I/                                                               \l/

I heard from a buddy that place has amazing fried chicken. So I came in, ordered a three-piece meal, with a side of mac n' cheese and potato wedges. I must say, these guys have fried chicken covered. It was delicious!My friend ordered a pizza, which was a tasty and valuable choice only because all toppings are complimentary. However, the juicy fried breast, thigh, and leg that I managed to eat all in one sitting were nothing short of amazing, particularly with their homemade gravy! Their sweet tea is very sweet, which I think works only in the South, haha.The workers here are very friendly and polite. The owner of this restaurant is a sweet man, and is extremely approachable. The service is top notch!I will definitely come back again.

Review Text :
Great sound, nicely laid out space, good service, solid beers on tap... This place is a game-changer. The lounge area on the street is awesome, and opens today (and everyday) from four PM till 2 AM. The concert space is great, as well. A knee-high stage has plenty of room for large acts, while in the back of the room, tired/lame attendees can relax in the bleachers. The bathrooms, while boring,  were spotless. We'll see how long that lasts, haha. I can't WAIT to update this review with more experiences. (ESPECIALLY FOOD!!! Next week!!!!!)This is the new mecca of Phoenix music. Charlie Levy who booked for the now legendary Nita's Hideaway and also the owner of Stateside Presents is the man behind it all! He is a music fan first and ... well ... that's just what he is ... a music fan not a natural businessman. The place is just beautiful (for now, soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt). The room is small ... stage big (for the size) ... no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come!Thank you Charlie!Music fans unite! This place MUST thrive!btw ... they have live music every single night of the week ... and they open at 4pm every day (the lounge will have musicians and DJs for your entertainment).I have a confession to make. I am... A hipster. It's happened. And ya know what? I'm okay with it. We came here last night in search of PBRs and live music. We got that. And so much more. As we're standing there sipping our Champagne of Beers and someone says:"Damn, that's a really good Jimmy Eat World cover band playing."And then someone else says:"Wait a second! That IS Jimmy Eat World!"So awesome. So 2001.The atmosphere of this place is great. You have a big outdoor area with space heaters for the cancer lovers, a nice sized front area for the boozers with high top tables and low tables, also plenty of room to stand and chill. The music venue is spacious and well amped. Apparently the food is great, I would definitely give it a try next time.One star off for the minimal bathrooms. There was always a huge line.I saw a really great show here with my girlfriend and friend.  The venue itself, I think, has too many bizarre rules and they are pretty disorganized.Going to take a piss, I'd just bought a beer and, hey, I kinda like pissing with a beer.  It's fun!  Above the urinals they have these metal deals that are perfect for setting a drink on, in fact I can't think of a single other application in which they might come in handy.  As I walk in, this security dude goes, "Hey!  You can't bring your beer in there," and I'm like, "Well, I'm gonna set it down right here, then..." when I came out, fuck, my beer was gone and so was the security dude.  Thanks, asshole, this place doesn't charge you up the ass for a drink or anything, anyway...Later on that night, the bar lost my friend's ATM card, and as she periodically checked the balance, she saw that at least one charge she wasn't present for at $2 went through.  Lovely.The venue itself is fine, in terms of set up.  It could stand to be bigger, because this fucker gets packed to the gills, and apparently it gets ten times more packed than it was when I saw it.It really doesn't get any better than Crescent! I have been saving up all these wonderful things to say in a review about Crescent Ballroom but, if I wait any longer I will never write it...Every show, every experience at the bar, every encounter with the staff, it all just gets better all the time. Something in the water perhaps? This venue is the tits! The show room is so intimate. You can get up close and personal with your favourite artists or chill back in the stadium bleachers There's not a bad spot to stop and listen in the whole place. The sound, the lights, the temperature! Its all oddly perfect. You are never really standing on top of someone else and I really love that. But some sold out shows do get packed.Los Dias de la Crescent was such a stand out event for me this past year. Really a unique experience at a venue other than a park. They have a good beer selection! Though they don't have Hop Knot on tap I can order it in a can or, in lieu, grab an Odells on draft. I have not had a chance to order food from the cocina but I have tried the nachos and they do not disappoint!I try to see at least two shows a month here. No reason not to! So many great artist and at such an intimate venue. Stop over at Stinkweeds, pick up some tickets and get your bottom to a show!Nice, large new venue, & decently priced. Sorry Marquee, I dont care to pay $25.00 to see local bands play.Lots of seating in the front bar and a pretty nice patio. Loved that there is seating in the actual venue AND that if you use it, you can still see the bands!they have some pretty tasty cocktails on the menu here that are available at the bar inside the actual venue or the regular bar.The staff seemed to be very courteous, even w/ it being SO busy while we were there.Depending on who's playing, we'll likely be back!Hands down, my absolute favorite venue in all of the Valley.I've seen about 6 or 7 shows here now.  It's a very intimate place, where even from the seating (stadium bleachers, for reals) you are still very much "there".  Pricing, including fees, are very reasonable.  I've rarely paid over $20 for a show, and one at that price even included the artist's new album (thanks, Donovan Frankenreiter!)The food looks and smells delicious, though I've never ordered any yet. Plenty of lunch specials are advertised via Facebook.  Yes, I am a Facebook fan as well!  I appreciate the help-yourself water and cups, so that the wait for drinks at the bar is not held up by a request for 10 waters. Mixed drinks (vodka press, at least) are an extremely reasonable $4 or $5.  Crazy cheap for a music venue. Beer selection is well-thought out as well.Bathrooms are always clean and well-stocked...even at the end of the night.  Practically a miracle.Staff is super friendly. Seriously.  This place has no flaws!Parking is always an easy $5 cash payment at the lot across the street.  Easily accessible to the PHX Light Rail as well, but I've only gone that route once.I notice most other reviews have lots of hipster references.  Can't say that I notice a huge influx of hipsters here versus other similarly sized music venues.  Could that mean that...I am.. *gasp*..a hipster myself?  Uhhh...I say nah...only because I don't own enough hats or mustache-inspired clothing/accessories to quality.  Yet.The Wife took me here for a Date Night to see her band ZZ Ward and have a few drinks. We both really enjoyed the ease and simplicity of the whole experience. Parking is right out back for around $5. Tickets for the show were $15 each and both the drinks and food were very affordable and tasty.Inside has a small lounge up front where you can enjoy some good eats and drinks. You can even hear the bands playing in certain areas without getting a ticket. There is also a small patio that you can use if you need to light one up or just get some fresh air.The bands are in the middle section and it is a rather large area. Most of the people listening are standing up by the stage and you can move around wherever you want to go. There are also some bleachers along the wall if want to listen sitting down. Really like the cool bar area in the back when you need a quick refill and the easy access bathrooms when it is time to go. Nice!This particular show was sold out and packed to the rim. Even with a full crowd it was still a very enjoyable event. The sound is pretty amazing no matter where you listen. It does have a tendency to get pretty loud at times so you may want to bring some ear plugs as an option.Get there early so you can goof off and work on your buzz. The music can go for a few hours depending on the length of the sets and who is playing. We both ordered the giant Lalo Guerrrero Burger to soak up some suds before the main act and it was delicious.Don't tell the wife but I thought ZZ Ward was really CUTE and could easily be my new Yelp Current Crush. Definitely will be back for another show soon. Check online for tickets and schedules. COOL MAN!4.5 STARSThis is my spot! I come here quite often. Cheap drinks, fun & friendly staff. Just don't be a drunk douchebag and they won't mess with you. It's simple.I've been to Crescent several times, but on this last visit, I noticed just how old I am. I literally could not handle the sound level of the music. My first move was to rummage through my purse to see if there was anything to stick in my ears. For some reason, I actually had ear plugs in my purse. I guess when you turn 30, you just start carrying crap like that around. Unfortunately, my boyfriend does not carry ear plugs or a man purse to put them in. So our second move, was to go outside on the patio. When people started smoking around us, we were forced back inside ... because smelling like smoke is now something I avoid like the plague. Then we sat on a bench and decided that if we were just going to sit there and talk to each other, we might as well go home. Now that is sad. I would definitely recommend this place to see a band, but for the love of God, the music in the front room is so loud it hurts. It's just not worth the hearing damage. Yes, I turned 31 last month.Have you ever experienced that moment where you realize you're not half as cool as you think you are? Yeah... well Crescent Ballroom did that for me. The first and only time I've come here, was to play Bingo. That statement alone should be enough evidence to myself and anyone else who will listen that my days of coolness have passed. If they ever existed at all.This place is pretty sweet. I had dinner before Bingo because grandpa (me) knew it might be a late night and I didn't want to eat after I left here. Doing something like that would lead to a night of indigestion and no sleep. Psssh... who needs that in their life. Am I right? I tried the carne asada quesadilla and it was unexpectedly good. I would eat here again without a doubt. The Bingo was played in the concert area. I'm not gonna lie... it was fun. The event was put on by Jackalope Ranch and emceed by the National Comedy Theater of Phoenix. They did a great job. Funny people. Especially this guy Marcus. Hilarious. They were all about audience participation. Like it or not. I was actually glad I never won a hand of Bingo because then you had to go up on stage and try to match wits with a trained comedian. I don't need that in my life. I'm the kind of person who thinks of a comeback 3 days later. It was a lot of fun though. Crescent Ballroom seems like it would be an amazing live music venue. I checked the calendar and there was not one band that I knew. Oh, wait... except the Toadies. You know the "hipster" line, you wouldn't know who they are... Well they're right. I don't. Bottom line is that this place is cool. A solid 4. Hopefully one day a band I know will play here and I can bump it to a 5. Until then I'll live in happy acceptance that my days of coolness are behind me.They must have recently hired a new crew. Last two times I've been there, there's one girl in particular who is insufferably rude. PRO TIP: bring cash for the bars. Every time I go there, my card either gets charged twice or I get overcharged.Small, intimate venue for shows/concerts in the middle of downtown. The bar is located at the end of the ballroom, near the bathrooms. There are three rows of "stadium" seating toward the back, facing the stage. Overall, clean, cute atmosphere and cheap drinks - $5 for my usual vodka cranberry. Had a great time seeing Yus, Mas Ysa, and EMA here - and Crescent Ballroom made the event free - which was awesome!What's not to love! How can a place called the Crescent Ballroom not be an experience! It is not a place where little old ladies dodder around, looking for a handsome, dashing, debonair dance partner. It is also not a place for the faint of heart who wish to challenge the trivia gods on a Sunday night.It is primarily a music venue where local acts can hone their skills in front of an appreciative audience of just post adolescent audiophiles.If you do venture out on a Sunday evening to play trivia here, be prepared to be completely destroyed by the local experts. They really know their stuff. There is some parking around back and I think you have to pay unless you are a gambler.The food choices are limited but they do have an eat-your-face-off plate of nachos that should satisfy anyone's hunger.The drink choices are quite acceptable if you can get the waiter to hear what you want.Try this place. You won't be disappointed.

Oh, Malaya Kitchen. How in the world have I passed by your doors for so long after dwelling, eating and shopping in and around the Arboretum for so long? Made it in after finding another restaurant was closed on a Sunday afternoon. Boy, oh boy, am I glad they were closed! These guys are on my culinary map for good. A quaint, low-lit dining room with a few tables, bench/booth-ish seats and a full bar. We made it in around 1:30pm and were seated immediately. For you soda drinkers, know that if you order a coke, you'll get a 12oz can with a cup of ice. Kind of a bummer, but I guess it's better that limit the intake to one per meal. We started out with the Roti Telur. "Pancake" style app with egg, onions and peppers served with an incredible curry dipping sauce. There are a few potatoes in the curry sauce. Like little starch boats floating in a delicious stream of Malaysian happiness. That good. Each bite was perfect as it was drenched with the curry sauce and a little added sriracha. I saved the curry sauce for the rest of the meal!My wife had the Stir Fried Okra and Belacan Sauce. Served with white or brown rice. The sauce was spicy and smoky. It had a hint of fruitiness. Kind of difficult to pinpoint but each bite was intriguing. The veggies were aplenty among the rice and sauce. I ordered the Char Kway Teow. Malaysian pan fried noodles with red onions and bean sprouts. I ordered it with chicken. WHOA. Smoky, tender noodles with so much chicken in each bite, I'd thought there wouldn't be any left for anyone else to order! I added the remaining curry sauce to my entire plate and couldn't have been happier. Whoever discovered this flavor profile deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. I cleaned my plate. Our server was so helpful and described each dish and how it was made. Very nice and so happy! The prices are very, very fair for lunch. We ate for just over $20. Can't go wrong in that department. Thanks, Malaya Kitchen. We'll be back soon and very soon. Cheers!D iverse menuA ttentive serviceM enu options for adventurers and the not-so-muchN ot a whole lot of $$G racious staffO ver-the-top roti telurO n point menu adviceD electable foodMalaya Kitchen is one of those great spots that I would be missing if it weren't for Yelpers! Thanks all! Malaya Kitchen is a wonderful little gem in the Arboretum.  It's cozy and comfortable and the servers are so helpful.  You can tell they love explaining their dishes to newbies.  My hubby and I had the Malay Roll - it's seasoned ground chicken rolled up in tofu skin and deep fried - it's served with a sweet-chili sauce and it was delicious.  It reminds me of a Chinese-Filipino dish, called Kikiam, I grew up with and it brought back some really nice memories.  We also had the Hainan Chicken  - it's poached chicken served at room temperature with the most amazing rice! And last but not least, we had the Char Kway Teow   - pan fried noodles - oh my - so good.Can't wait to go back! And their hours fit folks who tend to eat late - they close at 11:00 PM Mondays -Thursdays, at 12:00 Midnight on Fridays and 10:00 PM on Sundays.

Review Text :
Up until dining at Milos, my Greek food experience has been gyros from a truck and/or sitting in a divey restaurant where ladies with hairy chins serve up greasy plates of spanakopita and crinkle fries. Delicious nonetheless, but certainly not what you get at this upscale Las Vegas eatery. Yes, Milos is fancy. Not pretentious fancy, but they do have linen tablecloths and fancy art on the walls. Because it's Vegas, you don't necessarily have to dress up to dine out here (you see it all!) but I wouldn't want to come in here wearing jorts and a cutoff t-shirt. Just sayin'. This is the type of place where you could show off your hella proper table manners ;)Apparently this spot gets pretty crowded at night, so we came here for a late lunch. It was not busy at all! In fact, we were one of two tables seated in the entire restaurant. I felt kind of bad for our waiter since he was obviously wanting to chat with us, but kept his distance as to avoid being annoying. The prix-fixe menu is definitely the way to go. As many have mentioned, it's a good deal for the amount of food you're served. Definitely go with the grilled octopus as your first course - it's quite spectacular. I've always liked this eight-legged food, but have really started to appreciate it over the last few months. I had the shrimp as a main course and it was also delicious. For dessert, it was the yogurt martini. IMHO, Greek food is not synonymous with dessert, but this was about as good as you can get.We were in and out within an hour, although we could've stuck around much longer. I would imagine that this would be a place to take business clients or a good friend for a midday meal. Or if you want to call ahead a few weeks in advance, go here for dinner. It's classy, good food and excellent service.If you are looking for a fancy seafood lunch under twenty bucks on strip, you should definitely consider Milos. It offers lunch menu with 3 courses for $20.12 from Monday through Sunday. You can chose one from 6 different appetizers, 6 different main courses, and 3 options of deserts. I came here with my mom for Sunday lunch, and got seated at terrace. Atmosphere at terrace was very relaxing with stylish ambiance. My first course was fresh diver scallop skewer. Scallop tasted very fresh. It was cooked perfectly with right amount of seasoning. I could still taste sweetness of fresh scallops from my dish.  I had grilled Mediterranean bass as my main course. It was absolutely delicious!!! Fish meat tasted very elegant. Chef removed all the fish bones during preparations, so I could enjoy my dish with no worries. Bass was grilled beautifully with little seasoning of olive oil and sea salt. Is was simple and just perfect. I had walnut cake as desert. It was light and not too sweet. Overall I had a great time here, and would definitely be back very soon with friends and family. Milos truly won 5 starts on my yelp book. It is truly worthy every penny I spent here. Two thumbs up!!!I have no legit excuse why it has taken me so freakin long to hit up this place for lunch.  It's not like there aren't enough 5 star reviews on it already:P  I've read them all, had this place bookmarked forever and it lived up to the hype!  Definitely won't take as long to come back here.  My petite wife gets cold pretty easily.  Anyone else ever bring a snuggie to the movie theater?  So being seated on the terrace was the clear choice.  The sunlight, high ceilings and decor really transports you somewhere else.  The indoor dining area isn't too shabby either but this is where it's at!Down to business!  The 3 course lunch for $20.12 was what we were here for.  Appetizer:My wife got the Greek meze plate which had tarama (creamy paste with fish roe), tzatziki (cucumber yogurt), htipiti (Greek feta dip, kinda like hummus), manouri cheese (like super creamy feta), olives and cherry tomatoes along with a side of pita.  Yum yum.  The tarama was the clear standout as it was the first time either of us had eaten that before.  I love fish roe and all things caviar.  I shelled out the extra $10 for the grilled octopus: sashimi quality Mediterranean octopus, charcoal-broiled with lemon and olive oil.  It was worth every....single....penny.  Grilled octopus has to be one of the top 10 meats of all time!  I cut the pieces even smaller to try and savor each bite.  Entree:And just when I thought things couldn't get any better...they DID!  The waiter and a lot of Yelp reviews stressed the Lavraki (grilled Mediterranean bass) and it was so fucking good.  I could eat this for lunch 3 times a week for the rest of my life easy!!  A whole bass grilled up with lemon and oil was simple yet perfect.  I even ate the head bits and eyeballs for chrissakes!! My wife went with the tuna burger but it was pretty much carb overload at that point.  Between the second bread basket, pita from the meze and then the bun on the burger, she just went from the protein.  The tuna was cooked nicely.  I think there was an orange slice in it?  The zuchinni fries were great as well.  They added mint to them which had them take on a whole different taste than the usual way they're done.  Dessert:     Walnut pie with kaimaki ice cream was like a super spiced coffee cake and my wife loved the yogurt martini.I am not so hot on the dinner prices here but I would recommend this lunch to anyone.  I am ready to go again!Really amazing fish entrees, and the fish tour was a nice touch (ask for it!). I also thought the lamb chops and grilled octopus were delicious too. Our group was on a bit of a tight schedule and the staff was in tune with that (though due to timing of our entrees we were eating right down to the wire). Only complaint was the restaurant was filled with light smoke by the end of our dinner, not sure the root cause but hopefully that's not a regular occurrence.wow Milos I love you!Best lunch special on the strip and city!Been here twice for lunch and I'm in love!Locals and visitors you must come here for lunch!Great customer service, ambience and value :)I'm a fan!-------LUNCH ONLY--------I'm NOT a fan of Greek food at all but this restaurant may have completely changed my mind. This gem is located inside the Cosmo hotel right near the escalator but can be easy to miss. In fact, I only came here on a total whim but it turned out to the best decision ever. Their 3-course lunch meal for $20 is pretty difficult to beat. It was the perfect way to end one of the most tiring business trips I've ever taken. Service is really great, the setting is really nice (good for business or casual). If it's not too hot, be sure to sit outside because it really just makes the meal that much better. I went with my co-workers and we shared a bunch of dishes and everything tasted great but here are a few of my favorites:Grilled Octopus - Had just the right amount of chewy texture. Really great flavor. Definitely a table favoriteLobster Pasta - Most pasta dishes are the same but what I REALLY appreciated about this dish was that they were GENEROUS with their lobster portions. For a $20 lunch meal, you'd figure there'd be tons of pasta and only a little bit of lobster. No sir, they definitely piled on the lobster.Roasted Beets - Our group just really likes beets and this side dish was just executed really well.Greek coffee - SUPER SUPER sweet but that's right up my alley so I fell in love with this. My co-workers? Not so much hahaDefinitely a surprise hit for me considering I never like Greek food. But this restaurant has turned me into a believer.Excellent place for lunch.  For $22+, you get an appetizer, entree and dessert.  The portions are just right and they have great selections.For appetizer they have: Greek Meze Plate (tarama, tzatziki and htipiti), Canadian Classic (smoked salmon, cream cheese, red onion and a bagel), Scallop Skewer (with green bell pepper and couscous), Tomato Salad, Grilled Octopus for an extra $10 or Crab Cake for an extra $10.  For entree: Lavraki (grilled bass), Salmon (with steamed veggies), Organic Chicken Breast Skewer (with grilled mushrooms, onions and pita), Shrimp Saganaki (with couscous, tomato and feta), Lamb Chops (with fries and broccoli) for an extra $10 or Losbter Pasta for an extra $15.For dessert: Walnut Cake (with Kaimaki ice cream), Yogurt Martini or Fresh fruits.Greek Meze Plate:I started dipping my pita from the most flavorful to the not-so-much. I was not in the mood for flavor elevation today.  The tarama (creamy fish roe paste), bursts with pleasant brinyness, reminded me of  eating pregnant sardines but creamier (pardon the Andrew Zimmern-esque description).  It was very smooth and you can't tell you're eating fish eggs.  Dip your pita in the htipiti (red pepper spread) next.  Huge flavor difference from the tarama. Then move onto the tzatziki for a cool, tangy, creamy dip. Repeat.  Your plate comes with feta, olive and grape tomatoes too. 5/5Grilled Octopus: Hands down, THE BEST octopus I've had in the past 2 years.  It was tender and had an excellent smoky flavor to it.  It was absolutely wonderful. 5/5Lavraki:Served head on.  Grilled sea bass drizzled with olive oil, capers and served with broccoli.  The skin got soggy except for the part closest to the tail which was crisp and flavorful.  They'll warn you about the fish collar being too boney. 4/5Lobster Pasta:Great presentation. Lobster head, pasta, and lobster tail on a plate. Huge chunks of lobster in the pasta in a light tomato sauce.  What a beautiful dish. 5/5Walnut Cake:A small slice of what tasted like a banana bread except less moist. The ice cream tasted similar to absinthe/anise which I personally don't like. 3.5/5Yogurt Martini:Greek yogurt in a martini glass topped with strawberry sauce and half a strawberry for garnish. There's nothing more to elaborate on this one. 3.5/5Service and location were superb.  There's nothing bad to say about this place at all.Review of: $22.13 Pre-Fixe Lunch Menu 2013My friend and I have attempted to eat the Pre-Fixe at Milos before, back when it was $20.13. Indeed, they have upped the price, but I don't think $2 is much more for what you are getting. However, if they upped the price anymore than that I would think twice about coming here for this particular Pre=Fixe.I believe one of the best ways to eat well, in fancy places, and get the bang for your buck is to eat happy hours, lunch, and Pre-Fixe menus. Numerous fancy-dancy places in Vegas offer these menus in their "off" times (IE: not dinner) and this accommodates especially locals very well. I imagine the meal I had at this particular lunch would have set me back a whole lot more than 20 bucks-ish had I been dining during a "dinner" time at Milos. With that being said, onto the food:First Course - Meze PlateComes with three sauce, pita bread, cheese, one tomato and one olive. I really wanted another kalamata olive. Why just one Milos?! Why?! Oh right, presentation or something probably. I chose the meze plate because I wanted an option to just get my palate going before I had my main course. The other first courses on the menu are quite sumptuous (scallops, octopus, etc.) However, the meze plate eases you into your meal in a nice way, being able to play with which flavors you slather onto your pita bread. I enjoyed the dish and the presentation.Second Course - Sea BassA fish you'll wish you could eat every time you eat fish. It is presented sliced in half, tail and head still attached (please do what you can to scrape some meat out of the head - I did!). The flavor is - buttery, meaty white fish. If you don't know what that tastes like, then order this dish and enjoy. My fish did not have too many bones, I believe I probably ran into about 5-6. However, my friend's fish seemed to be loaded, so just be careful when eating.Third Course - Walnut CakeMeh. I was not impressed and wished I had ordered another dessert. This cake was dry and tasted like gingerbread. I'm not a fan. The ice cream on top was the only reason I could stomach the whole piece. Had the ice cream not been on top I would have just left it on the plate after the first couple bites.Service - Genteel, warm, friendly, upscale, quick, we were not forgotten, nor were we hovered over. When we arrived the place was empty, when we left it was totally full. So kudos to management and servers for keeping a service exceptional through a lunch rush.Overall - A decent Pre-Fixe to try out. Since Milos specializes in seafood, those who may not want to dump a whole lot of money into such a specialized restaurant should consider the Pre-Fixe option and then decide whether or not they would return for full price. Now, if I had a hankering for seafood and had some extra money to throw around I would definitely return to Milos, probably with out-of-town friends to wow them.I came here for my birthday lunch with my mommy. I have been hearing and reading rave reviews for this place for ages so was thrilled to finally be able to try this place. We arrived at 12 on the dot and the restaurant was just starting to fill up. We were approached immediately by our waiter who took our drink orders and sent over some bread to our table. The bread bowl was pretty good.I was a little disappointed that a lot of the things I had been interested to try were out since they didn't get a new shipment of seafood, so I didn't get to try the octopus that everyone raves about. I was only bummed for a short time and decided on starting with the hummus plate, lobster pasta and Greek yogurt for dessert. My mom got salmon bagel, chicken and Greek yogurt for dessert. Everything was really great. I was happy with our choices for the most part. The dips were great and the Greek yogurt blew my mind, it was so tasty. I had heard a lot about the walnut cake, but they don't offer that on the lunch menu anymore. For lunch, this is the place to be and you could tell as they were very busy. Great deal and I can't wait to go back and hopefully try a few of the options that weren't available to us this time. Service was impeccable as well.This is a fun place for an epic meal!  Over a year ago, Eric R. and I came here for the $20.12 lunch, both getting suckered into the supplement (me for the octopus, him for the crab cake).  We thought it was good but figured dinner here would be out of reach.  Yesterday I get a call from him around 3 PM asking if I wanted to have dinner here with his uncle.  Both of us have a lot of really cool uncles who seem to visit Vegas often and treat us to nice dinners.  I would never turn this down!  Reservations were set for 8 which gave me plenty of time to run errands after work.We arrived fashionably at 8:04 and were seated immediately.  Four of us dined without abandon.  We all had cocktails - I tasted the cucumber-based "In the Know" and the apple one, but opted for the "Sticky Rice" with tanqueray, plum preserves, and jasmine syrup.  It sounded me-ish and it was delicious.  We were given grilled bread and a fruity olive oil to start.  Then the ordering commenced.  The server said due to the east coast weather, they were limited on types of fish and oysters and were out of the octopus (gasp) and sardines.  Bummer!First, we opted for apps only.  Eric R. and I shared the Raw bar tasting, which normally has 4 types of fish but due to this shortage it had 3.  It included bigeye tuna with YUZU kosho!!!, salmon with fresno chile and shallot, and some white fish that ended up being quite excellent considering I do not often get white fish sashimi.  I also ordered 3 oysters from Washington state, and we got the grilled shrimp app with endive salad.  The other guests ordered the mushroom side as an app and so I tried abalone, trumpet, and shiitakes and they were great of course.  Eric R. also got taramasalata which was nothing like any I have had before - the roe was not visible, and Eric thought it tasted and looked like hummus (to me the taste was closer to taramasalata) but they did not give us anything to eat it with for probably 20 minutes - we had to ask for bread from 3 different people, and it was the least interesting thing to eat on the table.Next, we ordered Greek salads - everyone spotted the beautiful Canadian (hah) tomatoes near the bar and the salads are just tomatoes, feta, cucumber, red onion, olive, and green pepper - no lettuce.  Eric R. and I split one and I ended up with leftovers for today which I am eating now, yum!  We ordered the whole opakapaka for the table prepared simply with olive oil and lemon and had the server split it tableside.  It was delicate and tasty, and I could only eat half.  I tried the fish cheek which was cool.For sides, we got chard, broccoli, roasted beets, and sweet onions.  I was the only beet eater so I got to take those home too.  The rest of the sides were okay.  No room for dessert!  Because I am local, I am fortunate enough to take the delicious extra food home which I am sure many tourists do not do.  This meal was delicious from start to finish which service pretty personable throughout.  The sticky rice cocktail was also excellent.If I return, I still would get octopus if it were available again.  This was likely a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me, so I am glad it was delicious, fun, and with generous family!Hands down--worst experience in Vegas. Never have I been this disappointed in a Vegas restaurant.Was it because we didn't order wine (our bill wasn't going to be high enough)?Was it because we were the only Asians dining at this restaurant at dinner time? My husband and I have been regulars at the Cosmopolitan Hotel for almost 2 years now (we are here every 4-8 weeks) because it's dog-friendly. We come here and easily drop $$$$ on food and we were so disappointed on how this restaurant ignored us for an hour.  No exaggeration. I looked at my watch.WE WALKED OUT WITHOUT EATING OUR FOOD BECAUSE WE NEVER GOT IT....AFTER OVER ONE HOUR.We made reservations for 8:30pm. Despite other empty tables throughout the restaurant, we were seated at the worst table next to the hostess stand.We were not given menus. (What?!?)We had to wait at least 10-15 mins to finally get someone's attention to get us a menu.The server....where was he? No clue. He didn't even come to our table till TWENTY MINUTES AFTER WE SAT DOWN.Everything I wanted to order ran out, including lobster and octopus -- I told you spend money on food in Vegas.  (This is our second time here. Last time, half of the menu items had also run out at dinner time.)We never got our meal. No, seriously. We never got dinner!!!Our server didn't even check up on the kitchen to see if our order was in....turned out that it never made it to the kitchen. Can you believe it? How does that even happen?When we got angry and stood up to complain to one of the managers, he went to check on the kitchen.....yup, our dinner was no where on their radar. We then complained to the general manager. He was hardly empathetic.  WE ARE NEVER EVER EVER EVER SPENDING OUR MONEY AT THIS RESTAURANT. My easy going husband has never walked out of a restaurant. In fact, I'd have to say that this is a first for us.GO TO STK. In terms of food & service on the third floor, STK Is the winner.Best lunch deal in Vegas bar none...Restaurant is located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan HotelThree courses for $22.31(As of 2013)We have been going here since it opened and prices have bumped up from $19 the first year it opened.As a starter we have had...-Tomato salad(Always ripe and juicy with cucumber ..Very fresh and tasty)-Diver scallops ..its still good but this year it is one skewer with about 2/3 small scallops and grilled vegetables.-Smoked Salmon(Very standard..just ok)-Grilled octopus..This used to be a must get. With big chunky pieces of octopus. Now its much smaller pieces of octopus but still very good. (This is a supplemental dish and will cost an additional $15)Main dish-Lavraki (European sea bass)...This is a must get. Cooked to perfection with sprinkles of sea salt. Splash on some lemon and you are good to go. Just be careful of the tiny fsh bones. If you like-Lamb Chop..Tasty..very tender and cooked perfectly. The sleeper entree.-Salmon...Its salmon and you can get this anywhere...Had my buds and its was OK...-Lobster Pasta..Worth the supplemental $15. Pasta is al dente and cooked to perfectly and pipping out. Lobster chunks are meaty and sweet. Very very good dish.Dessert-Greek Yogurt..Very good. -Mixed Fruit..Just Ok...This is a must stop every time we are in Vegas.Would recommend you try this place out...We have had dinner here as well but prices jump up significantly.Brought clients in and celebrated securing a major hotel remodel project on the strip. I made it a point to make reservations ahead of time since it was a Thursday and Milos lunch is popular.We decided to get three different appetizers and share them between the three of us.They were: Grilled Octopus -sashimi quality Mediterranean octopus, charcoal-broiled,Greek Meze Plate - Tarama, Tzatziki, Htipiti, manouri cheese, olives & cherry tomatoes and the fresh Maryland Lump Crab Cake. Two of the three had a $10.00 up charge but they were all delicious and worth the extra money. For my main entree I chose the Lavraki - grilled Mediterranean bass cooked perfectly with a sauce and capers. The fish was whole and so moist and fresh. Lastly I had the Greek Yogurt which ended my fabulous meal. My clients were just as pleased with their meals as myself and everyone was satisfied. I'm so glad I chose Estiatorio Milos for lunch and would suggest this restaurant for a business power luncheon or for lunch with friends or family.My new favorite lunch place in Vegas! I've visited Milos in Greece and New York and am so excited that there is now one in LV. They offer a set lunch for $22. You get the choice of several appetizers, a few different mains and dessert. We ended doing one set lunch and ordering the Milos special, a must when at any Milos! It's lightly fried zucchini and eggplant with tzatziki and fried Greek cheese. OMG, I could eat this all day long. Plus their tzatziki is like yogurt of the gods. It's super thick and filled with cucumbers. For the set lunch, we ended paying a lot of supplemental charges for the octopus and the lobster spaghetti but it was worth it. I think next time I'd do the dips to start instead of the octopus, but regardless everything was wonderful. The atmosphere is bright, with some seating outside, which is so lovely for lunch. I hate feeling like you are in the basement of a casino for lunch and that is not the case at Milos. Dessert was some of that thick Greek yogurt with strawberry puree. We licked the bowl. You get the picture. Have you booked a table yet?!Let me start off by saying my favorite yelper Melanie A just gave this place 3 stars. I'm going with 1 star, I was going to go 2 stars but then she reminded me about the nasty attitudes at the front desk.  I walk in and give everybody a nice big friendly hello and get the nastiest looks with not 1 hello back from any of the 3 hostesses. Just a curt follow me from one of them.Strike one.Next we sit down in loud drafty room with more attitude from our waiter.Now before I go any further let me preface what I'm about to say with the fact that I have been to the original Milos in Montreal and the Milos in Manhattan, both were great dinning experiences but I don't know what this place is! It's more like a Myli's than a Milos!!I love octopus and eat it all over the world and have never paid $32.00 for octopus of any size. This was an appetizer which came out COLD,  we sent it back. Second octopus was inedible chewy as rubber, possibly the worst octopus of my life.Next we order the fish tasting appetizer.  Very good to excellent but at 82.00 for 16 pieces of sashimi that they should serve with a pair of tweezers and surgical magnifying glasses so u can see and properly handle the tiniest pieces of fish u can imagine.Bread and olive oil r great. Greek salad was pathetic with mushy tomatoes, one olive, yes one olive in a salad for two. Feta was of poor quality also. So bad I refuse to classify it as Greek! It was left half uneaten. We didn't want to send another dish back to appear like nasty tourists so we just left it on the table.We go pick out our fish, a Greek snapper of some sort. Came out dry as sawdust!  That went back. We had no choice it could not be swallowed with out risk of solidifying in your throat like some cemeticious  marine leak stopper that u slap in a hole instantly stop leaking water coming out of it.  Well at this point no employee of Milos restaurant is talking to us. Just nasty looks and attitude.We order Dover sole and that were the only words spoken. Icy silence from the staff.  No inkling of anybody coming over to say we're sorry your extremely outrageously expensive dinner is sucking so far.Dover sole came out and it was good but no where worth the price of admission. When we were done with the fish we sat there forever it seemed like we were in Quarantine with the H1N1 virus!Finally ordered coffee and no mention of coffee on the house for your miserable dinning experience, I am giving this a DANGER DANGER WILL ROBINSON warning.AVOID AVOID AVOID. Go put your money on Red or Black you'll get more enjoyment out of it then you will here.I just received THE WORST SERVICE I've ever had in my life.  Let me paint you the picture...I've been here a couple times with excellent service, friendly staff, and efficient food courses....as well as good food. Today, I noticed a HUGE difference in just receiving my WATER and BREAD.The bread was almost FINISHED before I received water...nothing to drink.  It was also almost finished by the time my order was TAKEN.  And no, we weren't starving...it just took that long.  I'd estimate about 12-15min.There was a HUGE difference of time between my first course and the entree.  So bad, that I noticed THREE OTHER TABLES (that arrived after me and ordered afterwards) receive their food before me!!!This wouldn't be a huge deal if it wasn't for the fact that I had to get a MANAGER involved, and I STILL didn't have my food until they were almost FINISHED with theirs.  One of the three tables actually WAS finished with their food.  And I think most of these tables had the SAME SERVER!!!Because my lunch was now taking almost 1.5-2hrs before I have received my entree, I ask the manager to bring my dessert WITH my entree, since I wouldn't have enough time to finish my meal.BEST PART :  While we are STILL waiting for our entrees to arrive, the server actually comes over to us, and asks how everything was....ARE YOU SERIOUS???  How can you be that HORRIBLE at your job, to NOT realize that you didn't even bring us 2 out of 3 COURSES and think we are FINISHED???  When I complain to her, she asks if I already talked to a manager...then brushes us off.  I am seriously considering walking out!!!The food finally comes in hand via the manager.  My Lobster Pasta (which I've had twice here before now) was a bit undercooked (noodles).  I mention it to the waitress, and I left a pile of noodles on the plate when I was finished.  Pretty sure it goes to deaf ear.When I don't get checked on via the manager, I just ask for the check and some water to finally be refilled.  She brings over the water and takes a while to get my check.  NOW I AM STEAMING...I WANNA LEAVE THIS PLACE!!!I follow her to the damn kiosk to print my check, write a big fat $0 on the tip line (PROUDLY) and write in huge print "THIS WAS THE WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER RECEIVED."  I've NEVER stiffed anyone in my entire life...not even a valet bringing a friend's car down...you're still gonna get money outta me.  But I could not FATHOM giving this DISAPPOINTMENT a dime of my money.  I dropped almost $100 for lunch for two with ice water to drink...I am not sitting at a Dennys at 3am!!!I wait for the same manager to finish talking to another group that was ALSO COMPLAINING, and hand him the checkbook with written note and walk away.  Good luck.Greek restaurant in a German hotel on the Vegas Strip?  Why not.Estiatorio Milos continues to impress.  Outstanding seafood that calls one back to the costal villages and towns bordering the Mediterranean.  And let's just say, you will pay 40 percent less for this level of quality and freshness as the "other" place in the twin parabolic, glass sheathed extensions of an eccentric, once vegan, billionaire's ego anchoring the North Strip.  Huh what?Milos features extremely fresh and vibrant ingredients like Mediterranean seafood, air flown live daily.  Dishes are prepared with respect for the incredible ingredients.  Most seafood is simply grilled, dressed with a peppery Greek olive oil and a squeeze of sun ripened lemon allowing the flavors to shine.  Exemplary examples include simply grilled, uber sweet, live langoustines (the only other place in Vegas to offer this), salty, oceanic Portuguese sardines, and a tender braised then grilled octopus.  The razor focused flavor of each carried by richness of the oil and enhanced by the acidity of the lemon.Grilled whole fish also benefit from the simple finish.  Simply tour the seafood bar, pick one out, pay by the pound and enjoy.Finally, for lobster lovers, do not pass on any of the lobster pastas (the lobster pasta for lunch uses an American lobster, dinner choices include the deep sea Bay of Fundy or Mediterranean blue lobsters).  Perfectly cooked chunks of tail meat mixed in a mild but acidic tomato base served with the cooked head.  Be sure to scrape out the tamale and mix it with the pasta for the added briny oceanic finish.Tip:  Lunch offers the best value.  Three courses beginning at $22.14 with a maximum $20 supplement for top selections.Very good wine list.  Wine by the glass offerings mainly Greek and pair perfectly with the food.  Service is attentive and very friendly.A restaurant that has vastly improved with time.**This review is for the bar area only** I was in Milos for about 45 minutes to meet with my cousin and pre-game for a bit before heading down stairs to see Mariachi El Bronx explode on the main floor of Cosmo. The bar area is super cozy and the bartenders are very attentive. This area not only overlooks the restaurant, but you also get a sweet view of the bustling Cosmo floor, great spot for people watching. The drinks here are pricey, but are also pretty stiff, so it balances out. I didn't eat during this quick trip, but I will be back because the food smells coming out this place were intoxicating. PRO TIP:Avoid the long wait and eat at the bar. You can order food and chow down in the bar area if the restaurant is slammed.We came here to celebrate our anniversary with the family. I am Greek and a pretty decent cook, I know how good Greek food should taste, so its not easy to please me, Milos Estiatorio did!We decided to dine at the patio.We had the prix-fixe thee-course lunch for $25 with some upgrades, at this price its a bargain (a steal), personally I believe they need to raise it to at least $35+ so they can keep the quality of the meal.They were out of Nova Scotia Lobster (not very happy about that) The grilled bread and olive oil was 4/5The Meze plate Tarama 2/5, Tzatziki 3.5/5, Milos special fried zucchini and eggplane with tzatziki and cheese 4.5/5Grilled Octopus +$10 upgrade (it's worth It) 4/5Lavraki/Bass 4/5Shrimp Saganaki 4/5 cous-cous 4/5 tomato sauce 5/5Calamari 4/5Lamb chops were 4/5Karidopita 4/5 with kaimaki 1/5 I wouldn't call it kaimaki it was a melted and refrozen ice something. Kaimaki is a creamy rich stretchy unique tasting ice cream with Sahlep powder and Mastixa, what I was served at Milos was not even close.They serve the Turkish version across the street for $5 for a Mini size, so as you see the real stuff is pricey. The Hoegaarden Belgian white Ale was the lightest no after taste beer I ever had 5/5 to bad you can find it in Las Vegas The service was good 4/5Loved the Mediterranean decor 4/5Over all we had a great time, I like to go back for dinner.As we ate our lunch, the table was divided over whether our experienced rated an optimistic  four stars (me) or three (everyone else). Unfortunately, the dessert course took it down rather than up. It's a good value for lunch, and the majority of four- and five-star reviews seem to be based on lunch experiences that emphasize the value: at $25.15 per person for a three-course pre-fixe, it's not bad. But it's not great, either. Diner who opted for the $16 wine pairing thought neither selection was particularly interesting, YMMV.APPETIZERS: Table bread had a light char on it that infused a slightly burned taste, fellow diners were divided over whether this added to or detracted from their enjoyment. Would appreciate herbs added to the decent-quality dipping oil. The mezze platter features various dips and crudités, the hummus was one of the best local versions I've had with a great texture. The tomato salad was simple and tasty but went unfinished with our group. The crab cake ($10 supp) was extremely good, but also unexpectedly tiny. The much-hyped grilled octopus ($10 supp), which I'd most been looking forward to, was well-flavored but disappointingly overdone and tough. I was bummed to see the scallop and calamari options visible on their website were not on the available menu.MAINS: The sea bass lacked seasoning but was perfectly cooked, broccoli side was unremarkable. The shrimp saganaki lacked flavor and the shrimp themselves were overcooked and cold instead of hot, fresh, and juicy. Lobster Pasta ($15 supp) has beautiful presentation but received mixed feelings at our table: I enjoyed the light tomato sauce while others found it bland and complained about the lack of lobster content and flavor in the dish. The chicken skewer was nicely seasoned and juicy but fairly boring, however the fries were spectacularly well done and paired well with the tzatziki sauce.DESSERT: We didn't finish even half of any single dish from this course. The Greek yogurt was the only decent item, and had great texture, but could have benefitted from additional fruit garnish rather than a single berry and a drizzle of compote. Would have preferred this with honey and walnuts, as it was previously served. The fresh fruit plate looked like the dismal remains of a business meeting buffet. The walnut cake and ice cream was a dry, flavorless mess topped with an icy, flavorless glob. I like the option to do the pre-fixe but if nearly a third of the available options incur a fee that then doubles the price, why bother? The dishes are fresh and appealing, but the trend of overcooking-and-underseasoning dishes is a basic execution error I don't expect to encounter on the Strip. Meal for four with coffees and  tip averaged to $50/pp and was underwhelming to all, which negated the "great food for a great value" claims that brought us in for our visit in the first place.Who ever thought you could get your bang for the buck in Las Vegas, one of the top places known for helping you empty your wallet?! But by far, this is one of my favorite dining experiences on the Strip. And that's saying a lot!FOOD:-------The pre-fixe lunch menu is a straight up steal at $25.15 for your choice of appetizer, main course, and dessert. And mind you, they're not skimping on the portions either. Here's what we ordered: APPETIZERS:** Fresh Maryland Lump Crab Cake ($10 supplementary) - So flavorful and juicy! And paired well with the marinated navy beans and mustard emulsion. Definitely a great choice.** Grilled Octopus appetizer ($10 supplementary) - My friend ordered this. I'd never wanted to try octopus before (usually stay away from seafood with a rubbery texture) but it smelled so good I couldn't resist. Prepared to sashimi quality and charcoal-broiled, the octopus was delicious. I don't know if I'll be able to eat it anywhere else!MAIN COURSES:** Lavraki - You get an entire grilled Mediterranean bass. This blew my mind. I was heading to the airport directly after lunch, so I had to eat the entire portion. Which wasn't a bad thing because it tasted amaaaazing.** Shetland Island Organic Salmon with steamed vegetables - My friend ordered this dish and it was also a great choice. I usually don't order salmon in restaurants as a rule, but this one was just right. Not dry at all and very flavorful.DESSERT:** Karidopita with kaimaki ice cream - What a happy ending to this meal! Absolutely wonderful with a great texture, not too sweet, and topped with ice cream. What more could you want?!** The Real Greek Yogurt - A nice, light dessert with berries. Not as sour as I expected. Yum!SERVICE/AMBIANCE:---------------------Wait staff was extremely professional and treated us just like everyone else, even though we were the only ones dressed very casually since we were soon airport-bound. Very attentive just as you'd expect from a $$$$ establishment. Very pleased with the service.The ambiance is just gorgeous. It gives you the fine ding experience while also adding a cultural flair with the seafood market theme and beautiful Greek decor.TIP: Come here for lunch! You can't pass up this experience especially at the price.DATE TIP: You can be a baller on a budget here, fo sho. You'll certainly impress your date! Only thing is the price is displayed very clearly at the top of the menu, so hopefully they're impressed by your deal-finding skills. Otherwise you should kick them to the curb anyway!

Restaurant name  Ichiban Sichuan
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Ichiban is up there with the best Chinese in Madison. Most of the menu is authentic with a few American standards thrown in.  Think General Tso's chicken. It's best to come with a few adventurous friends and order several items. The portions are huge for the prices.  String beans with or without minced pork and cumin lamb are my faves.  I will be back. Soon.At Bob S' behest, I finally got around to ordering from Ichiban.First, I would just like to say this was the fastest delivery order yet. We placed our order at ~7:30, and received a call at 7:50. I was expecting an hour's wait, as is typical for delivery in Madison, and was pleasantly surprised. Second, this place has real, yes REAL, scallion pancakes (though it could have been crunchier). Ever since moving here from Boston, I have been on a crusade to find scallion pancakes. I've tried dozens of Chinese places, and have received bread with scallions, fried crepes with scallions, but never actual scallion pancakes... Until now.Now, moving on to the actual food, which is among the most authentic Szechuan cuisine (along with Fugu) in all of Madison. We ordered the ox tongue and triple with chili sauce (different cuts of beef doused in chili oil), scallion pancakes (yay finally), eggplant with chili garlic sauce (huge chunks of sweet eggplants immersed in chili sauce) and poached sliced fish in hot chili sauce (the most tender fish you will ever have).The meal also came with 2 boxes of white rice, perfect for soaking up all the chili sauce. Though, for some reason, there were no fortune cookies. C'mon Ichiban, you need to get with the game here.That being said, everything was absolutely delicious, and I will definitely be stuffing my face with their dishes sometime soon. One thing of note is that the prices are slightly higher than most Chinese places in Madison, but I'd say it's well worth it.For once, a recommendation for a Chinese restaurant in Madison came through for me.  The food at Ichiban is not the best Chinese that I've ever had, but it's certainly at a different level from what you might find in Madison.  We went and had a vermicelli with minced pork, eggplant with garlic sauce, and the spicy chicken dish.  The spicy chicken dish was very good if you like some heat in your food.  I found the eggplant with garlic sauce somewhat oily, but it went well with some rice.This place is the best Chinese I've had in Madison.  It's rather pricey, but it's not your typical Chinese takeout food and it's worth it.  Come here if you want to expand your culinary experience of Chinese food to more than just General Tso' chicken and orange chicken and be prepared to enjoy some spice.

If you're looking for Serbian food in Las Vegas this is THE place to go.  Even if you don't care (or know) what Serbian food is, and if you're just looking for a huge plate o' meat, this is also THE place to go.  Serbians really, really love meat.  Like, all meat, all the time.When I go to Prince, I'm usually with Serbs and we order the plate of meat for two (it's enough for at least three people).  It includes cevapi (Serbian national dish, looks like ground beef sausage links), chicken, beef, pork, and some cheese-stuffed thing I have yet to identify.  It's really good when you're in the mood for a serious dose of protein.  I've also ordered  the beef soup which, literally, includes like a pound of smoky beef roast.  It's insane.  You will leave this place doubled over in pain from the amount of meat you consumed.  I guarantee it.  This would probably be a great place for body builders to eat.The only downside to Prince is that I always feel really intimidated walking in.  The restaurant is dimly lit inside and it sometimes feels like a "Serbian only" atmosphere.  But, if you feel self-conscious, just go outside to the patio seating and chow down on your cevapi.  The waiters are really nice and will make you feel welcome.  It's definitely an experience.

Restaurant name  Williams Fresh Cafe

Review Text :
Williams is kind of like KW's Tim Horton's. Okay, not really, Tim Horton's is flourishing in KW too but there certainly seem to be as many William's coffee locations as Tim's in the city.Williams serves coffee, obviously, but it also serves a wide array of sandwiches, smoothies and desserts. They actually have a kitchen where they prepare meals.They also have free wifi which keeps this place packed with university students and professors alike, all camped out in the booths working on their lap-tops. There's also a small patio.You order and pay at the counter in exchange for a big number you put on your table so they know where to bring your food or drink when it's ready.This location is always buzzing with people so don't expect to get any quiet reading done here, but if you like a bit of background noise, this is the place for you.

Review Text :
The Tilted Kilt.  The Irish Hooters....Please don't misunderstand....I love me some chain restaurants.  Cheesecake Factory, that's my ish.  This place...not so much.Maybe it's the boobalicious, scantily clad waitresses that turns me off.  Or perhaps maybe it was the terribly slow service we received ($2 cans of Yuengling really take 15 minutes to deliver?!).  Or maybe it was the mediocre to tasteless food we received.  Regardless, this place just left a bad taste in my mouth.  Even after 3 beers.  I'll stick to Jerome Bettis down the street.  At least they have a massive Carrot Cake waiting for me and not massive boobies.Wondering if anyone else here had a very nasty experience with Nick, the general manager.My idea of a general manager is that their goal is customer care and service above all else. I was honestly (and I am not being dramatic here) appalled at how I was treated by this General Manager. Verbally disrespected is a good way of putting it. I wanted to pull up an open table on the patio next to a friends' table as more folks were coming. The waitress, extremely kind and helpful (here name was Elizabeth or Libby), said she had to check at the hostess stand and asked me to come with her. I agreed as she was so sweet, I wanted to do what I could to make things easier for her. Upon our arrival at the hostess stand, where the GM was standing, she explained the situation. He immediately barked something at her about having "no idea what she was talking about" (Which made sense as he barely listened to her before he cut her off) and to take him out there and show him. We go back out to the patio, and I promptly explain I just want to take the open table next to my friends' table and sit next to them. I say I don't even need to push the tables together. Nick, the GM, then says "You can have a chair." I instantly think he's being sarcastic as not only is that table wide open, there are--NO LIE--more than a dozen open tables on the patio. It was 90+ degrees outside so no one wanted to be seated out there. Thinking he's joking I respond something like "Oh, just a chair? I can't have the table?" and he goes "NO and if you keep talking to me like that (Mind you, I do not speak disrespectfully to people so I have no idea what set him off), you're not even going to get a chair." At this point, I realize he is NOT kidding and I say "But you have all these open tables out here" and he responds "I have over a 40 minute wait, you're not on that list" and I say "But what about all these open tables?!" to which he says "you can forget that chair" and storms off.Not only did I leave immediately, my friends who were already sitting and eating were so disgusted by how he (a man) treated me (a woman) that they promptly paid their bill and left. As long as he is working here, I won't be making any visits. I've also contacted corporate.Been to this location a couple of times, and it is always fun! Got here on a Saturday night round 11:30 pm and the place was full, stayed until it closed. THANK YOU for having multiple Sam Adams on tap!!! Arizona is tough to find Sammy A. Place is just always fun, girls are always nice to look at. I believe what makes this a 4 star instead of 3, is that the hot bartenders actually can carry a conversation with you and not just stand there and be hot.Came here for the homie's birthday and I wanted to see what all the hype is about this place. I see why the fellas like it so much. It's like an Irish hooters. Girls in skirts? What's not to love. Haha.  So since it was a Friday and I couldn't eat meat I ordered the Quinlan's five cheese flat bread. I saw that it had a basil pesto sauce and thought yes please! Lol. I was disappointed. It was sooooo bland. Like really bland. =/ Drinkssss... I ordered the Celtic crush. A different waitress brought my drink. When I tried it, it was extremely sour. Our original waitress came and said she  noticed that my drink didn't look how it should've. So they made me a new one. It tasted like a screwdriver. Lol. The second drink was a purple haze. Wasn't a big fan of that thing either. To sum up I wasn't a fan of the food and the drinks weren't anything special. Not to mention parking is horrible!!! I drove around for 20 minutes looking for parking and ended up paying like $15. You'd think they would have their own parking but they don't. I probably wouldn't come again on a normal day. It's a cool place to hang out with the homies though to watch a game or to stop by after the suns game.

Restaurant name  BFG Café
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
It's taken me a year to find out that the BFG cafe wasn't named after a weapon in Doom, and that it therefore wasn't some sort of internet cafe as I had expected. No, in fact, BFG cafe stands for Big Fat Greek cafe, presumably because if you eat here regularly you will be big and fat, and the fact that they serve gyros. Additionally, BFG stands for Bloomfield-Friendship-Garfield, the three nearest neighborhoods to the cafe(Well actually East Liberty is probably closer than Bloomfield but nobody wants to eat at the Enormous Large Fat Greek cafe, it's simply too verbose).Walking in to the cafe is a big open kitchen, well over half the room, a few vending machines for drinks, and a seating area to the side. Seating is actually plentiful here as it appears the cafe is two spaces combined. The food here is my favorite kind: cheap. The most expensive item on their menu is a large speciality pizza for $13. 9" hoagies and gyro sandwiches are $5 and under, fries are about a buck, and "pittsburgh-style" salads and 12" pizzas are about $5-7. Simply put, they're hard prices to beat: a spinach-feta pizza and a gyro(big enough that I didn't even make it to the pizza) cost me $11 after tax. The gyro was excellent, and though not enough to usurp my stomach's other Big Fat Greek champion(My Big Fat Greek Gyro), the price and convenience of this place easily makes up for it.  The pizza had a very thin crust and had a nice seasoning to it. Toppings weren't skimped on, but I had a little trouble finding the feta on the slice I did attempt. They also threw tomatoes on it for free, because the guy on the phone thinks they're a nice touch, and, I did too.Shockingly, BFG didn't replace Salt as my favorite restaurant in this stretch of Penn ave, but for cheap sandwich while I'm working from home or for a pizza dinner when I don't feel like cooking, this is a great place to have in the neighborhoodSorry, but I wasn't super impressed with this place.  While the food's cheap here, I found it to be not that special.  I came here last night with a few friends around 6pm for dinner, since they often come here at that time on Mon.  One thing to note is that the dining area is actually quite a bit larger than it seems when you walk in--the doorway to the right of the area where you order leads to a much larger dining room with several booths.  This area is decorated with art from local artists, which is nice--it's great to see a business supporting the local arts scene.I ordered a chicken gyro ($5) and a small order of fries ($1.25) to go with it.  I was expecting the gyro to be on par with some of the other ones I've had around town (e.g., at Lesvos and the Greek Fest), but alas, it wasn't--I should have taken the hint when I saw only one spit of red gyro meat (I don't eat beef or lamb).  My major complaint with the gyro was its sogginess, which caused the pita to become unpleasantly wet, and the tzatziki sauce to become unbearably runny (it dripped out the entire time I was eating the gyro).  The fries were fresh cut and plentiful, but they were underseasoned, to the point that I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to them.  After trying a bite from a friend, I also decided to get a slice of the chocolate cheesecake with strawberry sauce ($2.50).  While this was the best part of the meal, even it wasn't super impressive--it wasn't as chocolatey as I would have liked, even with the chocolate crust.  The strawberry sauce was good, but it overwhelmed the flavor of the cheesecake itself, which there wasn't a whole lot of.Although I will likely come back here to hang out with my friends, I probably wouldn't return otherwise, since this place isn't super convenient to where I live, and my experience wasn't didn't motivate me to return otherwise.  As others have stated, you can't get much cheaper, but here, I feel that reflects negatively in the quality of the food.  If/when I return, I will try other things, such as the pizza, etc., and will update my review accordingly.Since I've been here several more times and tried several more items since my original review, I feel that an update is called for.  I may have been a bit too harsh in my original review, so I'll try to be more balanced and articulate this time.There are several things that I like about BFG.  I like that it's an unpretentious community eatery that serves the neighborhood in which it's located, a fact that's reflected in the type of food that they serve, the price point, and the employees (yeah, that's right, I refuse to use the term "help") that they hire.  This contrasts with some other eateries along Penn Ave. in the vicinity, which draw a more yuppie East End crowd.  (Disclaimer: I'm an East End yuppie!)  BFG's commitment to the community is even reflected in the wall art, which is from local artists, as I mentioned before.  The owner and staff are very friendly, and are gracious hosts to a group that I attend that meets here on Mon. evenings.On the other hand, I find the food to be rather hit-or-miss.  Some of it, such as the grape leaves and pita with tzatziki, the fries, and the baklava, is pretty decent.  Other items, such as the pizza (which I find too greasy for my liking) and the chicken gyro I mentioned in my previous review, leave room for improvement.  Given the price point, though, I can't complain too much, and since I return regularly, I'll figure out what I enjoy and will stick to ordering that.As a side note, BFG was broken into the weekend before last, and is still struggling to deal with the repercussions of the break in (when I visited last night, the glass on the front door was still broken).  If you're in the neighborhood, consider stopping by to show some support!3.5 stars for providing good hospitality and A-OK food on a consistent basis.

Restaurant name  Bratalian Neapolitan Cantina
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
If you're a fan of Rao's at Caesars or the original in Harlem in NYC, then you know the Pellegrino family and their cooking.  Recently, Carla, the executive chef of Rao's and her husband, Frank, Jr., divorced...she got 10 family recipes in the settlement and has installed her sister who has been by her side at the stoves for the past 10 years along with brother in law, Walter, to run the front of house.Why the name?  Bratalian combines her Brazilian roots (she was born in Rio), with her Italian heritage...but make no mistake, there is nothing Brazilian on the menu.Carla will be opening a new restaurant at the newly renovated Tropicana shortly, she reported - and given its Miami Beach theme by the pool, I'm guessing that's where the Rio flare may begin to show.Most important to know is that while they're newly opened, their liquor license isn't in place until mid April - so it's BYOB, and diners can benefit from no corkage fee for their first month.  One visit isn't enough for a review - but since it wasn't listed yet,  I wanted to get the word out.  The location is where the former Chef's Palate used to be - a nice sized 100+ seat spot on southern Eastern, near Horizon Ridge, as you head to Anthem and Seven Hills.  With the pleasant weather, you can dine on their small but rare patio.They're open for lunch and dinner.  Dishes are classic neopolitan fare - antipasti, primi, secondi and desserts.  We wish them great luck and are thrilled she chose to not only stay in town but to bring her culinary talents to our local neighborhood... p.s. Pasta is not made from scratch but dried.  Marinara sat in the bain marie a little too long which made sauce too salty, but this was just first try...there are lots of dishes to try.We went last night and when we got there found out they didn't have their liquor license yet so we went and bought wine and brought it in, which is fine, actually probobly saved money since we didn't have to buy there.  Then we waited.  Overall service was slow, Walter the general manager was rude, they were in the weeds and needed help even a bus boy would have helped a ton, and the food was just okay.To elaborate if you want to know more.  We probobly sat for 45 mins before being able to order appatizers, which was fine at first because I thought they were just giving us time to mingle but as the night went on realized they couldn't keep up.  Walter was our server (general manager).  I tried three different times to strike a conversation or get any type of personality or opinion out of him and he always responded with short monotoned answers like we were more of a pest then anything.   At that point I thought for how rude they are the food must be outstanding.  The decor I couldn't figure out, there are pictures of Carla everywhere but clothes hung up like on a clothes line (not classy), and siding on the back walls, so I thought we were maybe suppose to be in the backyard type atmopshere but the window had a curtain on it.  I know the decor shouldn't matter all that much but by that time I was irritiable and for the prices you are paying didn't feel like the decor matched.Then we finally ordered our meals and my friend asked to have some sausage with his and the general manager said and I quote, "Nope the chef will kill me."  So we just ordered them on the side and mixed them in but whatever I didn' think it was a tough request.I ordered a pasta with shrimp, which I was really looking forward to and it was just okay.  Way too much butter, just swimiming to the point that that was all you could taste.  My husband asked about the penne vodka which is suppose to be one of her signatures I believe or if the spaghetti and meatballs were better and Walter said Spaghetti which I thought was odd.We sat forever to get our check, and had mine and my husbands food boxed up.  When Walter brought the food back he put it on the floor, which I thought was weird as well.  I have never put anyone's leftovers on the floor in a like cvs bag.  We never actually got the check we had to flag him down to get him to take our credit card.  He asked about dessert but by that time we had been there 3 hours and 15 min and just wanted to leave.  What was even more annoying was there were people waiting to get a table and the restaurant was small so all they would have had to do was be much mroe attentive and we probobly would have only been there 1.5 to 2 hours tops.  Overall I would never go back, and beween us and the table next to us who we overheard don't think this place will last at all.  I give it a couple months unless they turn their service around.Went there yesterday, have been waiting to try the place since it opened, and finally got my lazy ass to Henderson to give Chef P's menu a go.We got there at around 5:30pm and the place was pretty empty, we were seated promptly without reservations and offered a few menu options. We selected the Prefix menu. It was $33 for your choice of app, entree, dessert, and a glass of wine. I was planning on ordering an entree and dessert so the prefix menu made sense.We started with the caprese salad as an addition to the prefix menu, the Mozz was amazing, and the tomatoes were ripe and delicious, it may have been a little high on the price point, but it was a great starter.We also had a few baskets of bread...the bread was good, and they had 2 different types in the basket, one was Italian and one tasted like a sourdough, but both were good, and were served with olive oil and balsamic.I had the Meatballs to start...they were large and 2 were included in the order. I was expecting small little app sized, but no these were pretty big meatballs. They were a pork, veal, and beef combo, they were served in a red sauce that was good for bread dipping. The meatballs were cooked perfectly, they were a little on the greasy side,  but they were great.For my Entree I chose the Penne Alla Vodka, a large portion of al dente Penne tossed in an amazing Vodka Sauce with a little ham thrown in for good measure. When I ordered the Prefix I was expecting smaller portions but they didn't cut back at all.My dessert course was the Ricotta Cheese Cake, a big slice of cheese cake that was around 5" thick. The crust was amazing, and the ricotta cheese cake filling was fluffy and delicious. I was tempted to eat half of it and use the rest as a pillow for my food induced coma.The companion had a chicken dish who's name escapes me but it was really good, and the Tiramisu which was also amazing.The wait staff was a little slow, and there was a length of time between the apps being served and the entrees getting out of the kitchen, and the place was a little warm, but I can't really complain too much about them. My biggest complaint is that I waited this long to try Bratalian!*** Review is for Spring 2014 Restaurant Week Menu ***I enjoyed my dinner at Bacio when Chef Pellegrino was there and I've wanted to try Bratalian since she opneed the place.  I'm glad I did.Since I was alone, I opted to sit at the bar.  Besides not taking up a table meant for two or more, I often have a good time watching the bartenders do their thing.  In this case, I had a direct view into the small kitchen of this restaurant and I could see Chef Pellegrino's sister, Chef Alessandra Madeira, cooking with her staff.  The kitchen seemed to run well and there were some laughs coming from there.  They were also putting out a good number of meals.  There were several take out orders called in while I was there.The three course Restaurant Week menu has a lot of choices.  For the starter, I chose the Polpette Tradizionale--two 6 ounce meatballs made with beef, pork, and veal in a fresh tomato and basil sauce.  What a large starter.  That could have been the meal.  The sauce was very good and the meatballs were soft in texture and had an excellent flavor.For the main course, I chose the Salsicce and Pepperoni--Italian sausage, both hot and sweet, sautéed over red and yellow peppers and onions.  Another winning dish.  The onions and peppers were sautéed just enough to start to soften them but not enough to take some of the crispness away and turn them to mush.  The pieces of sausage were cooked nicely and were very tasty.  It was different to have the sausage served in bite sized pieces and I liked the main course a whole lot.  I did let some of the peppers go.  Can't fill up on fiber!For dessert, I had ordered then Torta di ricotta--classic Italian ricotta cheesecake.  After having had ricotta cheesecake at several Italian restaurants recently, I am convinced that it's the only way cheesecake should be made--with ricotta and not cream cheese.  The texture of the ricotta cheesecake was excellent and the cheesecake was a perfect way to end the meal.Service throughout was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without having to ask.  One of the bus people removed any finished plates.  The staff worked as a team and they worked well together.A few notes:  If you arrive in the early evening, don't think they're not open.  There are wraps on the windows to shade the sun which the restaurant faces much of the day.  The restaurant itself is a small space, cozy, with interesting decorations including the clothes hanging from the line over the doorway area.  This was a grand way to start Spring Restaurant Week.  I hope my other choices turn out this well!  A hearty thanks to Chef Madeira and the staff at Bratalian for a very pleasant dinner.

Review Text :
Finally tried Viva Salsa last night and boy am I glad I did. It was hella good and cheap, too!For $5.95 plus tax I got 3 giant steak tacos (which I ate the guts only), chips and salsa and a drink. The bonus is the salsa bar. They have three different mouthwatering salsas to enjoy and also beans! From experience do not even attempt to put the HOT as hell beans in the tiny salsa cups provided. If you are like me you will burn yourself. Be smarter than the beans (and ding dong over here) and put them straight onto your plate. Overall I have to say this is a smokin' deal of a meal in a clean, little nook of the casino. Friendly and fast service, too. I will absolutely be back for more.

Can a good main course erase the low quality appetizer and drink before it?  That's the hard question I deal with right now (isn't life oh so tough?!).  My caipirinha was good but let's just say it was on the ice-y side....like WAY too much ice and not enough of the good stuff....the booze!  We started with the Crispy chicken marinated in dark rum and lime app.  Sound delicious, right?  It honestly tasted like chicken tenders from the freezer section of Giant Eagle...minus the taste.  Absolutely. No. Taste!  There was even a side sauce that I thought might spice it up.  No luck...how do you make a sauce tasteless??  I don't know...but they somehow did it!  The only redeeming factor is that the other app we ordered, the marinated shrimp with chilis and sweet potato, was fantastic.  Incredibly tasty and well marinated with lime.  I ordered the grilled skirt steak topped with chimichurri and black beans and rice.  It was very good!  The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare with a nice grilled flavor.  The black beans and rice were nothing to report home, but the small (very small) side salad of cucumber and tomatoes was also very good.  We had one more winning entree (braised chicken in ají and cilantro sauce) between my four dining companions (the losers: Beef brisket and a sandwich) .  So we're split 50/50 again!Would I give the place another try?  Absolutely, but I'll be sure to pick wisely again....even then....I'll hope for the best!  And give me more booze!  Then maybe I'll like things more!

Restaurant name  Twist by Pierre Gagnaire
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I asked Chef Gagnaire if it was a serious challenge to find inspiration in Las Vegas...after all, most of the products, chefs, and clients are from some other far flung destination.  And for a chef who seems to be defined by inspiration, improvisation and art (he's got a serious love for both jazz and modern art...and his recipes read more like Point than Keller), his answer surprised me.'No, zat is not really a probblemm for us, what I find challenging is to find zee line with the clients here in Las Vegas. What and how do zhay want to eeet?'This took me by surprise, as he's someone who's been cooking "famously" for over 40 years. He's already been through all of the ups and downs, fallen in and out of love with the Bibendum...and has garnered a reputation as an artist who doesn't suffer fools.  He's a chef that really doesn't have to answer to anyone. However, that he focuses so seriously on what the diner wants is a true peek into his character.To that end, he's promised that the menu is something that they will be evolving over the weeks and months to come.  In its first form, he offers both a tasting menu as well as a choose-what-you-like a la carte menu for the restaurant...which is also the sole US outpost of Gagnaire's cuisine.Highlights of the tasting menu included a lovely opening salvo of six canapés.  The textures and presentations spanned the spectrum, from Guiness and Jack Daniels gelles, to sardine potato chips.  After these bites, the first course of seared scallops went on to prove two things: 1) seared scallops are far from passé in the right hands, 2) those same hands have a thing for blending together complex and sometimes risky flavors into a delicious whole.  Langoustine Five Ways is an example of Chef Gagnaire's constant evolution.  The presentation maintains a backbone of preparations not unlike Japanese Kaiseki (Seared, Grilled, Mousseline, Gelee, Tartar), but the components of each preparation change considerably.  More, his presentation succeeds where so many "duos" and "trios" fail, as the lesser dishes strive for complexity for complexity's sake.  Here however, the form has function, as the chef manages to tease out what seems like every flavor and texture available in a Langoustine.  There's the delicate flavor of the grilled preparation and the powerful "head" flavor from the gelee.   Even the progression itself is well thought out and while the individual dishes may pull you in five different directions, you end up arriving exactly where the chef wants you. Granted, there were some aspects to the meal that needed refinement (wine list and inventory need to be synced up, a sauce ice cream that couldn't make it to the table without melting), but if everything was already "perfect" then isn't it all too easy?Unlike most "famous" chefs in Las Vegas (JR, TK and a very few others excluded) Twist is more than a brand extension, but a chance to see a man for his art.  Like it or not, he's not taking the task lightly...more than just "consulting," Chef Gagnaire has brought his A-team with him to Las Vegas.  Pascal, the CdC, has been with Gagnaire for 8 years, the Pastry chef, for 6 years, and Chef Gagnaire has even brought on Chef Michel, who has been cooking with Gagnaire for 26 years and is Un des Meilleurs Ouvriers de France...(translation: he's a super super official gangsta).  And while this team is not likely to last more than a month or two in its current form,  I'm sure it will have a lasting impact on the restaurant itself.  So, if you can get out to Las Vegas and the Mandarin Oriental, why not come and see just how carefully Chef Gagnaire walks the line?In a word, Twist.  The mere idea of the word is enough to send your token foodie's stomach into a conniption fit of pure desire.  The mere whisper of the word is enough to trigger endless blogging and tweeting due to sheer sweaty-handed anticipation.  The mere realization of the word is enough a road trip all the way to Lost Wages to see what all the fuss is about.  And so it was done.  Off to the south Las Vegas strip we would go in search of langostine (among other things), prepared in the manner of a man who pretty much put langostine on the map.  Being the gastronomic simpleton that I am, I decided I couldn't pass up a grand opening invite to the first ever dinner service at Twist by Pierre Gagnaire (December 5, 2009).  But in lieu of a ginormous appetite, what I really should've packed was my brain.  Food this complex, this multi-layered, and this (pardon my crude undertone) "weird", simply can't just be engulfed.  It requires several hours of thinking, ruminating, pondering or whatever-the-hell-it-takes to justify paying $400 a head for arguably one of the fanciest and most thought-out meal you'd ever dream of having this west of the Mississippi.  It's been days since engulfing this meal and I STILL can't wrap my head around it (and my stomach definitely had its work cut out for it too).Surprisingly, it took nearly 5 hours to complete this marathon of a 6-course tasting menu plus 6 courses of added appetizer supplements (note: every single thing I ate is pictorially posted here).  And don't you dare go on thinking that I'm slow and that 12 courses aren't all that much, because under Pierre Gagniere's roof, that really means like 36 presentations.  Do the math.  Throughout this marathon dinner complete with cocktails and fine wine, Voss water and a few $8 diet cokes sprinkled in "here and there", I began to realize the perplexity as this:  Pierre Gagnaire is, quite truthfully, an enigma of a man.  Forget that he's Michelin starred-this, iconoclastic-that.  Forget that he practically invented all that we have come to realize is "fusion" cuisine.  And just forget that his so-called eponymous "other" location on Rue. St. Balzac near the Champps Elysees is thought of as being the "3rd best restaurant" in the world by Restaurant Magazine (El Bulli in Spain is the 1st).Pierre Gagnaire creates an inspiring vision for this type of weird food, which is, not surprisingly, just weirdly delicious.  He's even a lovable weird guy himself, so appropriately charming and entertaining us like a "crazy uncle" might do during his brief cameo at our table.And as we were appropriately informed by our server David, the whole idea is to "taste and experience" all the ingredients which God put on this earth, which might occasionally occur in 1 singular dish.  This is most evident in the first of 3 presentations of Gagnaire's "Shellfish Royale" - somewhat of an oyster extravaganza with a backdrop of toasted beef gelée and shallots, as well as his last presentation of "King Sea Bream", a curiously concoction of a "bonito-shellfish gelée" with mozzarella ice cream.  I loved the fact seared scallops aren't even safe from Gagnaire's innovative antics as "black olive gelee" provides a certain Mediterranean setting, but then squab breast and foie gras come in to steal the show.  The end result of these seemingly contradictory flavor combinations and layers is this:  each bite resembles something that you have never ever tasted, with few ways to describe them, save for these vague examples --  My first time eating Pierre Gagnaire cuisine allowed me to taste 5 different representations of the langostine, including the unmistakable "head", allowed me to taste (and like) seafood mixed with cheese mixed with meat, and allowed me to eat something that tasted like the splendor that exists in a tidepool.  Overall, do I have any idea what this means?  Not on your life.  The only thing I can muster up is that a dinner under Pierre Gagnaire's roof is absolutely positively unlike any other eating experience you will ever have.  Ever.  Go there, and you will see.  The originality of it ensures that you cannot and will not be disappointed.I just realized I am about to turn the odometer over to 200 reviews!  I feel that Twist is an appropriate selection for this milestone because it was one of the most unique, memorable and enjoyable dining experiences of my life.I arrived early to enjoy a drink at the bar and ease into my evening.  The moment I walked in I knew this was a special place.  The staff greeted me warmly, as if I was a regular customer and offered me a seat immediately.  I decided to stick to the plan and sit at the bar for a drink first.  As I chatted with the very friendly bartender, I sipped a glass of Louis Roederer Brut and soaked in the beauty of this modern, intimate space.I was soon escorted to my windowside table.  There is something quite humorous about sitting in such an elegant, sophisticated place and looking out over the sea of neon and confusion that is Vegas.  I barely needed to look at the menu because I knew I wanted to try the tasting menu,  also called Pierre Gagnaire's Spirit. Being a completely politically incorrect glutton I added the Foie Gras Degustation.  More on that later.At most restaurants, bread is an afterthought.  Not true at Twist.  A server brought out three excellent selections.   A Wheat, Raisin and Walnut, a Country Rye, and a French Ciabatta.  They came with two butters. An unsalted butter from Normandy and one blended with seaweed.  This bread service is second only to the amazing Bread Cart at Restaurant Savoy.My actual meal started with an "amuse" that consisted of six little bites.  My two favorites were the Salad of Cuttlefish, Haricot Vert, Red Bell Pepper and Celeriac and the Tuna Chantilly with Homemade Rice Crackers.1st CourseSHELLFISH & RED BEETRed Beet Carpaccio, Campari, Shellfish Salad "Baltard Market" Soja glazed smoked Eel.From my first bite I knew I was in for an interesting, confusing, thought provoking evening. The following statement can be applied to all of the courses I had at Twist: I've never experienced this flavor combination before. 2nd CourseSEA AND EARTHSanta-Barbara Prawns, Spicy Grapefruit Syrup, Ginger-Potato Salad, Poached Duck Foie Gras, Iberico Ham, Scallop Mousseline, Baby Greens, Eggplant Tuille, Black & Blue Carrot Gelée, Squid Ink Gnocchetti, Seaweed. This course, as with most, was actually several small bites presented at once. Each one was fantastic in its own right and also worked together with the others.  3rd CourseBLACK CODGrilled Fillet, Poached in Citrus Butter, Molasses-White Balsamic Glaze, Mache, Manchégo Cheese, Asparagus Ice Cream, Green Apple, Paris Mushroom.One of my favorite courses of the evening. I placed the "ice cream" over the Cod and it turned into a sauce as it melted.  My waiter said he was glad to see me playing with my food.4th CourseSONOMA VALLEY FOIE GRAS DÉGUSTATIONTerrine, Dried Figs, Toasted Ginger BreadCustard, Green Lentils, Grilled ZucchiniSeared, Sweet and Sour Duck Glaze, Fruit MarmaladeCroquette, Trevicchio Coulis, Red OnionsThis is the singlemost decadent, over the top course I have ever experienced. Each of the small dishes were wonderful.  I found my self rotating between each one, enjoying the different textures and tastes.  My favorites were the Custard and the Seared.5th CourseHIBISCUSHibiscus Gelée, Mascarpone Cream, Malabar Pepper Braised Turnip, Rosé Champagne-Lime Granité.After the rich Foie course I was happy to see this light palate cleansing course.  Which, like everything else, was unique and different. 6th CourseGRILLED PRIME SIRLOINStewed Celery-Rhubarb, Pinot Noir Jus, Preserved Shallot. Broccoli Salad, Egg "Mimosa", Red Cabbage Gelée, Bolognaise, Grilled Zucchini, Beef Carpaccio, Black Olive Tapenade.A perfect piece of beef surrounded by unique and different sides. Have I said that before?DessertQuince Gelée, Bavaroise, Chartreuse ParfaitNelson Sablé, Meringue, Citrus SorbetCachaça Granité, Cucumber Marmelade, Green AppleFruit Biscuit, Seasonal CoulisGanache, Ginger, Chocolate Ice CreamI expected the meal to come to an amazing end and I was not disappointed.  My favorites were the Fruit Biscuit and the Granite. I finished my evening with a gift from the Chef, a plate of Meringues and Cookies.My experience at Twist was one I will never forget.  I still find myself thinking about it months later.  Twist is a must try for any adventurous food lover.  Hopefully, it won't be a once in a lifetime thing.Beyond what I expected from Michelin rated Pierre Gagnaire.When I first saw the menu, I thought the chef was arrogant; preparing a single primary protein multiple ways for a single dish.  Thankfully he is!Every appetizer focuses on a single primary ingredient prepared with a different cooking technique and accented by supporting ingredients that truly showcase how good it can be.  The contrast in textures this creates is incredible.  Because the same protein is used there is a beautiful continuity in the entire dish.All dishes are well edited.  You can clearly taste each ingredient.  There is an incredible respect for ingredients.If its your first time dining at Twist, I would recommend having multiple appetizers and skipping the mains.  You will get to try the most flavors.For appetizers, the veal sweetbreads, langoustines, and foie gras are to die for.  Favored mains include the john dory and the Confucius duck.The price matches the quality and is well in line with Vegas standards.The space is contemporary and fits with the understated luxury of the Mandarin Oriental with the added flare one expects in Vegas.Three visits and I can wait to go back!We went there for our anniversary last week.My husband ordered the complete tasting menu with wine pairing and I ordered the 3 course tasting menu.The service was horrible. Starving, they made me wait 1 hour for my first appetizer and 1 hour and 1/2 for the second which they made a mistake by serving me my husband's order (it was a mini portion of a cooked fish with the top being cooked but the inside totally RAW- I MEAN IF WE WANTED SASHIMI WE WOULD GO TO A SUSHI RESTAURANT- WHY WOULD WE PAY 400$ FOR TASTING MENU WHEN THEY CAN'T EVEN COOK A PIECE OF FISH????). So in 2 hours and 1/2 I pretty much had 1 appetizer and 1 cocktail. On top of the awful food, for my husband's second dish, the waiter served him his wine 30 minutes before they served him his dish so by the time he got anything to eat the wine was already finished and we were told no refills.  For his third dish, he got the food 30 minutes before they served him his wine so by the time my husband received his wine for his wine pairing he was already done eating.It was truly a horrible experience.I was really starving. We were seated at 6:30pm and furiously left the restaurant by 9pm. in 2 hours 1/2, I've had 1 appetizer and my husband had 3 courses of his 6 course tasting menu with 1 of the 3 being raw.What else can I say about this restaurant?????????We did not expect to get this low standard of service and food for this type of restaurant. It was really disapointing.This was one of the best dining experiences I've had.  I've been going to try Twist for awhile and I went there last night for a special meal.  I got the 6 course chef's tasting menu.  I made a reservation for 6 PM, the time they open. I was going to Blue Man Group later and I wanted to have plenty of time for a relaxed dinner and time to get to the show.David took my order after answering some questions I had about the menu--a menu I had poured over online.  He was a great help.There were five canapés delivered shortly after.  They're small and they were quite interesting in flavor and execution.  They were in/on three items.  My favorite was the salad of watermelon and dragon fruit, passion fruit, and basil.  A close second was the paprika-tomato meringue with smoked salmon and black olive agar.  The almond and ginger sable was none too shabby either.  All 5 were excellent!The first course was glazed Skate with red miso water, spring vegetables and Paris mushroom duxelle.The second course consisted of the 3 small bites--a grilled prawn on spinach velouté with garlic and parmesan.  The second bite was a piece of lobster with poached turnip, toasted sesame, and bisque.  The third portion was a cold, soft-boiled egg with Ossetra caviar in the yolk on a bed of marinated clams, red ahi tuna, and cuttlefish.Course three was Mediterranean John Dory with pink pepper, fine foie gras tart and baby artichokes.The fourth course was a palate cleanser.  It was a champagne sorbet which had some salted cucumber and a Campari soaked Red Beet.  I was blown away by the cucumber and sorbet combination.  Fantastic!Course five was Sonoma Valley Duck Breast with Alexia Potato, berries on a piquillo pepper reduction, and Bigarrde sauce.  The duck was excellent and the tart fruit with the pepper reduction--another superb flavor pairing!The last course was dessert which consisted of 5 different small desserts.  They were a coffee panna cotta with Bailey's, Kahlua, Coffee Gelée and lime sorbet.  Almond-Frangipane cake with lemon-Krisch syrup.  A third was strawberry soup with raspberry and basil, and a "Bella Vista" granité.  Then a fresh coconut tartlet with iced coconut, cilantro, and celery curls.  The last was a chocolate ganache.  As with the entire meal, the flavors developed in the desserts was wonderful!  Coconut, cilantro and celery--who would have thought?Service was excellent all evening, even when things became quite busy.  When my iced tea got low, a server brought me a new glass and switched the two.  I didn't have to ask, it was just done.  A funny example, when things weren't so busy, I sneezed.  Within a few moments, a server was at the table with a box of Kleenex.  Service with a smile and funny!  The same server also brought me a small Mandarin Oriental bag with a copy of all the menu items.  He had heard me mention to one of the servers that I'd never remember all the things.  The server wanted to make sure I had something to remind me.  Classy!The restaurant is very classy and the view is excellent.  I was there during daylight and dined long enough to enjoy seeing the lights come on along the Boulevard!  I wore a jacket and tie--their website requests that men wear jackets.  Most came dressed with business casual.Truly a wonderful dinner, about 2 1/2 hours.  It's worth the cost for the chance to try some unique foods in a unique setting with superb service!I came to Twist for my birthday dinner and It was such a great food tasting adventure. We ordered 6 course tasting menu, Pacific Lingcod, and couple appetizers (Oysters & Langoustine and Hudson Valley Foie Gras). I am not going to talk about details of each dish. I am just gonna share highlights of my dinner. Both appetizers we ordered were superb. My foie gras appetizer came in 2 different forms/ways with apple ice cream. Savory way: Poached foie Gras with Morteau SausageI usually like my foie gras to go with something sweet. But I enjoyed this dish very much. It was such wonderful combination!Sweet way: Glenmorangie Glazed Duck foie Gras Terrine with ginger bread powders and hazelnutsOlala... Yum Yum Yum! There is no other word to describe this dish! The second I put it in my mouth, it melted. Then all the flavors and aromas of foie gras and hazelnut just went together. Two thumbs up!Apple ice cream was very refreshing after eating so much fatty foie gras.Oysters & Langoustine:Kumamoto Oysters were such a beauty. They were big, juicy and sweet. Nom!Fanny Bay Oyster nage, Clams and leek was more like a soup to me. It was a very elegant dish. Honestly, I enjoyed the appetizers I ordered more than the tasting menu dishes. I also felt 6 course menu was a bit too much for me. On my next visit, I would probably order appetizers only and skip entrees. I can't wait to come back soon and carry on this tasting adventure!!Twist continues to impress.  Contemporary dining space with illuminated glass globes suspended throughout, outstanding view of the Strip, warm and efficient service, and incredible food.  What more can you ask for?Straight to the food.  The Hudson Valley foie. Presented two ways.  Poached (sous-vide) served with a horseradish emulsion, tart sauerkraut and smoky Morteau sausage.  A great savory balance between earthy, tart, smoky flavors all cutting the richness of the foie.  Second, "nuggets" of a foie terrine "glazed" with Glenmorangie dusted with sweet and spicy gingerbread power and hazelnuts.  The smoky undertones of the single malt accentuates the mineral, livery taste of the foie.  Delish.  Apple ice cream on the side; perfect.The Dover sole & prawns is hard to top.  The orange scented fish ("glazed" with orange cider) is brought to life by an earthy morel cream and vegetal flavors of turnips, coriander, and spinach.  The addition of prawns adds sweetness and a nice oceanic flavor.  Complex yet refreshing dish.The list of great dishes goes on and on.  The degustation menus are the best way to sample Twist.  Portions are scaled down so no risk of over eating (unless you have the six course grand desert).  Beautiful and delicious; just remember, you've been warned.  Note for beef lovers:  Twist offers the best priced Japanese A5 Wagyu steak in Vegas.  Offered as a New York steak;  10 ounces, $198.   Of course, eating this would be BORING.Multiple revisits, always a twist!Items experienced:Ginger Sable with almonds and sea salt, Lavosh Bread with Tuna foam with Bonito Flakes, Tartlette of Goat Cheese with Cherry Meringue, Guinness GeleeMetamorphosis - Aromatized Gin, Honey Syrup, Lemon JuiceSalted and Unsalted Isigny Butter / Cheddar Bacon, Cherry Walnut, French Baguette, Fennel and HerbRolly Gassman Pinot GrisRavioli of Foie Gras, Seared Langoustine with Dried Orange Zezette Bouillon and Paris Mushroom SaladKallstadtler Annsberg Spatlese 2008 ChardonnayHudson Valley Foie Gras - Seared Duck Foie Gras, Red Cabbage Reduction, Red Beet Wedges / Duck Foie Gras Terrine with Marbled Dried Fig, Date Paste, Carrot Fondant, Pimento Puree / Shaved fresh Foie Gras, Tandori Apple Syrup, Spinach, Green Apple SaladMarotti Campi Orgiolo Lacrima di Morro d'Alba Superiore 2010Muscovy Duck Aiguillettes with Green Pepper, Casis Bigarade Sauce, Braised Daikon Turnips, Marguerite Potato, HuckleberriesCreamy Morels10 year Stilton Cheddar, Brillat Savarin, Humboldt Fog, Fourme d'Ambert, Triple Cream Goat, Milk Gelee, Julien Vegetables, Toast, Winter Fruit Marmalade, Port Fig ChutneySamos Nectar Vintage 2002Beet Raspberry Macaron / Pineapple Saffron Meringue / Choco Taco with Sesame, Green Tea, Chocolate Pearls White Truffle Souffle - Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Caramelzed Pears, White Truffle Simple SyrupGrand Dessert Pierre Gagnaire - Arugula Financier with White Truffle, Pistachio Chantilly, Green Apple Tuile, Sorbet / Crumbly Shortbread, Black Currant Syrup, Caramelized Pear and Passion Fruit Marmalade with Honey / Multicolored Meringue, Golden Raisin, Polignac Almond, Ganache with Old Rum / Lemon Jelly with Limoncello, Chocolate Ice Cream, Mango Veloute and Wedges, Raspberry Sorbet and Coconut Milk with LimeHaving long held Pierre Gagnaire as my favorite chef I'd be lying if I did not admit that the existence of Twist at The Mandarin Oriental played some small part in my Vegas relocation decision and knowing that M. Gagnaire frequents each of his properties it was only a matter of time before I returned; the resulting four and a half hours amongst my ten best meals of 2013 and capped off by two dishes that warrant 'all time' best consideration.  Joined by friends somewhat outside my typical 'dining circle' for a truly memorable experience it was with great poise and frequent smiles that the professional staff worked and with expectedly flawless service the food and wine that followed simply 'fit' the room, the mood, and even the conversation - sometimes serious, often whimsical, at times challenging, but always excellent.  Steeped in the stream of consciousness characteristic to Gagnaire but reigned in and refined to razor sharp precision under the eye of Ryuki Kawasaki it was with expected flare that each course was delivered as a collection of plates and with bold, familiar flavors frequently reinvented by subtle nuance the meal unfolded as a slow moving dialogue without the traditional light-to-heavy structure, instead designing each plate as a segue both forward and back with growing complexity defining progress to the final savory before finally breaking pace for a special request I'll likely never forget - a tall, proud soufflé for the ages first imbued and then crowned with the last of the season's white truffles.Situated 23 floors above the Strip in the MO Hotel, the restaurant offers great views of our cities most famous landmark, and an even better view of it at night. We were seated away from the window in a more casual setting, the three of us enjoyed the atmosphere, we were able to take a couple sneak peaks of the kitchen. Definitely recommend if you are here on a date, I'd reserve a table by the window.It was a tough decision to make, it was my first time there so I was on the fence about choosing the tasting menu or a la carte. I let our server choose, and he recommended the four course tasting menu, and I chose to do the wine pairing as well. Bread basket included a cheddar bacon, cherry walnut, french baguette and a fennel herb roll along with salted and unsalted imported butter. *Rolly Gassman Pinot Gris*Ravioli of Foie Gras, seared langoustine with dried orange zezette bouillon, Paris mushroom salad*Kallstadler Annsberg Spatlese Chardonnay*Turbot, poached fillet in vadouvan butter, grapefruit fondue with tandoori leek, celery & snow peas julienne*Marotti Campi Orgiolo*Wagyu Beef, peppercorn steak, red cabbage marmalade, white beans, lentil & shiitake*Samos Necar Vintage *Grand Dessert- Arugula financier, pistachio chantilly, green apple tuile & sorbet, crumbly shortbread, black current syrup, apple & passion fruit marmalade, multicolored meringue, polignac almond, ganache with old rum, lemon jelly with limoncello, chocolate ice cream, mango veloute & wedges, raspberry sorbet & coconut milk with lime.I enjoyed my meal, but I felt dessert was bit of a let down. I wasn't completely impressed with the tasting menu dessert. Although, the white truffle soufle that was ordered off the menu was amazing. To top off the night, Chef Gagnaire was in house and made his way around the restaurant to each table and introduced himself which was a nice addition to our meal.I still stand firm that Pierre owes me a make out session for what I paid for dinner and wine pairing.***Twist delivers contemporary French cuisine; it is good for Vegas but still a notch below top SF and Chicago spots***Twist is yet another Vegas fine dining restaurant from an internationally acclaimed chef like Robuchon and Savoy.  Twist is newer though.  It is located on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin hotel.  Being newer, I was hoping for more contemporary cuisine than what I've had at Vegas' other fine dining French restaurants and Twist delivered.Twist features a lot of good (and modern) food while still showcasing French ingredients and cooking techniques.  Twist offers several dining options.  You can go for a more value-centric 3-course dinner.  You can also order a la carte where you choose from elaborate plates that feature proteins in multiple interpretations (the multiple presentations of foie gras sounded interesting) as well as big Prime steaks.  Finally, you can opt for one of their tasting menus--a vegetarian option or their seasonal tasting menu (available in 4 or 6 courses).I opted for the tasting menu and it started off very well.  First came a series of tasty amuses.  There were lavash breadsticks with albacore cream and bonito flakes (pate-like in richness), an almond sable, very good goat cheese sandwiched between two light and crispy crackers, and a really good Guinness and Jack Daniels gelee rolled in gingerbread (great burn but also sweet--reminiscent of the cocktail gels at LA's Providence).The bread was also good (several warm options including a warm bacon and smoked cheddar roll, a crusty French baguette, a too dense brioche roll, herb and feta, and cherry pecan bread).My first course was sea bass and haddock carpaccio with citrus and horseradish ice cream.  The fish was good--moist and soft--and went well with the citrus and herbs to give it freshness.  The horseradish ice cream was very creamy and had a noticeable horseradish flavor without being overpowering.My second course was easily my favorite of the night.  It was foie gras ravioli next to seared langoustine in a herb and coconut milk broth (topped with crispy mushrooms).  The foie gras ravioli had a thick pasta skin as well as creamy, buttery and savory seared foie gras at the center.  The langoustine was very nicely cooked--fresh, lightly sweet, plump, and soft.  The broth was very aromatic.  This reminded me of the buttery foie gras ravioli at Providence and the perfectly cooked langoustine at L'atelier de Joel Robuchon (two very good restaurants).Next up was a fish course and it was disappointing.  It was turbot and the fish was a little tough and not easy to flake--definitely far from Baume's soft and flaky turbot.  Worse than the slightly tough fish was the grapefruit (very acidic and bitter).  This felt like something that maybe should have came earlier because the acidity was too much for an entree.A good intermezzo of apple and yuzu sorbet with Dungeness crab came next.  Chicken followed and it was served on warm greens with pistachio.  I do not often see chicken on fine dining menus, but I was glad to see it because chicken can be really good if a crispy skin is achieved and the meat is juicy.  The meat was fairly juicy here, but there was no crispy skin.  The greens were okay, but this course felt overseasoned.Wagyu beef was the final savory course.  It was served over warm sweet and sour red cabbage slaw.  The Wagyu had a fair amount of richness.  Unfortunately, it was overcooked.  It was also more like tri-tip than a true steak so it was slightly tough and chewy.Dessert consisted of a series of mini desserts, which I felt overall were too fruit focused as well as too tart.  The first dessert was really good strawberries with cream and a nice strawberry sorbet.  The pistachio and cucumber parfait was refreshing and had great creaminess, but there were too many leafy greens, which resulted in a salad-like flavor and texture.  There was also a shortbread cookie with blackberries.  The chocolate part of the dessert had rich chocolate ice cream as well as light meringues and a fruit paste.Service was excellent--very polished and personable.  I thought my server Breanne was really good and the male server assisting her delivered food presentations with professionalism and knowledge but also an enthusiasm that really makes you want to dive into the food.Prices were very high, but that is the case with many Vegas restaurants.Twist provides a good view of The Strip; the dining room is nice, elegant and contemporary.I am not a fan of Vegas restaurants and there were a few things about Twist that reminded me why I feel this way (the high prices and how Vegas fine dining does not measure up to SF or Chicago).  The food here felt more exciting than Aureole, Guy Savoy and miX though and it is worth a shot if you are looking for high-end but also contemporary French cuisine in Vegas.CityCenter offers free self parking.I've been contemplating on how to rate my dining experience at Twist. On the one hand, man, did the food (and the view!) totally remind me why I love nice restaurants. On the other hand, the service was downright intolerable. I thought that given the quality of the service we received, it wouldn't be fair to give Twist a 4-star rating. Because when I think of Twist, I don't think, "Yay! I'm a fan".. it's more, "Food was good, BUT..."When my friends and I arrived for our 10 pm Saturday night reservation, we were told by an unapologetic hostess that the party seated at our table was still working on their entrees and may or may not be ordering dessert. She suggested that we go take a seat at the bar and they will come get us.After giving them 15 minutes to come get us, I decided to get the whole story. Apparently the party before us arrived late (about 30 minutes late for a Saturday night reservation) but they decided to seat them anyway. She didn't offer any apologies to compensate for the inconvenience. Plus, here's my other argument: what was the point of making reservations if they're just going to a) seat people whenever they show up and b) make people wait? We may as well have shown up sans reservation - I would've been less irritated.The manager, as if to compensate for the rude hostess, came to find us and said that they would be paying for the drinks we have at the bar and he will personally come find us when our table was ready. When we finally got seated, the service was nothing short of obsequious. We were also presented with extra amuse bouche courses.Although the food was delicious, I can't help but have that negative service taint my memory of this meal and this restaurant. A part of me feels bad because the manager and wait stuff really tried but I still can't get over the rude hostess. I'm not sure if I've had better food in Vegas but I've definitely had better service.Items Selected:Kumquat Meringue Tartlet with Goat Cheese and Short Bread Cookie / Smoked Sable with Chervil and Apple / Carrot Sesame Mousse / Parmesan and Sea Salt Biscuit/ Red Beet Gelee with Hazelnut Crumble / Souffle of Comte Cheese, Lavosh-Baguette, Brioche, Bacon Cheddar, Sauterne Pumpernickel, Cherry Walnut - Isigny Salted, Echire Unsalted-Chanterelle Soup - Coffee Morel Ravioli, Peppered Shrimp, Langoustines, English Peas-Spring - Chanterelle Soup with Parmesan, English Peas, Spring Onion, Swiss Chard / Stuffed Rabbit Saddle, Fresh Herb Jus, Black Olive / Baby Artichoke and Nougatine / Asparagus Custard with Chervil and Mozzarella Ice Cream / Tomato Tart with Basil and Spinach-Foie Gras Terrine - Charred Onion Gelee, Passion Fruit Pulp, Artichoke Cream, Spinach, Crispy Toast, Semillon Vinegar-Hudson Valley Foie Gras - Ringo Starr (Milk Chocolate, Gold, Chantilly of Foie, Terrine of Foie, Smoked Pepper Puree / Foie Gras Ice Cream with White Port, Charred onion Gelee, Passion Fruit Syrup, Baby Turnip, Watermelon Radish / Apple and Shallot Marmalade with Cinnamon, Sliced Duck, Cassis Tuille, Red Beet-Grilled Beef with Fresh Herb Butter - Eggplant Slice, English Mint Pea Puree, Chorizo, Tomme de Savoie/ Bone Marrow Croquette with Ramp and Potato Crisp / Bordelaise Sauce-Maine Lobster - Lobster Fricasse Turner, Chantilly Lace / Green Apple, Cucumber Gel, Lobster Rillette / Jasmine and Basmati Rice with Lobster Bisque-Seasonal Mushrooms-Pont Neuf Potatoes with Iberco de Bellota-Zwart Kaas (5 year aged Sheep's milk Gouda, Netherlands) / Gres de Champenois (Cow's milk Double Crème, Champagne) / Cana de Oveja (Soft-Ripened Sheep's milk log, Murcia) / Carboncino (Charcoal ash crusted Blend, Piedmont) / St. Agur Bleu (60 day Cow's milk Double Crème, Auvergne) / Gorgonzola Pear Ice Cream, Dark Chocolate Trail Mix, Kirsch Cherry Marmalade-Praline Éclair - Vanilla Pastry Cream, Coffee and Cognac, Pear and Caramelized Almond with Hazelnut / Black Sesame Ice Cream, Sliced Apricot, Hazelnut Crumble-Calvados and Caramel Parfait with Milk Chocolate Coated Apple and Kumquat Compote / Nashi Pear Wedge with Apricot and Peach Compote-Grand Dessert - Raspberry Sable with Basil, Mascarpone Coulis, Parfait Glace / Pistachio Biscuit Moelleux & Green Tea Ice Cream, Sweet Wine Cubes / Black Chocolate Ganache, Milk Caramel Ball, Bailey's and Coffee Granite / Cherry Soup, Prune Cream, Cassis Sorbet, Meringue Sticks / Peach and Apricot Compote with Rosemary, Pistachio Sugar Leaf, Orange Almond Cream-Lime Tart, Chocolate Vanilla Truffle, Apricot MarshmallowSuffice it to say that I'm a known entity at Twist and with my predilections to Chef Ryuki's interpretation of Pierre Gagnaire's cuisine well known a meal on Saturday night would prove just as thrilling as those prior, a showering of plates with mostly stellar service lasting over four hours in the butterfly adorned Spring dining room.  With Gagnaire himself present in the kitchen - as well as the dining room, bar, and even lobby - tending to details both small and large it was to an array of innovative canapés plus a quintet of breads with butters from Isigny and Echire that we began and moving next through six courses of meticulous sourcing and style rare would be a lull, a full emersion in the kitchen's stream of consciousness with a leisurely flowing pace. Opting for one tasting and courses a la carte to match 'Spring' began with flavors smacking of the season and although mushrooms both here and later were slightly over-seasoned everything else showed fresh and vibrant, a concept that carried right along to the course that followed - a flood of foie gras comprising seared, salad, torchon, terrine, and even ice cream.  Transitioning to 'surf n' turf' in an eight plate third course of butter poached lobster juxtaposing aggressively peppered beef before progressing to five cheeses novel to even the experienced it was at last in two separate courses that sweets arrived and with Gagnaire himself overseeing the pastry preparation that evening every item arrived with a flourish; a garnish here or an extra plate there to cap another stunning meal.Three of us met at 7 PM for dinner.  Michael U had received notice from one of the employees at Twist that Chef Gagnaire would be in Las Vegas for a range of dates.  It was because of this we booked at this time.  The restaurant, on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in City Center, is elegant and the view is very good.The three of us ended up getting a modified version of the grand tasting menu.  We were brought three rolls each and then the meal began.  First up was an amuse-blouche of two small bites with the server suggesting the correct order to eat the two. Course one was sea urchin mousseline with caviar.  There was gelée of bonito and grilled onion infusion and olive oil infused salsify spaghettini.  It was recommended that we mix the sea urchin with the spaghettini for the greatest flavor.  An excellent dish and an auspicious start for the evening. Course two was lobster fricassee with kaffir lime and enoki mushrooms, baby carrot stew and sweet wine and green tea butter and the dish was topped with some edible flowers.  The lobster was simply superb!Course three was modified by us.  We added an extra course at an extra charge. It was carnaroli risotto with artichokes and pine nuts.  It was topped with some micro greens and a LOT of shaved truffles.  What a grand melding of flavors with the truffles and risotto and the pine nuts added a texture that made this dish another winner.Next was time for a palate cleanser of some sorbet to ready us for the foie gras coming next.Course four was the roasted foie gras with coffee and chestnut velouté, prunes and porcini.  More truffles were shaved on this dish and it was absolutely sublime.  The sauce was so rich and the mushrooms with the foie were the tops!Course five was another divergence on our part.  We asked if we could sub proteins and we could.  Instead of the American Wagyu beef, I got Muscovy duck.  It ha d a green pepper sauce and caramelized pear and pine nuts.  The duck was accompanied by whisky jus eggplant cannelloni with duck confit.  Another winner, but I don't think I need to keep stating that.  A very good switch.Course six was a series of desserts.  One of them we added à la carte--the mille-feuille with praline cream, cassis compote and blackberry sorbet.  We each took a third of this shared dessert but only one (me) slopped on the nice white linen.The grand dessert course consists of three items: 1) Cassis: sorbet, wurtz, marmalade and cane sugar and pink pepper opaline; 2) Honey orange gelée, shortbread, mango and passion fruit topped with fromage blanc ice cream; 3) Chocolate gateau with golden raisins and Amarena cherries.   A suggestion was made in what order we should eat the desserts to get the fullest flavor profiles and it was a grand suggestion.  The dessert were rich, full of exceptional flavors, and very satisfying.  My favorite was the sorbet with grape halves that had been frozen and were around the sorbet.  A great concept.Wait, we're not done yet.  Next we were brought a plate of three lemon meringue bites that had lemon filling between the two sections of meringue.  Each meringue bite was accompanied by three blueberries on an edible toothpick.We're still not done--dessert six was brought for the three of us to share.  It was Gagnaire's Tanzanian chocolate parfait with coffee granité and caramelized hazelnuts.This was rich, smooth, and a perfect chocolaty end to this grand tasting meal.Service was outstanding as you would expect from Twist.  Chef Gagnaire came from the kitchen for a brief hello and the Chef de Cuisine, Ryuki Kawasaki, also came out and chatted with us for a short time and talked about his upcoming move to Bangkok, Thailand.Before leaving, we each received a signed menu from both chefs with the date.  A keepsake for sure!  We also got a small package of two biscotti with the Twist logo to take with us.  Our jackets were waiting for us at the host's stand and we were helped on with them.I can't say too many good words about this wonderful meal.  Three hours of good food, good company, and wonderful surroundings.  This is as good as it gets and a reason why this was my second visit but not my last!!At this point on a first name basis with a reservationist at The Mandarin Oriental who keeps me abreast of when Chef Gagnaire will be visiting his Forbes 5-Starred Twist, it was with somewhat sad news that I was informed my favorite chef would be in town the first weekend of 2015 to see off current Chef de Cuisine, Ryuki Kawasaki - a man soon to rightfully toque his own project in Bangkok, and someone whose cooking myself and two others were lucky enough to experience one more time over the course of three-hours from the 23rd floor room overlooking the dazzling lights below.Written about four times prior, thrice under the care of Chef Kawasaki whose interpretation and execution of Gagnaire's signature style is undoubtedly the best I've seen, the fifth visit to Twist found the room largely unchanged as lighted baubles hung overhead and with a slight change in the soundtrack offering a mix of French tunes and mid-70s American classics a sizable four-top along the "cracked egg" wall served as our table throughout the course a night filled with superlative service and cuisine  most akin to that which was experienced at Le Rue Balzac in 2011, still the best meal of my life.Starting with a truncated amuse consisting of two bites - salt and earth followed by bitter and sweet - to awaken the palate, it was not long after selecting a slightly augmented version of the evening's tasting menu that plated bread arrived, and paired with two butters from Normandy all three fresh-baked selections were as good as ever, the crunchy baguette a showstopper with the salted butter while the buttery brioche proved an amicable sponge for several sauces as the meal progressed.Wasting little time in getting started it was perhaps ten minutes after seating that plate one of the six-course menu arrived and with a spiral of thinly sliced salsify riffing on spaghetti the umami-laden sauce of creamed urchin topped with briny bubbles and hints of onion proved absolutely ethereal on its own, but all the better when blended with the 'pasta' and a base of consommé-clear gelee teaming with flavors of the ocean - a beautiful opening act on which a subsequent plate of snappy lobster enlivened with sweet wine and light bitters would expound before turning to things far more earthy, aromatic, and luxurious to say the least.At this point departing briefly from the night's grand tasting it was in a silver domed supplement that we all indulged and with each plate uncovered simultaneously the unmistakable scent of white truffles soon perfumed the air, each of us breathing in deeply before taking a spoonful of creamy risotto dotted with butter poached artichokes that proved an adept delivery mechanism for the sort of flavor one eats slowly to savor, and only wishes was available year round.Provided with an intermezzo to refresh the palate in preparation for things yet to come it seemed most improbable that anything following the risotto would prove a more memorable dish on the night and yet as luck, as well as fresh black truffles, would have it there were two superior plates to follow - the juicy chicken atop sliced cephalopod as complex as it was impressive while the soup proved to be amongst the best dishes to grace my palate in recent memory - a tender float of foie gras atop brioche finding its foil in a base that was at once sweet and savory with a toasty base-note lurking beneath a generous truffle crown.Opting to order the Mille-Feuille in addition to the included "Grande Dessert" it would be difficult to decide which of the four sweets was the most impressive of the night but with frozen grapes adding an unexpected degree of nuance to the small bowl titled Cassis the scaled back finale was without a doubt the most well conceptualized in my Twist experiences to date - a complimentary taste of the feather-light Tanzanian Chocolate capping the evening alongside fruity mignardises while autographed menus and duos of biscotti were offered as bonus gifts for the road.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Perhaps the most 'straight forward' meal enjoyed at Twist to-date in terms of a diminished selection of amuses, canapés, mignardises, satellite plates, and components to the Grand Dessert it seems that a transition is already underway in the Kitchen as Ryuki Kawasaki plans his departure, but with each dish an absolute gem of taste and presentation with service that remains the most professional and least 'stuffy' of all the formal French dining rooms in the city it seems safe to assume that the future is in good hands - a return visit already in its planning stages, once the new Chef is named.Finally getting the opportunity to dine at Twist, I couldn't resist the tasting menu. The restaurant is located inside the Mandarin Oriental and every seat includes dazzling views of the strip.Without going over each course in detail, I will say every bite was absolutely delicious and I can't think of a better fine dining experience that I have had in the last few years. It was gluttonous, divine and my dining companions left with bright smiles on our faces and full stomachs.Before we left, we each received a personalized signed menu from the evening which was a treat.Service was impeccable, as expected, and I can't think of one thing about the meal wasn't sheer perfection. The perfect way to spend three hours on a Saturday night in Vegas.

I've been to Halftime 5 times since it's opening last year. The food is very plain and distasteful. Granted that they have the typical barroom food, but it's just not good. I've had better from the frozen food isle. The service is slow. The people are rude and a little haughty. Let's face it, this is Buckeye. There's is and never will be a reason to be haughty. Won't return and tell everyone we know that it's an undesirable place to be. It's worth the drive to go a little farther to the Longhorn for a truly delicious burger and friendly, efficient service.First buckeye is hell. Second, when I did walk in the server did say for me to sit anywhere I wanted..and all but one table was dirty. 3rd I couldn't tell you anything about the food because I was sitting there for 10 minutes without anybody asking me for even a drink order or to give me a menu. I walked out...

At first glance it does not look like much, but looks are deceiving. This is straight up authentic Mexican food. Pure awesomeness in my mouth! We were the only people in here, and I was a little hesitant at first. Then, the food came out! It was awesome. There are a 3 signs when I go to a Mexican restaurant that I look for----I'll Tell you them:1.It has to have real Mexican cheese of some sort. Chihuahua Cheese is my fav.2. I need to see Verde----like truly good tasting tomitillo homeade sauce.3. I need a Steak Taco! A good flank steak taco can not be beat.This place knocked them out of the park! Also they brought a nice mixed Mexican veggie bowl that I really did appreciate. It was fresh cactus along with a pico. Totally unexpected and awesome. To really push my in love with this place, I was handed a free piece of cake on my walk out the door filled with fresh strawberries! I almost gave the waitress a hug I was so excited!Great true Mexican food in Madison!

I haven't had Pittza Rella in about a year and randomly a few days ago my brain and stomach was craving their unique out of this world delicious steak rolls and pepperoni rolls.  When they came, they were even better than I remember them being.This place puts a lot of love into the rolls.  Rather than separate round rolls they come in a long roll that's cut into slices.  The steak comes with peppers onions and mushroom and cheese.  The outside is crispy and perfectly browned and the same goes for the pepperoni rolls.  If you are a classic Pittsburgher you'll want some ranch dressing to dip them in so be sure to ask for it cause it doesn't come with it.  We also ordered pizza which I never had before and even that impressed me.  The cheese and toppings and everything stayed in its place bite after bite.  The crust was light and crispy, not too cooked not undercooked, just right.If you are in the West Mifflin/Homestead/Munhall area and you want to try an alternative just as good as Pizza Company with its own flare, Pittza Rella is a great game day decision.

I do not normally like to eat in buffets because I do not like to overeat, but my mom wanted to try this place.They just opened, so we decided to try this place for lunch.I thought it was decent, and some of the dishes were actually pretty tasty.I noticed the majority of buffet eaters were gravitating towards the fried and hot food stations. They had a variety of items such as baked salmon, fried shrimp, crab casserole, fried chicken, baked mussels, pork humba and more. My brother liked them, and he said they were remarkably flavorful.I went to the fruit and salad station and tried the sushi bar which had a wide selection.I love the fact that they have edename and kim chee on their appetizer buffet. Good stuff!They also have a stir fry station where food is made to order. You put all your vegetable ingredients, and sauces on a plate, and they will make a stir fry dish for you.The dessert cakes also look appetizing, but I skipped them and tried the ice cream instead.They have various flavors, and you can even put toppings on them.I tried the peppermint ice cream which was quite refreshing.The place was also very clean, and they also offer senior discounts.To sum up my review, I give them 4 stars for having a large selection and great service. Lots of choices both for vegetarians and meat eaters.I think they will do well. They picked an excellent location with ample parking and great buffet price too.For $7.50 plus tip, there's no room for grumbling.So, I really hate buffets in Arizona. They suck, they're shady, and they make me want to cry or vomit or both. I'm a HUGE fan of eating - throw in unlimited eating of half decent foods and we're talking solid gold! Needless to say, Vegas is my kind of town! However, since I don't live in Vegas, finding all you can eat options in Phoenix has become my new life's passion. Enter Red Wok. Now, it's no Fogo de Chao, it's not really even Las Vegas Blvd worthy, but it IS off-boulevard sketchy strip mall worthy in the highest sense of the word! The actual facility is surprisingly beautiful and clean! The food is okay for buffet food (a solid 3.5 stars) but here's the clincher: all you can eat char siu bau, chinese spare ribs, fried plantains, kalbi, and kimchee and it's all GOOD! The soups are a little bland and I pretty much avoided the rice/chow mein fillers but most of the other things were pretty darn delicioso! I saw boiled crawfish and peel and eat shrimp but I haven't decided if I'm brave enough for that venture just yet - I did eat a sushi roll and although it didn't SEEM gross, I think mentally I can't get over the idea of buffet sushi - much like I'm sure tongue tastes great but Jesus man, it's TONGUE! At  just under $9 for an adult lunch with drink, I actually feel like I'm getting my money's worth and then some! I am actually planning to return to try the ice cream and Mongolian BBQ station but considering I just downed half  dozen mini coffee cakes, I think I'll call it a night. I loved the facility, I loved the service, I liked the food, but add the Marvin Gaye and circa 1980's Madonna playing in the background and I'm totally sold! :)I could regale you with a list of every dish available but it is a buffet so you know what to expect before you walk in. It specializes in Asian cuisine so the majority of dishes have a distinctly oriental flavor.They do have some non-Asian dishes including mashed potatoes, pizza, French fries and barbecued chicken. They also have some steak pieces and spicy ribs as well.If you are hungry for sushi you will be able to fill yourself up with standard sushi fare. They also have seaweed salad and edamame.The meal is less than $10 for dinner unless you want to add a soft drink which is $2 more.The most common entree is chicken which is prepared in at least twelve different ways.They have some interesting desserts as well as ice cream so you will not leave here hungry.There is seating for lots of people as well as an additional room that will seat a whole bunch more.This is not a place to take your sweetheart on a first date. Also not a place to impress the boss. Great for large groups if you are paying for everyone. Great for hungry people and people who enjoy stuffing themselves to the gills and then feeling bad because they couldn't control their greed.Red Wok will not appeal to everyone and once in a while it may not agree with you, but it is great value for money.

Review Text :
In a series of fortunate events, we ended up dining atrium al fresco in the Mansion dining room for lunch today.  You can't even imagine the picturesque nature of the mansion.  Essentially, it is a private boutique hotel nestled under a temperature controlled, aroma controlled glass dome.  The "rooms" are private villas, generally for invited guests.The tables are pristine in the dining room.  Sparkiling silver and china, white linens, polished glassware, sterling carts.....it's all there.  The dining room opens to the atrium.  The peaceful gurgling of fountains, and the soft classical music create a truly tranquil environment.I ordered the creamy artichoke soup and carrot tortellini with short ribs.  My husband had king crab louis salad and dover sole. Our meal started with bread service.  There was a small platter presented with 4 different types of bread and a perfectly shaped rectangle of softened butter.  Each course is served seamlessly by the white gloved, suited waiters with the acompanying utensils.  My soup was creamy, buttery, artichoky, piping hot and topped with cripy artichoke hearts.  The king crab louis was a beautiful plate with lettuce hearts, olives, teardrop tomatoes, bell peppers, cheese, and generous chunks of sweet light crab.  It was all drizzled with a creamy, delightful, and surprisingly light lemon dressing.  On to the main course....my carrot tortellini was knock your socks off, out of this world, delectable!   It was a surpsing portion of braised kobe short ribs, petite turned carrots, and mini hand rolled tortellini.  The tortellini immediately melted in your mouth in a pool of umami beef jus.  It was just so darn savory and delightful.  The dover sole was probably the most beautiful plate of food I have ever seen.  It was cleverly served with pea puree and carrot puree instead of the average "peas and carrots."  It came with a sterling pitcher of herbed clarified butter.  It had onions, fried capers, and fresh peas as an artful garnish.  We finished off with a pot of tea, madelines, and petit fours.  They served chocolate and vanilla madelines, miniature truffles, guava jelly, and miniature almond clusters.The meal was lovely...and it was merely a lunch! I'm sure dinner is an elaborate performance of service and cuisine.  Be ready to pay for this level of excellence though.  Our bill, for lunch, for 8, without any alcohol, was $720.  My tortellini was $48 while the sole was $60....you won't find this out until the end because there aren't any prices on the menu.  But then again, I'm confident the average mansion diner just plum doesn't care.

Wow. Major disappointment.We used the free house wine offer, and gave it to my mom.I ordered the "crispy" (deep fried) and "sticky" (covered in mozz cheese) balls (I guess they are trying to make the old ladies blush when they read the menu) in diablo hot. ($10) for two. I also ordered a Caesar salad. My guy asked the owner (who was our waiter, and parks his lambo on the sidewalk, in front of the place) what dish is their best, especially for first comers. His answer... Chicken Parm.... really? Chicken parm? He got the marsala.We ordered calamari for an appetizer. It was not crispy. It was flavorless. Seriously, needed salt and pepper.My beef balls came (haha, they are suppose to be "gourmet). The extra money you spend to have them "crispy" and "sticky" go to waste. There was no texture to these meat balls. They were pure mush. The sauce was pretty good though, and spicy.When the marsala was delivered, I knew that the veggies on the side were either frozen, or out of a can. The carrots were the circles with the crinkle pattern on them, and the broccoli was just the stems, not the fluffy tops. The marsala sauce was overly sweet.Overall, Meh. No thanks.

Review Text :
Trader Joes, fro yo, nail salon, restaurants, a wine bar, shopping, soon-to-be drug store and now a bagel shop. Yes, this area absolutely needed the bagel shop addition! This is a pretty general Einstein Bagels but it's clean, in a good area, has friendly staff and the bagels are fresh and tasty! I really like how Einstein Bagels added thin bagels to their menu. I love their bagels but they can be to hearty for a breakfast, so the thin bagel is a great option. I also enjoy the bagel bites and bagel sandwiches (breakfast and lunch) as well. The cream cheeses are creamy and delicious, especially the honey almond cream cheese. My favorite bagel is the cinnamon sugar bagel. They also have great soda drinks, coffee, fruit, parfait and juices. There isn't much more to say other than that this is a perfect addition to the area and I'm happy to have an Einstein's close by for my morning breakfast urges.There are very few bagel shops in the Old Town area other than this Einsteins and a couple of others.  So, every now and then, I'll pop into this location to pick up some bagels for the house... they happen to have tasty schmears (aka cream cheese flavors) and quality lox as well.Unfortunately, the last few times I've been to this location, the service has been painfully slow.  Also, they are often out of certain kinds of bagels that I like including the honey whole wheat.  On the bright side, they will slice the bagels for you and/or put them in plastic bags to keep them fresh.  Their coffee isn't bad, and this location has a decent sized parking lot too... and if you need any groceries, you can run next door to Trader Joe's (or around the corner to AJ's) without moving your car!If you have the time and don't mind driving a tad bit further, I recommend both Chompie's and NY Bagel and Bialy over Einsteins, but if your expectations are in check and/or you're in a hurry, this Einsteins will do.  Just keep in mind that it's a chain, the service may be slow, and while the food won't blow you away, it is pretty consistent.

This place introduced me (and perhaps the city) to the Arepas. These soft corn based bread which is stuffed with awesomeness, be it meat, poultry or veggies.The Arepa (bread) is gluten free, so yay for celiac sufferers, the other ingredients I am not sure. Vege friendly yes, vegan friendly - not to my knowledge.If people LOVE their spicy sauce, they have two excellent sauces. The red sauce has lots of heat (go easy on this one) and their green sauce is avocado based with a touch of cilantro/coriander and is packed with flavour.Messy eaters be warned, the stuffing can fall out so eat in small bites and use food physics to your advantage!

Restaurant name  Hey Joe! Filipino Street Food Truck
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
5 stars for starting up a food truck and solid 3.5 for food. An exciting new addition to the Phoenix food truck scene. They made their Phoenix Public Market debut last night at the Wednesday evening market. They have a short but sweet menu that includes a Lumpia trio for $5, various combos of Grilled skewers of Pork, Chicken or combos that include skewers, lumpia and even chicken feet which range between $7-$10. All entrees are served with rice and pickled ginger "salad". They also offered chicken feet, chicken "ass", and a rare delicacy called balut (which if you finish you get free Lumpia on your next visit.) Deciding I wasn't feeling adventurous enough for the Balut I ordered the Lumpia trio. It was a rather popular selection that evening as others around me were ordering the same. They cook their Lumpia to order and after about a 5 min wait I received 3 HOT and crispy Lumpia. These were very good! and the dipping sauce made them better. Next time I hope to try the chicken "ass"...if this is anything like the Turkey tails you get at some Mexican Deli places I am down for trying these and I love the chicken feet at Chinese Dim Sum so I hope to try these next time.Delicious! The Hey Joe Special is comprised of perfectly tender and moist chicken (served on the bone, slightly awkward/messy but really really perfectly done), beautifully seasoned pork, and lumpia for $8, along with a pinch of salad and a healthy scoop of rice for the sides. The lumpia were (was? i don't know Filipino food) crispy and savory - I'm glad I splashed the sweet/spicy sauce Brian recommended on them. The pork had an intriguing citrus flavor which I loved. The Hey Joe truck will be at 18th Ave & Deer Valley on Mondays from 11-1 for the foreseeable future (your best way to find them is to follow them at twitter.com/heyjoetruck), and I will be there w/ an appetite.I'm an amateur when it comes to food trucks but my friend took me a spot that had 10 trucks parked for a weekday lunch. I chose to eat Filipino food and it was really good. The price is on the high side for it not being a sit down restaurant.  I had the pancit noodles and the lumpia and they were delicious. If you enjoy good Filipino food or you've never tried it, this is a good place to go.

Review Text :
I hate to be the first to review this with such a negative rating, unfortunately opening day did not do the place justice.  I understand that opening on a Friday night has its perks - lots of business, great way to show your nightlife capabilities - and show off in general, fresh crowds and new people to bring in and form into regulars, etc, etc, however if you're going to open on a Friday and be understaffed, it's not going to go very smooth.  My fiance and I showed up around 7pm and were sat promptly outside with no wait, which was nice considering all of the people that were in the bar area.  We didn't notice anything suspicious, everything seemed to be in good order and the place was spotless as far as cleanliness goes.  Then we sat down with the menus and were left alone without a drink order.  10 minutes later, our waitress showed up and took our orders - Arnold Palmer and a Port Brewing Wipeout IPA.  Another 10 minutes passes and the Arnold Palmer and two waters show up, but no beer.  Apparently they're out of most of their craft draft and bottled beer due to their soft opening the night before.  Okay, I guess I'll order something else.  The waitress excuses herself before I can order a different beer and I watch as she takes orders from 5 other tables around us, runs to the bar and kitchen twice before returning with another Arnold Palmer.  I order a Ska beer. "Which one? We have two."  I know, bring me whichever one you have available right now.  She smiles and trots away before we can order food.  We sat for another 15 minutes before my fiance went up to the bar to order me a beer.  The waitress passed us three more times before she brought out a beer for me, Ska Pinstripe red ale in a bottle.  With no glass.  But at least she stuck around long enough for us to order some food.Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against sucking down a beer straight from the bottle, but I wasn't exactly drinking a Corona or a Bud Lite.  Even then, don't most sports bars - and bars/restaurants in general - provide a glass with a canned or bottled beer?  I can even look past if the glass is frosted (yes, I am a beer snob, it happens to be my line of work), but to have no option of drinking out of a glass seems a little...odd to me.  I chalked it up to it being opening night, again, but I was finally beginning to run out of patience when our food still hadn't arrived another 30 minutes later.  I think the kicker for me was that the waitress kept zooming past us and offering up"Just another 2 minutes!" "It'll be out soon!" "I think it's because you ordered the fillet that it's taking so long..." "Thanks for hanging in there!" "2 more minutes!" without stopping to refill drinks or ask if we needed anything else.  I actually regretted not ordering appetizers, though we might have been there another half hour.10 minutes (seemed to be the trend of the night - I know, I know, opening night) later, I get the other beer my fiance ordered at the bar (Ska Modus Hoperandi), though the bartender was nice enough to give it to me on the house for waiting so long.  I could go on and on about how it took us close to an hour and a half to get our food, but in the end, we did get what we ordered (even after our waitress showed up with the next table's food convinced it was ours) and it wasn't half bad.  It is not food I would graciously wait an hour and a half for, but it was satisfying.  I ordered the fillet (I believe it's called Dennis' Fillet) cooked medium with prosciutto wrapped asparagus (which seemed pretty ritzy for a sports bar menu - but then it came with ranch and all was right with the world), and I received a slightly dry medium-well steak with blanched asparagus rested on some thick slices of...ham.  Don't get me wrong, the food had flavor, just not an hour and a half's worth.  Fiance got the blackened Cajun chicken sandwich with a side of pasta salad - the chicken had a nice kick, probably could've been seared a little more so the spices were more ingrained, but you won't hear any complaints about the pasta salad.  It had more flavor than most of my meal combined.  All in all, the place has some fantastic potential, the location is spot on for being in downtown Chandler, and by the time we left, there was a little bit of a wait for people to get in to eat while the bar area was jam packed.  I plan on revisiting in a month or so to see if they can get their act together and find their groove.  All of the people who served us, save for our waitress, were very courteous and helpful - even if at a snail's pace, though they didn't like hearing that we weren't 100% satisfied with our table service (hey, they asked!).  I'm sure this place will pick up some supportive regulars and turn out to be an awesome joint, just give it a little bit of time before you head in there, or at least be prepared to spend 2+ hours of your patience on the staff.

Review Text :
Great vibe. After you valet the car (you have to- it's the only option) you walk into an outdoor area very similar to postino Arcadia.  Head inside and be greeted by a lovely hostess.  We sat at the bar with a carafe of wine.  All wine is served in a carafe, ala on tap style.  I like this.  The bar is in the center of the restaurant in a super chic way that you can observe what is going on around you and kinda hideout or be seen- the choice is yours.  We were seated in what I think was the best seats in the house.  It was in a corner booth that was right at the corner of the restaurant.  Once we all slid into our booth seats, we all agreed it was like hunkering down in a basement somewhere on a leather couch.   We were introduced to Dan, the super slim, urban hipster server with a nice face and a witty personality.  When asked if my burger would be better with fries or mac n cheese, he asked me how often I eat burgers with mac n cheese? uhh, so yeah, I ordered the mac n cheese--- GREAT choice! We started with the Smorgash board that had pita, cheese, the most kale chips and largest kale chips I have ever seen, hummus, some veggies and smoked salmon-- it was interesting enough, but I probably won't be ordering that again.  But since they just opened, I am happy to try anything on the menu!Entrees included the waldorf salad that was only so-so, it was called "a bit too much" by a friend, the Barley salad was a huge hit as was the corn chowder.  My burger was good, I recommend going easier on the caramelized onions.  I felt like it started to taste more like a dessert before I even got half way through it.After we ate, relaxed and Dan check on us the perfect amount of time, we walked through and headed next door to Churn for dessert.  We passed the bar, said hello to a few friends we ran into, observed the outdoor seating one more time, and then walked though a hallway decorated in old cassette tapes, that was awesome!   At the end of the hallway was a bathroom marked "ladies and gents"- I absolutely despise shared bathrooms.  So that grossed me out thoroughly.  But as we made the turn, I saw the candies and ice cream that awaited me just around the corner....My taste buds got a sneak peak of Windosr back in March. I was a cocktail judge for the Arizona BBQ Festival and the friendly folks from Postino's introduced Windsor as a contestant in the whiskey competition. As I sipped a refreshing cocktail with only a subtle hint of whiskey, I made a mental note that as soon as Windsor opened their doors, I'd hop, skip and jump there as soon as possible. So with that, today was the day I made it through the whimsical doors of Windsor. I met fellow yelper, Christina P for a patio lunch at this new Central Phoenix restaurant. Similar to its neighborhood brother, Postino's, Windsor's architecture has the same modern and minimalistic feel to it from the exterior, but once you walk through the doors, you enter an entirely different world. Parking is extremely limited at Windsor, but I decided to risk it and found one last spot on the side of the residential street. However, I don't think this residential parking will last long, so I suggest saving yourself a possible ticket and valeting it instead. Atmosphere: Like I mentioned above, Windosr is completely unassuming from the outside. I had no idea that it was so open and airy throughout the interior of the restaurant and they also have two patios in the back. One patio is smaller and more intimate, and the other is a little larger and seats more. Both are quirky and fun as well as airy but protected from the sun by an overhang. I felt like I was lunching on the back patio of a stylish friend's house. The tables are close together, but I never felt like I was in another table's conversation or they were in mine. This is a great restaurant for patio dining and I could see it not being too hot in the summer should I crave an outdoor lunch. The staff was also friendly and attentive and consistently refilled my diet coke, which is always a plus in my book. Decor:I love the decor of the Windsor. Think retro chic. Everything is very clean and minimalistic but once you look closer, you see how retro and fun everything is. Take the cassette tape wall for example. Yes, it's an actual cassette tape wall and all of the cassettes are authentic and awesome. They have everything from Genesis and AC/DC to MC Hammer and homemade workout mix tapes. It's almost like a memory wall for those who are products on the 80s or earlier! The bathrooms are funky, the walls have funky writing on them and the whole decor resembles a classed up garage that's been converted into a bar/restaurant. Food:Now moving on to the food. The menu is just as retro as the decor in the sense that they have classic items with a twist. They have everything from hot dogs and a crab cake BLT to pastrami Reuben and of course plenty of salads and starters. I am excited to go back and continue to try items off the menu, but today I decided to go for the Brown Bag Chicken Sandwich which has pulled chicken with oven dried tomatoes, toasted hazelnuts and herbs topped with avocado, watercress & green goddess goat cheese. Yes, it was as good as it sounds, but note that this is a cold chicken sandwich and not warm. It was a tasty sandwich but I think it would have been better heated. We also tried the Kale leaves as an appetizer. If you are a fan of Kale, you'll probably enjoy them. They also come with a chive mayo sauce that tastes a lot like the sauce you get with artichokes. Between the food, atmosphere and decor, I really like Windsor and plan on adding this to my Central Phoenix rotation. Between Postino and Windsor, I am one happy camper!After a few trips to Churn, I decided it was time to try Windsor. I'd gotten a few tips from friends on what to order and everyone really enjoyed their food.Kammie K was my lunch partner. When I got there, she had a bowl of pistachios in front of her. In. The. Shell. I love that! Good food always takes a little work, right? As we munched on the nuts (hahaha I am a nut muncher!) I saw something on the menu I'd been wanting to try for a couple months: kale chips.The chips came with a ranch dipping sauce, but I only tried a little of it. They were perfect on their own! Garlic hunks and sea salt peppered each leaf perfectly. I can't wait to learn how to make them at home!I also had bite-sized corn dogs. They were pretty good & came with a side of mustard, but some of the batter didn't cook all the way on a couple of the pieces.The patio here is awesome. The misters really keep the temperature down, though I will have to really judge that in July.  They have the BEST soundtrack playing, too. It's a mix of awesome 80s music. Oh, and their wall is covered in cassette tapes. Some of them are mixed tapes. FTW!!!(Bring $5 for the valet. There is street parking, but it's hard to come by.)In my best Charlie Sheen, "Windsor. Winner. Windsor. Winner!"I had the MOST attentive service from our greeting at the door, to our seating in back, to our beverage service...ooops, then a small lapse in service...no biggie I was enjoying the vibe and the ambience.Ordered the Double Dip...sadly the name reminded me of my buddies in college when they would chew tobacco, sometimes they would "double dip"....gross I know. The concept of this dip is a cobb salad made into a dip served with a chipotle salsa (didn't get much smoky chipotle flavor however...which is fine since my little petite self is sensitive to spicy food...I mean my mom would serve potato chips and ketchup and called it chips and salsa...but I digress). I would order the dip again, but I have to say it really tasted just like egg salad. And fortunately I loves me some egg salad!My rueben sandwich was OUTSTANDING and I chose a side of mac n cheese which was total bliss (NOT plugging a restaurant downtown btw)....that was the word I said as cheese and a chunk of elbow macaroni slid down my chin. Pleasant, I know. My friend was doing the Meg Ryan orgasm scene as he enjoyed his bbq pulled chicken sandwich. I'm sure we looked ridiculous. But we were ridiculously happy. Welcome to the neighborhood Windsor. Let's totally hang out more often!I finally got to experience what everyone has been talking about.  Windsor is certainly one of the rather trendy spot at the moment on Central road.  I had the Pastrami Reuben sandwich, which was really salty.  I couldn't even finish it.  However, the Porkwich with kale salad was mighty tasty.  Highly recommend this.  The atmosphere was very laid back and friendly.  The cassette wall was a genius way to recycle old cassettes.The first few times I went to Windsor, I didn't love it. There was nothing wrong, it was just... I think this place is a guy hangout. It feels masculine. Not in a sports bar kind of way, but more like a place two friends that are guys regularly go to have a beer that don't want to drink bud light at a dive. Over time, the $5 pitchers of beer before 5pm have won me over. In addition to the great happy hour, they make some pretty spectacular drinks. The Number 17 is so refreshing. Manny is a fabulous bartender. They also have a few vegan food options - a sandwich and a mixed grain salad in addition to some sides. All have been fresh and tasty. I love that during nice weather they can open the place up, and the patio is great. The bathrooms are pretty cool as well. The parking is the real drawback. You either have to valet, which fortunately is complimentary, or try to find a spot on the residential streets that won't end up getting you towed..Overall I give Windsor a 3.5-4.0 stars.Sometime long, long ago, I had a wonderful brunch at Windsor.  I remember it fondly.A No 2 cocktail (vodka, peach puree, prosecco) times 2.  An amazing bloody mary bar, too bad I don't like bloody marys.  Warm donut holes with mascarpone and jam.  A fantastic breakfast burrito with Schreiner's sausage.  And more than one bite of my husband's strawberry pancakes.Wouldn't have changed a thing, especially when the bill came and it was far less than I would have expected.  Big hug to Shannon M (and an unnamed former Yelper) for introducing us to this gem.I have found a new place close to downtown to eat.  Great place to enjoy lunch and the $5 pitchers are a great enticer.If that does not get you down here maybe the great patio will get you here or the spacious bar.  I could see myself eating at the bar or one of the super comfortable booths.As for the eats....The backyard burger, Windsor style is on my list of must eat again, porkwich is a must eat all the time, and the mac and cheese is a great side.  I can't cook mac and cheese like that at home, nice crisp top of melted cheese and uber yummy cheese and pasta under neath.  The Windsor burger and piggy burger were great.  Just ask for extra napkins since you will look like a Carl's Jr commercial trying to scarf either burger down.  They are both messy, but I could not let the sauce and juice go to waste just dip the burger into the left overs on the plate. :) Let me describe the porkwich please....  Pulled pork, belly braised ham, cold slaw, smoked bacon, and the yummy sweet gold sauce.  All this on a buttermilk bun which is soft and a great absorber of all that sauce and flavor.  Get you eat on quick so the bun does not go soggy on you.  The backyard burger has a great garlic aioli, caramelized onions, sharp cheddar, and some iceberg shredded up to add some color.  This was a great burger and even though it is a must eat again I am really a fan of the porkwich.  My only downside is parking, really only a hand full of parking and then free valet.  Nothings free, I still gotta tip a guy that has to run down the street to get my car.  That's usually where your car will end up is down a side street adjacent to the restaurant.  I think the valet thing does fix the lack of parking problem and the food is so good it really is not that big of a deal.  If you are ever in the general vicinity of Windsor I suggest you give it a shot, great staff, great food, and great overall restaurant.This review is mostly due to the absolutely horrible attitude our table was given and the horrible service by the server named Emma.Why in the world they would have someone so miserable working there is beyond me.The food won't even get a review. We couldn't get past the fact we wet treated as a huge inconvenience to our server.I don't know what I could say that hasn't already been said, but this is one of my 3 go to places for brunch on the weekends.  I totally love it here and the staff always makes you feel so welcome!The drinks alone are fantastic.  (Can I have the NO.2, please!) and they have great deals for brunch on the weekends.  Their Bloody Mary bar is the best with a great variety to mix in (and who really needs to eat after all of those olives!)If you go for brunch, it is a MUST to experience their zucchini bread.  My friends tried mine yesterday, and they ended up stealing the whole thing from me!  HA!  And I also decided not to get the rest of the brunch yesterday and actually get a burger.  I got the Windsor style, and I have to say it was one of the best burgers I ever had!  I was totally impressed!So do yourself a favor, even if you have to travel a bit to get there, and experience the wonderness of the Windsor! :)Headed to the Windsor for bunch for June's Breakfast Club UYE, with a turnout of 17, one of the things that made Windsor a hit from the start for me was the fact that I was able to make reservations! WOOT WOOT! It makes everything so much easier!I can't lie before I even got the Windsor I had checked out the brunch menu and was 95% sure I was going to go with the Windsor Eggs Benedict, and even though they have a Bloody Mary Bar for 5 bucks, I wasn't going to tempt myself with that because honestly Bloody Marys are not my sort of thing.After sitting down and looking at the drink menu, I saw something that looked interesting and needed a try and it was a bloody mary drink too! I was mind blown that I was going down that path, but It's The Verde Bloody Mary, made with cucumbers, roasted poblano, cilantro & watercress, damn this drink was DELISH!  They do have a bloody Mary bar with all your fixings, pickles, spices, salts & garnishes but for me, this drink was perfect, it didn't need anything. It was spicy, it was heaven!  If you do not like spicy don't order it, for me damn it was great!After sipping on my Verde I no longer was interested in the benedict and wanted a spicy dish to go with my drink, so I went with the Matador, two eggs over easy ontop of griddled cheddar potatoes, crispy tortilla, salsa verde & avocado relish, while waiting for everyone's plates to come out I spotted some of the benedict dishes and was starting to get plate envy, they looked soo good!  Then the Matador made it to me, this dish was amazing, the salsa verde was great the egg & potatoes combo with the avocado relish was just explosions of flavors hitting your tongue, and it went very well with the Verde Bloody Mary, the only thing  I didn't really care for was the crispy tortilla, but it was a great dish for sure!I am happy to have tried the Windsor for bunch, look forward to checking them out at all different hours, and I know Ill be back soon because I am already craving that Verde Bloody Mary.Came here for brunch w/ a friend of mine. When we walked up the entrance looked more like it was the back of the building. Weird. Is there two entrances? lol. There was a line outside the door. I wasn't sure if people were just waiting for their names to be called or it was an actual line. Apparently there was no one there to help any of us. This is already a bad first impression for me. We got seated on the patio. 2nd negative was we got there at 1:10 and missed their brunch menu by ten minutes! Darn it! They need to extend their brunch menu. For drinks I ordered the No. 14. Anything watermelon I just have to try. This drink has Silver Rum, Pressed Watermelon, Habanero-Ginger Syrup, Smoked Chile Rim.There was definitely a kick to it. lolI ordered the brown bag chicken sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. It was good but not great. I really liked the mac and cheese. My friend got a side of the potatoes which I got to try. I think I liked their sides better than the entrees. lol. I was a bit disappointed in the customer service here. Our server was not personable, sociable or friendly at all. It was just straight business. What would you like to drink, are you ready to order? Done deal. I might come back to try their brunch menu next time, but other then that, don't think it was worth the drive for me.Who knew all these Hipster places were in Phoenix these days. All the years I have lived downtown, they never had these kind of places. Now Downtown is crawling with them! Yeah!!This is a nice place, on a great day. We chose to eat inside as the sun was to be going down soon, and it was a bit cold for me.My daughter tired several cocktails , she said all were very tasty. Especially one with cucumber. Which I as well tasted and enjoyed.The food took a long time but, the staff is very attentive and check on you a lot. It is like a group event. Everyone checks on you, and they are all very pleasant.The nice thing is before 5o'clock all drinks were only $5.00 no wonder it was so busy there.I got the Lobster roll, it was good but, it has a lot of seasoning on it. Really not necessary, just let me taste the Lobster.  We also got cierviche for an appetizer. Very good, I would order that again. My two dining companions all liked their food as well.A Ruben , and a club type thing. You can change out the bread if you like, and they have Gluten free. I got sweet potato fries, good. The shoe string fries ,not so good.But, it is a great place and worth a visit. Love the decor and the old look about it.Clean restrooms and the parking can be very tight.Every single visit I've had to Windsor has been positive. Whether I'm sitting out on the patio under low lights next to a heater, or inside a cozy booth by their spacious bar inside, it is always a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy with friends or on a date.Enough about the atmosphere, though - the food. I haven't met a dish here that I don't like. They have great salads (my favorite is the ahi tuna salad) that leave you satisfied. The sandwiches are the star here, though. I have enjoyed everything from the Backyard Burger to the Bahn Mi, and they are all spectacular. Great medium cook on the burger, tangy sauces (even a good kick on the bahn mi), amazing pork belly in the porkwitch... it's just so good. My favorite so far though has been the Oyster Po Boy. Giant pieces of lightly fried oysters and a huge helping of slaw to top it in the perfect roll. The sides continue to rock my socks. Most people will rave about their mac and cheese, and it certainly deserves its accolades, but my favorite is the fried okra. The cornmeal breading stays on it perfectly and the dipping sauce they serve with it is perfection. "But Libby!" You exclaim. "Whatever shall I drink with these delicious dishes?" Oh, let me tell you, friend. Do not miss the liquor at Windsor. The Number 63, with burbon, fresh grapefruit and honey syrup is the bomb.com. Not too sweet, not too bitter, not too liquory, just right. My other favorite is the Number 9 with rye, pineapple and mint. They're all worth a go (I just lean towards darker liquors) - definitely give it a shot. (see what I did there?)Overall, this is one of my favorite places in the valley. Upward Projects knew what they were doing when they created this amazing place for everyone (next to an ice cream store, no less) - it's a must in my book!Was having a rough day/night/week, whatever you want to call it and wanted to go somewhere to unwind and just forget about the day, so I suggested to a friend that we do dinner at Windsor, so off we went!The main reason why I wanted Windsor is because I remembered there Verde Mary, and that's what I wanted, something spicy with a kick! Man was I bummed out to learn that's not on the everyday menu, must be just a brunch thing, even Windsor was kickin me when I was down.  But I got over that soon and went with a black cherry lemonade, which was great tasting, fresh and not too sweet.After checking out the menu, we started off with Corn Dog Poppers that came with fried pickles and ballpark mustard.  These lil corn dogs were delsih! It was a corn meal crust perfectly cooked, even the pickles were coated in the corn meal, it just was perfect! The pickles even came in quarters and slices, I thought that was pretty cool.I went with the Grilled Chicken sandwich, it was a spicy curry rubbed chicken breast with a mango jalapeno mayo, red onion, spring greens & tomato on a hoagie roll. I have to say this was perfect! I love when chicken is mixed with fruit, I think mangos & pineapples are the best thing to pair with chicken, so mango jalapeno mayo was on point with me! Loved it!  But I do have to admit at some points I did have plate envy because all around me everything was having these huge beefy burgers, I might have to try one of those next time I am back!Oh my goodness, the food here in incredible! Not to mention their fabulous, dog friendly patio!! My boyfriend and I wanted to soak up our beautiful AZ weather with the pooch and hadn't been here so we gave it a shot! I ordered the brown bag chicken salad sandwich and it was phenomenal! Different than your average chicken salad sandwich, in a good way! Avocado, goat cheese and hazelnuts? Yes, please! I got a side salad with it that was tossed in an amazing mustard-y vinaigrette! We also shared a side of their house made chips which are a must! My boyfriend got the pastrami reuben and holy heaven, it was MASSIVE! But amazing. From 11 AM - 5 PM everyday, they have $5 pitchers of beer (not just any beer, GOOD beer!), cocktails & wine! If you have guests in town, this would be the perfect place to take them!

Review Text :
I found myself in the middle of a strange city (Mesa), I was down the street shopping, hungry, and armed with the yelp app on my iphone. I saw a yelp $12 for $24, a groupon $15 for $30, and a yelp check in offer. Decisions, which deal to choose. Most of their meals are anywhere from $10-$12 with tax, so choose accordingly.We walked in saturday at 6:00 pm, and there was no one else here. My initial thought was that everyone else *might* just know something I don't; perhaps I should find another spot I eat. I reluctantly decided to stay, then ordered the green curry and yellow curry. A few moments into our meal another couple came in to eat also, which made me feel better, if not just for the restaraunt operator, but for myself also. I'm normally a bit leary of a restaraunt with no customers. Maybe this is just how it is in middle of Mesa, I'm not really an authority on that particular subject though. I usually hang in and around the Phoenix mid-town area.The food was great! Though I did like the yellow curry better than the green; which is what I would suggest if your looking for curry. Go ahead and order it spicy, it was good. They brought the bill and there was a discrepancy. The yelp check-in offer was clearly $15 and they adjusted the check for 15%. I think the check in offer is SUPPOSED to be 15% and not $15, but they still honored it. I felt obliged and gave them a bigger tip than I ever do; an extra 10% on top of my usual.Over all a nice spot to calm your inner Thai-ger. Happy dining all you Yelpers!

Restaurant name  Jugoo Chinese Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Jugoo's location (right next to UNLV) makes it the most convenient place to drop by after class when I want Chinese. You will most likely see a Maserati parked in front. Just throwin' it out there, it's not a wealthy patron with a taste for Chinese food, but in fact the owner's fancy ride.Jugoo was "featured" on Dirty Dining. I generally assume places clean up their act after a hit from the health department--and the news--but not this place! While everything seems clean and hygienic, on my most recent visit, I discovered mold in the chili sauce. The tiny plastic container kept on the table was full of mold--in plain view of the customers. Totally a gross discovery. While the food was generally tasty, the rotten chili sauce AFTER the health department was in there is pretty ridiculous.If they'll put moldy chili sauce on the table, what do you think the food looks like in the back? Reason why spoiled rich kids shouldn't run restaurants. I would prefer not to get food poisoning due to someone's carelessness--thanks.

Restaurant name  The Tipsy Cow
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I have never gone to Tipsy and been disappointed, let me just say that. Highlights are as follows:*Pickles. They come with your basket (BASKET BONUS) or you can get them as an appetizer. If you get them as an app, make sure you have a decent size group with you. Or make sure you really like pickles. If you really like pickles, you'll really really like their pickles. Paragraph on pickles complete.*Truffle fries. Melt in your goddamn mouth.*Green goddess dressing. I'd bathe in it if it weren't so humid right now.*Specials. They circulate through some pretty creative, limited-time items on a fairly regular basis and I usually order off that menu. The last couple of munchies I tried on special were Goat Cheese Curds and a Caprese Sandwich. Both were way good and I actually think those Goat Cheese Curds were better than their regular ones. Make 'em permanent, make me happy.This review is for Tierney. (I hope that's right. It's what my receipt says.)I don't usually single out servers, but she was so incredible (as was the awesome hostess on Monday night) that I feel like I need to mention her by name. Our group of yelpy trivia players this past Monday grew from 4 to 5 to 7 to 9 to 12 over the course of an hour or so, and each time we needed to add more seats and swap people about, she knew exactly where people were and what they ordered. With each arrival she brought a menu, ran through the food specials time and time again (poor thing... it's fries and wings y'all... half off... every Monday... now you know) and made sure that pints were full of Yelp's Bursting Red Ale and that we felt tended to. Tipsy Trivia is one of my favorites in town, simply because almost everyone who's there on Monday plays. I have to imagine the servers aren't as excited about it as I am. Cheap fries, cheap wings, growing party sizes... it's probably a server nightmare. But ours was a breath of fresh air and for pub grub and beer, it was probably some of the best service I've received in Madison. As for the food, it's what you'd expect. I've always felt the burgers are a little over cooked, but you can stack 'em high, so that's a plus. Parmesan wings were a touch overwhelming, but the standard and the Asian glazed made mouths happy. And rotating taps keep things interesting, and it was exciting to see some "locals" (midwest but not Madison) that I had never heard of.

Restaurant name  Mark's Cafe
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
This small little breakfast place in Tempe is amazing! Mark, himself is the chef! No joke. This is a small, little find of a place that one may be lucky enough to find if you don't blink.. OR if you have yelp, of course! The staff right off from entering is nice and ready to make you happy. We were instantly greeted with waters and told that the pastries were down to two because they are supposedly THAT good! We did not embide, BUT, maybe someday! I loved that they advised us of that, though. I also loved that we instantly got water without having to ask and the coffee we did ask for was on it's way shortly thereafter. From the menu, I would sum Mark's Cafe as being a Benedict place! There are almost a dozen types of Benedict's on the menu and a couple on the 'specials board'. I ordered the Neptune Eggs Benedict. I was pleasantly surprised, (as I always am in the desert), to get REAL crabmeat on this Benedict. Mark's ran out of crab for half of the Benedict, BUT the waitress was super sweet and offered any other Benedict on the menu for me with an apology. To be honest, I was full off the one half of the Neptunes already! Neptunes is obviously a crab benedict underneath the usual hollandaise, but they have a plain hollandaise and a spicy hollandaise. I highly recommend the spicier of the two. It's freshly made by Mark and that makes all the difference in the Benedict. The second half I got to replace what was missing from half of the Neptune was a special on that day: the French Benedict. Same type of typical Benedict but with proscuitto. Yum! It comes with a side of house potatoes too; yummy for that leftover hollandaise sauce! My boyfriend ordered the Biscuits and Gravy. It was a HUGE plate of just that: Biscuits with sausage gravy, both freshly made. It came with a couple of eggs and bacon too. In case, all that sausage in the gravy just wasn't gonna be enough! There was a Blueberry Pancake ordered and on the table by our friend. She asked for just one from the stack order. They happily accommodated her request. That pancake was the size of the dinner, err, breakfast plate it was on. SO huge! The blueberries come on the side for you to spoon out at your delight and are syrupy and a concoction made again, by Mark the Chef , himself. The coffee never ran empty and the staff was super nice and happy. Mark's is a small cafe. We arrived about 1130am on a Sunday and it was almost full and I would imagine it fills up with quite a wait during the busiest times on a weekend. I love a family run business that is local such as Mark's Cafe. I learned after our brunch there that day that Mark's does catering too. Good to know for any events in the upcoming holiday season! If he can perfect a Benedict and it's sauce, I can only imagine what he can do with holiday pies!Mark's cafe is one of those places that you pass by at a strip mall unsure of what kind of restaurant it is, you know those places that don't pique interest unless you stumble upon it on yelp? It doesn't lack character, it's the curb appeal that throws you off because it's not much to look at from the outside but inside meaning the food, it's worth exploring and enjoying. Went with a friend on a random Saturday brunch/breakfast outing. S wanted a place close to home, so, I looked via yelp, and noticed Mark's had good reviews and stars. Read somewhere it's a benedict kinda place. Anywho, the staff was friendly, endearing, and welcoming. They have a wide selection of omelettes, benedicts, and lunch items. They also have many special items, and from what our server told us, they accommodate special requests since Mark has a knack for coming up with good eats. I got the Ultimate Benedict, which comes with prosciutto, tomato, spinach, and avocado over a croissant, with either regular or spicy hollandaise, I recommend you get the spicy because it's not spicy per se but it has this smoky full flavor that grows with each bite. What I love about this benedict is that it's layered on top of a croissant, so, the bread just soaks up the sauce and all the goodness. I also got a single stack pancake (which is the size of the plate, so, get one if you're getting it as a side), and they have toppings, so, our server's recommendation was to get the banana pecan, my friend got the banana pecan combined with the blueberry compote. It was all delicious, and I'm adding Mark's to my breakfast rotation. P.S. they have more than tabasco if you're looking for a spicy condiment, just ask. Happy eats!The restaurant is small, feels crowded and has a slightly grubby feel. On hotter days it can get warm inside too, despite the ceiling fans overhead. The breakfasts here though, are very tasty.We came here a little before 11 on a Saturday, and it was moderately busy, but there were still enough tables available that we didn't have to wait for a seat. The menu consists of breakfast and lunch, with signature egg benedict dishes, omelets, waffles, and sandwiches, just to name a few. I browsed through the benedict selections and decided on the Neptune benedict ($10.95), a Benedict with real crab meat (From a can). I ordered it with the spicy Hollandaise sauce for some extra kick. The delicate sweet flavor of the crab went well with the creamy, perfectly poached eggs and sauce, perched on top of an English muffin. I have to say, I was very impressed with the eggs they use. They are very fresh and high quality, as evidenced by the deep orange-yellow yolks. I also tried some of the chorizo waffle, a hefty meal of superbly seasoned chorizo with a large, lightly crisp waffle.Service was very friendly and attentive. Overall, a good place for breakfast.

Restaurant name  Cactus Moon Sports Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The owner's of Cactus Moon are self destructive morons.Friday nights have been developing a good country dance scene. Lots of people show up for a free lesson and dance afterwards. They have fun, buy food, drink, and have been telling friends how wonderful the place is (despite bad Yelp reviews). So, last Friday the owners waited until everybody arrived for the Friday dance -- and then announced that for now on they will only play hip-hop and top40. People that came here for their Friday night dance were furious -- and most of them stormed out.Count on at least 60 people to tell every one of their friends how callous and unfriendly Cactus Moon is. The owners could have made an announcement the previous week, so that people's night wouldn't be ruined, but that would have shown too much respect and consideration for their customers. CM owners wanted to be sure to let everyone there know that their loyal patronage isn't needed or even wanted.Oh, and the owners justified their actions by saying that dancers don't generate enough revenue. Of course it couldn't be that the food and service sucks!Businesses that treat customers with such disdain usually go out of business. The Phoenix market is just too competitive for idiots like this to survive. I cannot imagine that a bunch of oblivious young hip hoppers will save the day for CM, but we shall see what we see!Worst place!!!  Surprised has not been shut down yet. Servers are completely clueless, they ignore you and are more interested in talking to friends and having fun.  I asked for a cheese burger and the next question I was asked was; do you want cheese on that?  Even when the place is not busy you can walk in and sit at a table for nearly half an hour before a server even takes a drink order.  On top of that management does not know what they are doing either. Avoid this place at all costs as you will be very disappointed in the service, food, and simply the overall experience.

Restaurant name  Fat Moe's Pizza & Wings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
My boyfriend and I have been ordering (delivery) pizza and wings from here for about 5 months. The food is great! But their service is awful! We either are missing extras we requested or it takes 60 min+ for the food to arrive. (they are appx. a 1/2 mile away from us). I gotta say, if we didn't like their pizza so much, we would have dismissed this place a long time ago. (wrote this about  month ago)update: Ordered pizza and wings from them a week or two ago and the delivery guy showed up 2 hours after the pizza was ordered, after I had already spoken to the manager and he had offered to make a new pizza and wings if I came to pick it up. He also said they would credit my account $20 so the next time we got pizza and wings it would be free. today: Attempted to redeem my free pizza and wings and they guy on the phone said that we had a credit for 25% off our next order. I explained to him the situation and asked to speak to a manager. He said he would call me back. When he did, he offered a $15 minimum delivery and anything additional would be on us. HORRIBLE customer service. I'm not sure if they just have very consistent turn-over or what. But we are done trying to justify the food vs the service. I hope the owner reads this and does some serious hiring. So disappointing...

Restaurant name  Table 274
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Oh Table 274 - I'm so happy you're in Cotswold! With a focus on hard work, locally sourced ingredients, supporting local farmers and frankly, making really really delicious food, Table 274 is well on their way. The restaurant is nestled in the back of Cotswold shopping center (behind the toy store) and boasts an expansive space with plenty of tables and large bar area. I've also seen the bar menu - it looks pretty delicious.On to the food...I've been here twice now and here's what I've enjoyed....Italian sausage & sweet potato gnocchi (lunch item): 4.5/5: A really generous portion of practically perfect gnocchi. They make their gnocchi daily (no small feat) and this dish highlights them beautifully. It very sausage-y, so for those who dig a myriad of meat with delicious pasta, get this - you won't be disappointed. Strawberry shortcake: 5/5: Light, fresh and damn delicious. They have a fab pastry chef on board and it showwwwws! I shared the dessert with a friend but I could have easily taken it down myself. Fresh made rolls & honey butter: 4/5: I know it seems odd to comment directly on the bread but it was pretty great. Who doesn't love a fresh baked roll and honey butter? No one? That's right. Fig Prosciutto Flatbread: 3/5: Pretty much the only item I didn't love here. While the portion was generous, this flatbread lacked both prosciutto and cheese. It was super figgy and I was looking for more of the ying and yang w/the meat and cheese added to it. However, the peppery arugula on top was a lovely addition. Toasted gnocchi (appetizer): 5/5: Nabbed this dish before dinner and, again, the gnocchi was wonderful. My Italian grandma would love it. This dish features warm prosciutto, spring pea & carrot - even the veggies were nicely cooked, leaving a bit of a crunch. I would happily order this for a light dinner. I have no doubt that if Table 274 continues on their merry way that they'll earn a 5th star in no time. It's a great addition to Cotswold...get your nom on!

Review Text :
As the former owner of "In the Company of Thieves", I can tell you first hand that I did not put very much effort or passion into the business for the last 2 years of ownership.  Without giving personal detail's  I would like to express my regret in acting so poorly.  Many of the negative reviews will forever remind me of that regret.Moving forward, the best decision I made was to sell the shop to Gwen and Kyle Johnson.  They are doing a fantastic job with Johnson Public House.  The ambiance is inviting and the Barista's are all very friendly and well trained in the art.  The food menu is limited, but all very well prepared, and anyone that would expect a larger menu in such a place really doesn't understand the space and limitations that JPH is working with.They upgraded some permits to allow the cooking of eggs on premises.  When I owned Thieves I had to order eggs precooked for my breakfast sandwiches, which coming from a culinary background is downright embarrassing. I was skeptical at first with Intelligentsia being their sole coffee roaster, as I am a Kickapoo loyal, but I've been pleasantly surprised with the quality and consistency.  Again, it helps that the barista's are very well trained.  Along with excellent espresso drinks, they also specialize in pour overs, and individual french presses, which are right up my alley.     The beer and wine license they added is a huge plus to the Johnson st. hood, as don't really have too many other options to mellow out with a cold one, let alone a place with free WI-FI.All this new stuff is great, but by far the most important addition is their passion.  Unlike myself, Gwen and Kyle are in it for the long haul.  They are friendly, down to earth business owners, and a great big breath of fresh air for the Johnson street neighborhood.I wish them the best of luck, although I'm pretty sure they won't need it.Still a solid 5, but wish I could add a few more stars for standout service today!1. They were out of cold brew and typically (I think) don't keep much ice around, so after taking my order the lovely gent ran down the street to grab a bag in order to get their normal pour over method going with ice down below. He strained the ice out and poured the cooled at this point brew into a cup with new ice. It rawked. I want more. 2. Took with me a sammie to go and grabbed greens along side. This is so dorky but check it out: Greens were nicely placed in a recyclable cup w/ lid and the dressing was resting on top in it's own condiment cup. I dressed that puppy, capped it, shook, and boom, it was a little like being there minus the hip vibe and melting pot, no cornucopia of passerbys.

Review Text :
Ahhh, Waffallonia! The stuff dreams are made of!I had eagerly been awaiting the opening of Waffallonia for months, as I had heard they would be serving liege-style waffles. Having seen several glowing reviews about them throughout several publications, they were certainly hyped up quite a bit before I finally went. I finally made it out for a mini "Squirrel Hill Day" (aka "Diabetes Day" - a trip that consisted of Rita's, Waffallonia, and bubble tea) and indulged myself in some incredible Belgian dessert waffles. Waffallonia certainly lived up to the hype! Their waffles are slightly crispy on the outside, as they have a caramelized exterior and a soft, warm interior. I got a waffle with Biscoff and whipped cream - both of which slowly melted into the crevices (and into my heart!) Seeing as this was the first time I'd ever had Biscoff spread, I was INSTANTLY HOOKED. To this day, I go to Waffallonia on a regular basis just to buy a jar of the stuff.Only setback is that it's REALLY tiny with very few seats. Then again, I kind of find that sort of thing cozy and urban. Don't worry - the prices are decent and it never gets too crowded.Waffallonia is always a good idea. Now that the seasons have changed and the Schenley Plaza location is closed, I had to go to the Squirrel Hill store to get my fix. The shop is tiny and somehow manages to seat 6 at counters inside. Also at the shop they have ice cream that you can add to your waffle. The flavors for ice cream seemed amazing but I was there for one thing and one thing only: liege waffles. I settled on the monthly special which was a waffle with chocolate syrup, whipped cream and crushed candy cane.  Usually my son and I split a waffle with nutella but  we changed it up that day and the change was good.I finally made it to Waffallonia!  One of the only innovative dessert places in Pittsburgh, and it was delicious.  I wasn't expecting to love this place, but the hot waffles with toppings were so much more than I hoped and dreamed.I ordered the Namur Waffle ($4.80 with tax), which was bananas and nutella on a waffle.  One of the Squirrel Hill magazines also had a coupon for a free topping so I added some Speculoos ice cream ($2 value).  The waffles look so small, but they are actually the perfect portion and don't need to be any larger.  The actual waffles are really unique and delicious and would be good without toppings, really.If you can, eat the waffles at their little counter space.  They are the best hot.  Otherwise, they will package them to go.They take credit cards, and there is no minimum.

Review Text :
Son and I were headed to see a movie but being a bottomless pit teenager he was starving and in the mood for food, and Smash Burger was the place picked!Honestly, this was my 1st time at Smash Burger, so I was shocked it was fast food, I always figured it to be a sit down restaurant, idk where I get these ideas from.The menu is simple and easy to follow. I went with the Arizona Smash burger, mainly because I saw it had jalapenos on it, um YES please!  I also parried mine up with rosemary fries that to me sounded good.. My son ordered some chicken sandwich, when I heard it was chicken I lost interest, this boy just picked a burger place then ordered chicken smh, haha, and he got sweet potato fries.We found out seats and waited for the food.  Still not quite sure what he ordered, but it too had fresh slices of jalapenos on it, in which he turned to me and asked what exactly are those,,WHO IS THIS KID????? It's not his 1st time around jalapenos, must have been too hungry that his mind was slipping.The Arizona Smash burger had habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo & fresh sliced jalapenos and it looked great and the flavors were good too, but the bun was lacking, which to me, if you don't have a good bun, you don't have a good burger, also dangit!!!!! This is the 2nd place in 2 weeks that I have encounter shoe string fries!! WHAT IS THE FASCINATION WITH THESE FRIES?? They are not grown up fries, these were little bitty potatoes who aspired to be thick like steak fires but no got picked and fried when they were still so small haha.  They shouldn't be called fries, but other than it being shoe stringed, they had good flavor, even the sweet potato were all right.When we were finished, we went to dump our tray, and were quickly told, no no we got this. That was pretty cool I thought. Great customer service for a fast food type of place.

Restaurant name  Krazy Fish
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Krazy Fish (and More!) has been taunting me with delayed opening dates for a month or two now, but they are finally open and I must say, it was worth the wait.While the interior decor looks a bit like a performance art version of the mind of an unbalanced person with an aquatic fixation, the food is delicious. Get the tacos. Let me say that again good and slow so you wont miss it.GET. THE. TACOS.I've tried both the tempura shrimp and cuban chicken versions and both were delicious (though I'm partial to the shrimp, with a touch of the pepper oil that is on the tables). Neither was particularly spicy but the flavors were full and bright. I love that their slaw (which tops your protein) is not a mayo-y mess and the tortillas are fresh and fluffy. Tacos come with one side (all this for under $8). I am in love with their jalapeno cheddar grits souffle, to a ridiculous degree, but Jake's mac and cheese put up a strong argument and I look forward to measuring their squash casserole against Dish's.Yes, they serve other things besides tacos. There is shrimp and grits that is certainly on my to do list. There is pad thai. There is curry lemongrass tofu for the veggie crowd. They will even serve you up a quarter chicken, and I look forward to trying any or all of these dishes. But in the mean time (and who am I kidding, it will only be a matter of days before I stroll back) I am glad to have Krazy Fish as my new neighbor.Seriously strange, this place. From the Mad Scientist Acid Trip Under the Sea decor to the banana salsa to the...just...huge, newspaper sized menu, there are some really outta-the-norm things going on at Krazy Fish.And I gotta say, I likey.Things are messy - ya, there's brownie-filled orange cups for dessert for cheap, but they're overfilled, spilling out a bit. A salsa brought to the table in an icy squeeze bottle. A cold, intestinal coil of cheese grits solidifying while your sandwich is steaming hot. Water all over the bathroom floor. Corners, art to run into. Cilantro in everything, all hail the cheapest herb, garnish, chopped, springs tucked into your taco, sandwich, salsa, everywhere.It's almost, kind of a foodie joint, because anything, anywhere, on the menu, can be put in any burrito, any sammich, any taco. There are near-infinite combinations of flavor happening and not a lot of steering going on - a gruff rec by a waitress, that's about it - so it's easy to choose and end up with something freaky-not-good. OR (like moi) you could get jittery with excitement, anticipating what lemongrassy tofu, pickled jalapenos, and coconut curry could possibly taste like, and WHOA it kinda worked, even if it was a little sweet. Things are, here. Sugary. Riding that edge of too much. Not taking the plunge.Other options for veg's - tempura vegetables, potato cake. You can have a potato cake taco. Dare ya.House slaw is riskily weird, but good - toasted cumin, a little bitter, Indian flavors.There are like, 10 salsas. I even enjoyed the banana, sort of.It's beautiful that no one worried about foodie trendy BS when designing this space or menu. It's just all really Krazy, in an homage-to-East-Charlotte-ethnicity kinda way. Tacos, bolillos, banh mi, burritos (er, roti), viet, mex, thai, indo, chinese, whoa.Krazy Fish has been on my radar for quite some time. With crazy steel art festooned on their front patio and dive-y exterior, what more could you ask for in Plaza Midwood? This place is ridiculous. Landing directly on Central Ave, it's not too hard to miss their parking lot. Turn in right before Morningside. Made that mistake once....Glad to see that "Krazy" is first word in the name of this joint. Our server, Chad, was a freaking ray of sunshine. Hilarious and absolutely BLUNT. He had no problems telling us that some menu items were "dumb" if paired with others. He was jazzed to be there. What a great employee. He was fast, efficient and a great jokester. Mystery beer is interesting....$1 and you'll, most likely, get a crappy beer. Haha. Worth the $1 laugh it brought to our table. Bud Light with lime. GAG.Apps:Started out with the potato cakes. These things are awesome. Plenty of veggies and in a creamy curry-ish sauce. I would have mistaken them for falafel had I not been told. I was happy and so were my taste buds. Throw a little sriracha on these bag boys and you'll experience Krazy enlightenment. Entrees:My wife got a fried veggie burrito. This thing rivals the size of a Chipotle or Moe's burrito. Packed full of rice and tons of tasty veggies. Loved the sauce that the veggies were sautéed in. Welcomingly sweet and a came full circle with the rest of her plate. The grits on the side were so thick and creamy. I'd have a full plate on my next visit if it were an entree. Delicious. I tried the blackened tuna tacos. Holy crap. Pineapple salsa? I'd eat that on my foot. It was so good. Perky, cilantro-ey and so FRESH. I love every bit. Huge chunks of rare, seared tuna. The slaw, I'm pretty sure, is tossed in a bit of wasabi powder so it got dumped off my tacos lickity split. No offense. Just not a fan of wasabi. Got a side of the mac n' cheese per Chad's recommendation. So good. Soul food, meet Mexican. Be friends, I say. Sampled the blueberry salsa and the chipotle honey. Very interesting. Look forward to trying them on their respective dishes on our next visit. I'm happy to say Krazy Fish literally is crazy but absolutely intriguing. I can't wait to test more of the menu. Well done, ladies and gents. You've got something going here.

3/19/11After checking out the scene at Degree 270, my friend and I decided to end the evening w/ something sweet at Black Fig Bistro.  We both like chocolate and peanuts, and I'd had the opportunity to try the peanut butter and chocolate tart here a few times before, so I suggested we order this.  My friend LOVED this dessert! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-fig-bistro-scottsdale?select=S_oi-WhT5tat37ZKq79YjA#S_oi-WhT5tat37ZKq79YjA  We practically inhaled it, taking fast turns at the plate!  :)  I was already satisfied w/ my half of the pastry... or was it she w/ hers?  :P  In any case, we decided we'd try another-- a yellow cake w/ chocolate ganache and finished w/ chocolate and white chocolate curls.  Sounds good, doesn't it?  Well, it looked better than it tasted. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-fig-bistro-scottsdale?select=JjytWa_ggHvFBwRJk3TfOg#JjytWa_ggHvFBwRJk3TfOg  The cake was very dry, and the frosting wasn't as creamy, nor rich as we both wanted it to be.  The cute curlicues of chocolate weren't enough to save this pastry--  they tasted old, as if they've been in the fridge for too long.  I'd check out the other desserts, but not very late in the day!

Review Text :
Part of my Pizza Bender 2011 Edition, I stopped by this place and decided to give their 2 Slice special a try.  2 Slices of Cheese Pizza & a fountain drink for $5.....pretty good deal.  I added Sausage & Pepperoni for an additional $1 ($.50 per topping).The joint is decked out in Boston photos and memorabilia.....be prepared to get a talking to if you walk in here with other sports teams gear.  A guy with a Lakers hat was catching some guff from the owner.  It was all in good fun and they were both having fun talking a bit of trash about the other team.  Hilarious.After a few minutes my Pizza came out.  It's a thin Crust variety, very similar to NY Style.  I'm not calling it NY Style because it's a Boston Pizza joint.  The slices are pretty big and you have to fold it if you want to eat it with your hands.....I like it better that way.  The Pizza was pretty good....above average.  I thought the Sausage was much better than the Pepperoni.  The Pepperoni wasn't anything special.  The Cheese was gooey and had good flavor.  I didn't have to add anything to the Pizza, I enjoyed it as is.Overall, It's a pretty good Pizza.  If I could, I'd give it 3.75 Stars, but I'm rounding up here.Return Factor - 60%....would be higher if I lived nearby.More pizza please!!!!!We went to Bambino's not knowing what to expect and with open minds.  We are pizza lovers and are always looking for the next awesome slice to experience.  What we found was a fun Boston Pizzeria.  This means lots of Red Sox stuff and super yummy thin crust pizza.  It's a great time to be had!Let me just say, the Meat Lovers pizza from Bambino's blew our minds and we ate THE WHOLE THING in under 10 minutes.  10 minutes!!!!  I don't think we even stopped to take a breath between bites because it was so tasty!  We inhaled the awesome pizza because it was simply amazing.  It had flavorful pepperoni, ham, and some of the best sausage I have ever had, EVER!We also tried some yummy garlic knots, cheese sticks, chicken fingers (yes, I steal my baby girl's chicken fingers when she isn't looking), and fries. Oh and the zeppoles!  I have never had a zeppole and didn't know what to expect.  They are Italian style donuts and are one of the best things I have ever eaten dessert-wise.  They were hot fried dough, covered in powdered sugar and other fun spices and were finger licking good!  Everything we tried was delicious, came in a huge serving, and at a very good price.  How can you go wrong?It is a small joint, but it feels super homey.  The staff was always coming out to talk to us and make sure we were happy.  There was a lovely young lady, Stephanie, who was awesome!  I think she was about 13 and was on top of everyone in the restaurant.  She was running the counter and taking food orders, as well as being the welcoming committee.  She would even come out to play with my daughter from time to time, just to make sure she was enjoying lunch too!   It is a great mom & pop place and you feel so welcomed just walking in the door.  I wish Vegas had more places like this one!Every bite I took in Bambino's was delightful and I will be back for more!Finally decided to try this place few weeks ago and now I'm the duke lol... been going at least twice a week. Pizza by the slice can be difficult to find out here... especially at this quality. Love that it is around the corner from me and on my way home from work.But wait... didn't even get to the best part... they have sicilian pies! And they sell it by the slice as well. My new favorite sicilian in Vegas... also convenient that I can see the slices from the window as I pull up to see if they have sicilian lol... yes.. i'm that lazy.Anyway... give this place a shot and support local pizza places! So far everything I have had has been good and very fair priced. The staff is very friendly and the family that owns it recently moved to Vegas from Long Island. Looking forward to many more sicilian slices... now off to reheat one that's in my fridge :)New York style pizzeria?  Oh my!  Cesar Q. and I were out and about getting errands done and decided to make a stop by this great pizza place.  First off we have ordered take out from here one time before and loved the meatball calzone and chicken parm sub.  Today we actually came in and sat down for one of their lunch specials.  Normally we do all our takeout from 2 places close to home.  Villa Pizza being one of them.  This place has great food and great service!  While Villa tastes good their service leaves a lot to be desired (in my opinion).We arrived just as they were opening and received a welcome hello from the guy behind the counter.  We ordered my personal favorite of Chicken Francese.  It's served with a beverage, garlic knots and a side of pasta all for $9.  Not to shabby considering how much food you get.  Everything tasted great and exactly as one would expect.  They offer fresh parmesan cheese, none of that stuff in packets.  There is a soda fountain so you can refill your glass as often as you like.  The location is just off Durango and Sahara close to the 7-11 and next to the Subway.  This place has food that tastes as though grandma was in the kitchen cooking it herself!So happy we found a new Italian spot that has friendly EFFICIENTLY staff and reasonably priced  delivery too!

Review Text :
I was excited to check out Big Earl's (BE's), and finally convinced two co-workers to have lunch with me. We got to BE's around 2:00pm on a Wed, and where was only two other tables occupied. We were greeted promptly and shown to a tableWe placed our drink orders, and then put in our lunch request. I ordered pulled pork sammie, my friend ordered a brisket sammie. The food arrived and visually was good looking. We all ordered fries on the side, and they were cooked very nicely. Biting into the sammie, I was really surprised at the lack of flavor. It seemed more like a movie prop, rather then a BBQ sammie. I thought I would doctor it up by adding some sauce which is provided on the table (regular & spicy). The sauce had several problems. First, the consistency was very liquidy and does not have the thickness of traditional BBQ sauce. Sadly, the taste was also absent, and I was really, really puzzled. I switched it up to the spicy sauce, and found that to have the same consistency. I bit into the sammie and was once again really surprised at the lack of bite, flavor, and anything else you would expect.We ordered the cookie chipwiches dessert to go, and those were good when we had them later. One of my peers said "I wouldn't go back there for dry BBQ, but I would go there for dessert."I think this may be a case of BE's trying to be touristy friendly, and have food that is safe, and not too much flavor? The place is really cute inside, and they did a great job with the remodel. The staff was nice, and I really want this place to succeed. It is in a great location, and has TONS of promise, but something needs to be reworked here. Until then, my peers and I will have to pass on BE's, but it is worthy of another shot down the road.This place sucks!  Dry, re-heated, expensive food.I have tried this place twice, the first time I got the pulled pork sandwich and I was really disappointed. It was dry and flavorless. The sauce that they gave on the side tasted like pure vinegar. It was so disgusting that I threw the rest of the sandwich in the trash. It came with a large square of cornbread which somehow drier than the pork..you guessed it, in the trash it went. So far that's a $10 pork sandwich and cornbread in the garbage. I also got a little side of mac n cheese and baked beans (extra 2.99 a piece). The mac and cheese was dry and little more than shell pasta with some shredded cheddar on top, after a few bites I tossed it in the trash. The baked beans were ok...a little better than straight out of the can, and the slaw was ok. I'm not a slaw fan but their apple-cider/vinegar slaw was decent. I've had traditional Southeastern/Carolina slaw and this is pretty close. So after all of that, a pork sandwich with 2 sides, cornbread and slaw was over $16 and $13 of it went straight into the trash.I decided to give them one more shot. I thought maybe ribs and brisket are the way to go. I couldn't have been more wrong. I called ahead and ordered the "Pitmaster's Pick" which is a rib and brisket combo for $19.99. Unlike most other places I've been, this $20 meal does not include your choice of sides. So I decided to try the mac n cheese one more time for an additional $2.99. I was surprised that the guy on the phone said 5-10 minutes because I just ordered ribs and brisket which you can expect to wait on for a bit. Anyway when I got there I was surprised that on a carryout order I was charged a 10% carryout gratuity, and my food was waiting on me.The brisket was unlike any I've ever had, one huge hunk of mostly fat, the actual meat was tough and dry. It smelled smokey but I didn't taste any smoke. There was some kind of rub on there that was kind of chalky. The ribs were even worse, they were very tough and dry, they came sliced half-way between each bone and I still could not rip them apart. They had the same chalky rub type substance on there and a little bit of store bought sauce on top. I wont get into the mac n cheese and the corn bread because it was just as bad as before.After forcing me to tip on a carryout order my tab was just shy of $30. I salvaged what I could of the edible meat, and well I'm still hungry. So in 2 trips I have spent over $46 on just myself and I will never give them another dime of my money. Do yourself a favor and eat ANYWHERE else but here.You walk in and are greeted by ESPN on the tv, gypsy kings on the radio, and a BBQ restaurant that almost exclusively serves gourmet Mexican.  Talk about an identity crisis.  We wound up ordering Mexican and every dish was underwhelming and not worth the price tag.  They also charged our party of 6 a 20% gratuity to boot.  Guys, I recommend you go back to the drawing board and come up with a consistent concept.

Review Text :
One of the most enjoyable Sunday Brunches I've had to date. It's advertised as "Butler-Style Brunch" or, American Dim Sum, I was a bit confused by what they meant until it was explained to us. Small plates that are brought around to your table by the servers, and you pick what you want. My previous experience at La Cave was great, the outside patio option, and the view of the pool, plus the food was excellent, made me anxious to come try brunch. A little kink in the service, we did sit for awhile before being offered a drink, after someone had noticed, we were started out with bottomless mimosas ($20 extra on top of cost of brunch) but it did include a variety of drink options if mimosas aren't your thing.  They included; Bloody MaryCaipirinhaMargaritaMojitoSangria (white or red)MimosaI liked that you are able to switch them up.Table side items inlcuded:Heirloom Tomato and Mozzarella SaladChilled Tomato SoupFresh Fruit SaladYogurt Parfait with GranolaCornflake Crusted Brioche French ToastNY Style Egg SandwichScrambled EggsAngus Mini BurgersMushroom GritsBaked Potato Loaded Tater Tots w/ Brown GravyTomato Mozzarella FlatbreadChef's Selection Ham & Egg FlatbreadEggs Benedict with Chorizo, Canadian Bacon or FiletVeal Short Rib HashPancakes with Berry CompoteBacon and Chorizo Sausage CupsEverything we had was really good, but a few really stood out, I'm not a huge french toast lover, but the one served was by far the table favorite. I had 3 servings (don't judge, they're small). The mushroom grits and the Eggs Benedict Filet, oh and the Fresh Fruit Salad (sounds boring but it was outstanding) were  my favorites. I'm not sure if it was intentional, but we did wait quite awhile in between servings, not sure if this is to let you rest and digest before the next server comes around with items, but we did have to ask a few times for refills on our drinks and well as food. There seemed to be plenty of staff. Service wasn't bad enough to knock a star off, we really did enjoy our food. Already making plans to come back.I've been here for dinner many moons ago and it was a great experience. I went here for brunch for Easter and I'm glad I did. I think I enjoyed their brunch menu more than their dinner menu.For about $50, you can enjoy 16 butler-style table side items and for an additional $20, you get unlimited brunch cocktails (mimosa, sangria, Mojito, margarita, Bloody Mary, and caipiranha). About $30 for kids under 12. Servers with plates/trays of food go around the restaurant. We were sitting in front of the kitchen so, we always got first dibs on everything.Items we got just for the heck of it (non mind-blowing but expectations weren't set high in the first place):Heirloom Tomato and Mozzarella SaladFresh Fruit SaladScrambled EggsAngus Mini BurgerChorizo Sausage CupPancakes with Berry CompoteTomato Mozzarella FlatbreadVeal Short Rib HashWhat we enjoyed and ate the most:Cornflake Crusted Brioche French ToastMushroom Grits (I smelled truffles when the server passed by so, I had to have this!)Baked Potato Loaded Tater Tots with Brown Gravy (do you like Poutine?)Ham and Egg Flatbread (raw quail eggs)Eggs Benedict with Chorizo (one of the best eggs Benedict's I've ever consumed)Eggs Benedict with Filet (you can't go wrong with steak and eggs)This is supposed to be a leisurely dining experience so, if you have to be somewhere at a certain time, go somewhere else. I like my Lazy Sundays so this was an excellent choice. Laidback, no worries...just sit, eat, sip and enjoy life!This is my go-to Date location in Las Vegas. I think its the perfect first-date spot on the strip because of thr Tapas style dining. What could a better ice breaker be than talking about which food items you would like to share?Def order:Bacon Wrapped datesSangria Sliders FiletRequest:A table on the Patio. The view is simply amazing! The only downside is that it is slightly pricey. I haven't had a bill less than $150 after drinks/apps. The drinks in particular are super what adds up quickly. They are so tasty that you want to order them again and agian!La Cave is an alluring, quaint little restaurant within Wynn that was my second gastronomically-bookmarked stop in Las Vegas. It's a potentially dressy but not too dressy, intimate but not too intimate venue, with both indoor and outdoor seating. I enjoyed the ambiance within La Cave, especially the hammock swings, but the nonchalant attitude of our hostess and server put a bit of a damper on brunch.Jumbo lump crab lettuce cups with citrus segments:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-fnYvr2bthdzOn_LhMx8mA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)The lightness of this dish was very refreshing, but the straight-out-of-the-refrigerator coldness of the lump crab meat kept me from loving the preparation. The presentation, as shown on the picture, was also a bit lacking. I liked the acidic balance of the citrus segments, but I would have preferred they be sliced into smaller bits and interspersed throughout the crab.Kale salad:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ko9BBn19wVjVCnKSiKhqWA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)I love the taste of kale by itself, so it's very hard to go wrong with kale in my book. The fresh kale itself was tender and springy, but the dressing was deathly sweet. It was so sweet that I had trouble tasting the actual taste of kale, which was disappointing. As I'm allergic to apples, I requested that they come on the side (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=q2HJIqSFmGU7syb3UvF8NA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA). I would have also preferred that these be cut into thinner, smaller slices. Warm beet salad with goat cheese:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ZcU6FdfmQS_6Y76YjiMWkA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)This warm beet salad was probably my favorite dish of the meal, as the beets were cooked perfectly and cut into the perfect bite-sized cubes. There was a generous amount of melted goat cheese that was flavored well, and it was almost fondue-like how I was able to dip the beets into the goat cheese for a tasty morsel. The presentation was also adorable; this is a must-order for beet-lovers. Lamb shank atop bed of couscous:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Co3RQUf9w82XKO1zHQeScQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)The couscous was blatantly undercooked and underseasoned. The lamb shank was cooked well, but also a tad underseasoned, which I didn't mind because I like the natural taste of lamb. For someone who minded gaminess though, it may have been too much. It was an elegant dish that just fell a little short of the mark. Shrimp with piquillo peppers and fingerling potatoes:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=d1i5jsyqWYdq8xXTnrcQZw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)We added this dish on at the very end, so I'm not sure if it was because I was pretty full by the time it was served or if I was just not really that big a fan of it.. I liked the tangy citrus notes of the sauce, and the fingerling potatoes were cooked well, but there were maybe two total.. and they were cut into halves. The shrimp also just didn't have much of a shrimp taste, which is something that always bugs me: when food misses its nature-made taste.Bacon and quail egg flatbread:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=CJQ-fBIpDVVd-3El6GlF4Q&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)Out of the two flatbreads, this was definitely my favorite, and I'm usually not a fan of bacon (I know, I know). The huge chunks of fatty bacon were a bit more like ham in my book, and the runny quail eggs (more please!) somehow cut the heaviness of the meat and cheese. The perfect toastiness of the flatbread, with its crunchy outside and fluffy inside, set off the dish nicely. Fiery artichoke and pepperoncini flatbread:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=H9hg3GRikNP-ce7mAjuHNg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)The large portions of flatbread with glaring deficiencies of toppings made me immediately "meh," and the unimpressive flavors just reinforced that sentiment. I remember the pepperoncinis being very sour, but not much else. The flatbread was a tad overbaked compared to the previous one. I'm not sure if I would return to La Cave, as the price point was a little high for mediocre quality, and the small tapas-like plates tend to add up quickly. If I do, I'll definitely order the bacon and quail egg flatbread and warm beet salad again.The No1DP found this restaurant as a recommendation from the Encore concierge as a restaurant with portions and environment friendly for single travelers. Though it makes for the concierge to make a recommendation within the hotel, the No1DP had a nice meal out of it. When I joined him several days later he took me here on our first dinner date before the AWS re:Play party.LOCATION: One of the restaurants that line the Wynn Esplanade, the shopping strip inside the Wynn/Encore.We got to sit right next to the kitchen where all the hot items were grilled and the flatbreads were baked. We got to talk to one of the chefs and we witnessed how they prepared some of our food. - Diver Sea Scallops, Polenta Cake, Shrimp Sauce ($18). Medium-sized juicy scallop with an equal portion of polenta, which is easily becoming one of my favorite presentations of cornmeal. The small plate is deceptive that eating the entire plate could get a person full quite quickly.- Mushroom Grits, Pecorino ($10). Though not a lot of mushrooms it had full of mushroom flavor. It was also the most carb-heavy dish so I was able to get more full because of my portion of grits. It's served in a cask-iron skillet to keep it hot. - La Cave Caesar, Prosciutto, Lemon Anchovy Dressing ($11). Several stalks of lettuce doesn't make it a salad. It's essentially lettuce wrapped in prosciutto and served with a savory cream puff. It's a decent attempt at interpreting caesar salad as a small plate.- Prawns, Baby Corn, Long Beans, Chili Vinaigrette ($18). We got to see this made right in front of us from the grilling of shrimp to its final assembly of baby corn and long beans. This dish is meant to be eaten whole as the individual components are just average. Shrimps were a big portion.- Beef Filet, Caramelized Onions, Mushrooms, Blue Cheese Flatbread ($17). Our dining companion of the night offered me a slice of flatbread. The flour used is double zero, a high-quality flour used for making pastas and pizzas. I took a bite of the beef and it was soft yet packed with so much mushroom flavor. If the No1DP was used to eating beef he would certainly enjoy it. If dining for two flatbread can get you full quite quickly so we're glad in retrospect that we got non-flatbread dishes - it allowed us to try more small plates.Server was knowledgable in our requests of wine glasses for the night. No1DP enjoyed his white while I was happily sipping my light Pinot Noir. The place is definitely pricey (as is all Vegas establishments) but a reliably good restaurant for small plates.

Restaurant name  Greco Fresh Grille
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
My husband is Greek.  100% Greek.  As in, Easter means the family roasts a whole lamb on a spit. Uncle Dimitri will offer you the whole head of the lamb.  Meaning our wedding, yes was very similar to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, the movie.  AND...everyone's last name ends in OPOLOUS or ISIS. We know Greek food!  Greco Fresh Grille is the real deal, and like the name says, FRESH. GFG is bright and cheery inside, and immaculate.  There's a definite blue and white Greek theme going on-- but it's modern and fresh.  Most Greek restaurants, I'm sorry to say, don't serve real tzatziki sauce.  Most places use a cheap pre-made, preservatives-laden substitute, or they'll use sour cream.  (GROSS!  For sour cream, have Mexican food, mmmkay?) Not here.  You can tell the sauce is yogurt, you can tell someone has shredded cucumber into it, and the garlic is nice and strong.  Just how it should be. Another pet peeve of most Greek joints, is the gyros are made from a pre-molded mystery meat that just gets shaved off a spit to look like it's the real deal.  It's not greasy and Pepto-Bismol-inducing.  It tastes distinctly of lamb and spices. The gyro is moist, the pita nicely warmed on the flat top, and full of flavor.  The really friendly woman who served it to us, suggested keeping the foil on, and unwrapping like a present as you ate, so not to make a mess!My husband's lamb burger was delicious and unexpected.  Very clearly this was lamb, and it was served on a pita, not a bun.  Our only suggestion would be to season the patty itself more, and to include yogurt sauce with it. Instead of fries with our combo, we subbed salads-- not the traditional salads, but the shredded cabbage and arugula one. (The Lahano) It was crisp and refreshing.  I'd like to have seen more arugula, but bottom line, it was a very nice accompaniment. After we ate, my husband was in the mood for fries, after seeing someone else with a piping hot basket.  The lemon oregano fries are killer!  Think hot, fresh FIVE GUYS-like fries with the skins on...and freshly cut...except crispy on the outside and tender and fluffy on the inside.  Then add plenty of lemon juice for tart...salt and oregano...mmm, we ate it all!After overhearing another customer say "...since I had the hummus here, I can't eat the stuff at the supermarket..." we asked the cashier if she thought the hummus was good.  She said it was great, and gave us a small sample cup with two flavors, a traditional one and a roasted red pepper feta.  Alongside, were 4 mini pita wedges.  Again, super fresh. (I'm used to more tahini in mine, but I suppose this is different than Lebanese hummus.) The most rockin' way to end a meal...the galaktompoureko.  This is a traditional Greek dessert made of an eggy, custard, set with farina, between sheets of buttery phyllo.  HOLY MOLY don't tell my mother-in-law...but this is the best version I've ever had.  It's flavored with orange zest, and super light but creamy and milky....oh how to describe it.  Just give it a try.  If you like flan and rice pudding you'll like this. Bottom line, we were really impressed to find a Greek place that does things right.  They're owned by Greek people, and obviously hire good employees, because every single person we talked with was kind and helpful. My only wish, is there was a Greco Fresh closer to where I live!Finally ventured into this little Blakeney gem. My wife had been before and had great things to say so, needless to say, we were long overdue. Resting amongst more attractive and simple options for suburban folk, I'm happy to say Greco Fresh Grille is local-biz lover's haven. Small, shotgun setup on the inside and a handful of tables out back. The outdoor seating is great, but goes quite fast if it's a nice day. Get at it quick! Always nice to see filled tables at an off hour. Telltale sign this place is doing something right. Friendly service behind the counter. Welcoming and helpful. Here's our order: Got cups for water. They have pepsi products. (No hard feelings. I'm just a coke guy through and through. I'll make an exception for Cheerwine, however. Viva NC)Spinach Pie. To the Greek-savvy, Spanakopita. Amazing. The phyllo is perfectly crispy, flaky and crunches/dissolves with each bite. The spinach filling is savory and not too rich and creamy. Comes with 6 pieces, so perfect for a table of two. If you're sharing with more than two, you'll have to fight for more than one piece! I'd get this every time. My wife got the veggie gyro. Great mix of roasted red peppers, cucumber, red onion and great tzatziki. I'm a fan. The pita is thick and chewy, but not offensively so. I'd be hard pressed to shove a few pieces of the spinach pie in this bad boy! Loved all of the textures and flavors. Not overpowering and a great veggie option. I got the lamp gyro. Voted best in the QC by the Observer. I say rightfully so. Generous helping of lamb, balanced well with fresh veggies and, yet again, a nice slather of that great tzatziki. Each bite was great and I was only disappointed once it was gone. Prices are very reasonable. We ate for $20 and were happily full!Parking can be an issue, as there aren't many spaces directly in front of the shop. Not uncommon for Blakeney spots. I'd park over near the Starbucks. Can't wait to head back and stuff my face with more Greek food. Opa!Cheers.WOW WOW WOW!!!  This little hole in the wall is amazing!!  My best friends when I was a child were Orthodox Greek straight from the islands and one of my best friends now is Greek and she and her Mother make AWESOME Greek food.   With all of that being said, I'm a major Greek food snob and I have unreasonably high standards, as a result.  I have been to dozens of Greek restaurants over the years and a handful from Charlotte, NC to Columbia, SC and, hands-down...Greco is far superior to any other that I have been to.  The freshness of the ingredients, the flavors and seasonings, and the quality of the meat is just like my Greek friends have made me accustomed to.I visited Greco for a late lunch.  Even at 2:00 on a weekday, there were several people in their enjoying their meals and more coming in as I was waiting.  The decor is unpretentious and captures the essence of Greece beautifully.  It has a bit of a Greek Diner feel, which I LOVE!  The service was fast and friendly and I enjoyed watching the chef  (owner, maybe??) prepare my food..."FRESH' is the key word in the title here.  I watched intently and everything was homemade (Tzatziki, Greek dressing, Lamb patties, etc).I ordered the Lamb Gyro combo with Lemon and Oregano Fries and a Peasant Salad.  The lamb patties for the Gyro are made onsite with fresh lamb and the most perfect Greek Lamb seasoning blend.  It's cooked on the grill-top to order (not made from greasy pre-fab mounds kept warm on a a spit).  This is real deal!!  The meat was moist, tender, and delicious!  It was served with housemade Tzatziki and tomato on a warm pita (I asked them to hold the onions).  The Tzatziki is made with yogurt, fresh shredded cucumbers, fresh herbs, and TONS of garlic....it's a flavor sensation!   The fries...OMG, the fries!!!  The most incredible seasoned fries I have ever tasted.  Tastes like traditional Greek Potatoes, but in french fry form (brilliant marketing move, BTW...everyone loves french fries!!).  French fries are fresh cut with skins, fried crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle and then they are tossed in a bowl with salt, lemon juice, and oregano.  I will have dreams about these fries!  LOL   Last, but not least, is the Peasant Salad.  The Peasant Salad is everything that you love about a traditional Greek salad, minus the lettuce.  Giant wedges of plump red tomatoes, thinly sliced red onion, sliced seedless cucumbers (with the skin on), Kalamata Olives, and big cubes of deliciously salty and tangy feta cheese.  Again, all of the ingredients are put into a bowl and hand-tossed with Greek dressing and an extra dash of seasoning.  Salad is served with warm pita wedges.   It was a fantastic salad and the serving was huge!  Salads can also be topped with their house-marinated Chicken or Shrimp or their yummy Lamb.  They also have a Vegetarian Pita made with Red Peppers, Eggplant, and Zucchini and a kids menu.  They also offer Whole Wheat Pitas for a mere .25 charge.Prices are excellent as well.  I paid $15.00 (Gyro combo with Fries and a Drink and a full-sized Peasant Salad) and I made two meals out of it!  BTW, the Fries reheat perfectly in the oven!  If you are looking for heavy Greek dishes such as Pasticio, Baked Fish, or Leg of Lamb, this isn't the place.  If you are looking for delicious Greek quick dishes, this is a must-try!I can't wait to go back with my husband....he is going to love it!!!   I must try the Spanikopita next time!I have a new favorite lunch place!!Update Oct 8, 2012: I have been back 3-4 times since my original review and the 5-star rating still stands!  The service is always excellent and the ingredients are always very fresh.  My Husband, Son, and Mother have also eaten here with me and they love it, too.  I truly can't say enough about the house-made Gyro meat...it is moist and perfectly seasoned every time!   We have also tried the Spanikopita and it is very good, too!  This is "the" place for Gyros!

The food is a solid OK, but nothing more than that. The portions are good, a little too big for me but good for someone with an average appetite I guess. I'm rating them 3 stars because it's close to home, they have adequate seating, parking in a lot, and the prices are reasonable. I don't understand why the eggs on the Eggs Benedict are soft-cooked and not a runny poached as is traditional though...I suppose you should ask for that specifically if it's a deal breaker. On the other hand, I love their Raisin Apple Rave which is french toast made from raisin bread with caramelized apples and wouldn't change a thing about it.Overall, solid and better than any other breakfast chain restaurant.

Review Text :
I am writing this review 1 month after eating a 5 star breakfast at Sugar Factory because I wanted to see how long this meal would haunt me....the answer? It still does. When I wake in the morning I still dream of having the same breakfast I had here....and then I do the math and realize that if I left now, I wouldn't get there till lunch or dinner anyway....sigh. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Applewood Smoked Bacon instead of Canadian Bacon. It was the most delicious breakfast I have ever had. The flavors were perfect and the bacon melted in my mouth. The poached eggs are atop a bed of scalloped potatoes....mmmmmmm. The mimosa on the side was a perfect beverage and the icing on the cake. I am actually thinking of staying at Paris again, just so I could be sleeping above the kitchen that made this breakfast....and if you have read my review on the Paris Hotel, you would know how much of a sacrifice that is. If you have a Harrah's card you get a discount on your meals here, so I recommend stopping by the players club which is steps from the Sugar Factory, inside the casino. I also recommend their Happy Hour at the bar. The drinks are dazzling, but way over priced unless you are there for HH. The drinks are buy 1 get one free at that time which is a life savor when the drinks are $16-$24 a piece. Of course the $24 drinks are about a 1/2 gallon of sugary-sweet alcohol concoction, so make sure you are walking back to your hotel.So here are the highlights:- this place is open 24/7- they have an expansive and interesting cocktail menu inspired by your most favorite sweet candies- the terrace seating has a great view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip for people watchingWe had a late dinner here after watching a show and the huzbeau and I shared a french dip sammy which our server kindly split into separate plates.  It came with fries that were nice and crispy and the sammy was not bad.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw?select=dTGLNYS7_gZszDoRvzSW-QAlso shared the french onion soup - more notable than the sandwich, I remember the crouton and broth tasting pretty good.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw?select=QRBqJAV-0AN9Ke9SWAcQBwThe couple that was with us shared their banana split waffle which they enjoyed.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw?select=P5br39xhOBQfhQCoNLYF3g  I had a bubble gum cocktail which was pretty to look at but not as strong as it was pricey. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw?userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJgNice, dark decor and fitting to be part of the beautiful Paris hotel.  But you know what?  I dont' know what it is but I'm not exactly pining to come back.  Just A-ok for me.You know...it sure takes a lot for me to give a 1-star review; that being said, this is my first one in almost 50 reviews. Sugar Factory "American Brasserie," you let me down so hard. After careful consideration, this was probably one of the Top 5 Worst Dining Experiences I've Ever Had (future Yelp list, anyone?) I'm all about eating well and paying a high price for it-- especially in Vegas-- but, after eating here, I wished that my dining partner, David, and I just went to a normal cafe or even McDonald's on the way back to our resort.  I'm typically lenient with this type of fare, but our foul experience is just beyond my comprehension.Granted, we came in here very late. Around 4:00 AM. However, the restaurant was still busy and seemed well-staffed. The menu looked appealing enough, so we were sat immediately for a table for two. We were just desperate for some supposedly decent food (Yelp here had it at 3.5 stars, cumulatively...what the hell). Waited a while for water...okay. Waited a while to order...okay. Now, never to see our waiter again. Well, correction: we saw our waiter, but he never came within a 15 foot radius of our table. Cool, thanks.The lone highlight of this disaster: we waited under 30 minutes for food. It never should have taken this long to begin with, but whatever. I had just a simple burger. How hard is that, right? I could barely stomach half of it. I'm pretty confident that the bun was made back when the Paris resort was actually built...completely inedible. I took the bun off eventually and even the rest just wasn't good. I know that's not descriptive, but I was just turned off by it. Seemed almost as old as the bun and I've had better cheese and bacon toppings at a Denny's. Now, the worst: David had their basic chicken sandwich. This made my burger look like a star. The grilled chicken was probably rolled around the Strip like some hockey puck, picked back up, grilled into oblivion, then smashed between the same, nasty bun. He had a quarter of it, tried to just eat the meat, and couldn't. The waitstaff couldn't come by quick enough to scoop it up, not once asking our opinion.Ohh, it gets BETTER. We couldn't get our check. I mean, really, REALLY couldn't get our check. Our waiter was still M.I.A., the other members of the waitstaff were snobby and just kept saying "K" to us, like they were 6th grade girls. Never in my life have I considered getting up and walking out, but it kept running through my mind in the TWENTY minutes we waited for our damn piece of paper stating the damage. Well, well. Still no check. The manager comes by and asks us how things were. David didn't say much. ...But I did. Every detail of our atrocious meal escaped my mouth like word vomit (+5 bonus points if you catch that reference). He seemed a bit surprised, and loosely apologized; and, instead of comping our meal (the right thing to do if he had any hope of having repeat customers), he said he would fetch our check. UM, NO.  He came back and dropped off our check with a 20% discount. Normally, fine. But this was just ridiculous. Never, EVER again. The Sugar Factory Brasserie attempted to emulate that of a high-class, Vegas restaurant...and miserably failed. I would never come here again even if I was paid; there are so many other better options in this fabulous city.IF you are thinking of going to Serendipity DO NOT, come here instead.If you like the Cheesecake factory you will like this place.With 3 major differences:  1) they have a wide selection of crepes which I suggest the ratatouille crepe as it's fab and priced right at $13 2) they have a plethora of sugary sweet stuff that are served in glasses and called one of my favorite words "martini"3) they have breakfast everyday of the week till like 1 or somethingIt's located on the strip, there's an outside dining option, and there's typically a small wait.Also, the Bloody Mary's are deliciously devine, so if you need a big girl cocktail that's my suggestion.  This place is also Kid approved in my book!  It's also very loud and the bar tends to get backed up, so it will take you longer than you would like for your cocktail, so order that right away!Another CES show, another new place to try for breakfast.  I decided to try the Sugar Factory for breakfast and I'm glad I did.I had looked over the menu online before going, but I still looked again and was torn among three or so items.  I ordered the chocolate French toast which the menu described as dark chocolate stuffed brioche, strawberries, and chocolate syrup.  My server, Mariela, asked if I wanted maple syrup or chocolate syrup.  Hell, in for a penny in for a pound--I'll take the chocolate syrup.  She then asked, dark, light, or white chocolate.  I went with the dark.The breakfast was not long in coming but it was long enough that I could enjoy watching the tourists think sitting on the patio was OK for this cold morning.  I also watched as the fountains at the Bellagio just shot upwards steadily for about 2 minutes.  The crew were out there doing maintenance.The French toast was delightful.  It was a small portion, but for something this rich, that's exactly what you want!  I found myself breaking a small piece of brioche off and dipping the bread into the chocolate sauce.  Dessert for breakfast!  That's the way to go!Service was OK but it could have been better.  It wasn't until I was done with my French toast that I was asked about more coffee.  Considering how few people there were this morning, Mariela should have checked back with me long before this to see how things were and offer more coffee sooner.  Still, I rate the breakfast 4 stars because it was great tasting, the people watching was good, and it was a good choice to go here.Edit:  I asked when the check was brought if they give Total Rewards credit for the cost of the bill.  They don't, but if you give them your card, they'll give you a 20% discount off your entrée.Let me start by saying that this is all based on our waiter, Sloan.My friend and I came here for lunch one day, at a time when the restaurant was not in any means full- maybe like four tables were occupied. Let's get the pros out of the way, since there were only a few:PROS- We both got the veggie burger, which was fantastic. It is made with real veggies and on a bun that is purple. PURPLE! And tastes great. For dessert we got the crepes (Nutella and Smores) and they too were very delicious. But, not even this great feast was enough to make up for crappy service and lackluster surroundings.CONS- Who came up with the idea to cover every inch in tables and chairs, and in such a way that even Janga would be shamed? Seriously, not only was there no room (and I cringe at the idea of how it really would have been with a lot of people in there) but our table was lopsided, and kept rocking back and forth. The hostess who sat us even knew it- she moved it around a bit and said it would be fine. No. It was not.Next up prices; yeah whatever, it's expensive. I get that. 100$ for lunch for two.Now for the main one star review: Sloan, our waiter. Yeah, I remember his name. He was that bad. The first sign was the fact that we waited 20 minutes for our food to come out, and when it did, the person (who was not our waiter but some random chick) just dropped them off and ran away. Literally ran away. That's ok. Not like I was going to ask for ketchup. Oh wait, I was. So I waited for our actual waiter to come over so I could ask for some sauce. Ten minutes later out of the hole of hell he came up and I started with "Could I get some ranch...." and he turned to walk away. My friend had to yell 'wait' for him to return since she too wanted sauce.Next up, after eating and ordering dessert we waited another 20 minutes, all the while our dinner plates were in front of us and never cleared. Not until the crepes came out did our waiter walk over and clear it off. Finally, the wait time for the check was ridiculous. Not only had we been there for an hour and half already, we had to wait even longer for Sloan to notice us.And where was Sloan this entire time? I shit you not, speaking to the bartender. THE ENTIRE TIME. Seriously? You only have like three tables to take care of and you stand around and talk with a bartender for the entire day? My friend had to wave him over to get a check, and even THEN we were forced to wait until he picked it up from the table- SINCE HE WAS RIGHT BACK WITH THE BARTENDER!Not one person who works here seems to care about anything but standing around and talking to one another- there were plenty of other workers there, but I never saw one, NOT ONE doing anything. Well, except for the only other waitress there, who was actually doing her job. But she was the only one.I don't ever expect to come back, at least not at the same time since that seems to be the shift where all the lazies are put on.Hubby and I decided to stop here to have a drink and share a dessert after having dinner somewhere else. I have really wanted to try this place for a while, but it was not what I had hoped. I ordered a "Banana Mango Margarita" priced at $16 and it came garnished with a few banana gummies. The drink tasted good and I liked the banana sugar that rimmed the drink, but the banana gummies were so rock hard that they couldn't be eaten. Bummer. Hubby ordered a "Reese's Martini" also priced at $16 and it was rimmed with peanut butter. I tried a couple drinks and thought it looked much better than it tasted. We ordered the "Sugar Factory Fondue" priced at $21.95 and was disappointed. You can choose white, milk or dark chocolate and we decided to go with the milk chocolate fondue. It came with gummy bears, homemade marshmallows, white chocolate bread, brownie bites, strawberries and bananas. The gummy bears were so hard like the banana gummies that we didn't bother with them. The homemade marshmallows and strawberries and bananas were actually good, but the bread and brownie bites were dry and bland. We sat near a window so the Bellagio water show made for a nice view. Our server was nice, but our total including tax was $60.86 and that is just way too much for 2 cocktails and 1 dessert that were nothing special. I came, I tried, I doubt I will be back if I am picking where to eat.So because Britney Spears licked one of their lollipops this place can tax the hell out of people? Everything on the menu is overpriced. We ordered a couple drinks both at $16 each and they were tiny. The fondue we had for dessert came out with very few things for the price and most of it was either dry, had no flavor or was stale tasting. Not worth $60 or purchasing a groupon. OH and I saw pretty Christmas lights of blue and red while here. Cops pulled up right along LV Blvd and their lights suddenly turned the inside of Sugar Factory into a night club. As long as it's an episode of COPS I'm not in we are good. I wanted to start playing "bad boys" from my phone. Once the po's took off the place turned back into what it was supposed to be. Overpriced and boring. On the plus side we were seated by a window where we could see the water show at Bellagio.First: the CNF charge on the bill, aka "Concession & Franchise Fee" which we couldn't seem to get a straight answer about what exactly we were paying for... appeared to be a 3.5% charged on the bill (which, for our large party was a substantial surprise), and is supposedly related to fees charged to venues by the casinos they're attached to, sort of a surcharge for a restaurant having a prime location. According to my research (and thank you Anthony Curtis), there are very few places in Vegas that do this, and Sugar Factory was one of, if not THE, first to do this. This fee was not disclosed to us and I did not even notice it on the bill until another person pointed it out. The waiter, who provided fair service, could not explain it to us so he asked an associate to try to explain. She couldn't explain it either so we asked for a manager. A very nonchalant 'manager' (at least I think he was a manager, as he didn't introduce himself or formally state his position) said the disclaimer didn't make it onto their new menus. He said the tax was 4.75% (huh? 3.5%, 4.75% which is it?) added on separately so they wouldn't have to raise the prices of their dishes. And that it was "normal" because Cabo Wabo down the street charges it too. Did we ask about Cabo Wabo? Is there value in what we're paying for? No and no. We asked if there was anything he could do for us, as this started as a happy family gathering but at the end of the dinner we all sat around talking about this BS fee and feeling very dissatisfied. He did not care about our level of dissatisfaction, would not credit anything, not even give us a coupon for a future visit, or a free dessert (which I can see why, as their sundae is $49.95).Sugar Factory at Paris, we hope you're listening to your customers, because not only have you made a party of 8 unhappy customers, each of us and ALL of our social media connections are hearing us too. Trip Advisor, Twitter, Facebook...All you had to do was make us happy customers when we were there. Why is that so hard for you to do?Second: the lighting kept going from blinding-bright, to dark-are-we-having-a-blackout.Third: the food? I don't even remember. We were so upset about the customer service. Oh yes, they brought with our bill a little dish of complimentary yogurt covered mini pretzels: 4... for a party of 8.As stupid as this may sound, I went back to this place the following day for breakfast after a mediocre dinner.  I have to say that this location will not substitute anything.  They do not want to be bothered with any variations in their menu. I ordered the egg white scramble with crispy fries.  Unfortunately, the fries were not crispy.  The bacon was very average and did not taste like the applewood smoked bacon they claimed it was.  I ordered a banana but French toast. It was actually a slice of banana nut bread topped with some fruit and whipped cream (about $15).  I tried a few bites and pushed it aside. On a good note, they do serve Peet's Coffee and it was delicious. This place could be so much better, but they really don't care, IMHO.  I wanted to try it for myself and now I have. Too many other places to spend your dollars without all the heartache and grief.Came here with my cousins for a goblet. We were directed to sit at the high tables when we informed the front desk that we just wanted drinks. BAD IDEA. Our server ended up practically ignoring us the whole time. What should have been a 30 minute experience turned out to be an hour long due to the amount of time we had to wait for our server.So, if you want better service, take an actual seat. -_-Anyways, the Lollipop Passion goblet was absolutely yummy. I don't typically drink alcohol, but barely tasted it in this. (Maybe there's not much in there?!) We also ordered the Upside Down Pineapple Cake, which was very yummy paired with the vanilla gelato it comes with.I'm mostly removing my stars because of the service. And when I checked my credit card bill a couple days after, I noticed that my written tip was rounded up. It might not be a lot of money added onto my bill, but I'm annoyed that such a move was pulled. Shady.Went here on a Saturday afternoon for brunch for a bachelorette/bachelor lunch gathering. While we weren't able to sit in the same area, we were able to make two separate reservations for about 20 people each for a 1pm time slot. Parties of 30 or more will have to do some expensive buffet arrangement. We just wanted food. After a night of going out, the need for food was real. With such a large party, our food took a little while longer but once it arrived, it hit the spot. I ordered the Signature Burger and a side of fries, with a beef patty, tomatoes, cheese, and fried onion straws. Not healthy at all, but it's Vegas! Not a place known for healthy lifestyles.  Looking around the table, everyone's portions were HUGE. Club sandwiches piled high with turkey, a grilled cheese BLT with TWO grilled cheeses. I definitely took half of the burger home for a snack later on. With their prices though, it made sense to have big portions. Extremely over priced, but expected. Especially on their drinks. While the drinks were tasty and fun to drink, very expensive for the volume and quality you got.With a large party, would go here again. Solid selection for lunch, a good amount of space to fit big parties, and central on the strip.

First order (February 2013): I picked up a Russo's special which was topped with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers and onions.  The pizza was mediocre all the way and we were in no rush to order from here again.  Second order (September 2013): We had last minute guests coming over to watch the Sunday afternoon football games.  Since this is the closest pizza to my house, I gave it another shot and ordered a large sausage mushroom for pickup.  This pizza was actually pretty great.  Even our guests thought so and I was pleasantly surprised.  I couldn't believe this was the same place to be honest.  Third order (November 2013): An old buddy living in Boston was raving about chicken parm sandwiches around the Fenway area.  So that got me thinking to the last time I had a great chicken parm sub which was probably when Clinton was president.  I bit the bullet and got one to go.  Although the bread was decent, the chicken was bland and under seasoned as was the tomato sauce.  It was pretty blah overall.  The sub came with a small side of potato salad that was FROZEN.  My initial thought was that the crunch in my mouth was celery but it was ice!  Nice!  I called to inform them of this and the cashier simply just said "Sorry."  The owner called me 3 minutes later to apologize again.  He said there was something wrong with his fridge, everything froze over and blamed his cook for not noticing.I'll probably end up ordering from here again due to proximity but will drive that extra few miles to get pizza elsewhere for sure.  I wonder how many pizza chefs they have?  Maybe I need to obtain their shift schedule.Just okay for pizza and salads- cheese slice is $2.50, crust is perfectly thin and crispy but sauce was on the bland side. The Greek salad has scant non-lettuce ingredients and no protein for $10 but an incredible dressing- it's called a house italian, but it's a creamy version that tastes like a really good Caesar. Another table got a $16 steamed mussels special that looked to be a small portion, but the great garlic fragrance was enough to make me rethink my selections. Overall I feel like it's a bit overpriced for what you get.The space is small, walk-up style but dining in is nicer than you'd think- there's also a large TV tuned to sports above the counter and individual flat screen TVs at some of the booths.

Review Text :
Update. Tonight the owner of this place saw my hubby and I at a Thai place and remembered us apparently. Thought it was funny after 8 months she recalled my bad review even called it entertaining. And paid our bill for dinner and added 10 straws. Guess she misses us!!!!!   Thanks for the dinner Rebecca. until today I would of given this place 3 to 4 stars, I liked that it was a local business. My husband and I went to this spot once a week for almost a year now, even made this the place to go to start my 40th birthday. despite having to send my food back once and getting the wrong drink once or twice I came back and chalked that up to basic mistakes.Today the owner came out of left field on me using 2 straws and that it was costing her a lot of money and as a business owner I should respect her and only use 1 straw. my hubby even joked ok we will go to Dunkin Donuts then and she said you should. At first I thought she was kidding, but she wasnt. Really you would rather loose 2 loyal customers who come to you and have recommended you to others over 2 extra straws per week? if that hits your bottom line.. I am totally schocked at this and will NEVER go back now. Too bad Iove supporting local companies and such but apparently you would rather have the 2 cents than the 20 to 40 we spend there a week plus tipping your staff.If you go to the place and spend hundreds of $$$ over the course of a couple years......don't expect more the $5 off your second bottle on Tuesday.........even if the online ad doesn't mention that....And if  you complain.......you will be thrown out and police called.PatheticVery. Rude. Owner.Enough said.1 star is being generous after our last experience here.  Cant say enough great things about the bartender Josh, and servers Rachel and Darcy.... Its too bad that we wont get to experience their services because of the owner.  The owner may know how to light up an open sign, hire great employees, and set a great atmosphere... but she lacks class and needs to know what customer service stands for.  Im all about supporting small business and local businesses at that... but I will not support a classless piece of trash.  We were regulars there bringing in friends family and referring this place to anyone we could.  I will never go there again and dont think it is appropriate to treat customers the way she did us.  Not only did she eavesdrop on our quiet conversation, but then she butts in to tell us that we are being rude talking about how we disagree about her not advertising that only the 1st bottle is half off wine night but fails to tell us until after we have ordered 2 bottles.  Common courtesy would have been to tell us that the 2nd bottle is only $5  off when we ordered the 2nd bottle.... not wait til we question later and she wants to point to the menu stating the fine print says otherwise.  Im sorry, but i didnt look at a menu to look for the fine print when i see your Half off bottle wine night posted all over facebook.  But besides the fact,  after the disagreement, she proceeds to tell us that if we dont like it, we can leave.  Fair enough.....  let us finish our wine we bought and we will never be back.  She then threatens to call the cops if we dont leave that moment.  Unnecessary!  we werent causing a scene.  She made the scene on her own.  I will take my group of 7 that visits there 2-3 times a week and support another business.   In an economy like today, a business owner like herself should really take a step back and see where she will be if she continues to treat loyal customers and/or new customers like she did us.  I work with small business owners on a daily basis,,, and they arent successful by treating their customers rudely.  She should take this feedback as a gift.Lovely night!!! Perfect weather outside now, and you have the option of inside the cafe or outside in their lovely patio!! We picked the patio area, open aired, and not noisy at all, being that it's close to the street. Great customer service!! A++_ Delicious food, we ordered the Mango Shrimp!! Oh soo delightful with well proportioned mango squares, avocado, cilantro and lime!!! YUM!! ** Oh and we also went with the Tuesday special, which was Bruschetta and your pick of Wine, for the Bruschetta, you can pick three and we chose, the Fresh Mozzarella + Basil + Tomato, also the Brie + Apples + Honey and the famous Prosciutto + Mascarpone + Figs + Honey!!! OH SOO YUM!! An explosion of full flavors inside your mouth, everything from sweet to sour!!!  :) What a Great Combo, as for wine, we went with their ever soo fruity New Age, Torrentes!! Which was indeed a great pick!!! Fully satisfied!!! :)If you are a) in a hurry or b) claustrophobic, just turn around. Turn around now and RUN. You will be sitting close enough to hear the wisdom of neighboring randoms in love with the sound of their own voice. (A favorite quote from the next table: "If you want to be CEO, you gotta get your MBA.")You will wait. A long time. A disproportionately long time. Your server is super friendly and kind, but harried and unapologetic, even when shrimp end up in your dinner uninvited. ("Oh, oops, good thing you're not allergic to shellfish.......... are you?")The wine and beer list? Meh. Abbreviated.The menu? Bruschetta, salads, light sandwiches: your typical wine bar fare.So why in the eff is the place so successful? Location, location, location. What would be average in Arcadia is novel and exciting in 85028. Really. There is nothing else like it in this part of the valley and for that it wins. Its patio is big, decor is cute, food is decent, and it is god damn chic and exciting if you are used to Applebee's. So why does 32 SHEA garner four generous stars? BECAUSE THE NUTELLA MARTINI IS PROOF THAT GOD EXISTS. Pure. Genius.Oh i hate to do this, (food and drink quality is still good). 32 has been my favorite spot for awhile now for coffee.  Now where do i start on my new review... I struggled between 2 or 3 stars, but i am being biased and letting them live with the 3 instead.I haven't been to 32 in 2 weeks, and decided to stop by and get some drinks with my wife. When we get there it is all new people working there, that is a little depressing. I will reminisce that the first baristas i met here have been hands down my favorite and none have filled the shoes they left.Back to my experience.. I have my loyalty card with one punch left. That means my wife and I only need to pay for one of our drinks! Yay! Sounds like my day is going pretty well. The next event was waiting for this girl who was just tinkering on the Ipad to get done and greet us and get our orders. We order or drinks, and she says "I can't give you your free drink."I was just honestly confused and stunned so i didn't say anything.girl-"You are doing this in one purchase right?me-"yes...." at this point in my head i am thinking...WHAT!?!? it has NEVER been like that..for the 3 or so years i have been coming here it has NEVER been like that...girl-"well you can do it in two transactions"me- "yeah do that." ... at this point to prevent me from being over involved in this conversation i flip open my phone and wait for her to figure this all outThe girl turns to the person working on the bar and asks some question about the situation. YAY it's the manager working at the bar, finally a familiar face. She was as confused as i was about the situation.girl- "well i don't want to give them a double discount, a punch in the card and a free drink"At this point i just space out because this is the most ridiculousness i have heard. NO WHERE does that,  or acts like that...let alone in front of a customer. Granted i did not say anything else and just got my drink and left. WOW...i just don't even want to express how sad this is for me that 32 is starting to be one of "THOSE" placesAfter a busy morning and playdate at Imagination Avenue, my friend Jane B and our two almost two year olds had worked up quite an appetite... We wanted a quick lunch before their naptime, so logically, we checked Yelp for nearby lunch spots.  We didn't have to look far as 32 Shea is literally right across the parking lot... we decided to check it out and we were both very impressed.  32 Shea is a tiny little gem of a restaurant  on the corner of (you guessed it) 32nd Street and Shea.  It's colorful on the outside and inside both literally and figuratively... the staff couldn't have been friendlier - and that's even with 2 toddler boys making a mess as Jane and I tried to order and scarf our food down.We each had "the chop" salad and shared two muffins with the boys.  The salads were fresh and a good portion size, and the muffins were delicious... (we had a carrot muffin and a raspberry muffin).  They actually tasted more like cupcakes, so I don't know how healthy they were, but I'll tell myself they were healthy ;)The menu has plenty more to choose from as well:  all kinds of coffee drinks, smoothies, breakfast including egg sandwiches, burritos and oatmeal (served until noon), lunch and even dinner!  It sounds like at night the place becomes more loungey with candle light and table service (as opposed to the order at the counter style they have during the day).  I'll have to check that out!32 Shea reminded both of us of the type of cafe you'd find in a more urban environment like NYC or perhaps even Europe.  The building used to be a drive-thru photo mat and was then transformed to another restaurant before the current owners took it over in 2011.  They've done a fabulous job with it, and it still has a working drive-thru and a nice patio too.I have one request of the owners: please get some lemonade on the menu!  I wanted an Arnold Palmer but was told you don't have lemonade, so that is something I'd suggest.  Other than that, it looks like you've got something for everyone and I can't wait to return to try more from the menu!It was an uncommonly rainy night when I met a friend here for dinner and drinks so the patio area was closed.  I was sad that I couldn't enjoy the patio because it was honestly the one thing that really drew me in from the photos I saw here from other yelpers.  The interior was as packed as a small place this could be.  At this point I'm a little unsure about staying, no patio and tight quarters. The staff was immediately very happy to see me and showed no signs they were at all put out by the weather.  I ordred a beer and the pizza of the day.  The waitress tried to tell me what was on the pizza of the day but I really wanted to be surprised so I asked her to stop.  All she got out was "it's called black and blue".  I was told the beer I wanted wasn't in stock or going to be carried anymore so I said surprise me with a random beer that is similar.  They brought me one of my favorites so I was very happy with their choice.  The pizza took a lot longer to come out than I would have expected but I really didn't mind.  The atmosphere was so comfortable that had I not looked at the time I wouldn't have realized so much of it had passed.  The pizza was great, I had fun figuring out why they called it Black and Blue and the waitress asked me if I had figured it out.  The blue cheese flavor wasn't overpowering nor was the blackened steak.  It was a very well balanced flavor over all and I enjoyed every bite.I'm sure I'll be back so I can explore more of their menu and hopefully try out the patio area.I was a little disappointed, I have been asking the organizer of my twins mom group to do a night out at this place.  Finally, she sets the date.  My husband was going to be out of town, so I had the nanny come, since I didn't want to miss it, this place being my suggestion.  I got there on time as usual, so I was the first one.  I asked the lady inside if we had a spot reserved since we were a group, and she confirmed and told me I would be seating outside in a minute.I sat down on the bench outside to wait to be directed to my table.  Five minutes later a couple arrived and went inside.  What do you know, the server was guiding them to a table outside.  That was a little rude, but I decided to just walk myself to the table.  My friend who organized the event got in just then, and I had only one menu for me.  The server again, said she would be right back.  I ended up going in and grabbing another menu. By the way, there were only 2 other tables with customers besides ours.  Not really a happening night, it was St. Patty's day after all, so people where drinking somewhere else.  We ordered our drinks.  They are really good.  A few other friends arrived and again we were struggling to get her attention and more menus.  One of the ladies ended up going inside to order her drink, she said the server was rude to her inside also.  We ordered a few bruschetta.  Mine was pretty good, but I wish it would have been a better experience."Let's have coffee!" Amanda B. said.So I got there early. I hooked myself up to super fast wi-fi. I cursed myself for having stuffed myself already as the menu looked delicious. After hugs were shared I watched enviously as Amanda returned to the table with wine. At lunch time.Apparently Happy Hour is a twelve hour thing.TWELVE HOURS.Did you hear me?(Dine in only. This is stipulated on the menu. Who tries to take HH to go? Apparently SOME PEOPLE. 32 Shea does have a drive thru.)So from 6AM to 6PM folks can enjoy the following:$4 bottled craft beer$5 wine, mimosa, bloody mary$6 martinis, cocktailsAND then (!) they have a 2-hr munchie hour4pm-6pm (again, dine in only kids)$3 bruschetta$5 munchie menu (which they put on the chalk board)See here's the thing. If you're a writer, this place is dangerous. You'd never get a damn thing done. You'd show up bright and early for breakfast (which is served until noon), enjoy coffee, move onto a smoothie and then lunch. (The green smoothie is *excellent*.) At some point a beve would make sense, right? And then, well, it's drinking time?This is an adorable cozy space. You will fall in love with it. Oops! I got all sorts of excited and left something out. You place your order up front at the cashier and food is brought to you. Tables are cleared for you. I took a menu to keep in my car. YES, I did that. This place isn't in my neck of the woods. However, I cannot wait to grab food the next opportunity I'm up here again!UPDATE: While you're here be sure to try the New Mexican burrito. The green salsa is to die for. (I'm hoping they start selling this to go soon.) Garlic, jalapeños, cilantro, tomatoes, onion, and some other heaven. I can't remember what else Rebecca, the super cool owner, described with zest. She's currently sporting purple short hair. All the employes rock. There's a punky and fun vibe going on here. Good times :)I love Shea 32 for the amazing patio and laid back vibe. I was surprised to find this little gem in a half empty strip mall at the edge of a residential neighborhood. I have now been there a number of times- both for lunch and dinner- and have liked everything I tried. They have a killer sandwich called the OMG that I just can't get enough of - figs, prosciutto, mascarpone and honey on perfectly chewy ciabatta. For dinner they have excellent Bruschetta as well as revolving daily specials and an excellent wine selection. This is the perfect place for a romantic dinner outside on the Patio in the cooler months.I have tried so hard to support this place, but honestly its not working for me.The owner has some real attitude and its challenging to support.Once I was in there and she started to push my table back telling me rudely I needed to "move in" to make room for others. Another time , I received the incorrect drink order and she told me it was because I ordered it wrong.I was in yesterday and ordered my kids the nutella mocha....the barrista was so swamped filling both in house and drive through orders that she forgot entirely to put the "nutella" in their drinks. Zero consistency here.Don't even bother to order the juice smoothy, its just Costco juice blended over ice. Erroneously they list all of the ingredients in the Costco juice...making you think you are getting actual vegetables....32nd st café..calling you out on this one.The owner also likes to rave about how much money she is making, so clearly, short changing customers is the way to go.

Review Text :
I came here on a random moment after leaving the club, since my guy friends asked if I wanted to eat. After dancing my butt off for a few hours, you work this appetite, but I wasn't that hungry. I decided to meet up with them anyways, since good company is always nice to be around.The Henry is right across from this performance bar called BOND. They had some loud house music bumpin' and I asked the hostess if she could seat us somewhere that we can hear each other and the music isn't ringing in our ears. She walked me over to this Huge round booth that could fit a large party of six. I asked her if she was sure this is okay, since I didn't want to occupy a table when it's only three of us. She told me, since it's a slow night, it's fine and this is the only table that is the farthest from the music. It was nice and comfy. I do love the decor of The Henry, being it's open 24hours.. this place looks ravishing! A lot of warmth in this place from the colors. The men ordered some "healthy" egg whites omelets and even though I didn't try any.. I'm sure it was good, since they finished everything. I love when a man has a great appetite and isn't afraid to try new things. It makes the whole dining experience much more enjoyable and you actually have a bigger appetite yourself. That was the case with me this night. I asked the server what he thought was the highlight of this place for late night dining. He suggested many, but the Cinnamon French Toast he mentioned was the one I was curious about and I haven't had that in a long time.. So that was my pick of the night.The food came out shortly after and when I saw my dish.. I was already beaming with joy. Not only did it smell good.. It looked So delicious! Now this isn't your regular French Toast you make or order at IHOP or something. It was enormous for the size and thickness of the bread.. Lovely :) Even the maple syrup tasted yummy!!! I poured some on top of the toast and took the first bite... Sky rocket of flavor! Perfect perfect perfectly made French Toast. The texture from the thickness of the bread was unbelievably addicting.. so light, fluffy, soft, and had the most amazing flavor! The four thick slices of bread are dipped in french vanilla custard and I swear it was divine. Simply put... you could be having the best dessert/breakfast of your life. It tasted like candy, but in a good way.. not too sweet, but you have this happy smile in your tummy that candy sometimes give you.. yes that kind of feeling. Then the texture makes you want more and more and... I love eating the corners of this toast... when you try this.. you'll get what I mean ;) It also had candied pecans and creamery butter to finish off this brilliant breakfast creation. I loved it. If I ever wanted French Toast again and by the way... I Love French Toast. This place would be my #1 spot. It was SO good. I shared a few pieces with my guy friend and he loved this dish too. I thought he wouldn't want any since he works out hard and all, but with this dish I had.. he didn't care at all. He even said.. it's so good!!! Every time I asked him if he wanted another bite... he just opened his mouth without Any hesitation :P The plate was shining clean. Remember when I said I wasn't really that hungry... well after tasting this Cinnamon French Toast.. I magically became starving for another bite!!! Crazy I know!?!! This Cinnamon French Toast is the best to satisfy any hunger anytime in your day... Breakfast, lunch, or late night eats. So happy I came here and caught up with my friends. The BEST!!!Henry, oh Henry. Long line at the popular Pizzeria at the Cosmopolitan hotel?My friends decided to split up to order food at a couple places. Do you like how we multitask in getting crazy amounts of food?2 bitter champagne cocktails + 1 spinach artichoke dip = $50+Service was non-existent, yet rushed. The waitress kept asking if we were done with the menus when we did not even give her the order.My friend had a to-go box from another restaurant, and they threw it away. When we asked about it, they defensively replied, "IT'S NOT OUR FAULT."1 extra star because they open late and they let us eat our outside food (cosmo pizza) inside the restaurant.The Henry is a great spot to go for a late night dining spot.  The big plus is that it's 24 hours so you can come here anytime during the day.I came knowing about their French Dip sandwich and Truffle Tots because so many folks have ordered it and posted pics of it on yelp.  So when I came there for a late night munch fest, it was a no-brainer that that would be what I would order.French Dip -- tender prime rib, melted swiss cheese, horseradish sauce & au juswith truffle tater tots http://bit.ly/11JiTeYThis definitely hit the spot, especially at 1am in the morning!  A nice heavy portion of hot beef and cheese and then able to soak it all in to the au jus was just great comfort food all around!  And the Truffle Tots just made it even more epic!The Henry has definitely made my rotation of places to eat at any time of the day.  Their late night and breakfast menus are pretty solid and I would most definitely come back again.Considering The Cosmopolitan is the newest resort on the Strip, it's not surprising that nearly every aspect of the hotel is so trendy and nice.  However, it's still pretty surprising that even their 24-hour diner/cafe looks great.  Definitely nicer than some random Denny's or IHOP!Unlike the vast majority of Cosmo''s restaurants and eateries, The Henry is located on the ground floor (by the entrance closest to the Bellagio) as opposed to the second and third floors.  Despite being so close to the casino though, it's pretty cool how the restaurant isn't at all loud or smokey.  Although there seemed to be a decent sized crowd waiting to be seated, it only took about 10-15 minutes to get a table for brunch on a Sunday.While I normally would have opted for an actual brunch type of dish, I decided instead to go with the CORNED BEEF REUBEN with a side of Truffle Tater Tots based on what others had mentioned on Yelp.  The dish sounded pretty good, but to be honest, the truffle tater tots was what got me excited.  It's a combination of two fantastic things!As far as portions go, the reuben was certainly a winner - the sandwich was practically bursting open.  However, I don't think it tasted as amazing as how others have described.  I certainly appreciated all that meat, but the abundance of sauerkraut was very overwhelming (think sauerkraut with corned beef rather than corned beef with sauerkraut).  Conversely, the tater tots were just as good as I had hoped.  They could have been a little crispier, but that's a minor quibble.  I just wish there had been more!Even though the service was good enough for me to round up from THREE AND A HALF STARS, I'm rounding down specifically because of price.  The reuben wasn't awful at $16, but $5.00 for a diet coke?  That's ridiculous, even by Vegas standards.  Next time, I'll just stick with a cup of water and get my diet coke comped at the tables..After another decadent Vegas night, I wasn't about to be up at the crack of dawn for some breakfast and there was no way in heck I was going to drive to dine at a ill mom n pop place despite high recommendations by my reliable Yelp buddies. I'm just too tired, too lazy and too dang hungry and nobody got time for that!So I end up rolling out of bed at 12:00pm, brush my teeth and hobble down stairs for some much needed grub.  Just when I'm about to exit the hotel, what do I see? The Henry. Right across from Bond at the strip entrance. They serve a limited breakfast menu all day, I don't need to leave my hotel so that sounds good to me! The wait for a seat was a tolerable 5-10 minutes, and our server Billy, was energetic and friendly, albeit it on the frazzled side but he kept our coffees topped off and waters full, which was fine by meHe served up my coffee in a jiffy and since they proudly serve Illy, they get extra points!We had to wait a bit for our food but it came out piping out and delicious! I highly recommend the breakfast burrito. This beast was packed with all sorts of good stuff: melts cheese crispy potatoes fluffy scrambled eggs and a side of zesty salsa and cool sour cream. We built our own burger with avocado cheddar and caramelized onions. I ordered a medium rare patty and it came out medium, no biggie. Oh but those truffle Tate tots were a plus! They were crunchy and had the most irresistible truffle aroma despite me immersing them in loads of ketchup! YumBoth dishes were quite substantial so we decided to forgo dessert. We charged the bill to the room (hello identity points) and we were out of there in record time. Thanks Henry, you're the perfect cure for a Vegas hangover Happy Eats!The French Kiss is a must if you are going to come here, it is a cocktail drink consisting of Ford's gin, st. Germaine liqueur, rose syrup, and prosecco. Just the perfect strength when mixed here, and it is just delicious. What I usually love to get from here is the Reuben, you will never find a better Reuben than at Henry's! Always nice and friendly service, a highly recommended place to grab a bite all day and night!Honestly, I have no idea why this rating is so low. We stayed in the Cosmo recently, on a girls trip, and we ate here 2 of the 3 days, the other group of girls ate here 3 of the 3 days for our breakfast meal.Their Dill/Cucumber smashed Bloody Mary is to die for!!!  Their coffee is divine. The service was great both times AND there was little to no wait times to eat!The first day 2 girls ordered the Short Rib Benedict- Hot Damn is that good!  It was so good, in fact, they wanted it AGAIN the next day and sure as shit they both ordered it AGAIN!!!!!  But truly the most AMAZING THING is their Gruyere cheese hashbrown cake of LOVE. I actually thought it was a Risotto cake at first, but BY GOD IS THAT GOOD!  It's hashbrowns, onions, and cheese in a latkes style hashbrown circle of mouth watering, tongue tingling DELECTABLENESS. Need I say more?  Don't even think of not getting this thing. It's so good other people did without fries or tater tots; which by the way, they have as well, to get this as their side item instead. It can't be good for you, but by golly is it good!I got a burger the 2nd day as it was 11 o'clock on Saturday and they had a brunch menu, it was delicious as well.I would eat here again and again! I'd be 500 lbs but I would do it!The Henry inside the Cosmopolitan is a 24/7 diner with lounge and table seating. Great for late night snacks but nothing extraordinary for sure. If you're hanging out at Vesper or any of the Cosmo bars around, The Henry is probably your best choice to grab a bite.The menu has everything from burgers, chicken wings, salads... you name it. Average pricing (burger $12) but kinda slow service.Our table got the FRENCH ONION SOUP ($12) and the CHICKEN FINGERS W/ FRIES ($15) which tasted as expected. The soup was a good value though.Would come back if everything else fails.After arriving in Las Vegas, I was absolutely famished and didn't want to travel far for breakfast.  The Henry has a prime location at the Cosmo -- which happened to be where I was staying -- and fit the bill nicely.  Almost every hotel-casino in Vegas has at least one 24-hour diner-type restaurant, The Henry is Cosmo's version.  And since it's the Cosmo, it's shiny and gorgeous to look at, with abundant chandeliers and glittery surfaces (natch).  It's located right off the casino floor, across from the Bond bar. (Watch your head, since selfie stick-wielding tourists are everywhere.  I may or may not have been smacked by one.)  The place was quite busy on a Friday morning, but there was plenty of room at the bar, where the full menu is available.  I ordered a whole grain waffle with a side of chicken apple sausage.  The waffle was extremely delicious and even somewhat healthy, thanks to the abundant yogurt and fresh strawberries.  Unfortunately, the chicken apple sausage wasn't nearly as good -- it tasted slimy, like it had been sitting in the fridge for too long.I washed down my breakfast with a much-needed cappucino, which was quite tasty.  I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but getting through a day on the Las Vegas Strip always seems to require that extra jolt of energy.Another plus about The Henry: very friendly staff.  I've found that most Strip restaurants have a cold or stand-offish staff with major chips on their shoulders, but not here.  They make their customers feel at home.  That's reason enough to come back!I have had The Henry bookmarked for a long time because of the much raved about French Dip. I finally knocked the bookmark off this past week. It was about 11 pm when we arrived and the hostess seated us right away. We were put into a corner that left us no elbow room, so hubby asked the hostess if we could move to a different spot. She moved us to a half booth and half table. That didn't end up much better at first, but we moved the table around a bit so we had room and it turned out fine. Our server was nice however we did have to flag him down for drink refills. French Dip ($18) - Shaved prime rib, Swiss cheese and au jus on a French roll. I asked for the horseradish sauce to be left off. This also came with my choice of a few different sides and I chose the Truffle Tater Tots. The sandwich was not as great as I has hoped for. If you look at other pictures of yelp of this sandwich you will see there is a lot more meat in those ones compared to mine. The prime rib was tender, but lacked a lot of flavor. The bread was stiff even after dipping it into the au jus. The tater tots were nothing special and I tasted nothing truffle whatsoever. The total was $50 including tax (before tip) for just 2 sandwiches, 2 sides and 2 sodas. I wasn't impressed and have experienced better at other places both on and off the strip, so I can't see coming back.I hoped for a far better meal coming from a restaurant inside the Cosmo. Seating sucks depending where you get put. I ordered The Henry Burger and it comes with mushrooms, caramelized onions and cheddar cheese however I had the shrooms left off. The bun was toasted and hard and the burger was dry. Just because a burger is big doesn't mean it's going to taste good. The onions were in abundance and and the cheese was good and since there was a decent amount of cheese it helped me get the dry burger and bun down. It came with a side of fries that were actually cooked perfect. I had no issue inhaling the fries. I did have a problem with a $18 burger that wasn't great let alone wasn't even good and $5 for soda is a complete rip off. Service was okay but I wish I didn't have to wait as long as I did for drink refills.

This place is brand spanking new, serving up the culinary delights of Northeast China/Manchuria. The meat patty in fried pastry is absolutely to die for. They come 3 in an order and I saw people order it for lunch and wolf down all three in one sitting. The pastry is pan fried and the meat is somehow miraculously bathed in a savory soup. When you take a bite, the soup gushes out and overwhelms you, very much XLB style (Xiao Lung Bao). The dumplings, pot stickers, and hand pulled noodle soups are also quite good, as well as the noodle in the dark thick peanutty sauce. The ladies working there are pleasant and friendly. The restaurant is commendable for its cleanliness.This place totally rocks and I recommend you all flash mob this place to keep it alive and well, serving up goodies for years to come.I am excited about this place, even though I have not had many opps to try northern style Chinese food.  Think dough, and don't mistakenly believe it's the same dough steam/cooked/fried/stuffed in different ways.  The kind owner lady proudly told me each of our 3 dishes was made w/ a unique dough recipe... At first I was worried all the dough would overpower my tastebuds, until I asked for some dipping sauce... they kindly made me a black vinegar, ginger, and scallion sauce... that just upleveled everything.  Who knows if it's traditional or not, but I implored the owner to start dishing this out when Americans like me (smiley face) come over and eat.The off-menu items are written on a small whiteboard sitting atop the freezer stuffed w/ to-go dumplings... luckily the folks there speak English, so I'll be working my way thru this secret menu and who knows.. this might go 5 stars!SW corner of Ray and Alma School, next to the JCC.My mom picked this place for her birthday lunch.  We drove 50 mins (1 way).  It was a little place stuck in a strip mall.  We were greeted right away.  The staff was super friendly.  Before we ordered, the server brought waters and these yellow soups.  I have never seen yellow soup before, so like a little kid, MOM - What is this???  She told me it was a corn congee-like soup.  It was tasteless but then I found it you put sugar it in.  Ah, I just I am a Northern Style Chinese food newbie.  Since I have no idea, I left it up to my parents to order the food.  Beef Pies - Excellent!!!  Very tasty and yummy.Pork Potstickers -  Freshly made and cooked.  These are very good.  But found out Northern style, you do not use soy sauce for dipping sauce.  Vinegar is the thing.Green Onion Pancakes -  It was fresh but the layers of dough were not there.  OK.Fried Beef Bun - These are actually steamed.  Doughy but good.Lamb Skewers - My family inhaled them.  And said it was great.  Spicy Pork Intestines Stir Fry - Again my family ate it and said it was good.  I am the only person in my family that is not that brave.  1 con:  It was super HOT!  I was sweating the entire lunch.  Please turn on the AC!If someone tells you that you are the ginger vinegar to their xiaolongbao, marry them.  Sooo... instead of listening to my fellow Yelpers, I took some blind advice given on Instagram and ended up getting an unsatisfying meal.We had ordered the Green Onion Pancake [103], The Pork Soup Dumplings/Xiaolongbaos (XLB) [111], the Pickled Vegetable with Pig Intestine Clay Pot [39], and the Sweet & Sour Fish [86].  I had completely forgot to order the Beef Pie, which is apparently juicier/saucier and more flavorful, much to my disappointment.  Anyways, what I really wanted were the XLB and they were decent!  Everything is handmade and the skins on these babies were tender and delicate.  Sadly, it was so delicate that three out of seven of the soup dumplings had been punctured and spilled its soup before we could even pick them up to eat.  The ones with the soup didn't have much soup but they were pretty good.  My companion's dish, the pickled veggies with intestines in a clay pot, was flavorful and the intestines were thankfully clean.  Ain't nobody got time for particles-filled intestines!  The onion pancake and the sweet & sour fish were lacking luster.  The onion pancake lacked any flavor or seasoning and the fish dish came out soggy.  It was such a bummer! The service can be pretty slow since it's a really popular joint that's much too small.  There was a line out the door!  Halfway through our meal, we were asked to relocated to a booth so we can give our table up to a single lonely diner which I understand but it was kind of a drag to walk across the restaurant balancing your purse, jacket, and plate.  I never did get a water refill either.  All in all, I think I'd come back for the XLB and to try their Beef Pies [get your mind outta the gutter!].

Organic yumminess! The chicken pressed quesadilla is the best quesadilla I've had in a LONG time :)The ingredients were fresh & tasty! It came with 2 dips, a salsa (not my fav) & a chipoltle sour cream (my fav!!!). If I could have gotten away with licking the little container, I totally would have, lol. The location is cute but small. Get there early if you want to sit & eat. Also, there are a few tables outside, so dress for a picnic ;)

I was disappointed when the little BBQ place that once occupied this space closed, and I was perplexed when I noticed that a new Mexican restaurant was opening up in its place. A Roberto's had recently opened up in the same small shopping center. Why would they choose to set up shop so close to the competition? As it turns out, Roberto's is no competition at all. My boyfriend and I decided to check out this new shop and see if the menu looked any good. We had a back up plan... "If the menu sucks, we'll go to Roberto's." We walked up, and checked out the menu through the window (I hate walking into small businesses, making eye contact with the prideful business owner, and walking out. I feel bad, REALLY bad.). All it took was two words and the boyfriend was sold, wet burrito. I had already seen a few things that looked tasty including some fresh salads, fajitas, quesadillas, tacos, nachos, and combo plates. In we went. We were greeted by a super friendly guy who was all smiles. He had a great energy, and I could tell he was passionate about the food. Upon further inspection of the menu, we discovered something so sinful and amazing that we agreed that there was no way we were getting out of there without giving it a try... Fries. Fries? Yes. Fries. Fries covered in cheese, beans, cream, guacamole, and Mexican salsa with your choice of chicken, steak, or shrimp. YUM! The final order was a wet steak burrito for him, a dry steak burrito for me, and an order of steak fries. I knew it was going to be a ton of food, but I had no idea what was in store for us. The food and two regular drinks came to about $25.00. It might seem kind of pricey, but the fries were NOT an appetizer. They were a meal for two by themselves. After placing our order, he immediately got to work preparing our food. The kitchen was very clean, and everything was prepared fresh to order. I swear that there was nearly an entire cow on the grill. There was that much beef. As he was cooking, we carried on a conversation. I asked how business was going and he said, "Everyday it gets better. It's been three weeks, and we're doing good." He also shared that there was another location near the Boulevard Mall that has been open for 11 years. Then I asked the dreaded question, "Is Roberto's giving you guys some competition?" His reply was a simple, "No," followed by a big smile. I said, "So your food is THAT good huh?" Again, he smiled and nodded. The food was indeed THAT good. The steak fries came out first, and we immediately got to work devouring the delicious mountain of yummy goodness. After our burritos arrived, we moved to the outdoor seating. I will be honest. I never made it to the burrito, but my boyfriend did, and he says it was delicious. He asked me what night of the week should be Rivas night, so we are already planning on becoming regulars. I had to go in and ask for boxes to go, and I can't wait until lunch tomorrow when I will get to try my burrito.

Review Text :
Yes, Marjele's has made it to Old Town. Yes, this is the same Marjele's that you have probably been to before a sporting event in Downtown Phoenix, but this is Marjele's with the Old Town twist. That means, this is Marjele's; Scottsdale edition. However, so far it's doing pretty good in my book! Old Town lacks good sports bars and the ones they have fill up within 20 minutes on the day or night of a big game. So with that, I was pleased to hear that Marjele's gave us another sports bar option. I visited for the first time several weeks ago. Marjele's might have been open all of three days so we decided to check it out. Prior to going, we called to see if there was a chance they accepted reservations. And guess what? They did! Now, I don't know if this will last forever, but at the time, they took a reservation (I hope it stays like that!) The staffer on the phone was extremely polite and friendly when I talked to them. We arrived as one of the games was ending and before the next one started. The sports bar was jam packed so they didn't have our table yet, but they were extremely apologetic and got us one as soon as the first one opened up. So for that, they get a point for customer service. The scene: Considering this is a sports bar, I'm not shocked to say that this place was packed with men. All men. There might have been all of 15 girls in the bar when we were there. I assume this will change over time as girls realize that the ratio is in their favor. There is a nice long patio and then room inside with several tables and high tops, two bars and a standing area. TVs surround the entire bar, just like in the Downtown location. I think this Marjele's is bigger than the Downtown location, but it's a toss up. Now, like I said above, this one is definitely Scottsdaled up. At night, it's dark and "sceney" but it's still not bad yet. We'll see how long they keep it as a chill sports bar, especially since it's by PCL and now next door to the new El Hefe. I think this is a good option to watch a game or to visit on a night you want to go out in Old Town. The food: thumbs up in my book! This is generic bar food but decent bar food. The wings have a spicy kick to them. For my meal, I got the buffalo chicken wrap. It was tasty and tangy with a twist. The sandwich filled me up and unlike some other sports bars around town, I would be ok with eating here again. But again, remember...this is just sports bar food so don't walk into Marjel's expecting fine dining. Expect beers and fried food and you'll be set. So in conclusion, check out Marjele's if you're up for being out in Old Town, you're ok with running into the Old Town crowd, you want to watch a game at a place that will be crowded and social and you want to enjoy some food and drinks along the way...served by friendly staff of course!This place has so much potential but it's inconsistent customer service prevents it from being a top notch joint.  We come here every weekend to watch college football games.  The food is decent for a sports bar.  Over the course of the season I've had:Gorilla Wings - $9Basket of Fries - $3.50Fully Loaded Pizza (Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Onions, Black Olives, Mozzarella, Parmesan and Cheddar) - $12Italian Panini - Genoa Salami, Pepperoni, Ham, Provolone, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Vinaigrette, on Sourdough Bread) - $9.50Buffalo Chicken Wrap - $9.50Chicken Quesadilla - $9.50Yes, the prices are a bit high...but you're in Old Town Scottsdale, where prices are high everywhere.  During the football season, pints of domestic draft Beer are cheap so it makes up for the food pricing.The food quality is mediocre.  By far my favorite items are the Italian Panini and the Gorilla Wings served with Maniac Sauce, which is pretty hot.  The Chicken Quesadilla is ~meh~, a bit soggy and doesn't have much flavor.Where they really fall short is their inconsistent service.  When they're not busy (during ASU home games) the service is great.  However, when they're busy (ASU road games) the staff is overloaded and can't handle large crowds.  I think it's because they hire young, inexperienced kids who have an attitude.  On at least 3 occasions I've been told "I'm real busy right now, I'll come get your order when I can" or "I don't know, ask someone else, too busy right now"....come on!They'll never change because being in Old Town, they'll always have the business and don't have to worry about repeat, loyal customers.  If my friends didn't come here every week, we wouldn't come here as often as we do.Return Factor - a begrudging 80%, 30% if we didn't meet up here to watch college football

Review Text :
Island Style Restaurant #2 is located in the food court of the Greenland Supermarket and they hail from the original Island Style restaurant on West Sahara.The Mom and I headed to Greenland for lunch and did a tour to check out each place to see what interested us.  They shouted their wares and specials, hoping to hook us in.  Island Style was our last stop, and for some reason, the Mom was more interested in what they had to offer.She was eyeing the Bibimbap for $7.95, and I mentioned that the Husband likes that dish too, but with the stone pot version.  We inquired and found out their Dolsat Bibimbap was $8.95.  (She wasn't very familiar with the dish.)  As I pondered what to get, an order of fried dumplings were placed in front of us for another customer.  The Mom was immediately impressed by it and the smart guy at the counter pointed out that you get the dumplings for free if your order was $20 or more.  Of course, that easily sold us and we added the Kalbi Plate ($12.95) to our lunch to get that order of dumplings!We took a seat nearby and waited for our order.  The order of 10 dumplings were ready first, and they do usually go for $5.95.  It was piping hot and we loved the extra crispy texture.  It was filled with pork and noodles.  Two banchan were given to us as well - kim chee daikon and kim chee cabbage.The Dolsot Bibimbap came with a side of soup, and it was definitely a generous portion.  We ate as much as we could and packed the leftovers.The Kalbi Plate came with mac salad and rice, and I enjoyed the tasty beef - lots of flavor indeed.  We also had leftovers of this dish too.The Husband ended up getting all the leftovers for lunch today and he was a bit skeptical about the bibimbap (sans the hot pot).  However, upon arriving home this evening, he proclaimed that the bibimbap was very good and the kalbi tasted really good for leftovers.  Overall, sounds like everyone was happy with Island Style - and they make for good leftovers too! Aloha Promotion: Free soda with meal (mandu and spam musubi excluded) or free mandu (dumplings) with purchase of $20 or more.

If my stomach had a Hall of Fame, it would have a section dedicated to Capriotti's.Last night, I went to the Tempe location for the first time, and man-o-man, was I in for a treat. I've been a fan of this chain for a couple years. I discovered a location near my home in Las Vegas and ever since, I have been a huge fan! Of course, I hopped on my trusty Yelp app, and made sure that the Tempe location was the closest to Scottsdale (for now...there is one coming soon), but then...like a Coke machine in the middle of the freaking Sahara desert, I saw it....a YELP DEAL....for CAPRIOTTI'S! SWEET BABY JESUS! HELL FREAKING YEAH! I paid $7 for a $15 deal and parkoured my way down to Tempe like it was nobody's business. Parking was a bit of a problem since it was a game night. I also had to deal with the traffic from the ASU/USC traffic, but I love Capriotti's enough to brave any kind of traffic.The shop is small, but nice. Two TV's. Enough seating. Friendly staff. Tonight's addition to my imaginary Hall of Fame: Large Cole-Turkey with Ham. Yeah, I added the ham. I'm renegade like that. I guess you can say that I just go with it. The Cole Turkey is: pulled turkey, cole slaw, provolone, russian dressing, and mayo. So, so good. If you are a Capriotti's virgin, the large is a 20' sandwich. It's no joke. It can feed four people. I had my sandwich cut into four pieces. I ate one of them, put the other three in my fridge.  All in all, I really like this location. Staff, food....everything. Perfect. If I ever come back to Tempe, this is my spot...even over Jimmy John's. Yes.Capriotti's GREATER THAN Jimmy John's(no characters allowed)Amazing sandwiches. If you are ever craving some Thanksgiving loving, theres a perfect sandwich you! Pretty much T-giving in the palm of your hands, its the one and only Bobbie! Thy are also super fast, friendly, and the place is really clean.

Review Text :
Very weird place for a restaurant in my opinion... ha. Well, at least for now it is. Before I know it, that whole place will probably be filled with businesses. But, for those of you that want to try it.. I know the address says it's on Rainbow - but Rainbow does not go through all the way yet. So, if you're on Blue Diamond, Get onto Buffalo, turn left at Cactus and go all the way down, and you'll see it on your left. I'm not really sure what I was expecting when I walked into the place, but I liked what I saw. The place was decorated with a crap load of Christmas stuff. A little own of miniatures houses and a huge Christmas tree ! I'm not sure how festive the restaurant is on a normal basis, but it looks cute now. I really wanted to try this place for two reasons:1. I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF BREAKFAST FOODS !2. I'm on a mission to find the best Chicken Fried Steak in Vegas. The CFS here was good. Almost comparable to my favorite in Vegas so far [Babycakes]. It was good, very good...[not chewy at all!!] but a little too peppery for my taste [not overpowering or anything]. Now, if you're a person who likes pepper, then you'll probably enjoy this. It's safe to say that this is the 2nd best [at least in my opinion] CFS in Vegas. The portion of the CFS is also quite smaller compared to Babycakes, but still big enough to fill you. The gravy was a very nice. Probably the best gravy I've gotten on any CFS. It was rich, thick, and had bits of sausage throughout it. Very, very good ! I ordered the scrambled eggs with my CFS, as well as the battered potatoes. The scrambled eggs were underwhelming. Well seasoned, but definitely overcooked. Potatoes were good. I'm not a big potato fan at all, but I actually ate quite of few of their potatoes. They were nice and crispy.I'm excited to go back and try the rest of the offerings.  The service could have been better, but it wasn't quite bad enough to knock this review down to four stars.I've been here twice already. I remember not liking something about the place last time I came, but I couldn't remember what it was. Once we walked in here the other day, I was immediately reminded. The waitress just stared at us when we walked in. I said, "Do we just seat ourselves?" She responded, "Well that's what the sign says." Obviously I didn't read the sign if I asked the question, but she didn't need to be sarcastic about it. Maybe they should have a recorded message that says, "Please seat yourself" when you walk in the door, since they get irritated when people ask. It took us about 15 SECONDS to find a table and sit because I couldn't decide if I wanted something by the window, a 2 seat table, or a 4 seat table. I didn't think that was long at all, but when the waitress came up to us with our menus, she said, "Wow, I didn't realize finding a table was so hard." Then she took our drink orders (coffee and water). The coffee was $1.55 with unlimited refills. When she came back, we both ordered veggie omelets ($7.75 ea.)The veggies omelets were average. I just found it weird that they put whole slices of tomatoes in the center (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eDX3TWDnGMXq4hXmwgBkJg/l.jpg).  The coffee was very good though and I got about 3 refills. Overall, I don't think I'd come back here even though I live a couple miles away. I just don't like the service and the food is just mediocre. If the waitress was completely quiet the whole time, it would've been better. Tip:Directions: Go south on Buffalo, make a left on Cactus and when you get to the end, it'll be on your right.I have lived in Las Vegas for fifteen years and just, officially, had the best cheeseburger this town has to offer because of this restaurant.Warning, it takes a good moment to find this place.  We felt like after every turn we would be arriving there until another sign popped up for us to make another turn.  Then, when the signs stop, you assume you've gotten lost, but you just have to keep going until the end of the road...if you hit train tracks, you've gone too far.  ;)When you walk in, the interior matches everything you think a "country cafe" should look like.  Actually, it really reminded me of my grandmother's house back home in Texas...very cozy, very homey and knick knacks everywhere.  Also, they play country music from a local radio station.  Not even places that are supposed to be country ::cough Stoney's cough:: do that.We sat down and placed our orders, mine for the lunch cheeseburger and my friend for the breakfast burrito.  That's another thing, they don't stop serving breakfast until 3:00 PM, which is very beneficial when you're constantly out with someone that would prefer eat breakfast items at all three meals.Our check wasn't too high, the service was pretty good and the food was AMAZING!!!  I can't believe I didn't know about this place sooner!  I DEFINITELY intend to go back!03/23/13 DINNERI was tempted to give this place only 1 star, but since the owner/server was a nice guy, I went with 2 stars.On 02/27/12 spouse and I had dinner here. We brought a GROUPON along, and as it turned out, it was worth the long drive and price for what we had. Spouse really liked the chicken fried chicken.So a few months ago a repeat of the GROUPON was offered. I got one.Well, we were extremely disappointed this time. It had a few ups, but mostly downs.We came this night for their announced Saturday night special, which I will copy verbatim from their Facebook page: IT'S SATURDAY MARCH 23rd AND....TODAY'S SPECIAL IS....ROASTED TURKEY BREAST WITH DARRELL'S HOMEMADE CORNBREAD STUFFING (THIS IS DELISH!!) SERVED WITH FRESH MASHED POTATOES AND GRAVY(made from the drippings mm mm good) VEGETABLE, DINNER ROLL AND CHOICE OF HOMEMADE SOUP OR CRISP GREEN SALAD!!!We arrived. I saw a sign at the front door announcing "Saturday & Sunday only, check in with Facebook and get unlimited mimosas for $10 or half priced bloody marys". I said to myself, Why Not?, and proceeded to check in. I showed my phone to the owner/server (Darrell?), and he said "Oh, that's only offered at brunch, and as I don't own the bar, I can't make that offer for dinner." It's a tavern with him (Darrell?) subleasing the restaurant side of the building. That's fair enough. (It's similar to what Carluccio's did, moving from the Liberace center to a Henderson tavern.) But he (Darrell?) proceeded to bring us a free basket of fried mozzarella sticks, which was very nice of him (Darrell?), and were actually pretty good.We got the bloody marys after all, and it was one of the worst I've ever had. Why? For one, my olive was previously attacked by a bug (no lie, a chunk bit out of it, obviously insect-eaten) and the cocktail tasted metallic. I probably should've returned it, but then there were those free moz sticks, sitting there...After ordering said Saturday night special, next up were cup of soup or salad. I got the homemade chili, which was good. Spouse got the salad, and was quite happy. It even had dandelion greens. In the 2.25 years of living here in Vegas I don't think we've seen those in a salad. (Was it a packaged salad? If it was, it was surprising.)But then the main course comes. It was not turkey BREAST, it was turkey LOAF. Lots of white and grey-dark meat, sliced from a loaf, perfectly circular, falling to pieces. It was OK, but it wasn't anything special, or worth the price charged. And the "veg", the green beans, we forgot about this part from the last visit, they were sadly canned. Remaining was some cranberry sauce (OK, likely canned, no problem), the potatoes (a small scoop of homemade, these were good), the dressing (also seemed homemade, good) and the gravy (which I think wasn't from "drippings" because the last time I cooked a turkey loaf I don't recall all that many drippings, so we think it was bottled/packaged). The dinner roll was a version of texas toast, no garlic, just a grilled roll.Didn't order the homemade, just out of the oven, peach cobbler, offered by the owner/server (Darrell?). We promptly left after dinner. A lot of the turkey loaf came home for the kitties.If I hear they've improved, we might again make the trip out there. But I doubt that will happen.PS One other problem. We arrived to find a couple of uncontrolled kids running around the VERY SMALL restaurant, at times screaming. It continued throughout most of our visit. I guess the word "Families" in the name of the place should've been a clue of the possibility of an undesired child "carnival", supplied by their uncaring-of-other-patrons parents. (At the same age as those kids, if I had behaved that way in a restaurant with my Navy Commander father at the table, I would've been beaten to a pulp. Times have certainly changed.)My husband & I went to this place due to a groupon I found for it. The groupon deal was good, the food was good, but the service was HORRIBLE!! I've definitely experienced better. First, the drive to this place was coo-coo! We almost thought this place didn't exist. My husband thought it was a "groupon scam" but we finally found it. I kinda wished we hadn't though. As I said before, the food was good, but the service was NOT!! It all started w/the tall, dark-haired guy that greeted us at the door; he spoke in a monatone & he had no personality whatsoever. :(  Then, our server, a full-figured, blond-haired lady, came to take our order, & when she saw that we had a groupon, she gave a weird, attitudy look; a look that said, "Oh great, some more cheap-skates that only came here for the groupon deal". She had so much attitude, she definitely needs an attitude adjustment. Then, it took so long to get our food. Eventhough they were busy, it took FOREVER to get our food. We only ordered some common breakfast meals. My husband got the bacon & eggs w/sourdough toast & batter bites, which are only seasoned cubed potatoes that are crispy. I got a denver omelette, homefried potatoes, which have onions & bell peppers, w/biscuits & gravy. The biscuits were good but the gravy was very peppery & had no sausage, which it usually would have. The only good service we got was by the two guys who kept checking on us, about our drinks mainly, but they were cool still. We over-heard our server curse in the kitchen about all the people who were coming in w/all the groupons. I thought if they don't want people to come visit their restaurant w/groupons, then they shouldn't put their restaurant on the groupon website. I would only recommend this place for the food, but not for the service.If you are looking for just OK food, very rude and mediocre service this is the place!!. My friend and I went this morning for breakfast with our babies and we had THE WORST experience. Shyla almost yank the menu out of my babies hands when my baby was only looking at it! agh! the more I think about it the madder I get!!! some people just don't care about customer service anymore! we will never ever again return to this place...and I am sharing this with all my friends!If you're looking for a diner-esque type place, look no further. It may be a bit hard to find for those of you not familiar with Mountain's Edge.I found the staff to be friendly and pleasant and there was not long wait for our service.I got the Honey Stung Fried Chicken, it wasn't the best fried chicken but it was tasty and not at all greasy. I wasn't a big fan of their mashed potatoes (could they be instant-maybe?). The roll was tasty. I also got a cup of their Cream of Chicken Soup...wow! this stuff is good. I'd go back just for the soup!My husband got the Rib Eye Sandwich with Fries. The sandwich was good, no grisle like you get in some steaks. The fries were also good, I stole my share from his plate!I would definitely go back, friendly staff, prices are decent, food is good and it's close to home!Pros:The food is very good.Conveniently located in Mountain's Edge.Cons:SERVICE!!!! Bad and rude customer service from the brother and sister that usually work in the restaurant. We have eaten at this establishment a few times over the last couple years. Each time we don't know what type of service we will receive. The scale ranging from just ok to bad.As I mentioned before the food is very good and you can't beat the convenience for us, it's less than a 5 minute drive. Hence, continuing to come back.This is the last time though. We were there this last Sunday morning on 02/15/15We arrived and they were busy. We waited about 1/2 an hour before we were seated.The busser came over and took our drink order and brought out our drinks promptly. Our server also came over and took our order.Our food didn't come out to our table until ONE HOUR+ after taking our order. NO ONE, not our server, not the manager,  not a single person stopped by our table to tell us anything! Nothing at all. They just kept walking past our table several times while we were waiting. 45 minutes into want we flagged down our server to ask if there was a problem with our food? It was taking so long? She just replied that it shouldn't be too much longer.  5 minutes later the manager/head server came to our table to let us know that they have been very busy and that it shouldn't be too much longer.My husband and I both ordered steaks, medium rare at that. His was a sandwich and mine a regular small steak.Another 10 minutes passed and our food finally came out. WRONG ORDER for my husband.  They brought him a chicken fried steak. At this point we were just DONE!No we didn't want to wait for who knows how much longer to get the order right! As the manager/lead server was suggesting. Poor to nonexistent customer service will continue to drive people away. The owners really need to look into experienced servers with good customer service.That's too bad. But hopefully Mountain's Edge will have more choices soon!I ate here when my family came to visit. Seeing some reviews, I wanted to try it for myself. Everyone raved about the country fried steak so I tried it. Honestly, the food was mediocre. The guy who served us was very direct and rude. He would ask us a question and if we didn't answer quick enough, he would walk away. He did this a couple of times. The food came out fast, we waited about 10 mins till it came to our table. I read other reviews about people waiting longer.Okay, brace yourself for this part... My 3 year old needed to use the restroom so my husband took him. In the restroom was our server. My husband saw him walk out of the stall and not even wash his hands!!!!! As my husband walked back to our table with our son, I watched our server serve another customer their plate and a coke!!!! GROSSS!!!!!! Just because of that incident, we are NEVER going back. Their not very welcoming or friendly there anyway.

I was told that I needed to take my GF out on a date to dinner and a show. I wanted to see Absinthe again but after checking the restaurant prices at Caesars and being told a trip to McDonald's wasnt going to cut it to night we picked Rons steakhouse.Don't let the crazy people in and around the Casino scare you. This is a great place to escape the heat, the hustle and bustle of the strip and better yet most of the people in the casino couldnt afford the restaurant so its quaint and yet classy sit down experience you dont want to miss.We both had a 3 course steak dinner of perfectly cooked Fillets, house salads that came wrapped in tasty cucumber bowls and for desert it was cheesecake.The server was an Expat from France and very knowledgeable about all the dishes. He was even very entertaining as he made jokes about himself and his not being from America. It was very personal and engaging and all the staff made you feel at home. (So much so an elderly lady had a personal cell phone conversation in the booth next to us like she was sitting in her own living room. I hope whomever she was talking to gets her meds figures out, the laundry folded and the pets fed) If you are in the mood for a great steak dinner at a great price that will impress just about anyone; GIVE THEM A TRY!

Restaurant name  Comptoir 21

Review Text :
Bear in mind, Montreal is close to no ocean so though we are on an island fresh seafood can be hard to find. When fish and chips is fresh and perfect it's probably in my top 5 favourite foods, and when it's anything less than perfect it kinda breaks my heart because it just doesn't bring those same memories back. Le Comptoir 21 today was perfect - the fish was so light and fresh and buttery and not at all fishy I couldn't believe it; according to the owner it comes up from Boston (which explains it's bold Maritime-y American attitude =). The batter was perfect, especially squirted with the bottles of malt and regular vinegar provided, and dipped in the homemade tartar. I had a pint of local blonde beer from the tap, but saw they also had bottles of that lovely and inexpensive C'est La Vie wine from the Pays D'Oc. The fries were perfect and my date said his steak sandwich was above average: the panini was warm and light and full of peppers, mushrooms and onions and gooood with the hot sauce. We also really dug the communal seating at the counter wrapped around the smiling franglais waitress who seemed happy working in 360, dealing out the little baskets lined with blue and white check wax paper full up with breaded shrimp, calamari, burgers and darkly golden fries. You could almost almost hear the ocean and on this fall day in Canada we were just loving it.Il n'y a pas une grande panoplie de restos à fish n' chips à Montréal, alors quand l'envie d'un bon poisson avec une belle panure et des frites vous prends, le Comptoir 21 devient un incontournable!Ils ont une super bonne variété d'option même si le focus est vraiment mis sur le fish n'chip. On peut aussi y manger des burgers en version carnivore, poisson ou végétarien. La poutine est aussi végétarienne mais ç y goûter la sauce, vous ne pourriez pas le deviner au goût seulement. Elle est boooooonne!Et le poisson, bien que quand même un peu gras à cause de la friture, est simplement cuit à perfection. Il se défait seul tout en restant bien juteux. Et pour les sauces, mes préférées sont la thaï et la paprika. Toutefois, parce qu'on avait de la manière à décider, la serveuse a été tellement gentille et nous a offert de toutes les essayé (avec nos calmars en entrée) avant de faire notre choix finale pour le repas principal et elles étaient toutes très bonnes.L'endroit est tout petit et le décor vraiment cool. Tout le monde s'assoit à un long comptoir en forme de " U " et c'est quand même propice à la jasette avec des inconnus. On s'y sent bien en petit groupe ou même seul vu la disposition des sièges le long du comptoir. En fait, je ne les ai pas compté, mais si j'avais à prendre une chance, je dirais qu'il y a probablement 21 sièges au comptoir! Quelqu'un le saurait pour sûr?Quelle belle surprise!Disons-le, de l'extérieur, le restaurant n'a l'air de rien. Par contre, en y entrant on trouve une ambiance chaleureuse et des employés plus que gentils! Je m'attendais à ne trouver que quelques choix sur le menu, mais j'ai eu de la difficulté à choisir. La très sympathique employée à la caisse ma suggéré le classique Fish N' Chip et ne j'ai pas été déçue. La panure n'était pas trop lourde et le poisson, miam! On voyait (et goûtait!) qu'il était vraiment frais. Les frites étaient également délicieuses. Vous pourrez choisir la sauce qui accompagne votre poisson : la classique tartare, la piquante au jalapeno, la thaï et j'en passe. Ayant un petit appétit, j'ai pris la petite portion, mais ouff! La petite portion était une assez grosse portion pour moi, je n'ai pas réussi à tout avaler, même si c'était hyper bon. J'en ai donc eu beaucoup pour mon argent. Parlant d'argent, les prix sont plus qu'abordables compte tenu de la qualité de la nourriture et du service. Mon amie a quant à elle choisi les croquettes de morue avec la salade et son plat était tout aussi bon.J'y retournerai assurément pour essayer autre chose!We went there last night, wanting to enjoy some fish'n chips. We really appreciated the atmosphere set by the counter, which was great. We had the fried squids which were light and not too greasy, the paprika sauce with them was delicious too. The clam chowder was a bit thick but really good nevertheless. We then had the 21 Burger (with fried fish), I found the fish really too greasy and lacking in taste, and the shrimp tempuras which we found a tad too oily as well. The food was good, though all this fried and oil and grease did leave a weight on our stomachs but then it is North America I suppose. I have lived in London and eaten fish'n chips there and never had such a weight afterwards... All in all, for the food served, the price is right and the staff quite friendly, next time I might try something less greasy though!

Review Text :
China Gourmet has quickly become my go-to fast food Chinese eatery.  It's conveniently located down the street from my house and next to Food 4 Less so I can go and grab a few groceries on the way home as well.  I came here on a whim one day because I saw one of their fliers in between all the other junk mail and ads.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the quick service!  Granted, the first time I visited was the same week that they opened so it wasn't too busy and they managed to hook about one or two other people to try their food while I was there but I tend to believe it's still somewhat of a secret.  The first time here I opted for the Black Bean Shrimp plate and it was actually pretty killer (better than most of the Chinese eats in my area but I dare not mention any names haha).  The second time around I ordered the Salt and Pepper Shrimp and was appeased again.  Both times my food came with Egg Drop Soup, Wonton Crackers, and a couple of Egg Rolls.  Plus, they give you a whole plate (yes a whole regular sized plate) of just rice!  So awesome!  I left both times happy and full.  The price was actually pretty good as well and they also offer lunch specials for the run-and-go cheap eats peeps out there.  I will definitely come back to visit again and I hope the quality of the food doesn't diminish in the future and end up another one of those "fast food" joints that fade into the background.Yum!  See ya soon, China Gourmet!
Double Headers=***Chase Field's main concession stand Double Headers features a value menu that includes hot dogs, corn dogs and popcorn for $1.50 each; the concessions here are similar to what you will find at any other stadium, but the lower prices are refreshing***Double Headers is the main concession stand at Chase Field.  They have multiple locations all throughout the stadium, which make them very easy to find.  They serve the traditional baseball stadium food like hot dogs, french fries and popcorn.  There are some items that are only available at some of the Double Headers stands though (like the nachos).  I am not sure, but I think some of the Double Headers also sell a foot-long corn dog.Double Headers does provide one big advantage over many arena/stadium concessions stands.  They have a value menu that features items like hot dogs, corn dogs and popcorn for $1.50 each.  We went with the popcorn and it was okay.  It was not super light or super fresh, but it was perfectly serviceable.  It was a decent size too.  That size of popcorn would probably run about $4 at a movie theater concessions stand.We also went with the nachos, which were corn tortilla chips topped with jalapenos and a side of melted nacho cheese.  The chips were the kind of hearty gold tortilla chips that you would get from a grocery store.  They were crunchy, but they were not the freshest chips.The jalapenos were good and the nacho cheese here was better than what you would find at most arenas/stadiums.  The nacho cheese had a little bit of spice and heat to it.  That is rare for stadium cheese dips.  Usually, stadium cheese dips are very bland.Service was fine.I like trying more city/team-specific concessions when visiting a new stadium and there is a good number of them at Chase Field (local chains like Macayo's and Streets of New York pizza).  Double Headers, on the other hand, is very run-of-the-mill concessions.  Still, the value menu here makes Double Headers a good option if you are a stadium regular or are looking to get some food without having to spend too much money.
Frank N Steins=I've read several reviews of this place and others and I'm getting mighty tired of people from Chicago or New York or wherever blasting local restaurants because they don't have "authentic" food from their home town; pizza, hotdogs or whatever. This is PHOENIX. It's not Chicago. It's not New York. It's not St Paul, Minnesota (although for half the freakin' year it's hard to believe that last one). If you want authentic stuff from your home town then why the heck did you move here? I'm an Aussie and I never shoot places down simply because the hamburgers and fries don't taste like what I grew up with. If I don't like the food I say so. If I don't like the restaurant or service I say so, and vice versa. If only people could judge based on the individual pros or cons of restaurants and their ~local~ competition, and not some rose-coloured memory they have of sometime years ago or someplace three thousand miles away, things would be a lot fairer. Plus, this is a HOT DOG place, not some haute cuisine dining establishment! Exactly how different do Chicago buns or pickles taste?! If I maintained this same philosophy, every single Indian restaurant I've eaten at in Phoenix would get a single star rating. See how this works?Rant over. Went here for dinner the other night, arrived at just after 6pm. A lady with iridescent blue eyes greeted us and was very friendly in discussing the different options. Truth to tell, there aren't many - Chicago Style, one or two other styles, and a kids menu with three or four combo options. The lady noticed our toddler and said that if he sat on the other side of the table she would turn cartoons on for him on one of the tellys. We ordered our stuff and out it came in a few minutes. First plus were the fries. If you've read my talk thread here (http://j.mp/ovV41z) you'll know how I feel about crispy fries. Props to this place for serving actually fresh fries (albeit with the skin on). Yes, they were a bit oily - you get that when fries are fried in oil. Yes, they were a bit soggy - you get that when fries aren't pre-processed by blanching. These fries are what you get when 1) you chop a potato and 2) fry it thereafter. Try it sometime. Go to In-N-Out, same thing. If you want crispy fries, go somewhere else. Me, I could have eaten them all. day. long.Hotdogs were okay - it was my first go at Chicago style. I got two. Pickle, tomato was fine. The relish was sort of a bright fluorescent green - bizarre, but tasted ok. I didn't get the sport peppers as I had had jalapeno for lunch. One mistake was to forget to ask for no celery salt - I hate the taste of celery and the salt spoiled the dogs for me. I wiped off what I could. Still finished both. The wife enjoyed hers. She had a tray of chili fries - very good indeed. The kid wolfed down his dog and half his fries, as expected.All in all, a great meal. I was checking in on Yelp when the wife told me that they had already closed. Sure as shinola it was after 7. I read on their facebook page that they're planning to stay open a little longer. 7pm shutdown is definitely way too early and puts this place dangerously close to White Eagle IMO in terms of stupid business hour planning. But, 6pm is fine for us for a family dinner and it's not like we got bounced out at closing time. Anyone looking to have dinner later, just stand in front of this place and then turn your heads left and right. Several options. You know, or else just move back to Chicago where everything is so much better.I would have given this place a solid 3 star average, but it nosed up to 4 due to the thoughtfulness of the counter gal and the quality of the fries. Screw authentic, the food was good. And now I've half a mind to go eat at Portillo's in Chicago and then slam it on Yelp because the hotdogs didn't taste like the dogs I ate back in Phoenix. Oh wait, I said rant over, didn't I? (sips peppermint tea expressionlessly)
Double Helix Wine & Whiskey Lounge=Quality off the Strip wine bar at off the Strip prices.  WIN!Straight to the libations.  There is a short list of outstanding, highly rated, old world and cult wines offered by the bottle at dirt cheap prices (ie the impossible to get '09 Mollydooker Velvet Glove $225.  It's so hard to get that a wine shop in Hawaii only let me touch and caress the bottle but not buy)  There is also a good selection of wines by the glass offered both in full and half pours to help with tasting.Unfortunately whiskey, scotch and bourbon drinkers are left out.  For a place named Wine and WHISKEY, you expect more than just the most common names behind the barThe simple food is wine centric.  It all pairs well.  Props to the "Grown-ups grilled cheese" with its gooey, melted gruyere and smoked ham core; olive poppers (goat cheese and chorizo studded olives); and the rich mushroom arancini with a white truffle scented aioli.  The cheese and charcuterie selection is very good (thanks to a misunderstanding, I tried them all.  No one thought it was funny to serve a dish for 5-7 to ONE me huh?)They do offer salads, sandwiches and pastas for those wanting something heavier.  Don't be surprised to find the same items at their other location, Bottles and Burgers.Great happy hour from 3:30-7:30RecommendedGenerous happy hours a good happy hours.  Going from 3:30pm - 7:30pm daily makes it very accessible to most people.  Happy hour specials get you $3-$6 appetizers, $3 beers, $4-$7 wines, ~$5 cocktails, as well as 1/2 off premium well drinks (what's a premium well?) and 1/2 off their whiskey of the month.After several visits here I've found myself enjoying their grilled cheese and arancini appetizers the most.  Gruyere and smoked ham make for a tasty grilled cheese, and the arancini comes with a good truffle sauce.  The food isn't amazing, but these are the two dishes that I've liked most.  As far as drinks, talk with Jessica if you're sitting at the bar.  She's a good bartender that is always happy to make you a drink based on your mood and palate.  Otherwise, their happy hour cucumber martini is delicious, and made with Hendricks Gin!  Decent food and good drinks make for a nice stop at Town Square.Double Helix is definitely one of my favorite places to go in Town Square. My drinks of choice are wine and whiskey so it's the perfect place for me. It's also conveniently located half a mile from where I work so I frequently stop by for an after work drink and on occasion some food as well. They've changed the food menu a little but from what I've tried so far the food is pretty good. I recommend the adult grilled cheese, it's mouth watering. I bring friends in often and always sit at the bar. Kyle and Jessica are great bartenders and they make the experience all the better. If you're in the area or taking a shopping trip to Town Square, I definitely recommend stopping in Double Helix.Great happy hour! My friend & I wanted to meet for happy hour & she suggested this place. Good call, Heidi! Bartender was very patient as my friend sampled the happy hour wines trying to decide on a favorite. I went with the malbec right away and was pretty happy with it. I tried to be good and ordered the gluten free appetizer, Seared Yellowfin Tuna. It was really good and at happy hour prices, it was a steal. But then I got weak.... And had to order the Grown Up Grilled cheese. It was adorable. I ordered it sans pork (allergy) and it was really good. My friend ordered the Olive poppers, but I couldn't try them (also had pork) this place is very pork friendly. I don't think she expected them to be breaded & deep fried. She also ordered the Salmon Caesar salad. It was very big & looked delicious! She said she liked it. I'm definitely coming back to try some other stuff, if I can keep from ordering the Grown Up Grilled Cheese, that is... Try it!A great alternative to the Strip or Downtown watering holes when it comes to "adulting" on a Saturday night, wait... what is "Adulting?"  "Adulting" - Definition: Sipping one or two drinks, staying within your cocktail budget, and using all of your Uber credits for your inebriated friends. The Double Helix is a great lounge for both snackers and whiskey lovers alike. This spot is located in the main hub of Town Square and they feature over one hundred whiskeys and an entire vineyard's worth of wines, both red and white.  Instead of just staring at their vast drink menu, I suggest going with a "drink flight", this is the best way to find out exactly what you do and don't like and yes, they offer whiskey and wine flights for the indecisive person. They also have great happy hour deals that usually highlight a specialty whiskey or wine. If you really want to get educated on whiskey ask for Kyle, one of the bartenders, he's the hunky guy in the Kilt. The dude is legit when it comes to drink suggestions and whiskey anecdotes. Hummus, quesadillas, and fried cheese is just a small sample of the snacks they offer here, they also have excellent charcuterie plates to go with that bold red in your hand. Sip smart Las Vegas.
New Mexican Grill=What the HELL is wrong with you Yelpers who like this place?!  A rare Yelp miss, but an almost unforgivable miss.  I am tempted to write a letter to Yelp to audit the accounts who posted positive reviews for this place!  You're either tastebud deficient or a friend of the owner.First of all, we should have walked out when we saw that two employees were just sort of lazily hangin' about and chatting it up in a booth in the back of the joint.  Both looked unkempt and disinterested; thought they for sure were just a couple of hungover college kids.At first I thought they must be on break, but nope they were both involved in us getting our food.  Whoever is managing this place needs to get it under control.  Employees like that will kill your business!The chips and salsa are a joke.  They are just sitting out there under a heat lamp with a sign that says, basically, please don't take too much so we can save money.  Uh,.. never seen something so remarkably cheap in my life.  Even the sign looked cheap, printed on some old paper, off center, and filthy.  The chips were hard and seemed to have been sitting out for a while and likely not fresh.  The salsa was below average and didn't taste fresh.  I am convinced the tomatoes were out of a can.I tried their "specialty," if you dare call this piece of shit special, the Green Chili Pork Burrito.  Again, no way in hell was this fresh. Also bland and boring.  The rice was room temperature and the beans watery.My wife thought hers was just boring and the kids barely ate it.  Stay away!!!Drove from Queen Creek to the Pecos and Lindsey location for a to-go order and trip to the park after with the kids. I paid 20 dollars for my food and asked for a cup of water. They handed me a tiny plastic cup, to which I begged for a cup with a lid. After arguing with the manager for 5 min with a toddler in my arm and two kids running around. I left pretty annoyed at the place for not sparing a 5 cent cup that would make all the difference in this momma's world to take to the park with A LID.  I didn't get one.This may seem petty, but they also got my order wrong and therefore I came to the conclusion that if I make the effort to drive all that way, spend a good amount on a couple tacos and burrito, I expect a business to return the kindness even if it is as simple as a cheap water cup with a lid,  and getting the order right.The food was decent, but I won't be back. Consider the customer service when you decide to satisfy your Mexican food craving.
Tien Wong Hot Pot=Ok...I waited a while to write a review about this place because I wanted to at least get two visits under my belt before I make any praises or judgements....and the verdict is...da da the da da..well you already know what it is!  Since this is the only restaurant specializing in hot pot here in Phoenix/Chandler, maybe all of Arizona, there really is no other place I can compare it to.  So I gotta compare it to the hot pot/shabu shabu restaurants I have visited in L.A, San Gabriel, etc.Compared to the other places I have been, this place tops the list!  The soup broths that they offer are very unique to different asian regions.  I had the Ying Yang which is half non spicy traditional chinese herbal broth and half traditional Taiwanese Ma La Spicy herbal broth.  Sometimes these other place would make the Ma La broth not edible because there is too much of the numbing spice, but here they make it just right.  They also did not skimp on the herbs used in the broth...very flavorful.  THey also offer all their broths vegetarian.  The second time I was there I tried the spicy Lemongras veggie style and is was also very good.So, Tien got the broth down, but what about their menu items?  Three words...Fresh and Top Quality.All the veggies and mushrooms I ordered were very fresh.  This is important because with Hot pot/Shabu Shabu there is no hiding bad or poor quality items.  THe meat selection was also cut perfectly and of top quality...comparable to the top Shabu restaurants I have been to in Cali.I ordered the Shabu beef, lamb, and beef tongue.  the shabu was so tender, it basically melted in my mouth!In addition, the udon I had was also very good and so was everything else I had the two time I was there.Everything here is a la carte, so you can always get something different with each visit.All in all, I will be back again, and again, and again...keep up the quality and the service and I am sure this place will gain the popularity it deserves!!After my third trip to Tien Wong, I thought it was time to write the raving review it so obviously deserves, even despite the fact that they do not serve alcohol!Hot Pot is basically fondue with a soup broth instead of cheese. It is an absolutely amazing concept and is a great group or date event. It is a blast to go through and pick different veggies and tofu (they have meat and fish as well) and try new things you never would have tried under normal circumstances.I have really grown to love the greens, Tang O, taro root, the five spice tofu, and the iced tofu. They have probably 5-6 kinds of mushrooms, bock choy, spinach, four or five types of noodles, dumplings, and somehow like 4-5 different types of tofu! It is amazing! You also get a peanut and a soy dipping sauce, but I think the flavor of the vegetables drenched in miso is amazing without any sauce!I saw someone complain about the price here on Yelp, but we had dinner last night for 4 with a hot tea and a dessert for $50.00 total. We had 4 different dishes of tofu and 7 different kinds of vegetables in our huge pot of miso broth so that we could try our a variety. Every single one of us was stuffed and remained full throughout the rest of the night. I think it is a great value. People who don't normally eat vegetables or Asian enjoy the fun experience, and enjoy being able to try something they normally wouldn't. Also a great place to take a group of people so that you can all try something a little different.I was looking forward to trying the newly renamed T-Spot for a tasty bowl of hot pot, but it sadly didn't meet expectations. The blueberry boba tea was great, the service alright, they had pretty decor & the experience was nice, but perhaps better suited for a smaller party of two. After figuring out the menu & concept we chose a couple types of meat, veggies, noodles and two types of broth. The meat was lacking in flavor, barely a difference between the two different broths and not nearly spicy enough. Once cooked the portions were small and the bill we received nearly $70 for 3 was too much for so little.The meal left my wallet & my stomach empty.
The Habit Burger Grill=Q:  How did the jury find the hamburger?A:  Grill-ty as charred!This beloved California chain that has made its way to Utah, Nevada, and Arizona is amazing.  Mr. Dubs and I came here today when SRP screwed up one thing or another and the whole neighborhood's electricity went out.  Do you know how hard it is to pop in your contacts and do eyeliner in the dark?  It's hard.  But the struggle was well worth it when a delicious charbroiled burger and lovely A/C was there to greet you.After the lovely server went through the menu with us and gave us some suggestions, we ordered the Teriyaki Char, the #2 Original Double Char meal, and a side of tempura green beans.  Such delicious charry bits of goodness!  Everything was well-seasoned, had good flavor, and tasted great.  I especially loved the tempura green beans with a side of ranch.  It was well worth the extra calories.  Get lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, and grilled onions on your burger for no extra charge but cheese is like $0.55 extra and stuff like bacon and avocados are also an extra dime or two.  Don't forget to stop by the swanky chili peppers/pepperchinis/pickles bar and grab yourself a strawberry puree limeade with cucumber slices.  It was a bit sweet for my liking but it was super refreshing on this hot summer day!All in all, I'll definitely be back here again! Indoor seating is limited as well as parking and since there was a constant flow of customers, the place could end up a bit messy but oh well.  Good food at decent prices!  $20 lunch for two ain't too shabby for a fast food joint with much better quality.
Beijing Noodle Cafe=Hand-pulled noodles...enough said!No, seriously...they are the star of Beijing Noodle Cafe and it would be a crime if you didn't order them.My trusty Yelp app reminded me I was in the neighborhood and not only did we recently read about this restaurant in the local paper, but Paul Y. was raving about place to the Husband.  As soon as I checked in, I realized fellow yelper Andy T. was just here and he quickly sent us a message telling us what we had to order!  Located in a strip mall, this hole in the wall mom and pop restaurant is quaint and simply decorated with pictures of the menu items and hanging red lanterns.  Of course, the very clean fish tank is something you can't miss when you walk in.We were given a lunch menu - on one side featured lunch specials, but the other side was where the specialty noodles were offered.  We shared:* Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup ($6.95) - Hand pulled noodles in a very light aromatic broth with wood ear mushrooms and sliced beef.  It was very flavorful and we were quite impressed.* Szechuan Eggplant with Noodles ($6.95) - Hand pulled noodles with a stir-fry of eggplant, tomatoes and garlic sitting on top.  Again, very good and quite rich.  Although both dishes had the same noodles, they were showcased quite differently in broth versus sauce.  Once you eat a freshly made noodle, it's hard to want anything else.While we waited for our order, we inquired about when the demonstration for noodle pulling takes place.  The waiter told us that the chef was out, but usually during the evenings.  The chef came in a few minutes later and he started making our noodles.  It was quite impressive and definitely entertaining.  At that point, the female owner explained more about the different sizes of noodles offered (small, medium or large - although she recommends medium), and that they the hand cut noodles into water as well.  (If you've seen Bizarre Foods, you know what I'm talking about here!)  She also mentioned their appetizer dumplings as being made to order.  We initially thought they weren't offered at lunch because it wasn't on the lunch menu we were given and per another yelper's review.  On the contrary, it IS available!  Sweet!  So we added:* Pork Wonton in Red Chili Sauce ($4.95) - Twelve little handmade morsels sitting in a deadly chili oil sauce.  They were fresh and light, and not your average wonton.* Pork and Chives Potstickers ($4.95) - They came in a set of six that were pan fried and just filled to the brim with pork and chives.  It also came with a dipping sauce, and you can really tell the freshness of this potsticker.  They told us it takes 8 minutes for them to make it, but I think it took less.We're loving Beijing Noodle Cafe and we think you will too!  Be sure to ask the friendly lady owner for suggestions because she is more than helpful and willing to please.  You'll find out taking out-of-towners here for sure!Please make my noodles BY HAND! Thanks! SERIOUSLY!!! They hand pull their noodles here. If you are lucky (or you just ask) the chef will even come out and pull noodles. Amazing! And you can taste the difference! The noodles are so delicious!I always have the mushroom and beef noodles. Oh wow! So flavorful and rich. We shared the wontons in chili sauce appetizer last time and it was so good. I don't even like spicy food but it was goooooood!This place is located in a small strip mall and you could miss it if your not looking. It is quaint and clean and the staff is always friendly. If you are looking for not only a good meal, but a neat experience you should stop by. Trust me, Beijing is not that far! LOLGot noodle?  Yes.  Where?  Beijing Noodle Cafe of Las Vegas!I was recovering from a flu/food-poisoning, and as I was on the mend -- soup, particularly noodle soup, is what this non-medical professional prescribed to self.Searching online from my hotel room on the strip, Beijing Noodle Cafe rose to the top with it's 4+ star rating and FRESH made noodles.  Next step, muster up energy.I take the elevator downstairs, and take the long walk thru the lobby of the Luxor.  Hobbling and wobbling, all-the-while not drunk, I finally reach valet to retrieve my car.  Next step, find it.About a 15 minute drive down Flamingo, east of the strip (only 10 if you're really hungry), I arrive at a not-the-best looking strip mall & parking lot.  I didn't see the sign at first...and began to worry it fell victim to the economy.  Alas, I see it and parked right near.  Next step, get it.I open the door, and find that I am a VIP today...a private place all to myself, no papparazis, no TMZ, and no bother.  At 315pm, It was a strange time to eat, even for LUNNER (lunch/dinner).  A lovely, sweet lady greeted me, and I found a nice table...with some sun on my back.  The decor was cute but not fancy, with chinese artifacts, artwork, and painted a pretty mint green.  Next step, stop looking at the decor and pick a fricken noodle.The menu was great!  They serve lunch specials late, and I was able to take advantage of it.  Lanzhou Beef Noodle was the choice (and like Seinfelds' George, I like it spicy), with a side of dumplings.  Next step, intend to order a little too much so I have leftovers.The noodles are made fresh to order, so it takes a few extra minutes.  This translated is, the soup isn't already made where they take a ladle and dish it out to you.  FRESH noodles are worth the extra 10 minutes.  Next step, Zen-like patience.The dumplings came out first.  Wow - they were huge and a bit oddly shaped.  Translation: homemade, and not pressed out of a machine.  Forgetting that I've been ill, energy came from somewhere and I furiously dig into dumpling #1.  Holy Potsticker Batman!  Dumpling #2 was even more fricken great!  It's served with homemade chili sauce/oil -- pure heaven.  Next step, stop after eating 2 dumplings or be too full for the soup.The soup comes out, and it was absolutely FULL with FRESH noodles, and lovely pieces of tender beef.  Wow.  This is a great bowl, and perfectly executed by the chef.  Tasty broth, tender beef, and amazing noodles.  Next step, slow down or splash the window.I ate all the soup, one more dumpling, and took 2 dumplings 'to go'.  I was full, and full of noodle happiness I was!  Next step, don't eat the 2 remaining dumplings in the car, no matter how good they smell.CONCLUSION -- Great place, great service, great prices, great small business to support, and 2 great cold dumplings later from my hotel.  That's a lot of great, and greatly deserved!   It's best for locals and those looking for off-strip, hassle-free dining.  Next step, your turn.Quality, authentic, hand pulled noodles and hand cut noodles in the middle of the desert!If you're on a low carb diet, STOP READING.  Also, this is not for you if your idea of "authentic Asian cuisine" comes from a place that serves general tzo's chicken or beef with broccoli chow mien.  Skip if you enjoy eating rehydrated microwaved noodles from a styrofoam bowl.This is the real deal.  Extremely glutinous, al dente noodles with just the right amount of surface imperfections to hold the sauce or soup.  Enough, it's just good eats!The sliced pork and mushroom hand pulled noodles that other yelpers rave about is THE standout dish.  Loads of meaty mushrooms and tender pork.  Very flavorful, not too oily.  The beef noodle soup is also a worthy try.  Fresh herbs, ginger, garlic, chilies, and five spice create a very aromatic base for tender beef, mushrooms, and noodles.Ultimately, the strong flavors, lack of acidity, and the lack of textural contrast fill you up quick.  Avoid the "eyes bigger than the stomach" syndrome.  Nothing worse than a carb brick in your stomach and a cloying flavor in your mouth for hours.Note:  They use MSG with no apology.  You've been warned.Service is OK.  Prices very low.One of the best kept secrets in Vegas so shhhh, recommended.Came in out of the rain to kill time before meeting locksmith at my clients' home nearby. I was reluctant (even with the good Yelp reviews) to try out this "hole in the wall" establishment,  but my longing for a nice hot bowl of soup to warm me up was stronger than my fear. Upon entering, Beijing Noodle Cafe was the typical Chinese restaurant with minimal decor and a red glow that only seemed apparent in photos. I was greeted and seated immediately. The lunch specials looked tempting but after some Yelp research, I decided on the wonton noodle soup...wontons seemed like a popular choice amongst the Yelpers.My soup came within 5 minutes and it was DELICIOUS! The broth was nice and hearty with flecks of red chili, seaweed and shrimp, and the wontons...uniquely long rolled dumplings bursting with flavor in a thin wonton skin. These were some of the best wontons I've had in Vegas. I didn't care so much for the seaweed because it gave it more of a Japanese taste, so I must  remember to ask them to omit it next time. The noodles had a great chewy texture to them and I too was hoping to catch a glimpse of the noodle guy making them, but alas no.It was a satisfying bowl of real Chinese comfort food. This discovery was just in time for the cold weather ahead. 3 stars for now but I will upgrade my stars once I've had a chance to try other items from their menu.
Valhalla Pub and Eatery=You guys, they are updating their menu and had a "Lamb Burger with Feta and Curry Mayo" to try as a special that they are adding.  It. Was. Awesome.  Seriously, so tasty.  You need to go here, and get that burger, and then die of happiness.  Been here several times, and although service is a tad slow during lunch, they're always very friendly and the food is great, so I don't mind.  ALSO - check in on Yelp... you'll be glad you did :)If I'm heading to a Knights or Panthers game, you can find me over in Latta Arcade. The entire alley is such a great pre and post game spot.Rule number one for a sporting event: eat a meal before you start boozing. It sounds simple, right? Of course, it never is. We ventured here around 4pm before the Monday Night Football game. We ordered chips and salsa, the triple grilled cheese with waffle fries, hot dogs with kraut (plus mashed potatoes and gravy), and a couple of quesadillas. Now, I have no idea if they make the gravy from scratch, but I will say it's peppery and absolutely delicious. I will make sure every order I place here included something covered in gravy. The grilled cheese features brie as one of the three. Let's face it, brie makes everything better. A warning about the quesadilla: the Habenero Ranch is no joke. It's a delayed burn after the first taste. The table next to us got the fish and chips and I immediately wanted to order that, too. Huge portion for the fish. It looked really good.This place was absolutely slammed both inside and on the patio, but the staff never seemed to miss a beat. We had fantastic service and several people waiting on us. Thanks Valhalla for being a consistent game day favorite. Oh, and GO PANTHERS!!! Rarrrrrrrrrrrr.
Secret Pizza=Possibly the cheapest meal you will find in any of the casinos on the Las Vegas Strip.  And this unassuming and "hidden" pizzeria, which is not even what their name is (according to the man I spoke to behind the counter) is located in the newest luxury casino to opened in Las Vegas.  It is on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, across from the escalator and located next to Blue Ribbon Sushi.  There are no signs indicating that there is anything down the short hallway adorned with album covers, besides of course the pinball machine and flat screen televisions mounted on the wall clearly visible to anyone who bothered to look in.  But instead of finding a hidden alcove of arcade games, you will find a counter where you can order your pizza by the slice or by the whole pie, and work space where they prepare the NY-style pizzas from scratch.Prices are reasonable.  Slices starts at $3 per slice (plain cheese), $3.50 (one-topping), $4 (two toppings combo), and for $6 (you get a slice of plain cheese pizza and domestic draft beer).18" Pizza by the pie: $17 (Cheese), $18 (White Pizza - Ricotta & Mozzarella Cheese), $22 (three-toppings), or $25 (five-toppings).Available Toppings (in alphabetical): Black Olives, Extra Cheese, Fresh Garlic, Green Peppers, Meatballs, Mushrooms, Onions, Pepperoni, Ricotta, Roasted Tomatoes, Sliced Sausage, Spinach, White Anchovies.Beverages: Coca-Cola Brand fountain drinks, beer and wine (domestic and premium draft), Illy Coffee.  The cup of soda is pretty small, but you can ask for refills. :DDesserts: New York Cheesecake Slice and Cannoli.Also if you are staying at the Cosmopolitan and too busy/lazy/important/lost :p to make your way to the "Pizzeria", you can ring up the hotel to have someone deliver your pizza order.BTW, the concept of selling pizzas by the slice has been around for a long time, just ask any UCB students, but to implement this concept inside a mega luxury casino is as Misti (LV Yelp CM) stated, "genius"!----2/15/2011----Holy cow!  I have no idea this place gets so packed at 11pm on a Tuesday night!  And their cheese-less pizzas with extra garlic oil added to the pizza sauce is dope!  I am glad I ate the last slice that no one else wanted, even though I was rather full already :)Decor: 4.5/5Pizza: 3.5/5Price: 4.5/5Staff: 5/5 Friendly and nice to the guests.Shhhhhh! can you keep a secret?  We stumbled upon a secret pizzeria in the new Cosmopolitan hotel.It was 3 in the morning and we roll in jonesin for some food.Nico was such a sweetheart, he told us stories, listened to ours, and gave us advice on life, love, and all things worldly.  He was like an elder teaching us life lessons while he kneaded dough and turned it into pizza for us!It literally turned from this.....       )   (    )    (     ___     (       _.'      `._  )     .'               `.  _(________)___Into this...in a matter of 20 minutes                                              . ------------.               \-------------/                \%=@%%/                 \ O%O%/                   \%(_)O/                    \ *%8/                     \&8/                       \*/Great pizza, nice crust, and awesome company.  Nico hooked us up and managed to teach us about life all in 30 minutes.  He made me feel like I was in Italy and if this was his pizzeria he'd have given us the pizza for free!  Nico made our trip a memorable one.This place gets 5 stars just based on the fact that it oozes coolness and style.  This place is not listed on the cosmopolitan website and directories, there are no signs, and you have to go through a dark hallway in order to find it.  The only way to know about this place is pretty much by word of mouth.  Pretty ballsy move by Cosmopolitan, but it's working out pretty well for them.  It's a pretty solid piece of pizza.  I've never been to NYC and I can't tell you if this is authentic, but it looks and tastes how I'd imagine it to be like.  I got a white pizza with three different types of cheeses and I had it topped with roasted tomatoes and mushrooms.   It was delicious.  It's open pretty late, so if you need solid eats after partying and drinking around citycenter, then this should be your spot.This is the perfect place to wander into after a long night, and all you want is a greasy pizza with the 1 dollar bills you have left in your pocket you purposely created from your $5.00 so you can play more penny slots. Instead of being left with those .16 cents ticket redemption stubs you can't even play, save those dollars to be spent in the rabbit hole- with no directory name or signs, the fun part is trying to find this place!But i'm not going to spoil your fun by telling you where this place is- but will give u one clue. If u see a pool table, you're warm. So warm, you will be burning the roof of your mouth in 5 minutes biting into that hot cheese. You've been warned.Went here after multiple drinks by the pool and it totally hit the spot!  This place is the closest I've ever come to a real NYC slice in LV.  We got a slice of cheese, pepperoni and veggie which came out to $11.75.  That's STILL less than 1 piece of shrimp next door at Blue Ribbon!  I was surprised I liked the plain slice the best.  Not that their other ones weren't good.  Sometimes great pizza doesn't need anything else but sauce and cheese.  Wish there were more places to sit but not that big a deal with so much seating in the middle area of the 3rd floor.WHO: Any one of you who are craving pizza past midnight! =)WHERE: Inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel, on the 3rd floor. It is literally A HOLE IN THE WALL! I had to ask one of the front desk men where it was! There is no sign whatsoever, so asking is the safest way!WHEN: I have no idea when it closes, but it closes late! We went at 2am, and there was still a line to order!WHY: Thin-crust pizza is the way to go, THAT'S WHY!WHAT: Standing in the line, I was looking for some sort of menu, but there actually wasn't one! I was somewhat confused because I am so used to there being a menu explaining it all!When you get up to the counter, there are toppings you can choose from to make your slice of pizza to your liking, or there are also pre-made slices you can get! I just chose one of the pre-made slices that looked pretty interesting!On my pizza, along with the mozzarella cheese, there was another type of cheese that I didn't get to remember, but it was REALLY GOOD! I also had mushrooms and green peppers.  I did get to try the White Pizza from my friend!! That was actually one of the most unique slices of pizza I have ever tried!! Instead of marinara sauce, there was some type of garlic sauce under CHEEESE, CHEESE, AND MORE CHEESE! =D*NOTE: Try it out after all that partying one night! The line might scare you off, but it's okay- the line went by fairly fast!The allure of knowing something that only the "in the know" know has played into human behavior in seeking out food and drink since the time "Joe sent me" got people through the speakeasy door. Given the pizza joint at The Cosmopolitan is not listed in any of the hotel's customer collateral nor is it advertised on property and one has to both know it is there and how to get to it, my hubby and I figured this would be more the myth of "secret place" hype than good pizza. Happily, we were wrong.Finding ourselves at the Cosmopolitan about 1:30 in the afternoon one day last week and hungry for just a little something, we went to the Pizzeria. What we discovered is this teeny place makes really good pizza. In fact, my Brooklyn born and reared hubby thought it a good rendition of New York style pizza and coming from him that is high praise. It was the chewy, foldable crust, he said, and just the right amount of sauce and cheese. A generous slice was about $3.50 so a good value for Las Vegas eats. Pies are sold whole too. The VERY little pizza shop has standing at counter space for maybe eight - and another two spaces that are low enough to be used by both people in wheelchairs and shorter people...love universal access like that. But you could not get my claustrophobic self to stay in that little space to eat, so we walked to the lobby outside the Pizzeria and enjoyed our slice in that "game room" setting with a pool table, board games, low tables, chairs and sofas scattered about and multicolored glass lit ceiling above. And here goes a nod to the very nice Security guy who walked over to talk to us. "Oh oh" I thought, "we're probably not supposed to be eating pizza here." But as it turns out, he wanted to simply ask how we liked the pizza and being from New York himself, he agreed with my hubby that it was very good indeed. He introduced himself as Chris (Cosmopolitan staff do not wear name tags - a tactic that is part of a service strategy to get the employees to introduce themselves to guests) and asked if he could answer any questions about The Cosmopolitan for us. That kind of friendly approach from customer facing employees was consistent with every one of our experiences at the hotel, by with way, with the exception of the staff at the Chandelier Bar on the second floor.  ( But that's another review.)  We made sure to leave the lobby table as clean as we found it. Pizzeria opens at 11a.m. and stays open until sometime in the wee hours of the morning. Here's how to get there (see photos included to illustrate): a) Take the elevator near the Chandelier Bar to the third floor. When the doors open you'll see the lounge with the pool table in front of you. b) Make a hard right hairpin turn as you exit the elevator and you'll be in the short hallway that leads to the tiny Pizzeria.  You'll see a pinball machine at the end of the hallway. ( If you make only a right turn as you exit the elevator, you'll end up at the hallway that dead-ends in a concourse of meeting rooms. Ask me how I know that. :-)  A hairpin right is the thing. )c) The pinball machine you'll see in front of you as you make the hairpin turn is actually at the entry to the pizza place.So there you go!  Mangia!After hanging out at the Chandelier bar my friend Ashley was wanting a soda. Not knowing where to get one at almost 3am, she said to follow her, after going up a couple of escalators and down a narrow hallway the smell of pizza hit me in the face. OMG there is a hidden pizzeria in the hotel!!  Not only does this place have no name, you'll find no signage, and no menu. It's a very no nonsense New York-style pizza counter. To find it, look for the hallway wrapped in vintage records.There was a small line that was forming when we walked up. This place is super small and had limited seats (bar stools and a long counter). You can order a whole pie of just a couple of slices. Minh D decided to indulge in his pizza craving and get a slice which he ended up sharing with me. All i can say is wow this pizza tasted wonderful and full of cheesy goodness!! Ashley ordered a rootbeer (which has unlimited refilled as long as you are eating there). That rootbeer was the best i have had in a long time. Make sure you save your change because they have a classic pinball machine there too!!SECRET GEM!!! ... literally a secret, you can't even find this pizzeria listed on the cosmo's directory!!!its a CHEAP vegas meal option on the 3rd floor cosmopolitan in between 2 fancy restaurants.. behind a large wooden door w/o any name to distinguish it!!walk down the long hall towards the pinball machine & order pizza w/ fresh olive-oil-soaked-tomatoes on it YUM & only 4 something for this thin crust slice!!!i hope this small pizza place stays a secret =)If you are anywhere near the Cosmopolitan you must grab a slice of pizza here! At $3.50 a slice and $.50 per topping, this NY style pizza is just what one needs to curb that Vegas party appetite. Even better at 3 am after playing an awesome game of craps and lovely with a coke.The service is great here and just beware that if you want a whole pizza you should call ahead. There's almost always a line no matter what time of day or night you visit this hidden pizzeria. During my four day trip to Las Vegas I came back to the pizzeria three times. Now that I'm back in Honolulu I only wish I could magically transport myself down to that little hallway. Crispy crust, amazing pepperoni and just what the doctor ordered when you're hungry and waking up in Vegas!Yelp 365 Challenge: #34/365 (The Slice)It just cracks me up that this Pizzeria is still not getting any publicity on The Cosmopolitan's own website.  But that's not such a bad thing really, as it keeps the location mysterious and 'in the know' plus it makes it kind of fun in discovering it.  The spot is literally hidden from view and the only way I found it was when I saw some dude come out from a dark hallway with a big box of pizza.  I ordered two slices and they were delicious!  You especially have to try their White Pizza with Ricotta and Mozzarella Cheese.  It was my favorite slice.  Take a look at their slices......(http://bit.ly/1CK1fbR) they're huuge NY Style thin slices.  Very good and actually pretty filling.  The slices can range from $4.50-$6 depending the toppings which are a little pricey but considering that the slices are extra large and are very tasty, the price is pretty much justified.It's nice to see more quality pizza joints open up on the Strip.  With this spot and La Pizza, I'm glad that I can pick up a slice for a cheap lunch or even for a late night snack.  If you have a big group, you definitely can't go wrong with ordering a pie from here.Move. the. hell. over, Earl of Sandwich. I found a new late-night lover and it's NY style pizza in Vegas. My girlfriend raved about this place, while I rolled my eyes and insisted we go to Earl instead. She convinced me and we walked on over after a long night at the Marquee (both conveniently located in the Cosmo) and we were all speechless after our first bite. We ordered a combo of white cheese, sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms. I've never been a HUGE fan of pizza, but this thin, wide slice was simple and flawless. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=3cIZSbjXqJxr59N_84xHKQDo you remember when Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael (TMNT) ended their adventure by tearing down a slice of ooey gooey cheese pizza? WE FELT EXACTLY LIKE THAT (or at least I did).HELLOOOOO hung over food...vhere hve uuu beeeeen?? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=18_2XSMyx0Lwl2RWNkLMpgT.H.E. place to drag your post Marquee, hung over, puked out, makeup-less ass to stuff face....if you don't mind the walk of shame, that is.  Of course there are plenty of normal ppl (Meee) lining up for the delicious NY style pizza by the slice or box. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=4NbyT2TlL2PdMyrG-0BLLA$5 per slice or $22 per box, this baby is like the 2am diiiirty hot dog on Hollywood Blvd but better. http://www.yelp.com/biz/hollywood-blvd-hotdog-vendor-hollywood#hrid:HID2ZLJ9bBGibM5yP-NX3g Don't mind the wait, chat up the stranger standing in front of you or behind you and dont' judge if someone suddenly made a mad dash out to the restroom (comes standard when you are waiting with a bunch of equally boozed out crowd).I'm actually craving for a slice right now...mmmm....pizzzaaaaaThere are no signs leading you here, but it isn't hard to find if you know what you're supposed to be looking for. I'll decode it for you: 3rd floor where the pool table is, look for the hallway dressed in album covers & voila! Secret Pizza found! The first time I came here was in Jan but since enough alcohol will erase your memory, I couldn't remember a thing about that experience...except that a certain someone I was with, in all her drunken-ness, was claiming to be heiress to the hotel & all the equally-drunk boys around us believed her...I came here again last week, this time sober & therefore, able to write a (somewhat) coherent review. I had a huge slice topped with mushroom for about $5. Thin crust, not too oily & dee-lish with a few sprinkles of garlic powder & crushed pepper flakes. Limited counter seats, so be prepared to eat standing up. Uncover this yummy secret for yourself!You really should try out this secret pizza place called Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan. I admit it. While celebrating my 25th extravaganza in Vegas last week, I am guilty of being a repeat offender of Secret Pizza. For a bunch of girls (and boys) who revolves our schedules around eating and trying new places, I would say that is quite a compliment!Here's how it all started. Before we decided to go bar crawling in the Cosmopolitan, a local friend of mine told me that I should get the white pizza at Secret Pizza. Intrigued by this mysterious pizza joint and white pizza, the gang and I headed over in our tight dresses to devour some deliciousness. Being greedy as ever, I decided to go for their famed white slice and a combo. Halfway through, I realized my stomach is much smaller than I thought and had a difficult time finishing. The unique taste of the white pizza (composed of 3 different types of cheeses) had my taste buds jumping for joy but the familiar taste of the combo had me equally impressed.Secret Pizza makes me feel like I'm so "in the know". From the outside, no one would know what the hallway leads to. For those who rarely ventures off into random hallways, well that's their loss! I plan on coming back next time I'm in Vegas, so yelper's-- please keep the long lines as short as possible by keeping this place a secret!I remember VERY LITTLE of how, when, and where exactly the "Secret Pizza" place was, but I do remember the delicious aftermath.  After finding the "secret" hallway, we stormed in like gangbusters, asked the nice pizza man what was "good"  to which he rightfully suggested his own "meat lover's" version -- a seemingly off-the-menu creation concocted of pepperoni, sausage, peperoncinis, some other kind of meat, and some other stuff I'm failing to remember.  It was SO DAMN GOOD -- the not-so-soggy thin crust was absolutely what we needed, so much, that it got the stamp of approval from the two Manhattanites I was...ahem...dining with.  This WHOLE PIZZA easily fed 3 inebriated people or would feed about 37 models, 4 normal people or 15 people on a diet.  It should be noted that the two latter classes of people really don't belong in Vegas anyway.There is minimal seating inside, but you can take your pizza "to-go" and park it on one of the Cosmo's luxurious couch seating areas in the hall right outside.  Beer and wine only.Secret 1 - Yes, I was trying to look you in the eyes, but I'm a man and my eyes tend to stray.Secret 2 - I'm a bit shy.  So buy me alcohol and I'll open up a bit.Secret 3 - If you are female and I left you a compliment, it's likely I think you are cute.  Not so for men.No more secrets!!  I've given too much away--unless you go the Secret 2 route.Service - 5 StarsCleanliness - ExcellentPrice - Approximately $26.00 (The soon to be brother-in-law paid).Seafood - ??Meats - YesVegetables - YesDessert - Yes, Cannoli & New York Cheesecake.Fruits - N/AOther - (1) Located on Level 3 of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, (2) You will find it between Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill and Jaleo. (3) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here.  (4) Papst Blue Ribbon Beer is on tap here.  (5) Avoid the times 1 am to 5 am because that is the busiest times--that is when all The Situations and J Wowws come out from Marquee.  What was Ordered:Pizza with 4 toppings ($26.00) - A-Okay (3 Stars) - My sister and fiancé chose a 3 topping pizza.  One side was pepperoni and green peppers pizza.  The other side was sausage and roasted garlic.  All pizza here is thin crust and the large pizza has 8 large slices.  Here is the breakdown by slice:*The Crust - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - You are looking at approximately a 14" diameter of thin crust with tomato sauce and melted cheese.  One word comes to mind, "greasy."  *Sausage and Roasted Garlic - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - The sausage was good, but I think the Roasted Garlic was forgotten--maybe that's why they charged us the 3 topping price.  Plus, I do not think they gave us enough of the sausage per slice to make it more fulfilling.*Pepperoni and Green Peppers - A-Okay (3 Stars) - Probably the best combination of toppings that made the pizza tasty.  The pepperoni tasted like it was suppose to.  What brought this slice up a notch was the flavor of the roasted green peppers.  The Secret Pizza is really in a nondescript location--with no signage at all.  If you are near a random billiards table, you are in the right place.  The place is A-Ok, but I've experienced better.  Maybe if I was crazy drunk and just got out of the club, this place would have been rated higher.  Unfortunately, I'm sober.The secret is that it's really just OK pizza. Typical greasy under-the-heat-lamp pizza that tastes delicious if you're drunk but just all-right if you're sober. The flavors are as-is for the most part but you can accessorize for a price. The best part about coming here is that it is a secret - no signs or special doors, just a hallway. You feel special just to find it, along with the other, yeap I'm gonna say it, hipsters. IPA and PBR are flowing as well as wine and soda. Pinball machines are in check.About a year ago, I was aimlessly strolling thru the Cosmopolitan, taking in all the beauty that the hotel has to offer.  While walking around the Chandelier Bar on the upper floors, I stumbled across a long hallway lined with album covers, with a questionable ending.  What could be at the end? Narnia? Or the Springfield Mystery Spot, complete with Ozzie Smith? Of course, being the quizzical individual that I am, I walked down the hallway.  Couldn't believe what I saw...a walk-up pizza joint!Anyway, with over 500 reviews, I don't know how this is a secret anymore.  No sign, no advertising, but excellent NY-style pizza.  At $4.50/slice, with the Strip-markup, it's a pretty good value for wasteepants late-night munchies.  And if you're not ready to end the rager, they have beer and I think, boxed wine.This is obviously a place to go after a night throwin elbows at the club.  At times, I've seen the line full of button-down shirts, fist pumps, sky-high heels, and dresses that leave little to the imagination.  Sometimes the line is long, which is understandable given its popularity.  But they try their best to keep the line moving swiftly.I'm glad I stumbled onto this place, as it has become a staple when I visit.   I applaud the Cosmopolitan for this inspired idea.Who doesn't love a slice of warm, greasy, cheesy, goodness at 3am?Late night study session, putting the finishing touches on a major presentation, hard night of clubbing, end of a 24 hour session of hard core grinding on the green felt.  You crave it.  You gotta have it.  Once you do, you're smiling and loving life.That said Secret Pizza is more about the experience than food.  Decent New York style thin crust with a good balance of quality ingredients.  Tasty sausage, good quality cheeses, ripe acidic tomatoes.  Generous toppings but not overloaded.  Never too out there combos (ie,  CPK).  Is it the best pie in the US?  NO.  Not even the best in Vegas.  Inexpensive for the Strip (less than $5 a slice).  You get to play the cool, adventurer as you seek out it's goodness (exactly what the Cosmo is all about).  The best part, you can take your slice and eat it while walking through the casino and watch the envious drool.  One of them might even ask you where you got it.  The answer is obvious, "it's a secret".Sometimes, to experience the adventure is more important than the food.Recommended.I'm not good at keeping secrets, especially when it comes to food.But I'm gonna try my best in this review. Secret Pizza is a small joint, located down a long, secret hallway lined with music record covers on the third floor of the ___________hotel. Since SP is not listed on the hotels website or in their directory, nor do they have any signs indicating they are even a buisness, they can be hard to locate. Since SP is open till the wee hours of the morning, most people usually stumble in here in the early AM to cure their drunken munchies. Not me though. I stumbled in here right when they opened at 11am to cure my I just woke up and I'm hungry as hell munchies. All they serve here is pizza and beer. Simple. Delicious. You can buy your pie whole or by the slice. These are the slices my wife and I bought;1 white pizza slice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=24ppCiDbltVR9nt4spAUFQ1 sausage & pepperoni slice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=UGqPkyYuVIsLsjIN-UaEkg1 sausage & Pepperchini slice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=AwEEKS68Y2WnPRDIJYzHNgSince we got there right after they opened, each slice was just coming out of the oven. After waiting a few minutes to let the huge slices cool, I remember my girl Michelle T's warning about burning my mouth, my wife and I dug in. All three slices were great. They had lots of cheese and toppings, flavorful sauce and a nice, crispy crust. At $5 a slice, this is a great spot for a quick, tasty meal. If you can find SP, you definitely need to check it out. Just look for this hallway http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=JHsPAfv3yu3RrFNFO9qzFgI don't care how good yelpers think this pizza is.As long as they have those dehumanizingly long lines to get food, they are odorus cow-dung to me.If I had this business, I'd realize that the demand outstrips the supply, and following basic economics 101, (which obviously the owner did not take in college, if he even WENT to college), would lead me to open a second restaurant, somewhere else, to take care of the overflow.Man, I hate stupidity!If the lines at 3:00am are any indication, Secret Pizza is THE WORST KEPT SECRET in Vegas.  If the first rule of Secret Pizza is to not talk about Secret Pizza (right Yvette??  Haha), someone definitely wasn't paying attention!  Not that I have a problem that they did...because now I can write my review without having to feel guilty about it.Tucked away on the third floor and with no signage to point it out, finding the entrance is to literally look for a hole in the wall.  Once you do though, it's just a short trip down a hallway until you find yourself in a small room and in front of their pizza counter inside.  They offer a variety of pizzas by the slice at any given time, as well as whole pies that you can customize.  Since there was about ten of us there, we opted for two large pizzas - one with pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom, while the second had mushrooms, sausage, and green peppers (I think...didn't try that one).All in all, the pizzas were pretty solid.  There was a generous amount of tasty toppings and I liked how there wasn't a ton of sauce.  I certainly wouldn't say it's the best pizza out there, but it was good and a lot better than I had expected.  The best part of all though was their prices - at about $4-5 a slice and $22 for a three topping pizza, they're comparable to what regular pizzerias would charge and definitely budget friendly for the Strip.  As far as late night/post-partying food options go, Secret Pizza is a solid bet.  BTW, a word of advice from my friend - in your potentially inebriated state, try to remember to wait before taking that first bite.  You might not feel all that hot oil burning your mouth when you're drunk, but you'll definitely feel it when you wake up the next day ("Dude, my tongue REALLY HURTS").Review #700!  I love NYC pizza with a deep, lustful passion.  It plagues my dreams, calls out to me through windows with its seductive aroma, and makes me yearn for the next cheesy slice.  Secret Pizza is a place in Las Vegas that serves it.  My friend Grace C. went last year when Cella R. told her about it.  Ever since then, I've been plotting my return to Vegas and partaking in this secretive pizza joint.  My fellow elite Yelpers and I made our way over to the Cosmopolitan after a YEE at the Cathouse and ordered 2 pizzas ($50 total): one white pizza and one half pepporoni/ half sausage & mushroom.  It came out to about $5 per person.  Secret Pizza is located up on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan food court next to the sushi restaurant down an unmarked hallway.  There are white tiles and picture frames welcoming you into this unremarkable looking pizza place.  We ordered our pizzas around midnight and got them about 30 minutes after.  It seemed like forever to a slightly inebriated and starving person such as myself.  I was hungry and watching others get their slices before I did, was excruciatingly painful.  Drew M. started to play Donkey Kong while waiting.  Watching his arcade game progression only made me hungrier.  Where was this pizza anyway?!  Why didn't I just order a damn slice?!  Oh wait, there it is.  We brought it outside to the sofas & coffee table.  We dug in.  Silence.  Everyone is chewing and gulping their pizza in a very methodical fashion.  Delicious garlicky white pizza with greasy pepperoni pizza.  I was in heaven.  Was it the best pizza I've ever had?  No, nothing compares to real NYC pizza in NYC, but it comes close.  Too bad the crust wasn't as crispy as I would have liked but the flavor of the white pizza still makes me drool as I write this.  Pizza is the perfect food in the wee hours of the morning when all you want is carbs.  Thanks for making my pizza dreams come true, if only for the night!Secret pizza is the shit. Sober or drunk, it's worth the wait and the ridiculous conversations and interactions from all the sloppy mcsloppersons standing in line for a slice makes it quite entertaining as well. I liked the pepperoni, but I loved the white pizza with ricotta, mushrooms (?) and pepperoni! Just get a whole pizza for your group instead of ordering individual slices, because they're like the Pringles of the pizza world, once you pop you can't stop.For months I have wanted to sample the pizza inside the not so secret back room at The Cosmopolitan, but just never got around to it before now.  But once Tropfest ended, the planets finally aligned, and Diane and I quickly left the Boulevard Pool via escalator and easily found our way to this highly touted haven of late-night pizza at last.  The line to order was fairly long even after 1:00 a.m. on a Monday.    And, I quickly learned that if pizza slices rather than a full pie are sought, what you are able to get totally depends on what comes out of the pizza ovens just before one's order is placed.  But luck was with us on this visit, for we were able to buy fresh hot slices of pepperoni, sausage, and cheese pizza, plus commandeer two adjoining seats at the counter to be able to eat while sitting down.  Although I might have preferred slices of pepperoni & mushroom pizza, no such combination was available when I reached the head of the line.  But getting to try three out of four flavors is pretty good!I was really pleased with this pizza.  My expectations were high going in, but they were exceeded.  The crust was nice and buttery, with no char on the bottom.  While the wide slices were relatively thin, they were not noticeably so, and the nicely finished crust was chewy, resilient, and foldable.  All slices were just saucy enough, and really cheesy and tasty.  Pepperoni was lightly spicy, and sausage was very mild, just as pizza maker Luigi had indicated when I asked him on my way through the line.  A small amount of grease was present, but to me that was a good thing for this New York style pizza.  Even though they had come out of the oven just a few minutes before I reached the cash register, each slice was given a little more fire before they were handed to me.  So they were hot and gooey, and a true treat to consume whether drunk or sober.  For, I loved this pizza, and unlike many other guests, had only water to drink all night.  In fact, the Secret Pizza establishment graciously offers free cold water out of a dispenser, with plastic cups and utensils provided as well.  Besides probably being the cheapest meal available inside a Strip hotel, IMHO the Secret Pizza likely serves the best pizza on The Strip, and is neck and neck with Biaggio's and Metro Pizza, and just a shade behind Dom DeMarco's, for the best pizza served in the entire Las Vegas valley.  Next time I will be ordering a whole pie!I'm going solely off slice standards here. Fast (if you're just buying by the slice, not if you're ordering a whole pie), decently priced (for Vegas standards) and pretty tasty.Go with the white slice.  I thought it was white sauce (cream) but it was actually no red sauce, cheese, ricotta. Pretty good. I liked being able to add stuff to it (additional 50 cents per topping) but I wish they had some bacon. Better than the traditional pepperoni w/ red sauce that's for sure. And yea, it's thin crust and ultra greasy. If you're going to complain about grease, don't bother eating pizza. Do the world a favor and eat a damn salad with no dressing okay? I don't get why people order an entire pie and then whine and moan that it takes up to an hour. IT'S A FREAKING ENTIRE PIZZA IT'S NOT GOING TO BE READY IN 5 MINUTES PEOPLE. USE YOUR BRAIN.BOMB.com right here!  When you find it that is...Follow the chandelier up and then take the escalator up one level from Marquee.  Then follow your nose to the scent of PIZZA!!!!!!  (look for the hallway of vinyl)F that! I never get just a slice here, I always buy a pie, a whole one at that!  That way you can get half red sauce and half white!  Add your appropriate toppings and voila!  Dine inside or grab a seat by the pool table outside and watch all these people looking at you eating your huge slices!  The pizza here is really good and I actually favor the white.HOLLA!Secret Pizza is one of those establishments that really needs no introduction. At first glance, it is quiet, discrete, and no frills. Yet when you dig deeper and get to know its personality you find something so much more. I am a firm believer that every establishment has room for improvement. However, when I think about it long and hard Secret Pizza really epitomizes all I would want or come to expect of a pizza establishment. I almost dare say that it was the best pizza I have ever had. Nestled in the Cosmopolitan, you would think it would be flashy and glitzy. Rather, it defies that convention and it sits in a nondescript hallway that you would easily bypass. Not that I am saying you should go down every service hallway at the Cosmopolitan, I'm just saying taking the Star Trek like elevator to the third floor above the Chandelier Bar and walk down the nondescript hallway till you find Secret Pizza. Note, the hallway has photos on it to give you some direction.Once there, you will be greeted by the beautiful smell of pizza. While slices are available in the showcase, full pizza's are available as well. I'd probably call ahead if that is the case just to avoid having to wait. Since we didn't know any better, we settled on a simple pepperoni pizza. However as we waited to order, the guy working the counter clearly could tell we wanted a white pizza as well and mentioned that we could have a half pepperoni/half white pizza and it came out to be one of the best decisions we made in Vegas. The pepperoni was really good, but the white pizza was much better. Both offered really great flavors that melded in a perfect harmony that would make angels sing. The pepperoni has just the right amount of salt and spice to counteract the fat and sweetness of the mozzarella. While at the same time the white pizza was an amazingly good blend of ricotta and mozzarella cheese. Both on a thin crust that was easy to work with, yet not being very greasy at all. Service was good with the staff clearly not only knowing their menu but also clearly having skill when it comes to making their pies. They keep the line moving at a carefully timed rate as if it were a well-made machine.Definitely a great place to grab a bite, while they may not have seating grab a glass of wine or beer with the pie and head on out to the main areas. It is definitely one bite you do not want to miss."Get fcuked up, and eat pizza" - Old Eugine ProverbSome old Chinese fool tried to jack that shit from me and use it as his own.I'm going to lay it down on how to get to this place.   Do not deviate from these directions.-Walk by all the squealing Asian girls coming out of the club that think they're cuter than they actually are.  Actually...thinking they're cute at all is wrong.-Five steps past the white girls riding the escalator barefoot.  -Make a right when you see the Latinas showing off their newly acquired neck art ... hickies.-And when you see an angry black chick....run the other way.  Fcuk the pizza.Was the pizza really that good?  I don't remember.  My buddy liked it. I guess I did too.  Not as much as the Reyka tonics I was guzzling down at a frantic pace earlier. Evidently I waxed two slices, made it back to the room, and gracefully blacked out.   I woke up in the middle of the night with a shivering case of mud butt.  That means two things:  1. It was greasy2. It was goodI do faintly recall burping up pepperoncinis while on the throne.  I love those things.  Both the pepperoncinis and the porcelain La-Z-Boy.4 gleaming stars might be a bit too generous, but hell, aren't you all generous and shit when you get shitfaced?  Yeah...thought so."Secret Pizza" is not the name of this pizzeria.  It actually has no name, but Secret Pizza will suffice for now.It should be obvious by now that Secret Pizza is probably the worst-kept secret in Las Vegas.  Since everyone knows where it is already, I'll just go ahead and spill the beans -- Cosmopolitan hotel, third floor, tucked between Jaleo and Blue Ribbon Sushi, down the short corridor lined with vintage album covers.Okay, now that I said it, don't kill me, please?  This isn't Fight Club, right?I wasn't joking when I said everyone knows about Secret Pizza already.  The lines to eat here are obscene.  It's most popular in the middle of the night, when the post-Marquee crowd drops by to feed their drunken munchies.  However, when a group of us dropped by at 2pm in the afternoon, we still had to wait over 30 minutes just to reach the cashier.  Not that I minded waiting.  I could spend hours looking at the collection of vintage albums.  There's also pinball.  The pizzeria itself is decked out in gleaming white subway tile, in fitting with the New York theme.We shared a variety of red slices, some plastic cups of PBR, and a slice of cheesecake.  While the pizza was fresh and delicious, it was doused in enough grease to make the paper plate translucent in no time.  (Remember that episode of the Simpsons when Bart rubs his pizza on the wall and then the wall turns clear?  Yeah, like that.)  There is barely any seating inside the pizzeria, so we carried all of the grub to the lounge area outside.At $5 a slice, it's expensive, but not unreasonably so.  A better deal is ordering a whole pie.  I recommend that if everyone in your group can agree on a single topping.All in all, Secret Pizza is a solid place to go -- if for no other reason than being able to help all the other confused tourists who are curious to find out where you got your pizza and beer from.  :-)The first rule of Secret Pizza is: YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT SECRET PIZZA.Seriously, guys, the wait is getting ridiculous.Tips:- For full pies, call in your order for pick up in 30 mins.- It may smell irresistible, but do fight the urge to eat immediately. Otherwise, suffer from pizza palate.- Best spot for drunk people watching.This place is amazing. I'm not sure if i loved it so much because of how much i drank or if it really is as good as i remember but either way it hit the spot! 4 friends and i were leaving a concert at the boulevard pool and decided to finally try this place out. We got a large cheese pizza with banana peppers and sun dried tomatoes as toppings. So good. It was a bit greasy but after blotting that away it was near perfect. some of the best pizza in Vegas for sure. I like the whole gimmick of it being a "secret" too.Shhhh! Let me tell you a Secret about Secret Pizza....Secrets**Their White Pizza is off the hook!*Crust? Crazy Crispy Crust! Crunch with every bite!*SP is located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo*SP is open till Mon, Fri-Sun 11 am - 5 am Tue-Thu 11 am - 4 am*IPA Beer in tap*SP is really small! But who the "f" cares when your hungry!*SP sell by whole or by the slice.Secret Pizza Rocks ! Great place to grab a quick bite!My LV Trip Bookmark #2Let me get the logic behind Secret Pizza.  They're opened to 4-5 a.m.  The drunk and partially drunk slur their way in to get that "sober me up munchies" on.  Wouldn't you want a sign up to attract more customers?  How passively cruel is that to the wobbly and incoherent?   Wandering like zombies seeking to feed, one could only chuckle at the priceless visual as they search for Secret Pizza.  Contrarians (sober people) would say signs would defeat the purpose of their marketing goal...it wouldn't be called SECRET PIZZA...logic is never logic if drunk.Through the corridor on the right of the Japanese restaurant within the Cosmopolitan, you'll find Secret Pizza.  There I said it.  If that's not enough, you're probably too drunk to even eat.  Within this hallway is a massive collection of interesting prints of musicians.  I think they were musicians.  The pizza aroma pulled my attention away from the pictures.    My monstrous hunger, which developed from searching the menu, told me to get two slices.  Give up looking for a poster board list menu or what have you.  Just ask, because there are none.  Peering down through the glass, I eventually chose the meat lovers and the cheese with white sauce.  Pizzas are the thin crust.  My crusts were a tad burnt on the edges after the oven warm up; each crispy bite was filled with a healthy (so to speak) dose of cheese and ingredients.  Both slices were delicious.  Both had surprisingly good taste considering since they were just thrown into an oven and reheated for a minute.  No time for a sit down dinner, want a quick slice (or whole pizza), or need some grease to relieve your drunkenness.  Secret Pizza can be a strong option.  That is, if you can find it.Everybody knows that I love Pizza!  I also love the Cosmopolitan.  So, when I heard they had a Secret Pizza joint, I couldn't wait to give it a try.  I resisted the temptation to ask for help to find it and spent a good 2 hours looking for this place.  I finally gave up and asked an employee who gave me directions....they're not supposed to do that, LOL.The setup is like the typical street-side quick Pizza joints you find in major city downtown areas.  The Pizzas are pre-cooked and warmed up to order by the Slice or by the Pie.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=Z-z_DCestFY90vmHPj-iSg#Z-z_DCestFY90vmHPj-iSghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=LXFr4Kgn5aUPTV8pxEqIzQ#LXFr4Kgn5aUPTV8pxEqIzQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=JFQEuBrHJcjMJ1lqP_1HHg#JFQEuBrHJcjMJ1lqP_1HHgI ordered a Slice of Pepperoni & Sausage, my 'go to' order.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=Fk3XJrpND-_-Bu0XGSCbug#Fk3XJrpND-_-Bu0XGSCbugThe Pizza was reheated to a very hot temp and served on a paper plate.  The flavor was very good.  The Sausage slightly overpowered the Pepperoni, but they complimented each other well.Overall, it was a good experience and the Pizza was above average.Return Factor - 100%For someone who thinks pizza is overrated, I really like this place. But then again I've never been here sober and I probably never will.This is my go-to spot after drinking and dancing all night on the strip. I love the not-so-secret-now location and telling my out of towner friends all about it. I really love any pizza with the meatballs and I always have them add some pepperoncini's (sp) to it.The line can be hit or miss, but I've never waited less than 10-15 minutes every time I go there. It's just a fact of life that you're gonna have to wait a while so don't come here expecting prompt service. At least they have record covers of Italian musicians for you to stare at if you don't feel like staring at the fellow patrons in line. I was reminded that Madonna is Italian and learned that Chuck Mangione is a real person and not just a recurring character on King of the Hill. I tell you hhhwhat.LOVE THIS PLACE but if you don't know where you're going you'll never find it.  Rule number one of secret pizza, TELL EVERYONE!  Start by looking for the pool tables on the third floor, then search for a dark corridor lined with framed records that leads to a pinball machine, walk down said corridor and voila you're there...or you can just ask someone. LOL!This pizza joint is down an unassuming hallway close to the Marquee Nightclub. After a night of drinking, this is definitely a place to go. I don't think you can go wrong with any pizza here especially if you are buzz. The pizza costs $5 per slice and it's worth it!There were plenty of seating and  a big lounge area outside of the parlor. If Marquee is not popping, the wait is minimal and you can feel a bit more relax while scarfing down the slices. If it is, be ready to wait a bit!There's no signage so look for a hallway covered with records!We lost a good one; Ms Winnie H...  Vanished, kaput, finito, so long wherever you may be.  Such good things never last where all traces have disappeared and have gone without merit.  Secrets are kept and reasons retained under lock and key.  Whatever it may be, I dedicate this one to thee.After seeing so many reviews of this worst kept Vegas secret, I finally ventured up two flights of escalators in the City of Sin, where whispers stay and never leave closed lips.  The Cosmopolitan hide-out comes to light as one ventures down a dingy hallway of framed magazine covers dimly lit by spotlight halogen lights (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#4bjZhYMwuBLPOZoW6DI9MA).  It's but a small 60'x60' room filled with a few pinball wizards and people patiently waiting for a slice of heavenly pie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=o7wcJPIoRt13Dx7coGNEtw#o7wcJPIoRt13Dx7coGNEtw).  Behind the counter, workers pound and toss their gooey dough (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#lW79LoJSUg1RwIPrp_kAKw), making sliced triangles ranging from $4.50 on up based on 50 cents a topping.  For those with a more voracious appetite a pie be available with prices ranging from $25 to a deluxe of $35.00.  Pie additions cost $2.50 each.  Quite expensive, but not on my "Lost Wages" radar, as I wanted it by the slice and by the slice I did receive.  The toppings looked plain and just nominally adequate as they sit in their aluminum bins just waiting to be tossed sporadically on round pie pans laid with golden flour.  The prices of drinks are on par with private Taoish bars:  Sodas 4 bucks, IPAs 7 bucks.  Good Ol' PBR sewer agua a ghastly 5 bucks.We asked the chef what be best in his opinion.  Although we weren't really impressed with what was presented, we opted to go with his picks of white, deluxe, and veggie-tar-e-yan (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#VpTrXV0-B3IXvr2iCQiTtQ) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#ns2AT1cd63Rihd8BiVwDqw) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#Kh_DKlGnEKPQcgDBnzmw2g) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#yYP2x9gRAHoDEx9R5E_1dw).   Various choices to choose:(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#qCog__OGMqN2fhJxaHZx7w)(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#q3VPFuV-SQjXhIab6f_9aQ)We paid and waited just as patiently as others, noticing everyone kept within their small cliques, or busily eying their mobiles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#c9cbpz6hdIG_qINg5huokg).  The slices returned to the broiler and there they sat, until our names were called and then it begat!No idea if I be drunk or needed to be buzzin' to enjoy these hot tempting pie slices, but whatever it was, it really worked for me.  It was but a warm slice of heaven that was on par with some of the best I've put in my mouth without worrying about spitting up some hairball.  The crust was just crisp enough with the flexibility of NY-stylin' that wrapped around my hand.  Just enough grease and just enough cheese, the deluxe was nothing but 5-star tasting'.  We ate at the small alcove bar to take in and enjoy the happening surroundings.  I actually think the re-heating is probably the key to getting the crust texture just right.It was such a pleasure to finally unravel your secret, and while the surroundings are a bit crewed, as long as you're with friends or loved ones this place can satisfy any of your late night whims.  I will loyally keep the secret of this unnamed hallway as faithfully as a yelper should.  The last buck stops here (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA)!This place totally IS a secret. I had no idea where they were. I knew they were in the COSMOPOLITAN but once I got in I couldn't find them. There are no signs that point to their location that I knew of. The establishment itself didn't even have a sign upon entering. I found out that they were LOCATED on the 3rd floor of the cosmo. There is an entrance hallway next to the pool table and escalators. I should have looked on the yelp reviews but I didn't so I just asked a hotel worker. The ENVIRONMENT was exactly what I expected, SMALL with no tables to sit. They have a counter and that's about it. They do have an arcade machine which kept my son entertained while we waited. This place gets really busy so you will have to take your food to go (Don't know where though) or eat standing up. The SERVICE was not a good experience.  We were the only ones there at the time we walked in and we had no greeting whatsoever. Then, it took about a couple minutes for someone to even take our order. Next came the over promising. Since I ordered an entire pie, I was told that there was a pie in the oven and it would be about 10 minutes. That pie that was in the oven...you know the one the guy said was for us...well, it did not go to us. Nor did the second pie. On the third pie, we had to go back to the counter and remind them we were still waiting.  Only then did finally we get it. No apology. That is my pet peeve.   The QUALITY of the PIZZA was such a disappointment.  Since there were 5 of us, we just ordered the entire pie because it was a better value. Each slice is about 5 dollars and the entire pie is about 27 dollars depending on which one you get.  Our choice was pepperoni.  I understand that sometimes people can order the wrong item but, in this case, I doubt it would have made any difference.  First, their pizza is thin crust which is fine. I like thin crust pizza but the crust is very soft and limp which made it hard to eat. Kinda like a new yorker but worse..almost uncooked.  It just kept flapping all over the place and going limp just prior to getting in my mouth. Second, it was very very oily. I'm talking about Pizza Hut type sprayed on oil dipped in more oil. I had pizza juice running all over my hands and mouth.  Some of you might like that, which is totally cool but not for me. I am going to give it two stars though because I don't think I can ever give any pizza joint 1 star. Plus, the employees did speak in a friendly manner. Even though they did not serve us well.  Bottom line is, the name matches perfectly. Nobody should know about this place.I love this place! When you're wandering through the Cosmo, feeling broke as a joke after a night of gambling and/or partying, what a sight for sore eyes this place will be... once you find it, of course! Once you make your way through the narrow corridor lined with record covers, you'll approach what may be the most deliciously crispy pizza crust in all of Las Vegas!The prices are dirt cheap, the people are friendly, and they're open til 4am. How can I keep something so wondrous a secret???While walking around the Cosmopolitan hotel after a long night of partying, clubbing, gambling or lounging around, chances are that you'd probably be hankering for something quick and that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. (And chances are, you may have already lost an arm and a leg at one of the tables).In probably the worst kept secret about the hotel, Secret Pizza (honestly, I think the place has no official name and "Secret Pizza" just sorta became the de facto name over time) offers people from all walks of life a slice of New York styled pizza at reasonable prices in one of the swankier hotels on the Strip.Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan and tucked away in the restaurant area (read, baller food court), you'll see a hallway that could pass as a restroom access area. If you smell pizza and you see some old vinyls decorating the walls, you're on the right track. Just keep going and you'll soon be in line for pizza, made available essentially all day. You can also tell you're in the area once you start seeing more people walking or sitting around with pizza on paper plates.Secret Pizza has a couple pinball machines to keep people preoccupied a bit, as they scarf down that 'za. The quality (particularly of the pepperoni) is pretty damn comparable to New York styled pizza (for all I know, they could have brought some of the water to Las Vegas).A big slice and a drink can run you just shy of $10 bucks, which isn't bad, considering where you're at. They also serve beer, served in red plastic cups, naturally. After all, you need to keep that party mentality going back at the suite, right?My only suggestion is that the place consider a wider beer selection and offer glasses to drink out of. There's a considerable difference in drinking beer out of a plastic cup versus drinking out of a glass. Outside of that, I realized that it's the place's secretive location in a nice resort and design that has made it one of the best known places for a late night slice.This place is too good to keep it a secret!! It is hidden on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, but just follow your nose and you'll find it. What makes Secret Pizza so good is the crust. It was a NY style thin crust, but it was so crispy and flaky, and not soggy at all. I wish I could have tried the Sicilian deep dish pizza, but they didn't have any cooked at the time. Next time I'm in Vegas I will absolutely be back!!This place really is a secret!Approaching my Vegas trip, a friend told me to check out this place in the Cosmopolitan hotel.  I don't know how he found out about it, but apparently this place had really good pizza and was hidden somewhere in the Cosmo.  Oh it was hidden all right.  When I jumped on the Cosmopolitan hotel website to find a list of their restaurants....no listing for this place.  Luckily I stumbled on it here on Yelp, listed as "Secret Pizza".I followed other reviewers' directions and hints for finding the place: it's down a sorta-hidden hallway next to the pool tables on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo.  We could smell pizzas in the oven once we got to the 3rd floor, so we knew we were in the right place.  Even in the hotel there was no mention of this pizza place and no signs pointing towards it.  Even the restaurant is unnamed!But my friend was right, the pizza was delicious (although I think its novelty partially adds to the taste, haha)!  Crispy crust, fresh-tasting dough, and a delicious blend of cheese/sauce as topping!  I got the white pizza (feta and mozzerella cheeses instead of tomato sauce) with mushrooms on it.  I guess because mushrooms aren't a super popular topping, the chef just put raw mushrooms on a slice of white pizza before sending it through the oven to heat it up.  It's okay; still super good!!White pizza with mushrooms - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=RcmzA0Mj4T73Ytmdtj-ByQ#RcmzA0Mj4T73Ytmdtj-ByQWe lucked out coming in at 2pm, which I guess isn't part of the lunch crowd, so there wasn't a line.  However, I've heard there can be a pretty long line for this place, especially in the wee hours of the morning when the nightclubbers come out of Marquee.Good luck! :)Secret pizza is delicious. Definitely a hidden gem... Although I don't know if it is really a secret anymore, as any time I go there there's a line around the block. I'll admit waiting in line can be fun. The late night line (the only kind I've been in) is usually filled with drunken out of Towners and club goers. Everyone is usually is fun spirits, don't expect to make laying friendships, but definitely a enjoyable way to wait for your turn. Staff is fun & friendly, major respect to them for that. I'd hate dealing with all the drunks, if I weren't drunk myself that is. The pizza speaks for itself, simply delicious. If you are at the Cosmo, hungry and have some time, this is the place for you.Went here on the recommendation of a couple of my Yelp friends (CD and Evelyn). It's located in the Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor, but unless you ask someone that works there, you may have difficulty finding it, since there are no signs indicating what it is, or where it is. The entrance is just a long hallway that looks like it may lead to a restroom, but surprise - at the end of the hallway is a small pizza kitchen. Seating can be sparse, so be prepared to eat while standing.  I don't know if it's my timing or what, but many times, when I visit an establishment, there are only a handful of people around. 10 minutes later, the place gets seemingly packed. That was the case here too. Got a slice of both the White Pizza, and the Sausage Pepperoni. I can't write too much about the White Pizza, because it's irresistable and now I feel compelled to drive all the way to the strip from Summerlin, just for a slice. It's that good! It's funny observing some of the people in line - the closer they get to the cash register, the more they seem like they are drooling, Lol! As I was leaving, I noticed one of the pizza cooks pulling a deep-dish white pizza out of the oven. Oh... I want that!!! must... delay... gratification...  :P~~Psst...over here, pal. Youz like da slices do youz? Well, here's a little secret just between youz and me pal ... Down a non-descript hallway lined with album covers in the Cosmopolitan Hotel youz can find Secret Pizza. No matter how much you lose in Vegas, save $5 for some 5-star pizza. Shanon Y. was right about the White Sauce Cheese Pizza. It's a pizzagasm in your mouth of grease, cheese, and crust. There is only enough room for a few places to stand and eat at Secret Pizza ... Lots of families and groups were buying whole pies and chowing down in the hallways and lounge areas. It has no sign. It has no name, but the secret is out about Secret Pizza.Located on the third floor by the pool table in the Cosmo, you'll find a long dark hallway flanked with vintage record covers leading to a small pizza joint serving freshly baked pizza pies. It's really no secret that the secret pizza puts out some of the best late night eats this side of the strip! But most importantly, if you're staying at the Cosmo, there's no need to trek out in inclement weather or battle the strip crowd for good grub either.  Thankfully, on the late night I stumbled in, the line wasn't too obnoxiously long. Be warned, on certain nights when the Marquee or Chelsea has an event, you could be waiting for quite awhile for your slice, so plan accordingly! Overall, the pizzas are very tasty. Thinly sliced NYC style (for you to fold and eat)with a variety of topping options. My personal favorites are the works and white pizzas. They've got loads of condiments like oregano, granulated garlic, cheese, chili flakes etc for you to customize your pies, well. Happy Eats!$5 a slice!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=X6KFkFPwPA8My53L3XTX4g#X6KFkFPwPA8My53L3XTX4gSure them be some damn good slices of NY style pie, but damn Gina, even in Vegas $5 felt a bit steep for cheese and bread. Just know that if you go on any busy night, it will be a long wait in a long hallway. Bring some drinks or something to kill the time. If the line is out of the hall, expect to wait almost an hour for above average $5 a slice pizza.Secret Pizza, you sneaky little devil. This pizza joint, if I recall, is located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan. Once you step off the escalator, look for a nondescript hallway, no signs, no nothing but  quite possibly a looong line of people. Congratulations, you've unlocked their "secret" venue, now prepare yourself for a good 30 minute wait. I won't lie. It's pretty much torture, especially if you've found yourself here after club hours like myself. You can try your best to entertain yourself with the semi-neato-skeeto album covers but who are we kidding, anytime you get a whiff of that delicious pizza or someone exits the venue and walks past you in that narrow hallway, you're reminded how you're STILL in line and STILL not stuffing your piehole with, well, pie.After you've managed to snake yourself to the end of the hallway, you can start eyeballing which pie is destined to be yours, individual slices or a whole pie? I opted for the latter and had to wait longer but it was worth it. I got half mushroom & pepperoni and the other half was ricotta and garlic. I enjoyed both types immensely but favored the white pizza and would gladly bathe in slices of this pizza - so good! Uber good!!Pizza had a nice chewiness and the cheese was cheesy goodness. Definitely hit the spot! I ordered a large pizza and ducked out to one of the open tables just to the left upon exiting the hallway and inhaled my little slice of heaven.Oh, by the way. You might see some unusual happenings while in line. For instance, one girl got to the cashier, turned around, lifted her dress and shook what her mama gave her. My friend and I turned to look at each other and mentally said, "Did you just see that?" while one other patron yelled out "Does that get you free toppings?" Hahah, we all laughed.Anyway, duty called (boyfriend back in hotel room patiently waiting) so I paraded out of The Cosmopolitan and made my way over to MGM. Unfortunately BF was passed out, sad story for him, but happy ending for me: I plopped down in our living room and helped myself to another slice :)So my verdict?Worth the wait? Unfortunately yes.Will I come back? Oh you betcha'Will I save pizza for the next morning? No, it's definitely better hot... unless you have access to a microwave!Authentic New York Pizza hidden in an uber modern, posh Las Vegas Hotel and Casino. Secret pizza is located on the third floor of the Cosmo. If you see a hallway with old, kitschy records (vinyl y'all) and what appears to be a pin ball machine, winner, winner chicken dinner! Follow your nose and prepare to drool. It's like the hole in the wall pizza by the slice places in NYC. There are no thrills. A pizza counter and guys making fresh dough and heating slices. A single slice is HUGE and is $4.50/$5.00 a slice. Trust me, you'll only need one.  They also sell whole pies, beer, soda, and 2 liters.My favorite is the White Pie is my favorite. Garlicky, creamy, gooey dough heaven. My second favorite is the plain cheese. How you know the pizza is good? My mama is a New Yorker. She taught me that when you pick a slice up, the bottom half is droopy and the slice can be folded in half (taco shape). Secret Pizza does alllllll of this.Pro Tip: If you don't want to brave the strip, the same delectable pizza is available on the West Side of town by Those Guys Pies.I haven't had pizza in the longest time ever because my diet's pretty low carb, but in vegas it completely went out the window! Anybody that personally knows me, knows that I'm one indecisive girl when it comes to food cause I wanna eat/sample everything. We were staying at Aria and they have Five/50 pizza bar there which I wanted to try, but I also wanted Secret pizza. Luckily, my bf was sweet enough to run to both places to buy slices and bring it back to the room at Aria for us :)Normally the line is crazy packed out the door, but luckily my bf didn't have to wait long. We ended up getting the white pizza w/ sausage and mushrooms. I was surprised the pizza was still nice and warm when he got back to the room. I was a bit scared at first because all the reviews kept saying it's super oily, but this definitely was NOT the case for us! Compared to Five/50 pizza in Aria, Secret Pizza was way better!!I've had really good pizza in NY and the pizza here was a NY style big slice (big, foldable, and not too much sauce). It held up the toppings and everything nicely. The crust had the perfect crunch and texture. They were also generous w/ the toppings here especially the sausage. I mean you can see the whole sausage link on my pizza. I really liked the cheese on here too, it didn't have the stinky cheese smell. The roasted garlic spread smothered on the white pizza was sooo robust and good!! The white pizza consisted of various cheeses as well, the ricotta stood out and tasted fresh.FYI: We came here once after clubbing and got lost trying to find it. No wonder it's called secret pizza lol.-It's located at the very top floor of cosmo (3rd) where all the fancy restaurants are. Look for a hallway w/ vinyl CD records and you'll find the hidden gem!-It's more of a go in & grab a quick slice place, there aren't chairs for you to sitThis place was super hard to find!  I was pretty tipsy and all I remember was going through different sets of elevators and escalators, past swanky lobbies and convention rooms, and suddenly I was walking down a hallway of vinyl records filled with other drunken people.  You'll smell the place before you see it...IF you see it!Was led to Secret Pizza by Mr. Dubs for some late-night munchies to soak up the booze that wouldn't leave my system.  I had a hankering and Pizza was calling my name.  Heeding Siren's call, this place was suggested to me after Mr. Dubs' own drunken adventures with his crew.  We ordered four slices and took it back to our room.  Eating pizza on the balcony of your Cosmopolitan suite is pretty amazingly epic when it's 4 in the morning.Maybe it was the alcohol but sinking my teeth for that first bite of cheesy meaty goodness was amazing.  New York style thin crust, some cheese drag action, and a generous helping of toppings.  I'm in Heaven.  It's not the best pizza ever or even the best slice on the Strip but it's pretty darn good and nicely priced!  At $5+ a slice, it was great.  The slices are gigantic and I only ate one slice out of the two that I ordered.  Passing out in a food and booze coma afterward resulted in the best sleep ever.  Hurray for Secret Pizza!Vegas just wouldn't be the same for me without multiple visits to Secret Pizza! It's been a good two years since my last trip to Sin City and I'm proud to say that it's still the real deal! I took a girlfriend here with me on our first night and at 3am it was still open and still in the same spot on the 4th floor of the Cosmo. She marveled at how there's no signage, no listing, and I replied "That's why it's a SECRET! Lol" Even at 3am there's a long line but thankfully everything moves pretty quickly. True to Vegas party scene everyone in line with us was pretty much wasted and the folks behind us were obnoxiously drunk. We finally got to the front and the pizza guy chit chatted with us about what slices they were offering at that time. I honestly marvel at how nice everyone is at Secret Pizza because if I had to deal with all the tomfoolery I don't think I'd be nearly as patient. We each got two slices and a Coke to go. The prices have gone up from $3.50 to $4.75 per slice with an additional $.50 per topping. Still not so bad when you consider that you're in a very touristy area and it is 3am. Overall still a really great experience and literally a "hidden" gem on the Las Vegas Strip. We came back the next night again for Secret Pizza as we were hanging out at the bar and my girlfriend came back a third time the next night because she wanted to make sure she got another slice before we headed back home! Now THAT is some gooooood pizza folks! May you be very lucky during your trip to Vegas and may your stomach be blessed with the deliciousness of Secret Pizza!!!Seems like every time I go to Vegas I end up at Secret Pizza. It could be months, even years, between Vegas trips and yet Secret Pizza is that go-to joint when you need great tasting grub that is cheap and will fill you up. Its especially the place to go late at night. First-timers in Vegas will ask you where you got that huge pizza slice. Its a nondescript shop with no signage so for anyone wanting to find this place you pretty much just take the Cosmopolitan escalator all the way to the top floor, spot the narrow entranceway where people are walking out with boxes of pizza.If you go before people are let out the clubs, its a brisk stroll up to the front of the line and the pizza comes out as soon as you put in your order. The combo deluxe slice is my favorite ($6.00) but I had the Veggie too and it was not bad. Seems like all their pie slices hit the spot. Plus, its always comforting to see the same dude in the New Era baseball cap working here every time I come. Not really a secret anymore but still churning out great pizza. This place is awesome.Except that one time Joe Thornton from the San Jose Sharks was a douchebag and tried to cut everyone. Thats a story for another time...Tip: There's a nice spot with couches around a pool table where you can enjoy your pizza away from the cramped close quarters of this narrow pizza joint.I've heard so much about Secret Pizza over the last year or two...everyone either loves it or hates it, and there doesn't seem to be much in between.I'm right in the middle on my decision...I arrived at Secret Pizza about 10pm last night with my tequila boyfriend (my best friend, since my fella is not a tequila fan) and some Yelp friends...and some new friends we had made at the AWESOME margarita festival at the pool.  We were very intoxicated, and in need of pizza!The wait wasn't bad, especially since we got a whole pizza.  Service was pretty standard...not overly friendly, but not super happy to have a room full of drunk guests.  At my level of drunkenness, I think the pizza was the BEST pizza I've ever eaten.  Now, you also have to keep in mind that I've been dieting for 8 weeks, and have been craving pizza, too, so I'm sure that figured in a bit.It was hot...it was greasy, it was smothered in garlic...(well, that was our fault...didn't realize the "Parmesan cheese" we were putting on the pizza was actually garlic salt!)...it was good!Now, I'm going to have to try it again stone sober to see how I feel about it...you know how everything tastes good when you're intoxicated...I'd like to make sure that I don't need to drink 26 margaritas again to enjoy it.The SECRET is out.Well, at least I'm not kept in the dark about the secret anymore.  Thanks to fellow yelper, Rod U, I was finally became aware of the secret location of this pizza mecca that everyone seemed to know of except me (at least until recently).I think the "secret" is more the location versus the actual pizza itself.  You'll find this small pizza parlor/station at the end of a very nondescript hallway in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  After walking past pictures and portraits of various people, you will soon reach the secret pizza.Order by the slice or the whole pizza.  Go big or go small, it's your choice.  For me personally, I chose a slice of pepperoni and that was it.  Was it the best pizza I've had?  Was it worth the all the wait to finally eat this slice of pizza from the mysterious and difficult-to-find pizza palor?  Well, let's just say when you're hungry any slice of pizza will satisfy your appetite.  NOTE:  Slice of pepperoni was $5.25.  Absence of seating.  Stand and eat at the available counter space or go find some tables and eclectic chairs within the Cosmo.SERVICE:  Quick, courteous, and efficient.BOTTOM LINE:  Secret no more!  I'll be back!After years of clubbing at Marquee and having Secret Pizza bookmarked, I finally got the chance to eat here during my last Vegas trip in October. We'd gotten our stamps at Marquee and with re-entry privileges, we decided we didn't want to wait in the club for Porter Robinson to go on and should grab some food 'cause we were starving.The entrance of Secret Pizza is through a tiny hallway on the 3rd level of Cosmopolitan, in between this restaurant and elevator outside the Marquee ticket holder entrance and re-entry line. There was a short line at 11:30 pm, which moved quickly. I got a slice of NY-style Cheese and Craig P. went with a slice of deep dish. Tasty and pretty standard in terms of what you'd expect. Way later in the evening (morning?), some of my friends brought back an entire Secret pizza to the hotel for some amazing drunchies. Cold, but still very good!There's no seating, only standing room with counter tops along the wall for you to stuff your face. However, you can eat in the resting area right outside; there are plenty of sofas and chairs, as well as a free pool table.Great option if you're clubbing and hungry during or after.This place should be called "incredibly packed pizza" because that's what it is. Secret pizza was a lot better when it was actually a fucking secret. The 1st time I came here I was able to walk right in at 4am, get my pizza, high 5 my friends & get my drunk ass back to my hotel. Now you walk up and wait in a line for 45 minutes. All that annoyance aside, the pizza is actually good but you're definitely getting ripped off as a slice will run you a cool $5+ depending on toppings.They should limit how many pizzas 1 person can buy. MFers be walking out with like 5 pizzas with a line out the door & then trying to sell it for double the price outside.Definitely a good place to go if you're just escaping Marquee. And I know you just got out from the horrendous stairway, so now you're suddenly starving. The sweet smell of cheese and tomato sauce isn't helping, just follow your nose and it will lead you to the secret hallway to the place they call Secret Pizza.If you found the secret because the line is a mile long, sorry it's going to feel like a century to get in. I would avoid it between 12-2am, but they close at 5, so get your timing right! You can always call for a whole pie. The prices are pretty cheap for Vegas.For those not staying at Cosmo, it's great because there is plenty of seating outside.I like to keep some of my beloved places a secret, but facing nostalgia at its best, saving Secret Pizza as my secret is cruel for pizza connoisseurs. The fanciest pizza I've ever tasted was anything of the ordinary from the countless pizza parlours of Italy. To me, margherita pizzas were a real treat, gently wrapped in parchment paper at 2€ a slice, and an additional 1,50€ for sea salted chips. However, there is something different about Secret Pizza. You can find this little gem on the third floor between the corners at the Cosmopolitan. Purchased by the slice or by whole, the open face kitchen allows you to choose your slice of heaven from white pizzas to red pizzas. When I first tasted Secret Pizza my friends purchased whole pies of everything pizza and a pepperoni pizza, and even at 2am, they were outstanding & melty, just the way I like my cheesy pies. On my last trip here I tried the white ricotta + sausage pizza which is now my only preference. Full of flavour with just the right strength of spice & herbs, this pizza was a winner on my taste buds. Keep in mind that the line to Secret Pizza is absurd; I think the best option is to telephone in your whole pie only. Although I am not a pizza aficionado like I used to be when I was under 10 years old, I love Secret Pizza so much that I would purchase a whole pie for myself, even if my companion didn't like Pizza Secret! xI was staying at the Cosmopolitan and heard about this place but, since I had meetings at most of my meals during my stay, it wasn't the sort of place that fit my schedule.But, on the day I was leaving Las Vegas I wanted something quick and filling to hold me over until I got back to Phoenix and I hunted this place down.I guess when The Cosmopolitan first opened it was fun finding this "hidden" place. But, the word it out and other yelpers have even posted photos of the hallway to look for.  However, if you aren't paying attention and maybe you're a bit hung over it would be possible to walk right past it.They mostly serve pizza by the slice with a number of selections available so you can go in, order, eat, and leave.  They'll also make you a pie but you'll have to wait for it.The pizza is NY style and it was excellent! By Las Vegas standards, not too expensive.Great spot for a good casual meal off the beaten path.Literally, THE best pizza I have ever had in my entire life! When's used to live in Las Vegas- I worked at Marquee day club. I would try and come here after every shift (pizza is not the food to eat to be in bikini shape btw)Sometimes there is a very long wait, and most of the time I would skip my way to the front of the line- and upset everyone. Every single pizza here is amazing. My favorite is the white pizza- but can never go wrong with a classic cheese or pepperoni. This is the must eat at place while in Vegas... If you can find itOf course this place hidden. Is there a sign that says the name? Of course there isn't. What about a listing on the directory? You won't find any. Of course.Open almost 24/7, late night grubbers should trek up on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel to find this gem. A dark hallway of record covers adorning the walls can be found near the pool table that will lead you to this tiny and very casual joint. Serving NY-style pizza, the crust is crisp-thin (eaten folded) and is piping hot from the oven with a good sizzle from the cheese. A slice will cost you about $5 and some change. I say it's a bit steep but for each bite I took, nostalgia overtook me only proving that these were the closest I've had (from the west side) to eating a good ol' NYC pizza. I got their PEPPERONI, a classic that I couldn't resist, and WHITE PIZZA which I think was mighty fantastic. If you only have room for one, I highly recommend the latter. Trust.I hear ordering a whole pizza can make you skip the line but lucky for us, there wasn't a crowd that one weekday afternoon we went. P.S. Secret Pizza, please refill your table napkin containers. All were empty when we went.The secret's out! Any place with long lines and mediocre food just isn't worthy of my time...Honestly there is nothing amazing about this pizza! It's too oily for my taste.I ended up coming to Secret Pizza as someone had recommended it to my cousin and he wanted to try the place out. Secret Pizza is on the third level of the Cosmopolitan inside a small alley sandwiched between two other places whose names I don't remember. Secret Pizza is more like a take away stand with a handful of barstool type seats along the wall to eat your pizza. The menu is simple, basically New York style thin crust pizza that is sold by the slice (~$6). There are basically two types of pies that you can get the regular peperoni pizza which has the regular red sauce or the white pizza which basically uses ricotta & mozzarella cheese as the base. We decided to get a whole three topping white pizza (~$40) and went with meatballs, half peperoni and half mushrooms. After this it was a 15 minute wait in which time the pie was freshly baked and come out piping hot.Upon receiving the pie the first thing I noticed is that it was pretty big but the toppings were sparse covering only 65% of the pizza leaving a large outer crust bare. As soon as I picked up the first slice it was clear that it was extremely oily. I've eaten pizza's in NY so I was expecting a little grease but this was way too oily and not in a good way. The pizza itself was great. I don't like super crispy crusts that result from overcooking thin crust pizza's so I was happy that this crust had the right amount of flexibility that allowed you to eat the slice by gently folding it. The ricotta & mozzarella cheese base was excellent and had the perfect amount of seasoning. Unfortunately a tiny amount is put on very much like the other toppings. Pricewise I felt that it was relatively more expensive when compared to other joints on the strip even after giving it the Vegas Strip plus large Casino handicap especially looking at the miniscule amount of toppings.One last comment would be that this place is super popular and is a testament to word of mouth that spreads by social media. In the 25 minutes that we spent eating the pie on the 3rd floor lobby we were approached by no less than 6 parties asking us for the precise location of secret pizza. Anyway I doubt that I will return for a super expensive slice of above average pizza.Nestled on the third floor of the charming Cosmopolitan, Secret Pizza is the food equivalent of Platform 9 3/4.  Slice for slice, Secret Pizza is probably my favorite Vegas institution (over the traditional staples such as Earl's, Pink's, etc.) to visit for all my late night fatty indulgences.  Secret Pizza delivers the quintessential New York style slice: a sparing amount of zesty sauce and cheese without an abundance of toppings. The crust is thin and crispy while the base holds up well for folded consumption rapidly.  You should probably order at least two slices.  I've gone so far as ordering 4 slices at once and even a whole pie.  The variety of slices differs by the day.  If you want something that isn't featured on the display, you'll need to go ahead and order a pie.  Always order it with a beer.My addiction is out of hand.  I once left Hakkasan early just so I could beat the lines and get my hands on these slices (wait times around 2-3 am are approximately 30-45 minutes). On most trips, I'll go at least once.  Other times, I'll venture here two or three times.  When I stayed at the Cosmopolitan for my birthday, I had it three times in one day.  I know - I'm one sick puppy.In need of some late night bomb pizza?  Look no further... well, you may have to search a little to find this sucker.  Secret Pizza is located on the third floor fairly close to the pool table.  There, you'll see a hallway that'll take you to your delicious pizza destination.The slices are ginormous!  If you're in a group, I'd recommend getting a whole pie for two reasons.  1 - Price!  It's cheaper to buy a whole pie rather than purchasing piece by piece.  Just be ready to agree on toppings.  2 - They cook it from scratch on the spot.  Although the pizza is still good when they take each slice from under the heat lamps, but it just tastes so much better when your pizza comes out fresh.  If you opt for a pie, get ready for a little wait (~30 minutes).If you're in the Cosmopolitan and in the mood to grub (nudge nudge, for those drunken nights after hitting up Marquee), definitely take the time to find this joint.  It's probably the most price conscious and tasty meal you'll find in this hotel.I remember coming to Secret Pizza like a year ago, so I decided to come here again to see if it was still as good as I remembered it to be. It's located in the Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor across the billiard tables and chandelier. There's an element of mystery when trying to find this place because the hallway leading up to the actual pizzeria has no signage or pizza advertisements. You can easily find it, though, when you see people walking out of the hallway carrying their food out... I felt like Alice going to Wonderland except there's pizza on the other side, and not talking flowers and such. It's kinda cool knowing that this place is literally a hole in the wall, especially since the NY style slices offered here are really good.The interior is pretty small and it can get packed so fast. There's very limited seating (I only saw like two or three chairs) and then the rest is standing area. There's a few arcade games in there as well. Overall, the pizza was slightly doughy and had a bit of crunch to the bottom of the slice. I had two slices of pizza: a white pizza slice and a mushroom one.The white pizza with ricotta was so good. I think the ricotta elevated the flavor of the slice because when I bit into it, my mouth was hit with the rich, cheesy goodness. The mushroom pizza didn't really have that strong of a mushroom taste, probably because the mushrooms were more like small bits scattered all over the pizza slice. It had a very subtle mushroom flavor going on. I ended up spending $11 on the two slices of pizza. I think the pizza is a little pricey (what isn't on the strip?), but so worth it. In my opinion, I'd say I believe in the hype this place has got. It can get crowded and you may bump elbows with other people if you dine-in, but this place definitely did not disappoint!The not-so-secret, Secret Pizza!  If you're a Vegas veteran, then you know that this place gets PACKED during the peak hours, aka after club hours. Secret Pizza is located on the 3rd level of Cosmopolitan and it's not hard to find since there always seems to be a line of people in a small hallway.Honestly, I don't even know what slices I've tried but I've enjoyed them all.  I have yet to try their popular White Pizza, but they're all really good.  1 huge slice will cost you about $5-$6. Not too bad considering it is Vegas... and the pizza is actually good! Its always served piping hot and I love how the cheese is all melted and stringy with each bite.  Yum.  No complaints here!I would say definitely hit this spot up if you're staying at the Cosmo of if you're leaving Marquee !Who hasn't heard about Secret Pizza at this point? Definitely lives up to the hype BUT I can't decide if inebriated me prefers pizza or the ever-so-comforting Earl's. However, if one is at Marquee, I don't see why not! Just look for the hallway! TIP: Just order a whole pizza in advance and pick it up. It's cheaper than buying individual slices &  you don't have to stand in line.Sorry not sorry! 3.5 stars in my book. I don't get what the hype is all about!!! Maybe people love it cuz they are drunk and just think it's so good but me I wasn't drunk and I had this place twice during my stay at the Cosmopolitian and both times it was good but it wasn't thay greatttt that people make it seem. Yes the pizza is thin and the cheese sauce is good but that's really all. It's good but not the best. The guys working here are super nice and $5.00-5.50 for one freaken slice of pizza is really not worth it. I wouldn't rush back I think there are plenty of other options for pizza on the strip. I do like that it does have a cool hidden secret look to it when entering but other than that nothing to rave about.White slice with tomato. Do it now! $6/slice may be a bit much, but I've been officially converted. The pepperoni is fine but the signature white pie is actually worth the hype: garlicky, cheesy, just a little bit gooey, and those tomatoes just make it extra special. Service is friendly, spot is bare-bones but in a good way, snag a stool if you see one available!Note: Some people take the "secret" part a little too literally- it's not on any maps or even the Cosmopolitan website. Go to the 3rd floor with all the other restaurants, and find the hallway between Blue Ribbon Sushi  and Jaleo.Yummy pizza that will satisfy you after a night of clubbing, drinking, or if you're looking for a snack. This is located upstairs in the Cosmo on the right side of where you'd enter for their club/pool parties. There isn't a name, but instead a long hall with pictures that you walk down in. Luckily every time I've come here there wasn't a line. You pick your slice, they warm it up, and you pay. Easy concept and quick bit to eat. Will run you about $5-$6 depending on what kind of slice you get. Good crunchy texture but a bit oily. Guess that's what your napkin is for!
Reathrey Sekong=I had lunch at Sekong by Night with a couple of foodnik friends on its second day of business.  Overall the experience was worthy of four-stars. First, the design - it appears to have formerly been a Mexican restaurant and an Italian eatery of sorts, and vestiges of both decors abound, though the owners have gone to great lengths to give it an Indochine feel. All around a pleasant dining atmosphere with spacious booths flanking a long table that would be suitable for a large group.The food was great; it was like Vietnamese food's understated cousin, which I guess it technically is.  The menu offered a handy guide to the meals, and often compared a dish to it's Vietnamese counterpart.  I had a spring roll, which was large and delicious. The fish sauce it came with appeared to be nuoc mam, but was a little sweeter than the nuoc mam at other places around town. Katheaw is the Cambodian cousin of pho, and in presentation looks exactly  like pho (vermicelli noodles in a broth with meats and vegetables); the broth, however, bore no taste resemblence to pho broth, and if anything tasted more like chicken noodle soup than pho. I opted for the Katheaw Phnom Pehn, and while I found it delicious, be aware that it is offal-heavy, and if you don't like the taste of liver, you won't like the amount they put in it.  My lunch companions' meals looked delicious, and I had a taste of one of their sandwiches.  Again, the sandwich was very similar to banh mi (those French made inroads on the local Southeast Asian cuisine, I'll tell you), but featuring beef rather than pork, and heavy with the taste of lemongrass, which I'd never noticed in the banh mi I've had.I'm a junkie for Pho Thanh, but I suspect I'm going to put Sekong by Night into the rotation.Over the past few years we've been fortunate enough to have so many tasty and diverse Asian restaurants open. Some of my personal favorites are Soi4 for up-scaled Thai street food, Northeaster Thailand delights at Thai-E and chewy hand pulled noodles at China Magic Noodle House just to name a few. Now there is one more specialty to add to the fold, Sekong by Night specializing in Cambodian fare.Sekong has taken home to the old Fellini's Pizza space at 13th Place and Indian School. They've taken the space and turned it into a charming dining room that's comfortable and tasteful. Cambodian artwork graces each table along with beautiful patterned table cloths. Family owned son Yutheana In runs the front of the house while his mom Lakhana In cooks all of the delicious Khmer style dishes.You'll quickly notice that many of the dishes might appear like Thai food, well reverse that, Thai food is heavily influenced by Cambodian cooking though the later is definitely not as spicy. However you'll also notice a Colonial and Vietnamese influence on the menu starting with their fresh Spring Rolls. Chewy rice paper is wrapped around a salad of vegetables and shrimp, complete with a delicately sweet flavored fish sauce.If you've ever heard of Banh Mi you'll know this famous Vietnamese style sandwich. Its Cambodia cousin called Num Pang, though simply labeled as "sandwiches" on the menu, is just as tasty. They take a large slab of crust French baguette, sourced from Lee's Sandwiches in Chandler, and pile it high with lemon grass flavored beef, pickled veggies, cilantro and a squirt of siracha chile sauce. I think once word gets out how good Sekong's sandwiches are; there could be a line out the door.Other hits included sweetened stir fried beef Lok Lak Beef and another dish called Loat Cha. The earthworm shaped rice noodles were so chewy and addictive Id order them every time.Service was on the slow side since they've only just opened but I assure you, it was worth the wait.What a great little spot! Off the beaten path and "off the hook" as well! I had seen some previous reviews on Yelp but hadn't thought to check the place out. My parents were in town today and saw a full-page feature in the New Times on this place, so my dad suggested trying it. By the time we arrived after our delightful yoga class at Urban Yoga (how very Central Phoenix - I know, I know), it was about 1:40 and the place was completely empty. Sometimes, that can result in a less-than-enthusiastic greeting from owners or waitstaff but the man who greeted us was friendly and seemed genuinely happy that we were there. I love that. He took our drink order right away. The sodas were a little under-carbonated but no big deal. Easily fixed, for sure. My mom raved about her iced tea, so no complaints there. The menu was a little smaller than I expected (the owner later explained that he wanted to start more minimal and then branch out after getting a customer base, which is a good strategy IMO), but several things stood out to me. My dad and I ordered loat chat, worm-shaped rice noodles, but substituted tofu for beef (not immediately obvious that we could do this but we were gracefully accommodated), and the stir-fried shrimp (came with white rice, pickled vegetables and an egg roll). My mom chose the chicken noodle soup and we also got some fresh spring rolls for the table. All of the food came out very quickly and was extremely flavorful and robust without being too greasy or salty. The shell-on shrimp were a particular favorite of mine - although they were very messy to eat, they were very tender and had a nice kick to them. The rice noodles were also great and the shredded egg on top was a delicious touch. All in all, our meal was great - and affordable, to boot. All of our drinks, entrees and the spring rolls came out to only $34 including tax and tip. The owner was also great and we all loved his passionate approach to his business. He even told us that he opened the place because he was told that a Cambodian restaurant wouldn't survive in this city.  A rebel after my own heart. And, after all, doesn't Phoenix need more rebels?You're probably asking yourself, what in the world does "Sekong by Night" mean? Well, the answer is, oooh just some classic, popular Cambodian song title that the owner is obsessed over. :)As previously mentioned by another fellow Yelper, Sekong does exude charm.  In fact, most of the artistic, decorative items that is seen in the dining room is a straight import from mainland Cambodia (ie. table cloths, paintings, sculptures, and other artworks).  Obviously, the owner wanted to not only deliver authenticity from a cuisine standpoint but also historically and culturally.  They did a magnificent job in creating a nice visual display to sort of educate first time consumers of Khmer cuisine.To get an idea of what Khmer dishes are like, I always say they're a cousin to Vietnamese and Thai cuisine.  Although, I think they just share ideas or possibly just steal from one another.One prime example of idea sharing that you might find in a Vietnamese menu is the Luc Lac.  And actually, this creation was French inspired.  It's basically steak meat that has been cut into cubes and sautéed to a tender perfection fused with caramelized onions and garlic to give a richer taste.  The dish usually comes with a side of white rice and a fresh salad that has been lightly soaked in a sweet, citrus, vinagry dressing.  Its fantastic when done right!  In fact, I really enjoy Sekong's version! Its a must try! [Recommend]http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ?select=yeZLfWYl0CMkhNM9T73i_wSekong also serves tasty sandwiches like the Vietnamese Banh Mi.  I have only tried their grilled beef.  From what I recollect tasting, it was meat marinated in a savory, lemon grass.  The baguette was very toasty and had a soft interior while the pickled veggies were fresh tasting. [Recommend]And the cultural similarity theme continues! They also serve a crispy crepe-like dish that encompasses pork, shrimp and bean sprouts called, Baynchaiv, traditionally a finger food.  You take your lettuce and create a wrap and dip it into home made fish sauce. [Recommend]http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ?select=dmpDwgYQUk68LqY3tGx3fwLoat Cha, my other go-to dish, are these 1-inch round rice noodles drenched lightly in soy sauce and then pan fried served with fresh, crispy bean sprouts, green onions, and sliced beef topped with one egg.  [Recommend]Now, the chicken wings with a side of rice is quite tasty.  Last time I ordered one, the chicken came out nicely crisped with a hint of peking flavor, which is a notorious marinade for Chinese roast ducks.As for snacks and specialty drinks, I've had their tempura sweet potato and banana, and grass jelly drink.  All were excellent.  The tempura snacks came out super crispy with a fresh tasting interior.  If you are unfamiliar with grass jelly, it is basically semi-bland jello with a slightly sweet, grassy flavor, but in creating a refreshing drink, jello are cut up into tiny cubes while adding ice, sugar and honey.The one item that has bothered me for awhile now is the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup, also the counter to Vietnamese Pho.  The only reason why I have hesitated for this long is, admittedly, due to the exotic-ness (ie. pork liver, heart, tripes, etc).  As soon as I can grow a third ball, I will attempt it! Just kidding, I will eventually.The menu is not as large but being new to the food scene, they are looking to start off small and expand as business blossom.  By now, you may have already read about the lengthy wait, awkward location, and whatever shenanigans have you not, they are still working out the kinks and are continually listening to feed backs.  Pricing is very reasonable and competitive with the other Southeastern Asian power houses in the Valley [$5 - 10 range].  I will continue to be a regular here and add more updates as I try more items.Having now got 2 people on my case I thought it would be best to clarify and explain perhaps in more detail.First off, I didn't mean any offense to Cambodian people as a whole and if they are upset I apologize for my tongue in cheek attitude. I don't know any and from this experience I'm not bothered by that in the slightest.Secondly, the selling off as Cambodian is an inaccurate statement which I'll happily retract here. It would be unfair to both Vietnamese and other Cambodian restaurants. I was more trying to make the point to those that were wondering what Cambodian food was like, that it is very much akin to Vietnamese food. It's not my fault there are more Vietnamese restaurants in the US and probably based on this I can see why.Generally I've found that places with a higher yelp rating are harder to get into which makes perfect sense to me. This place was NOT full (about half full when we came in) nor happening despite what the owner says! Funnily enough, he has the cheek to call me a liar?! Insensitive comments - yes. Liar - no. (More on the owner's lying later)The poor start relates to that and the poor service which the owner disputes (I have no idea why this fact is disputed). If you have to wait over 5 mins. in a restaurant before contact (not physical contact as the owner oddly suggests) then that's a poor sign. I've only been to 500 places so what would I know?!Then the owner decides that because the food is brought out that makes it excellent service? Are you kidding me?! That was the funniest comment so far. That comment alone is enough to confirm to me that they have no clue to the meaning of the word service. Bringing out dishes is a given! lol Nothing to do with service - I will say the plates were put down on the table nicely if that's what is being alluded to?The owner could just have asked where I'm coming from and I would have gladly responded with my opinion to which I am fully entitled as is the owner. Should probably think about "customer is always right" before launching a senseless tirade/defense of service! Try engaging your customers and explaining things if it is sooooo different?!!!I'd add that the menu has a good number of items on it and never did I suggest that they should be able to make or sere every single type of Cambodian dish? That was funny too.But by far the funniest is the comment about the egg roll coming at the end of the meal. Why would say that and then have a picture of the amok fish with an egg roll on yelp?! Yet the owner calls me a liar? Just own up - you forgot, had a bad day whatever. You think lying is going to make your place look better?!If I were only judging this place against against other restaurants in the Phoenix area then I would have given it 2.5 stars. Not trying to be generous, I tell it how I see it. I'm glad other people had such an amazing experience but unfortunately we did not. The blame for that must primarily lie with the owner. I'd have thought you would want to satisfy your customers, not like to them!I give it a 1 star because I am comparing this restaurant to the many others I have visited and base if off the entire experience from start to finish. Why wouldn't I compare it? That's how a rating can be generated! You have to know good to know bad, so that to me is the essence of rating a place, by comparing it to others. It's nothing to do with how fancy a place is or not. e.g. a hole in the wall restaurant with good food and service would get 5 stars to me, but a pricey steakhouse with amazing ambiance but ok food and good service would get 4. Lying to the customer gets 1 star.To finish (finally!) I apologize for the Cambodian references mentioned earlier, I meant no offense and hope to have cleared those up. However the service was appalling and the food lackluster. That was our experience. Nothing can change that now. Let's see if the owner can come clean or will they have to resort to more petty name calling like they are in the fourth grade!Reathrey Sekong (formerly known as Sekong by Night) is one of the true ethnic gems of central Phoenix. The cuisine is delicious, the service is very friendly, and the prices are great! I love their katheaw buoh, a really flavorful and hearty tofu vegetable noodle soup; I'm not a vegetarian, but I'll take this over any meat-based soup  any day. I also enjoyed their lok lak beef, a delightful mixture of bold and subtle flavors. Their jumbo grilled chicken wings have a very pleasant garlic-soy flavor; you have to wait for the wings to cool a bit after they are served so that they will attain the peak of crispness. I'm glad I ordered the delicious Cambodian iced coffee with my latest meal - the caffeine buzz kept me from slipping into a food coma. On a previous visit, though, I found the rather intriguing basil seed drink really pleasant and refreshing. I know I'll be making many return trips  here, by myself and also with friends ... share the goodness!What is up with the owner. If you're reading this, are you like the Sekong By Night Nazi? I reviewed 3 stars for this restaurant and I get a whole novel, back-sass reply.  "eventually you found us!  Your mom should be proud." What does my mom have to do with anything? What are you trying to imply? Your restaurant was extremely difficult to find. Maybe you should get a BIGGER sign up because as you can read, MANY yelpers have gotten lost/ or stated that couldn't find this place.The soup did lack quite a bit of flavor. It was BLAND. It was actually a bland version of a wannabe Vietnamese soup my MOM could make at home. The soup came out way before the dish. Sorry your butt-hurt because I don't like your bland wannabe Vietnamese soup. I said it, what are you gonna do about it? Few meats on a stick, a bowl of rice, vegetables, and a bland soup for 8 bucks is expensive. I really DID feel jipped. I didn't expect Cambodian food to be this "pricey," especially being in Central Phoenix. My bad, I AM comparing your prices to other asian restaurant in the area. Then again it was my first time actually at a cambodian restaurant and I wasn't satisfied. Again, don't be butt-hurt. About your sandwich, I can in fact get it somewhere else for cheaper. There are loads of Vietnamese restaurants in Central Phoenix that don't make their bread and also sell it for 2.00 plus tax. I don't know why you are still calling your sandwiches "Cambodian sandwiches," It may be called differently since it was sold at a Cambodian Restaurant but it's the exact same thing as a Banh Mi sold at a Vietnamese restaurant (my bad because I didn't call it whatever you named it on your menu) but except yours is over-sauced and very stingy on the meat. Why would I have to complain about my sandwich to you when I was there? Shouldn't the staff know how to prepare the sandwich? Am I a criminal for stating my opinion and experience on yelp? YOU make me feel like I am a criminal for yelping three stars which means "A-okay". What did you want? five stars? The food wasn't "As good as it gets."If you would reply saying "sorry for being cheap and stingy on the meats." Then maybe I would want to actually return. ATTENTION YELPERS:Do not yelp lower than 4 stars or the Sekong By Night Nazi will come and get you.Again, this is sarcasm. Don't get butt-hurt.Get a life that isn't so focused on the bad reviews you get on yelp. You have so many good reviews, be happy about it. Your reply ticked me off so I had to reply even if it's been months later.We have stopped in twice in the last month. A nice little friendly place. We enjoyed the spring rolls they were very flavorful, (some restaurants serve them bland) these were fresh and tasty. We ordered sandwiches to go and requested a slight change to the recipe that was meet with a pleasant attitude. The sandwiches were very nice, bread was great as were the fillings. We will come in again and try some other items. I do wonder why the owner is offended by the 3 star ratings. I reserve the four and five stars for when my sox are really knocked off and am suspicious of places that have all 4 and 5 stars. The first rule of Yelp for owners is not to be compatitive to the yelpers. All reviews are helpful good and bad.Well after discovering this place about a week ago by driving by it, I googled it and found it on yelp.Since I never had Cambodian food I was curious what their food is like.Reading all the 5 stars review I knew immediately that this is something I would love.Sure enough my first visit there today was everything I expected and more.The place is very clean. Our server was extremely friendly ( not sure if it was the Sekong By Night Nazi) And the food was fresh and very tasty.We had the Spring Rolls as appetizer and boy those are yummy.I ordered the Curry Chicken and my partner had the Shrimp Ling.Both dishes again were fresh and very tasty.I will be back for more and can't wait to explore the rest of their menu.BTW, I admire the owner brutal honesty, people who  give this place a 1 star are just naive and should stick to the McDonalds down the street.Why do you need to slander and business just because your taste buds are not used to freshly prepared food???Two thumbs up!!Before I get to the reason for the 1 star review let me give you a little bit of background.  I "Yelped" banh mi sandwiches for Phoenix last night because I was craving one and wanted to find out what Yelpers out there think are the best.  I was a bit surprised to see Reathrey on the list as they are not a Vietnamese restaurant, but having patronized the restaurant at least a half dozen times, I decided to read through the reviews.  My boyfriend and I originally went to the restaurant after reading the glowing article in Phoenix Magazine.  Our first visit there was pretty uneventful.  We ordered the Mi Keaw soup, spring rolls and the crepe (which by the way was served slightly burned with that side facing down- but I never complain about my food and ordered it again on later visits).  My only real complaint that first evening was the incredibly uncomfortable bench seating.  On subsequent visits we opted for the tables in the center of the space.  I have tried a number of different things on the menu and while having no other Cambodian food to compare it to I find it to be just meahhh.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves the Mi Keaw soup and has ordered it as take out a number of times and is the reason for our repeat business.  In my opinion the Pho at many valley Vietnamese restaurants is much tastier.Okay - back to the reason for the one star review.  So here I was reading through the reviews when I started coming across the owner's incredibly RUDE, SARCASTIC, CONDESCENDING, DISRESPECTFUL and downright UNACCEPTABLE responses to his less than stellar reviews.  I have three words for you GET OVER YOURSELF!!! I don't care if you are running a Michelan star rated restaurant (which CLEARLY you are not) that type of disgusting behavior will run your business into the ground.  I, for one, will be spreading the word and NOT in a good way.  Sincerely,A very disappointed EX-patronI admittedly don't know much about Cambodia. I know I want to see Angkor Wat at some point in my life, but that's about as far as my knowledge extends. When I saw there was a local Cambodian restaurant here in Phoenix, I was intrigued and wanted to stop by to broaden my knowledge base. We walked into Reathrey Sekong on a Friday evening at 6:30pm and were sat immediately. For a 4-1/2 star restaurant, that impressed me. Especially since we had just left another place after seeing a horde of people standing outside. The inside is small but charming to say the least. I ordered the Cambodian iced coffee which was recommended in other reviews. Greatness. I thought it was going to be too sweet, but it wasn't, the mix of coffee and condensed milk was perfect. I ordered the large serving of the Cambodian BBQ Platter for dinner. It was basically a big plate o' meat that consisted of sliced beef, grilled beef skewers and grilled chicken wings. It's also served with a bowl of white rice. Excellent. The two beef offerings were cooked so that they were still tender and the flavor was awesome. The wings were on another level. Probably in the top 5 of best wings I've ever eaten. The only issue I experienced was in the order the items were served. I waited for what I thought was a while before my coffee came out but it was okay. I figured they were just waiting for it to brew. My coffee came out, but my wife's drink (coconut smoothie with boba) didn't come out for a few minutes later.Then the same thing happened with our food. My food came out and hers didn't for about 3-5 minutes later. It wasn't a huge deal, but it's just awkward when you're sitting there with your food and your eating companion is sitting there watching you, twiddling their thumbs. She wasn't actually twiddling her thumbs. Does anyone do that anymore? Anyway... you get the point. That was my only qualm. Other than that, this place was excellent. If Reathrey Sekong is any indication of the deliciousness that awaits in Cambodia... I can't get there fast enough.Met up with the International Supper Club UYE at Reathrey Sekong for the monthly pick of November, we were a party of 12, and it was suggested to us that since we were a larger party that we should order dishes family style.  I get the reasoning behind it, 1 cook in the kitchen, not everyone would be eating at the same time, I'm just not that big on seafood dishes and eating family style wasn't going to work for me, so I broke the rules and ordered for myselfI have to say our waiter was amazing, he was working the entire place by himself, did an outstanding job! Everyone was also enjoying the dishes they were trying too. The restaurant is nicely decorated and cozy, I have to say I enjoyed out time where conversing with everyone.I don't remember the name of the item I ordered, but it was a beef sandwich on a french roll with like a carrot slaw pickles and cilantro, the sandwich itself was on the sweet side, which was shocking, I was thinking more savory since it was beef, but I did quite enjoy it!Another fun International Supper Club UYE meet up!The Honeydew Soba, Basil Seed Drink, BBQ Beef and Fresh Spring Rolls were super delicious!  I was very impressed with all if the food.  The clientele here were also very friendly the night we dined, as people shared their favorite dishes and talked to each other.  Extra friendly waiter as well!!!  I can't wait to return!!!!Wow.After our aborted trip to Two Hippies one Sunday (it was closed), we looked around on Yelp for another spot for lunch.  Cambodian food caught my wife's curiosity, so we dodged the roadwork in the quest to make it here.Decorated with antiques (some look like they were from 1950s Cambodia) this place was very pleasant inside.  Service was friendly and smiling.  The food was--quite unlike anything else I've ever had.The fried rice had chunks of perfectly seasoned, tender beef that gave it. . .dimension (for the lack of a better word) that I never realized that a fried rice could have.  I know that this sounds kind of strange, or even goofy, but the taste was simply phenomenal.  When I spoke to my wife about her lemongrass soup, I realized that I she was having a similar experience with her food.A previous reviewer referred to this restaurant as "one of the true ethnic gems of central Phoenix", and I can't put it any better.  If you're in the area and are thinking about Thai curry or a bowl of pho, may I suggest this alternative.  It's not the particular ethnicity that makes this place unique as much as its sheer outstanding quality.  It's something different, done deliciously.This place serves awesome food.A group of us went to savor the flavors on a Friday night at about 8 pm. The place was packed and there were two groups ahead of us. After a short wait we were seated in an adjacent room that felt a little like the family living room as it had great character.Because the restaurant was so busy and it is a small family-run establishment we did not expect to be served quickly. Fortunately we were there to enjoy the company as well as the food so the wait for our food passed quickly.We ordered five separate main dishes that were served in waves. We started with the noodle dish with beef that started our glands    palpitating in expectation of more succulent dishes to come. We then enjoyed a delightful barbecued pork dish and a fish dish with shredded mango (mmmmm).This was followed by another beef dish (loc lac) that was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.Finally we had the crepe dish that was a mixture of flavors and fillings. The crepe dish was served last because it required two of the six kitchen burners to prepare and the restaurant wanted the food to reach us in the quickest way.We were all very full by the end of our gastronomic feast. Definitely one of the best meals I have ever eaten.We took at least two hours enjoying our meal. Don't come here if you are in a hurry!
Sauceman's=After reading all the great reviews of Sauceman's, I officially have major food envy. Maybe I chose the wrong item off the menu? Perhaps I walked in at an inopportune time? I'm not sure, but I will say that I had really high hopes for Sauceman's, especially because they're right down the street from me in South End. I always want to support local businesses, but Sauceman's really let me down yesterday afternoon...I drove up to Sauceman's looking for a tasty and affordable little lunch. I was quite excited to try out this new South End venture and perused the menu as the woman in front of me ordered. Well, the person taking her order was having some trouble so while he was yelling into the kitchen for assistance, I waited. And waited. Nearly 5 minutes went by until another staff member came and helped me. And there were at least 4 staff people hanging around just a few feet away from me. Not a good sign. However, I was there around 2 pm so perhaps shifts were changing, blah blah blah. I decided on the small size French Dip with fries. And this is after asking the woman behind the counter what she thought of that particular sandwich. I quote, "It's actually one of my favorites on the menu." Sweet, I'll have that, thank you. $6.50 and I sat down. Once seated, the folks who were finishing up their shifts (presumably) sat 5 feet away from me in the main dining area chatting away and chomping down their food. About 5-7 minutes went by and my sandwich came out with a boatload of fries. Most certainly a generous portion of fries. Since I'm really trying to be as fair as possible, let me break down my thoughts on my French Dip & Fries...The beef: Lackluster and fairly tasteless. I also garnered a few bites of chewy fat that were not so delicious. The cheese: I've had better mozzarella, 'twas a bit on the plasticky side.The bun: Chewy chewy and not in a pleasant way. Tasted like this bun was quite frozen not long ago. The au jus: Not too shabby here. Perhaps if the beef simmered longer in the au jus with a bit more spice, I would have enjoyed it much more.The fries: All were toasty and hot, yet many of them were dehydrated. Again, seems like the freezer got the best of them. So, yeah. For a girl who likes to eat I didn't even finish half of my meal. But the big kicker is that when my basket was placed in front of me up until I left 15 minutes later - no one asked me if I needed anything (and I was the only person in the restaurant besides the staff). Or how my food was. Or, frankly, how I was doing. And, no, I don't need to be catered to, I was just hoping for more of a local, caring and cool staff at my neighborhood eatery. I may come back to try the ribs, but I'm not rushing to do so.After getting out with some great friends of ours for the first time in a while, we decided to take them to Sauceman's. I'm a huge BBQ fan and Sauceman's was one of the places left on my list in town. Though this location doesn't seem to be much from the outside, it definitely holds a firm place in my BBQ-loving soul amongst the other varietals in town. I had passed by this little building so many times on my way in and out of Uptown and always wanted to stop in. It's pretty small inside with some tables and a walk-up counter to order at. We started with some fried pickles and onion rings. Fried Pickles are somewhat of a ubiquitous app in town. Throw a stone in any direction and there is a joint that serves em the same as a few others in town. They weren't really anything to write home about. I actually wasn't too thrilled with the flavor and only ate a couple. The onion rings were great. Thick, but battered cooked correctly so you don't end up pulling out the entire onion from the inside of the batter housing. Well done here, ladies and gents in the kitchen. I ordered the thick cut pork. Nice chunks of pork and a nice change of pace from my typical goings of the chopped variety. I really enjoyed the larger pieces and eating them with a fork and knife. The flavor was fantastic and their Carolina Mustard BBQ sauce was a stupendous addition. The hushpuppies they serve with each meal are some of the best I've had in town. Huge ones, too. Not small like others I've had, which was a nice change as well. I just freaking love hushpuppies all around. Very happy with my entree. Another big plus was the fact that they had Triple C's Smoked Amber on draught. Such an incredible brew and works rather well with BBQ. The service was great. One girl and a few people in the kitchen were holding down the entire operation. Next time, I might check out their wings as I've heard they are of note. Needless to say, I'm stoked about heading back to Sauceman's rather soon.I rarely get to review a restaurant's food because there are often bigger hangups to deal with at any restaurant I visit.Recently I was going to a show uptown and made a special trip to visit Sauceman's, knowing it was on the way.  Typically I have only come to Sauceman's for lunch, or on the weekend, so I am not familiar with their strange hours.  But even if I were, am I expected to keep them memorized forever?On a Thursday, this place closes at 6 PM.  Why?  Heck if I know.  But that's not really the point.  Point is, I got there at about 5:40 PM, and was excited to eat.  When I came in, I noticed all of the chairs were upturned on the tables, trashcans were empty, without bags, and there was one other customer waiting for a to-go order.  Seeing the chairs the way that they were, I just assumed they were cleaning the restaurant and mopping the floors after lunch, and were getting it ready to re-open for dinner.I told the female cashier (who I am almost certain is the poorly placed manager - she has been in supervisor mode every visit I have made) my order, and she specifically asked, "For here or To-Go?".  I said "for here" and she didn't argue.  She took my order, and I flipped the chairs back over at one table and went to the restroom.  When I came back, my food was waiting and I got ready to dig in.  I then noticed that there was no BBQ sauce on my sandwich, and no sauce bottles on the table.I rounded the corner to tell her there were no bottles on the table, and her response made me want to gag.  Rather than saying, "I'm sorry sir, that is my fault, here you are..." the smart mouth turned her back to me while mumbling to her coworker  "Yeah, that's 'cause we're closed".Am I wrong here, or is that how you are supposed to talk to customers that go out of their way to eat at your establishment?I was stunned.  She got the best of me.  I cannot tell you how hard my teeth were clenched to keep from getting back up and letting these people have it.Instead I quietly seethed and tried to enjoy the food, which was good, but irrelevant to the matter at hand.  While sitting there I watched a couple come in and ask if they could dine in.  The cashier told her they closed at 5 but they would still take to-go orders.  This was my first time hearing this - something I should have been told the second I walked in.  Maybe I am partially to blame for not questioning the upturned chairs, but again - it's 6:00 on a Thursday, and no normal person has ever looked at the door of a restaurant to say "Hmm, I wonder if they close early on this weekday?"The couple that came in after me waited on their to-go order, and I ate as fast as I could to get out of there and go write this review... and also to remove the incredible burden I had caused them by being there.I am fed up with people not appreciating the business they receive, and this restaurant can be added to the list.  I am sure the owners would love to know that the workers talk about the customers behind their backs like teenagers, but I cannot find out the owner(s) names to tell them.  That's probably just the way they want it to be.I can't explain how a once great bbq joint has slid so low so quickly. They have plenty of trophy's and awards on display, but what they didn't have when I visited was a great meal to offer. I picked my Wife up at work, and wanted to celebrate our 25th Anniversary with a nice lunch. Fortunately she picked Sauceman's, not me. The first warning sign was that they were out of most of the fountain drinks. There was a hand written sign that said to get a can from the cooler. Except the cooler was out of diet sodas. When I asked, the woman behind the counter suggested I drink water. That was strike 1.We received our meals quickly, but before the server could walk away, I asked her if what I received was the $9 pork plate. The portion of hush puppies outweighed the pork on my plate. She said "yes, they weigh the pork", then walked away. Wow! That was strike 2.My Wife ordered the brisket sandwich, her usual menu choice. At first glance, all looked good. There was so much brisket that she had to take some out of her sandwich so she could fit it in her mouth. Before she took a bite, I looked at the meat on her plate, and showed her how dry it was. When I posted the picture one of my fellow Yelpers commented that it looked like jerky, not brisket. Strike 3.I don't know what happened to them, hopefully they can turn things around again. If it was just some dry brisket, I could forgive them. But between the issues with the soda, and the terribly small portions, it looks to me like this could be the beginning of the end for Sauceman's.I've eaten at Sauceman's many times since they've been open. My last visit made me so angry that I deleted all my previous glowing reviews, and there were several of them.================================================When I first came here after they opened, their burnt ends pork BBQ was fantastic. Their barbecue sandwiches were massive and delicious.Their panko breaded onion rings were nothing short of amazing.Service was decent, but nothing to brag about.Their postage stamp size parking lot was horrendous then, and it has only gotten worse as the restaurant has grown in popularity.This restaurant was too small even on day one. They have added a ton of outside dining to try and compensate for the lack of seating, but what they really need is a much larger building and more parking.================================================My last visit.........the straw that broke the camel's back.The Rastafarian Brother who was running the cash register was slow as molasses. He couldn't get orders correct the first time around. He acted like he couldn't understand English. He had an attitude. Frankly, he acted like he was high on ganja. He was talking with people in the back of the line, laughing, and doing everything but his job. It took a good fifteen minutes - just to place my order, and I was third in line, because he was being such a Richard. (In retrospect, I wish that I had just left and gone anywhere else.) $#@&#@!!!After what seemed an eternity, I grabbed a spot at one of the few empty tables, laid down my receipt and order placard, and I went to go get some sweet tea. When I returned thirty seconds later, my receipt was gone, and my order placard was gone! $#@&#@!!!Luckily, I remembered my order number.It took a good twenty minutes for my food to be prepared, and the entire time I sat on pins and needles hoping to flag down the runner. When what I thought was my order went by, headed for the outside tables, I quickly asked the employee if that was order #61. He said, "yes, it is," and looked at my table for verification. I told him that someone had removed my order placard, but that was my food. No receipt. No order placard. He gave me a puzzled look, but luckily he believed me, and I got to eat the lunch that I paid for. {sigh}The food was not nearly as good as previous visits, in fact it was disappointingly mediocre. The portion sizes were smaller and the prices were higher. It just wasn't very good, and it certainly wasn't worth all the BS that I had to go through. I haven't been back since, and I have no plans to EVER return. Lexington 'Q kicks their rear end, and for that matter, every other BBQ restaurant in Charlotte. Midwood Smokehouse is waaaay better. McKoy's is better. So is Bill Spoons, Mac's Speed Shop, Shane's Rib Shack, Bubba's BBQ, and Bobbee O's. None of the aforementioned businesses are a pain in the rear to visit either. When I am in the Queen City, I just drive right past Sauceman's on the way to other restaurants that appreciate my business. Who needs that type of aggravation?
Go Wild Sushi & Grill=The food and ambiance were fantastic.  We all enjoyed our dinner of albacore, yellowtail and salmon sushi, chicken yakisoba, beef teriyaki, a spicy tuna and philly roll, and red snapper sashimi with olive oil, black pepper and green onions.  The friendly, helpful staff was also a plus.  I know this wasn't a very descriptive review, but I'm about to be called to a poker table!
Tacos Atoyac=The price is right for these street tacos, rolled tacos, tamales and Mexican hot dogs at newly-opened Tacos Atoyac. Sure, while taco shops are a dime a dozen in Phoenix, the price point and taste can't be beat. The decor is very casual and spartan for now, but the value for a typical family meal make Tacos Atoyac a steal.The lengua, cabeza and carne asada tacos were flavorful and at $1 each, quite the value.  The black beans came to our table topped with cotija cheese and the arroz was reminiscent of any you'd find at any abuelita's house.  The "Oaxacan-style" hot dog was colorful and topped with generous helpings of sliced tomatoes, bacon bits and avocado and so very delicious.Horchata and Mexican Coca Cola are plentiful, and the Coke priced at $1.50 is the cheapest I've seen yet at a taco shop.Overall dinner for two was about $13, which included six tacos, one soda a spicy chicken tamale, a rolled taco and a Oaxacan hot dog. Not bad...It's easy to find at the NE corner of Glendale Ave. and 19th Ave., next to 7-11. Can't wait to visit again, and am looking forward to having another lengua taco, hot dog and to trying the tortas!We went to Tacos Atoyac for lunch again and really enjoyed the food based on a recommendation from Iain B.  This is not border Mexican food but rather oaxaca or oaxaquena southern Mexico or what you might find in Mexico City.  Their prices are very easy on your pockets, but don't let that fool you.  Their food is extremely fresh, unique and delicious.  What a little "gem" of a place this is!  Restaurant ~ Tacos Atoyac is small and not very appealing on the outside (somewhat of a dive look) but it's what's on the inside that counts and this place is no exception.  This place is very clean with a simple design on the inside. The folks that work here are friendly and will make you feel very welcomed.  This was huge since for us since both of us speak very little Spanish.  Food ~ You order your food when you walk in and they bring you your delicious oaxacan-Mexican food to you accompanied with a side of cooked jalapenos, onions and salsa (you can choose green, red or a guacamole infused salsa).  The green chili salsa went exceptionally well with my fish and al pastor tacos.  No chips and salsa here, which I'm perfectly fine with.  On our first visit we sampled all of the tacos at $1 each.  The carne asada and al pastor were tender and delicious with with some chopped cilantro and onions on top. All of the tacos were very good, even the lengua and tripa o cabeza tacos. (yes I knew they were tongue and tripe~ but they were good!) I just added a little salsa which gave it just the right amount of heat to add to the flavor.  We also tried their spicy beef and chicken tamales at $1.75. Thy were very good as well but I preferred their tacos, so went back for few more.  Total bill with a few drinks was around $18 for us both.Second visit we had their fish tacos ~ they are delish!  We also had a couple of quesadilla's since they were making them fresh from scratch at $1.50. The corn quesadilla was tasty with some fresh green  epazote, cheese and a light spread of frijoles! We also tried their flour quesdilla's and a few burros with al pastor and carne asada.  They too were very good with a nice balance of fresh guacamole and loads of meat in their burros. We sampled a lot of food again this trip and left stuffed and happy with a bill of only $24.  We have really enjoyed most of the things we've tried so far and we are looking forward to coming back very soon.  Tacos Atoyac will leave you satisfied, happy and planning what to eat on your next visit.  They keep it simple with tons of flavor.  I hope to see you there.This may very well conclude my search for really, really good tacos. The place is inconspicuous, really easy to miss, especially with the rather small name sign outside. But you'll always see cars pulling into and out of the parking spaces in front. Inside, the atmosphere is pretty sparse but the friendliness of the people, the incredible prices (see the menu pics I posted), and the delicious food more than make up for it. I tried the carne asada, al pastor, tripa - I ordered it extra crunchy - and lengua ... all superb!  The tacos come with a side of sauteed onions and jalapenos, which very nicely complement the flavors of the tacos. This is definitely a place for many, many repeat visits.Oh my gooooood! Can you say bomb? Go ahead, try it. Okay come back. Yes. These tacos are that and more. Worth all the hype. Worth a little more from me. These are no sh*t, amazing tacos with great flavor. But, okay let me esplain something to you. Mexican food is usually the last thing I want to eat when I eat out. My parents are from the valley, born and raised and very Americanized. Still, I grew up with rice and beans with every meal, even steaks, even eggs, no joke. Every. Meal. Some things are like Bruce Willis, they Die Hard. But I love me some tacos man... And these are SOME tacos!I've been here a handful of times now and have had, I think, every taco of the menu at least once. The tacos de pescado are by far my favourite. Lightly breaded, perfectly seasoned, little pieces of white flaky fish wrapped up in soft warm corn tortillas smothered in a spicy crema. Yum! The tacos pastor are probably my second fav. Tasty marinated carnita covered in a sort of  pico and wrapped in those perfect soft tortillas. I love the tripas (never fear, they cook them way down!) and the carne asada also. And the sonny man always orders the quesadilla. So delicious and I am feenin for one with chorizo right now!Okay well I have to go get my fix since they were closed for the holidays. Laters baby.Quite possibly the best street style fish taco I have had in Phoenix. The generous portion of fish was heavily seasoned and lightly breaded, the result was pure heaven. I also ordered the flour quesadilla, refried pinto beans, carne asada and al pastor tacos. The refried beans were creamy and the queso in the quesadilla was awesome. I washed that all down with a bottled coke and rolled myself home. You may want to give yourself some time if you come here during lunch, by 11:30 the line was out the door. Apparently I am not the only one that knows how delicious this little dive is!Oh my, oh my, how I miss coming here for the best fish tacos.  The fish is seasoned and lightly breaded and there is a good portion on the taco.  I have tried the crispy quesidilla and al pastor tacos, but the fish tacos remain my all time favorite.  It's very simple inside and not in the greatest neighborhood, but the service is great, prices are cheap and the food is amazing. Come and get some authentic tacos!!Tacos Atoyac reinforces my belief that the more expensive your Mexican food is, and the fancier the establishment appears, the worse it's probably going to be. I mean, EVERYONE knows that the *good* stuff lies in plain, secluded little strip malls that are easily overlooked. Just pop in and get whatever you want. I am convinced Atoyac can do no wrong. I ordered a simple pastor burrito. Carne asada is easy to do, but the arduous process of choosing a marinade that's just-right is in my opinion the litmus test for whether or not a restaurant is legit. Part of me wanted to say it's too sweet, but as it disappeared fast, I realized it's unique, but really hits the spot. Sevice was fast, and all meals come with grilled onions and a grilled serrano, which is just the right amount of heat for me, and definitely too much for most people who will read this. Be careful, and have some delicious horchata ready just in case.The food here was very good, but I'd suggest you open your patio for more seating as this place is a claustrophobics worst nightmare.  I seriously wished I'd taken my food to go.   And if you are running the register and a customer shows you a picture of a plate of delicious tacos from your own restaurant on your own restaurant's Yelp page on the Yelp mobile app and asks you if you know what kind of tacos they are don't give them an annoyed glare and say "How am I supposed to know?!?!"   Uh, you are supposed to be able to identify your menu items because you are running the register, and because your menu doesn't exactly give a lot of description to your different offerings, and because it's just good customer service?   I'll be trying this place again because everything was tasty the last time (for basically ordering the items blind) but if I get treated like an idiot for a simple inquiry again I definitely won't be back.What happened?? I had the best tacos of my life here. I came back the other day... and its closed???Taco Gods why have you forsaken me!??!?Street tacos at its finest. It was like the real deal from Mexico minus the diarrhea. The fish tacos were second to none. I'm gonna miss you Taco Azoteca... Ayot... Atoyec... how do you say it?
Bagel Bar=There are several eating options at this terminal, and since I didn't have a bagel my entire time while in Montreal, I thought why not? This was my one and only chance to get one, as I was hankering for one, and well, it was a major disappointment. It was about 6:30am and was half asleep, and after going through security, and perusing my food options, I noticed a plethora of breakfast bagels on display. All were on sesame seed bagels, and were either egg and cheese; egg, ham, and cheese; or salmon and cream cheese. I opted for the egg and cheese, and anxiously anticipated eating one, as I needed a bagel fix (none for about 3 weeks).  Oh, I was so disappointed, as it was heated up by microwave, and was flat, chewy and dry. No flavor on the sesame bagel; and the egg was also bland and cheese was just way too much. Prices were fair, and not too pricey (thankfully)!As I mentioned in my quick tip, this is a very mediocre bagel, but the only place in the gate where you can get one. I'd skip and go find another place to eat in the terminal.Only positive side was that the coffee was really strong and robust, and there are a few tables next to Bagel Bar, where you can eat (quickly) and then board your plane!
JackBeagles=Yay a new pub...my fav! Stumbled upon this joint while waiting for a table at Cabo that turned into waiting too long and eating at Solstice.  Anyways I had to circle back to make sure I checked this place out and I'm sure glad I did.  Besides falling off my chair after my delicious Allagash beer with the delightful aftertaste of Jim Beam I do actually mean it was delightful I had a great time.  They are serving food and will definitely check out some grub next time I return.. the beer selection is great and the staff is friendly.  Our waiter Tom was on top of it and very knowledgable about the beers and the menu...I will be returning soon. If your in NODA check this place out and add it to your pub crawl!Mike was handing out breakfast only Beagle Bucks Friday night when I stopped in for a beer.  So this morning, I took advantage of their opening at 7am on Saturdays and Sundays for breakfast and enjoyed a nice hearty meal.I had the Basic Beagle Breakfast.  Two eggs any style (scrambled), bacon or sausage (3 strips of tasty perfectly cooked bacon), breakfast potatoes or grits (potatoes since i am still unwilling to let go of my Yankee-ness to eat grits), and biscuits or toast (two great biscuits), all with a little fruit cup.They have breakfast wraps and tweaks to your standard breakfast fare.  Next time, I will venture for the Shit on a Shingle.  Up north, that is creamed chipped beef on toast.  There, it is more like your sausage biscuits and gravy only on texas toast.All of it is reasonably priced and a great breakfast option in the hood that is open early.  Just sucks waiting until noon to wash it down with a mimosa or bloody mary...
D.O.C.G. Enoteca=I wish I read the review by MG prior to going here.  I also ordered the Trofie for $22 and was surprised by the tiny size of the dish and the shrimp.  Overall my friends and I weren't impressed by the menu and thought about leaving.  The pizza oven was also broken.  We had to ask for free breadsticks since they didn't serve us any.This has to be the worst restaurant in Las Vegas! To start with, I think it's the only  italian restaurant I've ever been to  that charges you for mediocre bread. The portions are a joke and incredibly overpriced considering how small and uninteresting they are. I ordered the chicken which was the smallest chicken I've ever seen. It tasted average at best, and I was still hungry after dinner. The waiter was reluctant to give us breadsticks (made it sound like he did us a favor swiping them off the bar) and we paid $5 for "stromboli" bread which was average at best. Everyone who works there seems unhappy and look like they don't want to be there, and the overall experience was awful. If I could rate it a zero I would. The entire experience was unpleasant, food unsatisfying, terrible menu, broken pizza over and apathetic service. I would never return and suggest you don't go either.When visit the famous Las Vegas, the price for dinner at a restaurant mean at least over $100. However i think this newly open restaurant doesn't know that overrated prices must come with satisfactory service. Well this place had the most horrible service in a Restaurant in Vegas. It took 30 min to sit us down, 30 min to ask us for our order and another 30 min to bring the food. Not many options on the menu ( 6 options). We order the schiacciatta pizza, a medium size entree with a salad.  I think I would say that pizza from Costco Warehouse would taste better. I visit Las Vegas several times a year so I won't come back to that restaurant.I'm the first real person to review this place, let all other fake spammers be gone!  Yelp should really work that shizzle out.  Zack S...um this place closes at 11 so you couldn't have possibly hit the bar...so yeah if your gonna post fake reviews at least check your facts..This place has so much potential, yet the ridiculously bad service just overshadowed everything good they did.This is probably the worst service I have ever received in my life.  Do you guys remember in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts goes into the first store on Rodeo and the snooty lady acts like she's too good for this place?  Well that's what they did to us.Where's the hostess?  Oh she's chatting with her friend...*ignoring me*We finally get seated and then we sit and wait...and wait...and wait...finally I get up and ask one of the waiters at the cash register to send over someone...She treats us like we're a nuisance to her, she's singing along to the song that's playing...(WTF?)  I think they turned up the music louder as more people left because by the time it was near closing time it was blaring hip hop music...really weird considering it was a nice casual Italian restaurant.We order almost 200 bucks worth of food, and then she's like "is that it?"excuse me bitch...watch the attitude...Wait, wait, watch as all the waiters get together to talk about us...seriously I can see you whispering about us....this is so unprofessional right now....We seriously waited for like an hour and a half, it was ridiculous!  The place was practically empty!  The waiters were standing around and chatting with each other.  I took pictures as evidence!This place is supposed to be a nice place, for the prices they charge they should have a whole restaurant re-staffed because it was ridiculous!  I have never felt more uncomfortable and treated so rudely in my life!I also wanted to order take out for later and apparently they don't have take out boxes?  You're a restaurant?  You don't have boxes?  Seriously?This is the worst experience in a restaurant I have ever had.  I've gotten better service at Carls Jr in a shady neighborhood than this.  I won't hesitate to tell everyone to avoid this restaurant when you're in Vegas because this was outrageous!  No one treats me like that and gets away with it!  I wish I had a You've been yelped card so I could give them a piece of my mind.I'm like those crazy housewives who have nothing better to do...I won't stop calling to speak to management until someone is fired.  I'm serious, no one gets away with treating me like that without suffering repercussions.  We don't play that, I'm sorry I'm not one of those quiet asian people who take your shit...I will not be silenced... You best believe.  You're done..The end.*note I left for the manager*"This is probably the most unprofessional and ridiculous restaurant I have ever had the misfortune to experience, not just from the our waitress, but the waitstaff and blatant ignorance from most of the employees I had to encounter."                                                                   Anthony NguyenYou're kidding right.  As close to authentic Italian as I am (I'm Asian).  RANT:  Even in the black chip world of Las Vegas, charging twice as much as anyone else does not mean the food is twice as good.  $22 for a personal Margherita pizza?  $22???  The best example I had in Italy, from a widely acknowledged top pizzeria rated by professional food reviewers, €7 ($9).  And yes, it was more than twice as good.The menu reads well with dishes from Toscana, Lazio, and Campania.  Ordering done.  Anticipation builds, then WTF, bread served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar,  Italians would never commit such a culinary faux pas.  The producers of either great ingredient would sooner see it run down the street then mix them together.  Not a good sign.The springtime Roman classic, fried artichokes.  They should be well trimmed, fried golden brown.  The contrast between the bitter, crispy leaves and sweet tender heart makes the mouth all kinds of happy.  NOT HERE.  Half cooked, inedible leaves around an undercooked heart.  Bitter and vegetal in all the wrong ways.The pizzas hailing from Nappoli, decent ingredients, properly blistered, crust well seasoned with a decent chew.  So what's wrong?   Rustic is one thing, plain sloppy is another.  Margherita had 90 percent of the cheese on one side of the pizza.  The desiccated, burnt basil on the other.  The prosciutto with asparagus had all of it's ingredients centered in the middle with a two inch wide crust all around.Finally, the wines.  This is an enotecca right?  So Roman food, no wines from Lazio.  Limited selections from Campania (Nappoli), Tuscany well represented. Vegas resort prices.Euro contemporary ambiance.  Servers lack energy.  Italy, still half a world away.I knew I was eating here last night and had to do my pre-work.  First of all, what the heck does DOCG mean?  During dinner we asked and got the answer in English, which means "controlled designation of origin guaranteed". You should see DOCG on all fine Italian food labels, especially on wine.  I never knew this until last night.  By the way, within 5 minutes we forgot what DOCG meant, hah. I had to go back after dinner and ask again.  LolRegarding their food, where the heck do I start?  We tasted a lot during our dinner last night.  Present during dinner was Chad S, Roy E w/his gf, and of course, Terri R.  We shared the following dishes.Small Plates:-Their Bread-Roasted Bone Marrow (red beets & oxtail)-Grilled Octopus (chickpeas, tomatoes & basil)-Pancetta Wrapped Prawns (w/rosemary lentils)-Beef Carpaccio (caper aioli, parmesan & arugula)I wasn't a fan of the Roasted Bone Marrow and wished it had more taste to it. The Beef Carpaccio, however, was fantastic. Pizza's:-The "D.O.C.G" Pizza (fonduta, egg & truffles)-Margherita (mozzarella & tomato)The DOCG Pizza was a very tasty one over the Margherita.  This may not make sense at all, but the egg topped on it gave it a sweetness which combined very well with the pizza. Pastas:-Pici (braised duck sauce & black truffles)-Scialatielli ("arrabbiata" with lobster & shrimp)-Fettuccine (roasted garlic, escarole & mushrooms)My favorite of the three had to be the Pici.  The duck actually tasted like braised ribs, but had a small after taste to it.  Very lean and simply melts in your mouth. Sides:-Roasted Asparagus (w/lemon & egg vinaigrette)-Grilled Broccolini (w/garlic & chili)-Potato Puree (w/mascarpone & parmigiano)Their version of a mashed potato, just a lot creamier and full of butter.  Out of the three sides, this was my favorite with the asparagus as a close 2nd.  Dinners:-Diver's Scallops (My Entree - w/brussel sprouts & pancetta)-Braised Short Ribs (Terri R's Entree) - w/sweet potatoes & cippolini):  I had to add this on my review since I ate half of her entree. I thought that the scallops were just okay. I'm a little different than most. I prefer smaller pieces of scallops over these huge ones that are served here.  In my opinion, the large pieces are a little too fishy to me (I know, this isn't fish. Just saying).  I did enjoy Terri's Braised Short Ribs.  Even though there wasn't a bone, this was some "fall off the bone" meat. I wish I had her meal. It was phenominal. Desserts:-Salted Caramel Budino (pretzel toffee)-Tiramisu (kahlua soak & coffee gelato)-Marscarpone Cheesecake (w/fresh strawberries and strawberry sauce)-Tartufo (nutella malt gelato, chianti cherrycompote & hazelnuts)My favorite of the four desserts was the Salt Caramel Budino.  Served in layers, you have to dig your spoon deep in order to enjoy the magic of this dessert.  The Tartufo was magic as well with a combination of Nutella and dark chocolate.  The Tiramisu tasted like your normal Tiramisu.  As for the their cheesecake, I wasn't able to partake in the fun since I'm allergic to fruit. According to our group, this was a favorite too.  Sorry for the longer than average review, but we were here a long time and ate a lot. Can you say food coma?  Food baby? After dinner, we were given a special "behind the scenes" tour of both DOCG's and Scarpetta's kitchen.  I had a great time and with a great meal.  I originally came here expecting less and got more, a lot more.  Good job, DOCG!  Your service was fantastic and definitely appreciated.YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (055/366)What has taken us so long to dine at celebrity and award-winning Chef Scott Conant's D.O.C.G. Enoteca before? Since 2010, Chef Conant opened two Italian restaurants (D.O.C.G. and Scarpetta) in The Cosmopolitan Hotel, we've passed by numerous times on our way to other restaurants or boutiques. So this time, on our 2-day jaunt to Las Vegas, I decided to make reservations.  I chose D.O.C.G. over the sleek, sophisticated and earthy Scarpetta.  D.O.C.G. Enoteca is definitely more casual, rustic and yet modern.  Melissa was our fresh-faced, personable and attentive server. She was efficient without being rushy or obtrusive. Her friendliness matched the casual rustic restaurant as she brought out our selections in relaxed succession. We had an early dinner reservation because we were leaving Las Vegas in the next morning and we wanted to "squeeze" in a couple more hours of gambling. We started with the feature appetizer, a plate of 6 deep-fried semolina crusted oysters with Tabasco aioli.  We paired it with a bottle of 2013 Jermann Pinot Grigio that was crisp, citrusy and peachy with a smooth finish.  Melissa recommended some pasta and pizza but upon perusing the menu, we decided upon pasta. My husband chose Pici which was a bowlful of hand crafted short, thick spaghetti with braised duck sauce and black truffles. The duck sauce was chock-full of tender braised shredded duck meat. While I ordered Scialatielli that was composed of handcrafted tubular pasta with lobster and shrimp arrabbiata.  The arrabbiata wasn't overly spicy or tomatoey.  Both pastas were perfectly cooked and the sauces seemed to coat every nook and cranny of the pasta shapes. While dining, Melissa came by regularly to refill our water and wine glasses. We were considering ordering dessert wine but my "sweet tooth" chose the Salted Caramel Budino with pretzel toffee. The Budino was an intensely flavored salted caramel pudding that we paired with coffee. It was rich, sweet, creamy and rounded out our dinners. Our tastebuds and stomachs had been treated to authentic flavorful rustic Italian cuisine.  We ended our dining experience feeling full of energy and continued our evening by gambling until the "wee hours" of the next morning.
Copper Blues=This is the place where the beer flows like wine.Sorry Lloyd and Harry, you should skip past Aspen and head here. With what looked to be 40+ beers to choose from on tap, grab yourself a cold and frothy one on a moments notice. Order yourself some of their Rockin' Chicken Nacho's, a fig and goat cheese pizza, the southwest burger topped with roasted green chiles and Monterrey Jack cheese, or what can only be described as "Pig" on their menu. A 1/2 lb of bacon served with a side of dipping maple syrup. I've been twice now on a Tuesday for their Open Mic' comedy line up "Laughs and Draughts". $3 Santan brews, $6 Chicken and Mac n Cheese, and other nice priced bar foods to choose from like wings. As much as I want to love this local joint for a mid-week night of comedic stylings; unfortunately, I don't think I'll be spending too many more Tuesday's here. There's just something that seems to be missing. No, not the food. It wasn't the drinks, not even the service itself. That's right, the comedy. I'm not sure I laughed but 2 or 3 times the entire hour and a half I stuck it out. The saving grace was that the Olympics were playing on the TV's in the background, but I could have got that same olympic sized entertainment at my own home, and the beer is cheaper there.If you're looking for a laugh on a Tuesday night, I'd try to stick it out til Wednesday and find your way over to Stand-Up Scottsdale; their open mic is usually worth the time and effort, and its put together in much better fashion - no run on comedians who don't seem to cut the mustard or know when to exit stage left. They do, from time to time, have live music or a DJ spinning records. Check out their main site for a calendar of events. While I can't speak on those particulars, I imagine you can't really mess up music too badly. I would like to leave you Yelpers with the following words of advice. If you're out for a great selection of tapped and bottled beer, wine, or liquor in a cool down town atmosphere. Race on down, cause you may have just won gold.Happy Yelping Phoenix!Food: quite delicious. Atmosphere: rockin'. Customer service? I'm disheartened to say that it's extremely disappointing! Therefore the three stars is only for the food and atmosphere. I've been to Copper Blues three times now and every time there's always been some sort of hiccup. However, the hiccups were short lived and soon forgotten. Unfortunately the hiccup during this last visit won't be so easily forgotten. This past Friday night, we went to see Bob Saget perform (he is absolutely hilarious by the way). Before the show, we wanted to grab dinner so we decided to make it easy and eat at Copper Blues. When we arrived, we were given a buzzer and quoted for a 10-minute wait. We asked if there was open seating anywhere and they directed us to the outdoor patio and said that was the only open seating. After about 10 minutes of waiting, we checked back with the hostess on the status and at that point, she said it was going to be a 35 minute wait. We said that we were told 10 minutes initially and then she said, "oh well, then it's 10 minutes I guess." It was all very confusing. So after about another 10 minutes, we checked back again and at this point they said that they never quote a wait time and when I told them that I had been quoted twice, she said again that they never quote a wait time. I felt like I was on crazy pills! It didnt seem like the staff knew what was going on that night! Well, the saga continues on... At this point, it's around 6:00 PM and we are hungry and eager to get some dinner before Saget. It was also freezing on the outdoor patio and we were hoping to sit inside. We decide to check out the inside portion of the restaurant (even though we were told initially that the only open seating was outside). Well, when we got inside, we realized that the entire bar area was also open seating. Now this is where the hiccup will forever stay with me and it will be hard to get over this next part. We find two high top tables and are told that one is in use, so we take the other one. It has three chairs and we need two more chairs. At this point, a waiter comes up and confronts us. I let him know that we are in need of two more chairs and do they have any (this is in the open seating bar, remember.) He turns to me, stares at me dead on and says "well are you even planning on eating here or are you just going to be using this table to wait?" Now regardless of whether we were going to order one drink or a whole meal, I don't think a waiter should ever question a customer and treat them the way I was treated. I proceed to tell him that we are wanting to eat dinner and we have been wanting to eat dinner there for a good thirty minutes! I was blown away by the treatment and I will admit that I've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before. Someone must have seen my anger and utter shock because about five minutes later they told us they found a table at the bar for us but sadly at that point, the experience at Copper Blues was ruined. We ordered several drinks and a couple appetizers (which were delicious) but after the treatment, decided to just eat dinner at Stand Up Live. I hate writing a disappointing review like this one. I visit restaurants wanting a good experience and wanting to enjoy the atmosphere. However, customer service can either make or badly break an experience.
Culver's=Good burgers, my not-so usual place for burger but it does the job.
Sloppi Jo's Roving Eatery=I am a fan of the food trucks in Veagas, and I am glad to welcome Sloppi Jo's into the fold.The menu isn't the biggest in town, but everything is very well done. I have yet to have anything that I don't like on their menu.I attended both the soft opening and their opening joint with FUKUburger, and it was the best of both worlds...Fukuburgers and Sloppi Jo's Hatch Chile inspired menu.I'm including my review of their soft opening "Hatch Chile Cheese Burger- Burger Cooked to a perfect medium, served wrapped in a tortilla, with chilies.I was impressed with the burger the patty was decent sized and cooked to a perfect medium, there was a little heat from the chilies, but it could use a little more bite (and I'm not really a chili guy).Green Chicken Chile Stew- Chicken, peppers, potatoes, served with a tortilla on the sideThe stew had a noticeable heat, but it wasn't overbearing, the chicken pieces were big, and the stew was great, I will be getting this again.Next up was their Breakfast Burrito-It was bit of a mess, but a tasty tasty mess. Tortilla wrapped around eggs, bacon, chilies, and topped with 2 different sauces, and some crema. I am not a breakfast burrito guy but this was amazing...If I'm out in the morning and the truck is within a drive of my house...I'm having one of thesePork Taco-The Pork could be one of the best menu items at SloppiJo's it's featured in the taco and the sloppijo, the taco was good, it had avocado on it, and sadly I'm not really an avocado fan, other than that they were delish.The SloppiJo-There is nothing I can say that will do this dish any justice other than YUM. It featured the pork which was topped with a fried egg and served with a few veggies and a tortilla, it was delicious, it was messy, and I will be having more of these in the future.Sopapillas-A perfect end to the meal...sugary and delicious."My 2 favorite dishes are the Name Sake Sloppi Jo and the breakfast burrito.I look forward to eating at Sloppi Jo's more in the future.
New King Wah Chinese Buffet=Located in a small stripmall near the North East corner of Southern and Central Ave. Is this small buffet. When you enter, you have walk down a small walk way and then are met with a cashier who takes your drink order and counts the number of people in your party. You'll then claim your table and serve yourself. All the usual hits and misses of the average Chinese Buffet are here - none really stand out in all honesty. They are all pretty average and then came 'the incident'...I'm still traumatized by it. Seriously I am... I went there and it felt like any other time. I had gotten a chicken dish of somekind. i don't really recall. and I started eating it and it had a very odd taste. I didn't know what it was, it was like chicken... but not really. I then started to eat the rest of it and then I saw different bones that I have NEVER found in chickens before. I couldn't even identify which part of the chicken it was and the meat was very tough and then it hit me.... THAT WASN'T CHICKEN!!I almost threw up right then and there! I barely made it in time to go to the bathroom and vomit what I had eaten of my faux-chicken. Now I have NO idea what the hell it was that I ate. I tried to ask the cashier and she insisted it was chicken, but then she reluctantly said that it wasn't and when I demanded my money back she quit talking and wouldn't say exactly what the hell it was! The owner came out and started yelling at me and started yelling in Spanish (there is nothing quite like Spanish in a thick chinese accent!) and wouldn't stop even when I told her that I don't speak Spanish and then I realized she wasn't yelling to communicate with me, but with the other patrons who were starting to look at their own food with concern. I got my money back and bolted out of there and have NEVER gone back!!
Bouillon Bilk=OK I know I am spoiled, I am from SF area, I am a cook, a chef, in this food business for 2/3rds of my life.  I am telling you that I've been disappointed so many times in Montreal restaurants; I don't even write about the restaurants if I am disappointed that's why I don't have many reviews about Montreal restaurants but here I am now.  Try this one.  It's been opened for little more than a week.  The view from this restaurant isn't good at all - dreadful construction site you have to see while you are eating - but inside of this restaurant is cool and hip.  And of course you have to judge the restaurant with their food right?  OMG, ok the salmon burger and Bailey's cream brulee was fantastic.  It's not easy to find a "Salmon Burger" that you just bite a one and say WOW  so here we are.  :)  Have you ever tried MSG over load Poutine in QC and got disgusted?? If you've been disappointed, you should try their Poutine here.  I bet that they use real stock for the poutine!  Delicious!  Oh well, I have to go there again and try more times to say something very fair but the first impression?  Absolutely you should try.  Oh Oh Oh!  Did I tell you that there is nowhere to go around Place d'art?  so try it! :)Everytime I come back here, I eat something new!!!Carrots, whoever thought carrots were tasty, but it was!!! We had the carrot risotto, the lobster with almond sauce, ravioli, and sweet breads and octopus, yeah it's like this weird surf and turf and for dessert a banana cake with ice cream and chocolate sauce, it was weak and really not on par with the savory stuff. I find this place extremely interesting and original. They come up with the most unsual combinations of ingredients and when you think about it, it's not clearly obvious why someone would put these things together, then you eat it and you're like wow really this makes sense why didn't people think of this...Nothing is straightforward here, it's always an obtuse and oblique interpretation as usual!!! I'm not saying I've liked everything I ate here, but some of the stuff I didn't like, I can still see there was some thought put into it, what the chef was trying to do. That for me still gets points even if I didn't like the dish. When I eat here I can feel the intense passion for the food more so than most other places, I don't know who creates the menu at this place but I'm thinking it has to be someone so interesting!!! I know whatever, let me have my fantasy!!! lolexamples from previous visits:foie gras and rhubarbe, (foie gras is torchon not seared, I think the seared foie gras would have been better)seared shrimps with bone marrow and orange miso sauce !!! this one was amazingAnd this time carrot risotto with passion fruit, sweetbreads and octopus.The carrot risotto, carrot in the sauce, with carrot bits, seriously could be the best risotto I've had the past few years. Maybe there was too much sauce or too runny as they say, but I didn't mind, It tasted great. My one only caveat was the shrimps were kind of like those mini cocktail shrimps and they didn't add anything to the dish, maybe a sear could add more flavour. The dish was amazing never thought carrots could taste so good.The sweetbread and octopus. the sweetbreads was crispy and octopus was tender, garnished with peach slices, string beans and mushrooms. a pleasant dish fresh with contrasting textures colours and flavours. very nice, I promote this place to be my new favourite french resto in MTL.The ravioli was much better meat was better salted this time around huge improvement over last time, and the ravioli texture was perfect. The lobster was so so, didn't fly for me.FYI: they just expanded about 3 weeks ago, it is now twice as big, they took over the space next door.Quality food served with style, this is my short summary about the Bouillon Bilk experience. All the plates I managed to dig in were delicious. For everybody who will bother to read this review, the menu of the restaurant changes periodically and my descriptions below may not be valid in few months. The best of the appetizers:The risotto with white truffles was amazing, you won't find it on the menu and the portion won't fill you up, but the ingredients are perfect;Linguini with rabbit and snails, perfectly balanced, filling dish;The amuse bouche is not optional, you must have the bone marrow.  Mains were even better:I would definitely come back for my venison, it was perfectly medium rare cooked, surrounded by rich combination of side flavours; The cappelleti with parsnip, lobster and chestnut is absolutely the best alternative as a  main course for seafood lovers;Are you scallops addict, don't hesitate, the chef knows how to prepare them. The desserts are delicious and presented with imagination: parsnip ice-cream was my little discovery for the night. The wine list is long, rather then reading and pretending that we know what to choose we followed the sommelier's advice. He brought us three bottles that should match our predominately seafood choices and the two of them we picked were wonderful. Beware the restaurant will charge a deposit for big group of people, they accept reservations up to ten and the deposit will be reimbursed back to your credit card once you are at the restaurant. Fantastic restaurant for our first group dinner in 2015!My muse was probably watching over, since it placed me within walking distance of Bouillon Bilk...Simple urban design, endless bar seating, low ceilings and dimmed lights set my mood right from the start.It's packed. Always packed. So do make reservations. However - if you alone or do not mind eating at the bar, you can still score seat there.I asked sazerac as soon as I saw it on the list, but alas, it was not available that night, and my server (who was very helpful and nice, btw), recommended another drink of similar composition (name escapes me at the moment), which was incredibly well made.It's all started with perfect drink... Followed by bread and butter... Then, beautifully presented sweetbreads, veal tongue & celery root appetizer arrived. My eyes lit up, and my taste buds started singing. It was delicious. But it was not over yet - my cleaned to the original shine plate disappeared magically, and in it place came main course - perfectly seared scallops, cauliflower, shiitake mushrooms & watercress. I closed my eyes in joy and savored it piece by piece... I was not planning on dessert (ok, that's a bold fat lie if you know me. shhhh!), but I could not resist special that day - chocolate macaron, a scoop of ice cream & little cup of warmed wine, all together complimenting each other in taste pairing and in presentation.It was an amazing meal all together.For me, the class of Bouillon Bilk stands up there with Envy and Juni - with service, food and presentation being on the level that put it on the list of my forever favorites.I love the name of this restaurant, WOO for alliteration. Boullion Bilk - it's fun to say. I find the name attractive as well as everything inside - environment and cuisine. All appealing and cool and lovely. The decor is extremely simple and clean. Wooden floors, white walls, white tablecloths and napkins, big heavy wooden tables. No crazy artwork or light fixtures, just simple textures and clean lines. We started with the "Quebec Cheese Assortment" (5 cheeses for $20 or 3 for $15). Of course we got 5, and they were each local and incredible. I can't remember the exact names of each cheese, and I know they rotate depending on what's available, but they're five very different and beautiful options. We ate every single bite, of course. What's better than cheese?? I can't think of anything.For my entree, I ordered the scallop dish which comes with zucchini, shiitake mushrooms, pear, and watercress served in a brown butter. Oh my stars, you guys. These scallops were the most buttery, perfectly seared, velvety pieces of fish everrrr. The brown butter was rich and fantastic and the pear provided a really interesting sweetness. This particular dish was $31 which is a bit pricey considering the small portion. It's enough food for one person surely, a healthy size, but I was craving a bit more in the end. Wonderful wine menu here as well with some great local options.
Salsa Blanca=Vegetarian burrito AND grilled Vegetarian burritos are both made with animal lard (in the beans).  One employee shrugged her shoulders, another said "that's the way it is", and a third said I'd just have to order it without the (lard) beans.  Why make this naive restaurant mistake?  Don't call it a vegetarian burrito if it isn't vegetarian.  Just call it a veggie burrito.   It's especially annoying because vegetarians tend to gravitate towards more gringo places like this one that are more likely to have vegetarian items than the more "traditional" Mexican places where lard and chicken stock is put in everything.Grilled veggie burrito had cold cheese inside.  Not melted, not lukewarm, but cold.  Tortilla wasn't the slightest bit warm either, just as if it was served raw.  So there's this cool to the touch tortilla with cold cheese inside, and then the grilled veggies.  Tables receive salsa which is nice, the hot is really more of a medium, but then a small portion of chips.  The one-top next to me had the same chips portion and we had 3 in our party.  Why do this to people?  You're going to hear a request for more chips within the first few minutes, and people are going to wonder why the table only had one little portion in the first place.Atmosphere is clean with huge mirrors on some of the walls, and a flat panel TV on the other showing a nature documentary.  A few fake Macaws hanging from the ceiling.  It still has a trace of the Pick Up Stix feel that used to be here but went out of business.  Ordering procedure is the same.Staff was entirely unlike most Mexican places - vast majority of people were caucasian, or gringo if you prefer, and that raises an eyebrow in an ethnic restaurant.  Maybe that matters to the reader here, maybe not.On a positive note, the employees did check on tables as folks were dining, and were over the top with politeness.   That's incredibly rare these days.
Anthony's Prime Steak and Seafood=We stopped by the M Resort for some light bites and drinks. The oyster bar thats a part of Anthony's has and east/west motif to their menu. Half of the menu has Asian-inspired fare, while the other half has American fare. Three types of oysters were offered. We went with half a dozen of the smaller Kusshi oysters. Clean and mild tasting, they were a great start to our meal. Next up was a cucumber and watermelon salad ($10). I envisioned a beautifully composed, petite salad. What we got was the opposite. It was a large mound of lettuce, vegetables, and watermelon drowning in a kim chee vinaigrette. The flavors were somewhat bold and spicy but it was so heavy-handed that I could only eat a few bites.We moved over to a different bar closer to their main dining room to check out their menu. Yup, a completely different bar menu. Not sure why they felt it necessary to have a separate menu, but whatever. The beef tartare ($22) was another heavy-handed dish. The cylindrical stack of beef sat atop mixed greens. On top of the beef was a substantial pile of pickled red onions and a quail egg. The dish was way too acidic, drowning in a sauce that was probably masking inferior beef. There were two more sauces needlessly spread across the plate. Talk about overkill... there were about half a dozen ingredients that should have been left off the dish.The last item we tried were the lobster tacos ($24). Surprise, surprise... it was another heavy-handed dish with an excessive amount of ingredients. They used so much chipotle aioli and avocado mousse that I couldn't even taste lobster. Sauce was oozing out in every direction.Anthony's has a menu -- or menus, plural -- that sound appetizing, but unfortunately the execution is lacking.2.5 Stars
Big Paul's BBQ=With all that Las Vegas has to offer on the culinary scene, one of its weakest categories is Barbeque. Barbeque in Las Vegas has been a joke that just doesn't get funnier with each telling. It's apparent that Vegas needs Barbeque, because there is always another joint being opened up by someone who has no idea how to make Barbeque.The few places that do Barbeque right in this town get everything else wrong. Remember, Barbeque is working man's food. It is supposed to be affordable and in large quantities that satisfy the hungriest cowboy - an idea that Lucille's has completely forgotten. It is also supposed to be rustic and down-home, served in off-the-wall joints with billows of smoke flavoring the neighborhood - something you won't get at the Wisconsin based Dave's.Then comes Big Paul's BBQ. You've never heard of it, it not a chain. You've probably never seen it, it sits quietly on a simple strip mall corner of western Flamingo Ave. It's rustic, it's understated, it down-home - in-other-words - it's almost perfect.Ribs, Chicken, Links, Brisket, Pulled Pork and Catfish are just a few of the menu items to choose from. I had the Brisket and Ribs combo - 3 full pounds of deliciously smoke meat a couple of sides and bread.The brisket was perfectly tender, with a beautiful ring of pink on the outside as proof its slow-smoked preparation. You could tell that Paul left the fat on the brisket during the smoking process. The ribs were equally well smoked and fall-off-the-bone tender just like the brisket. I got both without the sauce, because I like to taste the Barbeque itself before the sauce has its affect. The BBQ Beans were definitely delicious, the green beans were canned and one of the few detractions to the rest of the meal. The dry ribs were evidence that Paul doesn't do much to season the Barbeque during the smoking process. Although some prefer their Barbeque this way, I have always been a bigger fan of a dry rub or a vinegar wash during smoking.All-in-all, the meat was delicious and the spicy BBQ Sauce was pretty good (next time I will try the regular BBQ Sauce). Big Paul is from the Houston area and he holds true to the region's Barbeque roots. I think with time, Big Paul's BBQ could definitely evolve into a local gem. It gets 3 stars now, but I can see it moving up to 4 in no time.The second BBQ restaurant at this location post Shish Kabob House.  I was a fan of the last place and the only person to ever write a review on it :(  The menu seems to be about the same as the last with a couple of additions to the sides menu and some pretty good food combos for 2 or more.  It was July 4th.  I left work late and we didn't feel like firing up the grill.  My initial plan was to just go pick up Famous Dave's but ended up taking a quick right while driving west on Flamingo due to this overpowering smell of barbecued meat!  What the heck right?  Better off supporting a local mom and pop place than a megachain anyways.  I ordered the combo of baby back ribs slab, 20 hot wings and 2 large sides for $24.99.  The slab of ribs with 2 small sides was almost $20 so this was a no brainer for $5 more.  The ribs were pretty awesome.  They had a fantastic smokey flavor to them that one could only get by slow cooking those babies all day.  Wings were pretty standard.  About the same as any other pizza joint in town but good enough.  The cashier recommended the red beans and rice along with the macaroni salad for sides which were both spot on.Already planning on getting the brisket and pulled pork for my next order!Honestly, I'd give this place negative stars if I could. The food was ok, but as a paying customer, I expect to be treated with courtesy and not like a criminal.I live very close (less than 5 minutes by car) to this place and was very excited to have a bbq place in the neighborhood; so excited that when my cousin came to visit, I recommended we give it a try. We drive up there and place our order with who we later found out was the owner (yes, Big Paul himself). He was not the friendliest of guys, but the prices were reasonable, we were hungry, and the place smelled great so I overlooked it.We brought our food home and I was ready to sink my teeth in to a juicy smoked rib, only to bite down in to a tough, rubbery piece of meat that I literally could not chew. But the sauce was pretty tasty and we'd ordered other items so though I was disappointed by the ribs, I moved on to the brisket and pulled pork. Neither was anything to write home about, but the meat was at least chewable and as I said before the sauce was good. We finished eating and my pregnant cousin reached in to her bag for dessert, only to find that they had forgotten to include her peach cobbler. No big deal, we lived close and they deliver. She called the restaurant to inform them of the mistake. They did not offer to deliver it to us, but agreed when asked. My cousin also asked if she could be upgraded to a large as compensation for the mistake. The girl on the other end said "that shouldn't be a problem." The delivery guy shows up at the house with a small peach cobbler. My cousin asks about the large and the driver knows nothing about it. She repeated what the girl on the phone had told her and he said he would call and find out what happened. The delivery guy gets in his car to use the phone and a minute later we hear his car drive away, assuming he was going to get the large cobbler. We wait half an hour and then my cousin calls again. This time the owner gets on the phone. My cousin politely explains what happened to him and we were both STUNNED when the owner begins shouting at her and saying that he "waisted gas" sending his driver to her and if she didn't want a small, that was "her problem." Still in shock, my cousin explains that there must have been a misunderstanding. Still rude, the owner says that she can come pick up her money (which was only $2.99 by the way) but he was done with the whole situation. He would not even listen to her speak.  At this point my cousin is becoming upset (not to mention hormonal, because she is pregnant). She tries voicing how displeased she is with the way she is being treated and the owner asks her is she BELIEVES IN GOD!!! WTF?!?!? What did that have to do with anything? How unprofessional can you be?!  Incredibly annoyed by now, I accompany my cousin back to the restaurant. Again, it was only $3 but she still wanted the peach cobbler (again, pregnant).  We walk in and she says to the owner, "Sir I ordered a peach cobbler and..." Before she could finish speaking he opens the register and cuts her off to say "There's your money, now you can go." Shocked again, my cousin says "I would just like to say that I am very disappointed with..." He cuts her off again, "You made your point, now get out. If you don't leave now, I'll call the cops. I've got you on camera and I know your address." (Which was actually MY address because she doesn't live here in Vegas). By now, my cousin is PISSED. "Call the cops." She tells him, "I've done nothing wrong. All I wanted was to upgrade a small peach cobbler to a large, no one even bothered to ask me if I was willing to pay the additional money for an upgrade! I'm a paying customer!" He gets on the phone and dials the police. To avoid any trouble, we left the restaurant both disappointed and confused. As we are getting in to the car, the owner follows us outside to read off the license plate number to my cousin's rental car to the police (supposedly) on the phone. My experience here was so horrible and so disappointing, I will NEVER eat here again. I wish the opposite were true, but in my opinion bad service out weighs good bbq sauce. Never in my life have I been so disrespected and treated like a criminal just for ordering dessert. Especially when it was THEM who made the mistake in the first place. They really need to learn how to do business with people or they surely will not last long.
Bite Bistro=I have been to Bite Bistro several times... living in Bellevue, then moving to neighboring Avalon, it's rare that I have a chance to brag about culinary attractions in the area.For those unsure about where Bellevue is, Bite Bistro is worth the extra work to figure it out and make the trip (it's really only a few minutes outside of the city!).  Bite Bistro is a welcoming restaurant, stylish and modern but comfortable and casual.  There is usually a nice mix of older fine dining patrons and younger couples and groups.  It's BYOB and they offer a lot of tasty mixers for liquor.  Many of the ones I've tried are a bit too sweet for me, so I usually settle with a bottle of wine or beer.  This particular trip to Bite I was concerned because nothing on the menu immediately jumped out as an easy choice.  They recently removed my go-to Prosciutto Sandwich (with St. Andres cheese, amazing sandwich), so I was desperate to find my next fave dish.  My husband ordered the Hanger Steak, which is a delicious mix of juicy flavorful steak and Bite's unbeatable fries.  Can't go wrong with that, but I was looking for something a little less heavy.  I settled on the Duck Breast and squash.  I don't remember ever having duck, so this was a leap.  It came out medium rare, sliced over top of tenderly sauteed squash, brussel sprouts, and fresh cranberries.  The duck was so juicy it was unbelievable.  I'm not usually a fan of fat on meat, but the thin edge of fat on one of the pieces was like butter mixed with the delicious duck.  The bitter crunchy cranberries and rich flavors of the squash and brussels was perfectly balanced.  My husband even liked the duck more than the steak (and the steak was good, people).  One thing I love about Bite is that I always have room for dessert, and they always have something that is interesting.  Tonight we treated ourselves to the goat cheese and warm cider dessert.  The goat cheese was so creamy and rich that I could have eaten a bucket of it.  Served with little pieces of bread and apples this was a great fall/winter dessert idea.  The warm cider was a nice finishing touch.  I have had dishes I like more than others at Bite, but I've never had any dish there that was not thoughtfully cooked, carefully presented, and creative.  I couldn't ask for more than that from a restaurant.  The service is always fantastic.  I would come here every night if I could!  Next time I'm there I'd love to experience a chef's tasting.  Keep up the great work, Bite Bistro!
Grumman78=Delicious and creative taco's, although in Montreal we have a lack of taco trucks so everyone may have flipped out on this one and lost all perspective. Friends of mine recently booked the taco truck to cater their wedding and have been thrilled with the kind service and tasty sampling options, so the great reputation comes with a dose of good-people-ness that puts me up to 5 stars.
Meat & Potatoes=We came in on Saturday night.  We had a reservation, but it would not have been necessary on this particular evening.  Got got one of the tiny round marble tables along the banquet.Our server Brent checked in with us right away.  We thought his service was superior through out our visit.  BJ opted for a Butternuts Pork Slap and I got a Ronaldo which was house made raspberry vodka, grenadine, and citrus sparkling.  Loved my drink and BJ loved his beer!While we pondered the menu, we decided to get an appetizer and share a Wedge salad.  They were thoughtful enough to divide the salad for us.  I was surprised at the size of my half portion.  It was huge.  The wedge was baby iceberg, super crisp bacon, roasted tomatoes-yum!!, croutons, ramps-my first experience, and the most incredible house made blue cheese with nice chunks of blue cheese.  The Yukon Skins appetizer was the perfect size for two.  This was my first experience with pork belly pastrami and I liked it.  After some debate, BJ got the smoked pork chop with pastrami, baked beans and  spicy apple slaw.  I tried his meal.  The chop was incredible, as was the beans and slaw.  I loved the kick from the jalapenos.  Best slaw ever!  And the portion size was big.  It's the first time that BJ didn't finish this meal.  I am usually the one with the carry out bag.  I got the lobster risotto for my meal.  The portion size was fairly small, which was good because there were so many other things that I wanted to eat!  The risotto was not my favorite, it was a little too watery for my taste and the lobster was a little stringy.  Not bad, but not that great, either.For dessert, we shared the blueberry pana cotta.  It was cute that they served it in a mason jar, but not so great when it came to eating it.  We had to use our small coffee spoons to be able to get a nice mix of the cream with the blueberries.  Also, the texture was a bit rubbery, but we still loved the flavor.  For those of you parking in the Theater Square garage, M & P is able to offer a reduced rate parking.  Just ask your server.  Loved our dinner!The BEST brunch in the 'Burgh, hands down!  For starters, FINALLY a Pittsburgh establishment has an honest to God Bloody Mary bar!  And, if you sit at the bar during Saturday or Sunday brunch, Bloody Mary's are all you can drink for $15.  That, my friend, is a deal.Now on to the food.  Wow.  Here I go with superlatives again, but the shortrib hash with poached eggs drizzled with horseradish hollandaise was, without a doubt, absolutely stellar!  Rich, melt-in-your-mouth, succulent shredded shortribs melded together with creamy potato cubes.  Perched atop were two perfectly poached eggs whose yolks, when pierced by a fork, enveloped the hash in creaminess only surpassed by the final crowning glory of a zippy housemade horseradish hollandise.  Superb....I've been fantasizing about them ever since.  The hubby enjoyed a plate of chicken and waffles.  You may recall he ordered the same thing at Alchemy & Ale recently...Meat & Potatoes makes chicken and waffles the way they SHOULD be made!  Crisp, crunchy, JUICY, ON THE BONE chicken pieces piled atop a crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside cheddar jalapeno waffle kissed with bacon bourbon maple syrup.  Ooooooo....maple. Bacon. Bourbon.  We each had a specialty drink - me the Bacon & Egg - a blend of bacon vodka, orange juice, sugar and egg white.  The bacon vodka was a house infusion that packed more bacon punch than the Bakon brand I have in my bar.  I am going to try my own bacon infusion again!  The drink was interesting, but next time I want all that bacon-y goodness in a Bloody Mary!  Fond memories of San Remo and Monte Carlo meals always ending with Fernet Branca enticed the hubster to order a Kingston which included Drambuie and Fernet Branca along with pineapple juice.  He enjoyed it, but enjoyed his Shock Top Pumpkin Wheat Ale even more!  He IS a pumkin ale fan.The brunch prices here are amazingly reasonable!  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, professional and efficient.  The kitchen is top notch!  Meat & Potatoes is a PERFECT way to start a weekend morning!I know what you're thinking... Seriously, another 5 star review? Why so? Here's the deal folks. This place has consistently been awesome. Dinner: awesome! Brunch: awesome! And drumroll please... Lunch: AWESOME!There's not many places I can say that about, but they find a way to be creative and deliscious with every meal. I do hope you read all my other reviews on this place for tips on what I thought were gear choice (poutine, cough cough) but for lunch I probably had thee best fish sandwich I've ever had! They just opened for lunch today and are running a special Lentin menu with fish, fish and more fish... And one burger (seriously, if you don't like fish or a burger you might be screwed till Easter.). I had the Parmesan fish sammie, which was a generous portion of perfectly battered fish, a VERY generous portion of provolone and tomato sauce. But the crown jewel was the smoked potato salad side dish. Again, generous portion of some of the most delectable and inventive potato salad I've ever had! The smoked taste stayed with me for a while after, but rather than garlic breathe, it was actual a reminder how, oh. My. Gawd. Amazing it was! To be continued....My review in one word - disappointing. How about two words? Very disappointing. We were so excited to try this place after strong yelp reviews and friends' recommendations so we saved our first visit for my birthday. 6:15 Saturday night reservations started off great. Seated right away, asked if we had theater plans so they could make sure they tended us in a timely manner. Seemed like a great beginning. That was when it went downhill. The two of us were seated along the wall where the " tables" for two are located. These tables are woefully small and completely inadequate for any dinner setting. And they are so close together!! They are essentially thigh width apart!! There should be a minimum state requirement of butt width for goodness sake! Even the skinny busboys couldn't wedge themselves in there. When your chair is wider than the table, you know it's bad. Makes for a very disruptive dining experience when your neighbor leaves. Plus, I think the fire marshall should have a look at this. Can't be safe. When I say close together, I mean the plates of the diners on either side of me were just as close to me as my wife's across the table! Everything was in arms reach. I wanted a table for two, not a party of six. I am not that interested in your life, trust me. Beer served in cans is not my style but I did one anyway. Arrived warm. Wanted to try the smoked wings we'd heard about so we started with those and the curry mussels. Both came out together and we literally had to stack them on top of each other on the table since it was so tiny. Ridiculous. The wings were the best thing all night - good, not great. I'm a huge mussels fan and was excited when they arrived looking fresh and delish. They were large but not delish. There was NO flavor. Bland with a capital B. No curry flavor at all - I think the steaming liquid would have tasted better.  Did the spice cabinet turn out to be empty? Nice quantity though. Just not what I would have expected. Frankly I could have stopped eating here - and wish I had. We had placed our entire order at one time. I ordered the brisket sandwich and my wife the short rib flatbread. Between appetizers and entree was at least 50 minutes. At one point I was finally able to grab our server ( where DOES she does disappear to?) and told her, if it's not out now, just cancel the order. She had stopped by 25 minutes prior and said they'd be out in one minute. Wrong.Amazingly, mine came out but she dropped the flat bread in the kitchen.  Service disaster. Let's just say 2 1/2 hours is way too long for what we had. One hour waits between courses? Absurd. Service was among the worst I've ever experienced. And the brisket? After 3 bites I put my utensils down. Not good at all. Another flavorless serving. Flatbread? Awful. Short rib my eye. If there was more than an ounce of short rib on there I'll buy your next meal. I feel bad giving it two stars but that was what my experience calls for. Oh, and the very limited draft beer menu? No Oktoberfest at all. Instead, a summer session ale? I mean, come on guys - this is October! There's no excuse for that. And at $7 and $10 each for our drafts, this is not a place I'd even want to drink.We were very excited to try this restaurant and went there on Saturday night for my husband's birthday. After reading a lot of the Yelp reviews, I was looking forward to the food and was concerned about the poor service many before us reviewed.Well as you may guess by the rating, neither the food or the service was up to par. In my opinion, one of the very best things a restaurant can do to ensure its success is to make sure their servers are knowledgeable, gracious, super efficient & personable. If I'd had that, I'd probably give the food another chance. The most glaring failure during order taking was asking if we wanted bread or frites with our mussels and failing to mention when my husband said frites that he would again be served French fries with his brisket sandwich. Who seriously needs 2 orders of fries during 1 service? Our first beers we ordered off the bar menu were served in cans - that's an inexcusable restaurant decision that I wish they had made more obvious on that bar menu. Seriously, it's a gastropub not a tailgate!  Draft beers were not mentioned by our server and had we not read the board on the other side of the bar and done an online search for the beer's description, we wouldn't have known they existed or what they were. She had no idea about any of the drafts when we asked.So many things on the menu were appealing we decided to order 4 items. We started with the smoked wings (recommended highly by other Yelpers) and the curry mussels. I got the feeling if we hadn't specified to our server that we considered the final 2 items to be our entrees, that all 4 items would have shown up at our ridiculously tiny table for 2 at once. When the 2 appetizers arrived at once we had to pile everything on top of each other because the table didn't have room for 2 appetizers plus 2 small appetizer plates. The wings were actually really delicious with a nice smokey flavor and turned out to be  the highlight of the meal. The mussels were nicely sized and plentiful but the curry sauce was sorely lacking in flavor. Then our server disappeared for 20 minutes, stopped by to tell us she was sorry about our wait but our food would be up in 1 minute, then disappeared for 25 additional minutes. My husband found her scurrying by long enough to tell her to please cancel the rest of our food if it wasn't already sitting in the back. She disappeared for another 5 minutes and appeared with only my husband's brisket sandwich which came with more frites. She squeezed into the tiny space between us & the next table and informed me that my short rib flatbread had hit the floor as she was racing it to our table but that they had started another one and it would be done in 7 minutes. Not sure why the first one couldn't come out in 45 if it only took 7 to cook. Neither the brisket nor the flatbread were very good and unfortunately our attitudes toward Meat & Potatoes weren't either by the end of the evening.Rachel C and I feasted like champion eaters at Meat & Potatoes. We started with the mussels, which were a very generous portion. They were served in a peppery curry sauce and we received some bread for dipping. Then the kitchen sent out some fried pickles and brussels on the house - both were great! Next up was the mac and cheese with chorizo and pulled pork (!!!). The cheese was definitely very Velveeta-esque (pretty sure it was Velveeta). Delish. I was so stuffed at this point that I really couldn't eat much of my main course. A shame because it was also awesome. Hanger steak with all kinds of veggies and potatoes. Our server was great and very knowledgeable about the menu. When she brought over my slightly-dirty martini, she immediately asked me to let her know if it was too dirty. It was, and I appreciated that she recognized that right away. My replacement martini was just right. Next time I find myself in Pittsburgh, Meat and Potatoes is definitely on the agenda!I have to say that since moving from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, I've been disappointed with the restaurants I've tried so far. Philly made me a total food snob, which happens easily when you can eat any cuisine at any time on any street corner and have a great meal, whether it's $10 or $50. I know, I know there are great places in Pittsburgh and everyone tells me I just haven't been to the "right" places yet.Meat & Potatoes was one of those places! My faith in Pittsburgh food is restored. This was easily the best meal I've had here and definitely up there for one of the best meals I've had anywhere. From my phone call making reservations to dessert, we had an amazing experience here.I called to make reservations and was connected with Matthew, who was extremely helpful and very pleasant! I had to call back soon after to make changes due to a change in our party number and he was overall very accommodating.  We arrived a bit before our reservation and got drinks at the bar. They have a nice selection of beers, some drafts and then an extensive bottle selection. It was quite crowded, so we took our drinks out to the lobby where there are large, comfy couches and tables to wait for our table. When we were seated, we were introduced to Josh, who was a magnificent server and made our meal very enjoyable! He took great care of us throughout the night, from making sure we had everything we needed to making menu suggestions at our request.Everything was delicious. We started with the Curry Mussels and Wild Mushroom Risotto. They were a great indication of the quality of the food we were going to have and we could not stop raving about it. The risotto was creamy and cooked perfectly. I am a huge fan of Mussels and loved something other than the traditional red or white sauce. Curry, coconut milk, lemongrass...YUM!Each of us ordered a different entree and shared so we could sample everything. I could not have been happier with my selection. I ordered the Agnolotti pasta. It had pecorino romano cheese, greens, sweet potatoes and a maple bourbon foam. I was intrigued right away. A sweet, savory pasta dish that was definitely one of the most delicious and unique I had ever tasted. I am to stop myself from devouring it just so I could savor the leftovers!The other dishes were equally as delicious! (Some of the best steak I've ever had.)Pappardelle pasta with bolognese sauce, short rib, pancetta and pork shoulderWagyu Flat Iron with heirloom cherry tomatoes, pickled jicama, wasabi mashed potatoesHanger Steak with pulled potatoes, romesco,  water cress, green onions, jalapeno vinaigretteOh and it didn't stop there. We decided to indulge in dessert because we knew it would be amazing. We shared an Eggnog pot de creme and a chocolate mousse that were both out of this world!!I will definitely be going back because there were other menu items such as the Korean Reuban and  Lamb Burger that definitely caught my eye as well!I have been wanting to go to Meat & Potatoes for a long time. I have heard such good things so this was a place I really needed to go to. Lo and behold I was asked to a late night birthday celebration! It was held on Monday after 10. We were presented with two menus. A late night menu and the regular menu.  I was torn. The late night menu was $5!!! And the menu looked amazing, mussels, oyster, patty melt, shake and bake chicken, and an assortment of flat breads! Wow, what a great menu and a great deal.  But would the portions be enough? Or was this a sampling menu. I was hungry. I didn't want this $5 menu to turn out to be some sliders and a chicken leg. So I asked the waitress about the portion size. She said that they were small, but still good and made a shape with her hands that looked like a slider sized bun.OK, I thought to myself, better go with the big girl menu.  I ordered the Kimchi Ruben from the regular menu. The rest of the party went with the late night menu, and ordered two of each of the $5 plates. My food came first, and it was delicious. The bread was thick and crusty, and did not get soggy even the next day. The corned beef was cut to perfection and the kimchi (brussels sprouts) was spot on. Just enough spice and heat to make me want to try it again. But, then the rest of the food came out. And let me tell you, that  $5 menu was no joke. The flat breads were so good. I got to try the greens and chilies flatbread. OH MY. The greens were cooked to sweet perfection and when you took a bite it was heaven, with that kick of chilies mixed in. Just enough to make you go, "WOW" but not overwhelming. The Patty Melt was amazing. Juicy, cheesy, and the bread was thick and toasted just right. The mussels were marinating in this amazing buttery garlic sauce that made you dip your crusts of bread in it, just to get another bite. So good.(Can you tell we shared plates?)My only complaint is that if the waitress wouldn't have told me that the sizes were small I would have saved some money and just ordered off the late night menu. But I was not disappointed with my order or all of the other dishes I tried at all. And it makes me want to go back soon. This time, I will focus on the late night menu!!If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck & looks like a duck, then it's duck so please send it to Meat and Potatoes promptly as I will be over to eat it shortly.  Just thinking about it gets me all quacked up.  First time there but definitely not our last trip to M&P.  We arranged reservations almost 2 weeks in advance and when we arrived the waiting area was packed with other reservation holders so reservations are a must.  I did see a table or two that was not occupied during our early dinner but I chuck that up to the hours we were dining, 5pm on a Saturday.  Well it worked out perfect since we were coming from an afternoon show.I studied the menu for two weeks looking it over and over and wondering what I would order.  I had thought of the fried pickles as these are one of my favorites, or the pork belly taco's because come on pork belly in a taco!  Yum, but no.  My recent love affair with duck had me swooning for it...  I also saw so many wonderful pictures of the bone marrow I had to give that a shot too.  I can say confidently that I picked wisely.  This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.As I looked to my H who I convinced to order the Wagyu, I stated, "Welcome to my new favorite restaurant".  He absolutely loved the wagya, he said I wish there was just one more piece of it.  I think he could have had two... Lucky for me my plate filled me and though I could have eaten more I didn't have to, the portion was perfect.  I could've done without the pierogies.   I love pierogies but this one wasn't my thing.  All is fine I gladly gave them to my H to eat and he happily did so.  The atmosphere here seems casual with an upscale feel at the same time and the seats were like sitting on your overstuffed couch.  I melted in.  I will be back M&P you really got all your ducks in a row.The thing that I really want to talk about when it comes to Meat & Potatos is the seating. If you want a food review you can read one of the many others. I want to say something about the seating. I really don't like sitting really closely to other people. There are many 2 person tables that pretty much line the border of the restaurant. So you are basically eating with the people on your left and right so it makes for a poor experience when you sit next to overly chatty people who want to talk to you and or when you're sitting next to drunk people. Also I don't know what the waiter looked like because he was literally standing directly behind me the entire meal, because I was facing the wall and there is no room to take the order from the side of the table because the waiter's butt would be in the faces of the table next to you. That is a little annoying to me. I wish the seating was better but over all it was a good experience and the food was delicious.Impressive...so impressive. Another place that makes me gloat about how cool Pittsburgh is. There was a bit of a mix up with reservations, and the room we'd requested wasn't available. Because of this mistake, though, the manager made sure we were seated, and our party was comped appetizers. Good business! Those apps were divine: mushroom flatbread, tuna tartare tacos, fries...we passed them around again and again, our eyes telling the story of our love for them. I had never eaten dinner here before, so I was really excited, and I ordered the pot roast. It's meat and potatoes, people. I'm not leaving here without some mash! While I was waiting on the dinner, I tried the 25th hour cocktail, a blend of gin and citrus that I would love to recreate at home. M&P is well-known for their creativity behind the bar, and tonight did not disappoint. Now for the meal! OMG. Meat was tender and juicy, and it sat on a bed of the most perfect consistency of mashed potatoes one could ask for. The plate was adorned  with a gravy that brought the whole dish together, and I was in glutton heaven. It was a special occasion, and I hit the gym the next day :)Of course, we didn't stop there. To complete the celebration of the evening, the table ordered each of the three desserts to share: panacotta, Heath bar, and chocolate Oreo. Each of these desserts comes in a mason jar and is packed with deliciousness. Everyone had a different fav. Service was outstanding!Five stars, well-deserved.One of my favorite dinner spots downtown with dishes that are a bit pricey (for the Pittsburgh market) but well-executed. Never really have been let down with food options here plus they have a reasonable selection of beers. Always busy so make sure to make a reservation beforehand! I haven't had the brunch here so all my comments are for dinner but I will say I've heard good things about the brunch. It's on my to do list...On a side note, Monday nights after 10 PM they have industry night for the folks who are in the restaurant industry. They offer $8 bites and drink specials- definitely worth checking out if you're out late on a Monday. Food:I've eaten a number of dishes here and quite frankly have never been disappointed. It is, in true Pittsburgh fashion, rather decadent so don't go if you're on a diet. My favorites:Snacks/Apps- fried taters with black truffle mayo (the mayo really sells it in my opinion), Mac n cheese (a generous serving of mixed in chorizo packs in a nice punch of flavor; eat and expect an impending nap), fried brussels (my favorite but again, not the healthy kind your mom made you eat as a kid)Entrees- lamb burger (just all-in-all well executed burger), pork chop Also if you're there for industry night on Monday, I believe the menu may rotate each time but if poutines are on the menu (see picture) go for Asian Persuasion and Southern Pride. Three poutine dishes was more than plenty for 4 of us following an appetizer or two. Drinks:Had a mixed experience with cocktails here. Not all that impressed with them so if you're on the fence about a cocktail or draft beer, I'd steer towards the latter. They seem to always have a few interesting ones on tap. If you're looking for a place for a quick drink with friends downtown and are willing to stand at the bar, it's a worthwhile stop. Ambience:Matches the food- lots of wood, warm and dimly lit. As I alluded to before, it's a nice way to prep you for the food coma to come. The place seems busy often do not a quiet romantic date spot but certainly trendy and interesting enough for a date or with a few friends. Large groups would probably be difficult to seat here- haven't tried before. Service:Generally good although can be a bit slower when things are busy. Never had issues so far.We went again over the summer on my birthday. We started off with the Mac N Cheese appetizer (chorizo, pulled pork and loads of cheese!) So so good! A definite must try!This time for our entree the wife and I shared the 34 oz rib eye for two. It comes with confit steak fries, house made steak sauce and bone marrow gratin. It is AMAZING and a bargain at $59 as we ate off of it for days!!Our daughter had the Plain Jane burger with white cheddar cheese and loved it. I'm glad I made reservations as the place was packed the whole time we were there.Service was exceptional as our waitress Ashlee S was great and took good care of us.I've said before and I'll say it again. THIS PLACE IS A MUST TRY!!!Meat & Potatoes is practically legendary in Pittsburgh.  This restaurant is within the Cultural Trust building that contains a parking garage, the backstage bar, and the Cabaret Theater.  It is usually crowded so definitely make a reservation if possible.My friend and I came here as a celebration, and we ordered quite a bit of food.  We started with the Tartare ($16) and Short Rib Flatbread ($12).  We needed some instructions with the Tartare because we had no idea how to eat it.  We ended up ordering pita to it with it, but the server could have done a bit more explaining when asked.  The flatbread, however, was unique and delicious.  It had the rib meat, bleu cheese, and a sweetness to it.For dinner, I ordered the Parpadelle ($18), which was FANTASTIC.  I eat very little meat in general, but the meat here is flawless.  It is so perfectly tender and amazing.  The pasta and sauce were delicious as well.  Absolutely recommend.  My friend ordered the duck breast ($18), which was also delicious!  I know most people come here and get the giant cow thing, but I am not into meat enough to order that. We finished off our meal with some kind of Creme Brule dessert thing.  It was served in a mason jar and also had hints of chocolate.  It was just ok and really lacked any distinct flavor.  We did not even eat half of the dessert between two of us.So why is this place not perfect?  The lovely ambiance is ruined by tables that are too close together.  You can barely move and forget having much of a conversation with anyone you are out to dinner with.  The worst part is that you are so close that the people next to you will try to jump into your conversation.  It's basically family style seating, which is so not my scene.  While the food is fantastic, I am unlikely to return unless I want to sit alone at the bar.Roses are redmy steaks is tooI ordered an extra sideAnd there's none for you! (~o~)Soooo yummy ...this might be the best restaurant Iv been to during my stay in Pittsburgh!! the bar is just really inviting!! might be one of my favorite things about this restaurant! -Appetizers ----fried pickles! thinkin bout dat bikini body but also thinkin bout dem fried pickles...Fried pickles Strips ...Thin, crispy and savory, popular as an appetizer! -----mushroom truffle Risotto!! delectable Italian risotto with lots of mushrooms served with rich truffle oil and cheese..delish! -entrees------porterhouse for two...can feed like four people! holy shit! bone marrowCooked in butter...oven ed..served with toasted butter bread! there's other flavorings depending on the creativity and tradition of the cook!porterhouse steaksOne of the most famous thing to order here!  This meat seasoned and cooked perfectly! im impressed! potatoeswell seasoned as well...oven crispy on the outside and soft on the inside the biggest "french fries" i have ever seen! there was one thing i didn't like about this was the waiter serving me two teaspoons of ketchup when i have a full plates of potatoes..i kept asking for more but he just kept on giving me teaspoons... that was pretty irritating! just give me a dame ketchup  bottle...gosh!  champagnelove it! ;Dthe decor and atmosphere of this restaurant is nice.. however....didn't like how the tables were so connected to each other...i actually felt like i dining with other people just because the tables and chairs were so close to each other...
NYP- Pizzeria=This place would've gotten 5 stars, but the customer service skills here suck. This isn't Dick's.You line up and let the person behind the counter know what kind of pizza you want. We had choices in front of us like meat lovers, cheese, veggie... we didn't see pepperoni, so when I asked, the guy was snooty and said yea.... like of course, it's a pizza place... but it was not in the window, so I asked. I also ordered a garlic knot. 6 for $3.95 was too many, so we got the 1 for $.95It only took a few minutes, but it was the longest few minutes in the world because it was so uncomfortable. They didn't talk to you or welcome you. They had sad looks on their faces and it felt like asking them for ranch was like pulling teeth. We sat just outside of the establishment and the pizza was great. Thin sliced New York style, of course. Sauce was good, not too sweet. The crust was not bland. It was a good slice. The garlic knot was good, too. Fluffy bread, not much garlic, just enough and it is served with hot marinara.The pizza here was decent. The hubby and I shared a slice of cheese pizza. He also got two garlic knots with marinara sauce. We washed everything down with a  Dr. Brown's root beer.For $5.45, the slice wasn't that huge and it was thin crust. Since it was thin crust, I was hoping that it would be crispy, but it wasn't. The pizza wasn't overly salty. The sauce had a nice seasoning to it. The garlic knots were awesome. They were just buttery, garlicky, and soft. I dipped it into the marinara sauce and stuffed it into my mouth. It made my tastebuds happy. The guy working there was cool. They were having this promotion with this mug. It was $10 but you could get free refills at any of their restaurants with a purchase. Without a purchase, it was $1 or something like that. He wasn't trying to sell it to me or anything. I noticed it and asked him about it. He took his time explaining it to me.
Hot N Juicy Crawfish=We came to the new location last night to avoid the long wait at the original location. It still smells like construction in here. I love the decor. We get seated and our server asks us what we would like to drink. I order a Blue Moon and she tells me they don't have their alcohol permit yet. WTF?!!What we ordered:2 Calamari1 Fried Catfish Basket2 lbs Shrimp Hot N Juicy medium1 lb Shrimp Garlic Butter mild1 Chicken Nuggets Basket2 Chicken Wings Basket1 Fried Shrimp4 Bowls of RiceThe food was just as good as the original location. This is the first time I tried the Catfish and Calamari and they were both very good. My only other complaint is that the chicken wings for the kids took a long time and were brought out a few minutes apart. They should have just brought out the orders together, cause one kid had to watch the other kid eat. I will mos def come back to this location since there is no wait to be seated. Next time I will call first to make sure they have their alcohol permit.I told one of my coworkers about a new business that is having a grand opening today, and to meet us there after work.  I didn't know the exact address, so I told him to just search for the Hot N Juicy by name and go to the one closest to the Wynn.  He immediately thought I was trying to steer him to some other type of establishments hidden in plain sight throughout Las Vegas.At Hot N Juicy, where the girls on average are pretty, the service is very friendly and attentive, Hot n Juicy Special is always on the menu, individual experiences can be customized from Mild to Extra Spicy, you can definitely treat your mouth to a messy but happy ending.  And today only, you can enjoy it with a 2-for-1 special*.Come early and expect to wait at least 40 minutes, or take up the offer of a free limo shuttle service to Hot n Juicy (original location) where the food is the same, but without the wait and the services of the Hot N Juicy All-Star waitresses.  Again, the limo is presumably for the Grand Opening promotion only.Spicy level is supposedly a little higher than other places, so customize accordingly.  1 pound of crawfish may sound like a lot, but it really is not, as most of the weight is contributed by the lobster-mini-me shells.  If crawfish is not your thing, shrimp, lobster, clams, and various crabs (Dungeness, Blue, Snow and King), and raw oysters can be ordered.You can add the following sides to your above orders:Corn, potato, sausage, Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, bowl of rice, rolls and even extra seasoning sauce.Appetizers include Fried Shrimp, Fried Catfish, Soft Shell Crab, Calamari, Chicken Wings and Etouffee.What I like about this place?  "It is bigger on the inside".  The waitresses remind me of Suicide Girls.  Perfect place to visit to satisfy your spicy food craving. In case there is a wait for the use of the restrooms or you have a tendency to stare at the waitresses, you have portraits of the lovely Hot N Juicy Girls to check out.  Or you can just pretend there is a line for the lavatory.What I don't like or care for:  Shrimp are not de-veined.  The parking here can be a pain, as it can be rather scarce during peak hours.  Not to mention some less than proficient drivers to deal with.Overall, I enjoyed my Hot N Juicy dining experience.  The food was pretty good, but dining here is more of a social activity for me. And if you have a problem with eating with your hands and getting messy, it is best to patronize a different establishment, otherwise enjoy!Ambiance:  4/5  Roomy, with fishing theme decor adorning the walls and pictures of the Hot N Juicy waitresses on the hallway wall leading to the restrooms.Cleanliness:  5/5  It is new, but I hope they keep it looking that way.Food:  4/5  Nothing extraordinary, but it is enjoyable and fun.Price: 3/5  About what you expect.  The main items are all priced at "Market or Seasonal Price", which for shrimp and crawfish are around the $10 mark.Location:  4/5  Definitely close enough to the Strip for the out-of-towners to take a cab here.Pretty solid 4 Yelp stars.*Buy 1 pound of crawfish get the 2nd pound free, all day until it is sold out.I am a hot & juicy fan.. Even before it was on the travel channel and became so widely popular. I have preached the wonders of shrimp and crawfish to all my friends and will even choose H&J over The BoilingCrab. I have had many wonderful dinners at the original location and the servers are always so attentive. So why the low rating for this new location you ask? Its not the food that lacks at this location, it's the service. We tried out this place on a Thursday night around 9:00.. It wasn't too busy so when we arrived the hostess sat us right after she cleared up a booth. After a while a not so enthusiastic nor friendly server took our drink order. Then when she came back we ordered 2 lbs of shrimp + potatoes, rice, rolls and sweet potato fries. Slowly our order started to arrive one by one delivered by a food runner.. Soon we received everything except the sweet potato fries. Over half way through our dinner still no fries.. And no sign of our server.. So we have to flag someone down & ask and we find out that they ran out of SP fries a while a go and our server was supposed to tell us.. Then we are told not to worry it will immediately be taken off our check..At this point our server has yet to once check up on us.. I spot her bottle blonde pig tails numerous times chit chatting with her co workers and horsing around.. Then we have to flag someone down again to place a Togo order but then we're told the kitchen is closed...  Finally our server shows up only to plop acheckbook down on the table.. Peeved, we want to leave so we give her our card., when it comes back we realize they didn't take off the fries after all.. So we go to the front and the girl apologizes and says she needs to swipe the card again but we should be rest assured it will only be charged once because they settle all the transactions at the end of the night. So there goes another 5 minutes of waiting around due to bad service all the while food is still being brought out to tables.. "kitchen closed" my a$$.. ..The next day sure enough the card got charged twice from hot and juicy. Now I'm sorry, I honestly don't mean to be rude and I am a pretty patient person but seriously how hard is it to be a server at a restaurant that only has plastic silverware, paper towels and serves their food from a plastic bag.. ? Had the server just done her job adequately my experience would have been great.Went for a 2lb. lunch yesterday just to 'check in' on the classic. I went in with an open mind, but my suspicions were right:The most inconsistently-sized shrimp and crawfish of it's kind in Vegas. If you order a bag of shrimp here you WILL get some tiny runts, and over half of my shrimp's heads had fallen off by themselves in the bag, a telltale sign of non-freshness. And, this place serves up consistently stingy portions - I'm convinced that they weigh the sauce when they weigh your 1lb. bag of food. The sauce is not as good as I remember, and though I have fond memories of this chain from years past, I feel like Hot N Juicy has become the Pho Kim Long / Lotus Of Siam of seafood-in-a-bag joints. Popular because of public relations, not because the food is great. Hot N Juicy's food is no longer made with love. You get a sense that the bottom line is king here. More profits = more PR budget = more TV exposure = more first-time customers = more profits. Sad. One day Robin Leach will be Hot N Juicy's only customer, and he'll expect to eat for free, because that's how he rolls.So, where to go for cajun seafood-in-a-bag?Cravin' Cajun is SO much more consistent, the crawfish are huge and the shrimp are ALL 10-15 count (and you get 16-20 in a 1lb. bag!). All of your shrimp heads will be intact, and the sauce at Cravin' Cajun is straight-up tastier. Please, if you only have time for one of these joints, try Cravin' Cajun. If you have time for two, try Hot N Juicy so you can make your own judgement. If you can't already tell, I am passionate about this subject.Well one of my friends insisted on coming here. So this place isn't flashy or apart of the strip, it's in I guess the Chinatown section of Vegas.  It was pretty busy for a Friday at 3pm. There was a 30 minute wait so we went next door and all got 30 minute massages lol(awesome). So we come back and get seated at our table.  Waitress was super sweet and attentive Took our order,  put on those garbage bag bibs lol, and gloves.Food came out and man it was hott, like spicy hot.  Which is great but i had a runny nose after the first 2 bites but I didn't mind lol just caught me off guard.All the food was just below great. The cajun fries were way to oily for my liking. The cajun calamari was good, but portion was small, the softshell crab was surprisingly good even thou I am not a fan of crab.Overall I'd enjoyed the experience with cause of my great friends, great service,  good food, and a break from the strip.I think the most fascinating part of this experience was looking around at how everyone sat there with tables packed with food and then nothing was left. So it's definitely an experience I'd recommedyummmmmmmmmm always a hit never a miss.. well so far.. they def are the best ive ever had.. the hollywood spot just isnt the same.. this place..fresh or frozen.. the sauce is just amazing.. i need to remember that i should get the hot instead of medium.. the hot is already super spicy but the medium is not .. they need something inbetween.. the fries were amazing.. so were the oysters.. we were seated right away.. so glad that there's no wait..
Baldwin Street Grille=Big statement coming at ya. You ready for this Madison? Baldwin Street Grille has the best... THE BEST food I've ever eaten at a hole in the wall type townie feeling pub. And I'm not talking about just Madison! Are they going to be Michelin rated? No. But what they're doing works. It's just solid, and for me that gets 5 stars. I ate. And ate. And ATE, so I feel safe saying something so strong having had their hand breaded deep fried mushrooms, Carolina Burger with sweet potato fries, mixed greens salad and hot wings. I don't know why I was so ravenous, but I'm glad Robin knows a thing or two about cooking because everything rocked, and it's amazing that he by himself is able to turn things out so quick. Ryan behind the bar is always up for some convo and will want to know your name. Don't be scurrr'd. Shake the guy's hand and get chatting. Although your "bar burger" is going to be on a real plate, like a ceramic one, these two gents are anything but fancy. The place is super chill, has enough TVs so everyone will be happy watching whatever it is that gets them going, and the equivalent of an ipod looking juke on the wall plays decent tunes on the cheap. I had it in mind to grab a beer and maybe some fries but drank 3 and ate a third of the menu. It's just a cool place to be and I hear their fish fry on Friday is bomb!Another fish fry update, from 9/26/14.This could be one of the best fish frys in Madison proper. Service is consistently slow, absent, and absent-minded, but if it's a quality fish fry you're after, look no further.+ Group of 7 met for fish on Friday, 9/26/14 at around 8:15pm- Not much by way of accommodating groups; the pool table takes up a ton of room- A/C was *insane* - we all wore our coats, begged the bartenders to turn off the A/C, and continued to freeze- Loud. Very, very loud.- Slow service; two bartenders serve as libations-makers, servers, bussers, cashiers, and everything in-between. This makes for many forgotten items and really slow service in between visits.+ Appetizers. Yum. The curds appear to now be homemade, and they were solid. The sweet potato fries are always outstanding, and the tater tots can't be beat. The wide variety of optional dipping sauces compliment everything nicely.+ The cod. Don't make the mistake that I've made in past visits by choosing the perch. Perch is fine and dandy, but the cod here is the star. We visited with my Alaskan fisherman friend (who supplies numerous Madison establishments with line-caught cod, walleye, halibut, and sablefish), and he was floored, as were the rest of us. BSG uses cod loin, which is a thicker, meatier, more tender cut of fish. It's delicate, yet can hold its own while in the fryer. The batter was perfectly applied, nicely flavored, and expertly fried. We all inhaled our fish in record time.So... bring a coat (even in the summer), prepare to be crammed-in to place, don't expect super awesome service (they forgot several of our beers as well as my fish, and I had to stand at the bar for a bit to get things corrected), but prepare to be wowed by the fish fry.Note: all options are fried - no baked fish is available.This place looks pretty unassuming from outside. I went there on a Friday night. Had trouble finding the door, was worried it wasn't even open. Started to be concerned that I invited my friends out for dinner to a place that wasn't open and that I would find them outside, grumpy in the neg. degree weather. But I shouldn't have fretted! Finally found the door and walked into a happening, inviting place.It was Friday, so I had to go with the fish fry. They had both cod and perch available. The perch is sort of a flaky crust on the outside but the cod has a beer battered crust . So if you are looking for a that crunchy layer of goodness surrounding your fish. Go with the cod!! it was delicious. They use the loin which is a nice piece of meat.They have drink specials and specials every night of the week in terms of food. 50 cent wings on Mondays! I'm definitely going to be coming back. Such great food at such a chill place. Definitely a great place to come to if you are a sports fan they have a TV for practically every customer in the place. The service that night was great I thought even though some other reviewers said it was a hit or miss. I thought with it being pretty crowded we were waited on in a timely fashion.
Raul & Theresa's=An off day.The West Valley has had its share of  Mexican restaurants.  However, I get tired off the typical version of Mexican food drowned in sauce,  rice, and heavy beans. Today, I decided to give Raul and Theresa's a try. The dishes at Raul and Theresa's looked really good. That's why I feel bad saying that my meal today just wasn't very good. Today, I had the chorizo, eggs, beans, and tortilla breakfast. The chorizo was somewhat over cooked and just wasn't very flavorful, as were the beans.  I was disappointed with my meal. It wasn't the worst meal nor the best. Maybe it was an off day.
Stingray Sushi=We came here after the ASU football game. Tired and hungry, we were looking for a place to eat but all the restaurants in the Scottsdale Quarter had a waiting line except Stingray. I dropped my family off and parked. Walking around Stingray, I couldn't find the entrance. My son had to do a search and rescue and open the front door for me. The front door looks like a wooden wall. Very deceptive. The inside was very modern looking and spacious. I had a really hard time with the menu cause I couldn't really decide. We always get sushi but nothing else seemed intriguing. So we started off with the rainbow roll and the dragon roll. I would have to say outstanding sushi. Very fresh just like it should be. Really good. For dinner, I just ordered the Vegetable Udon   It had yellow opinions, green onions, carrots, and mushrooms with of course udon noodles in a really dark soup. It was okay but salty. Nothing special about it. My wife, daughter, and mom all ordered the seafood udon. It was basically the same as my vegetable udon except it had seafood and tempura shrimp. Seafood was okay. Not great. So my wife wasn't too impressed. My son had the teriyaki chicken on a bed of vegetables. He liked the chicken and was satisfied. So overall, the food was okay. The sushi was very good. Another issue was their service. Our waitress came right away and brought us our drinks. We told her we weren't ready to order. The problem was trying to get her back. It took forever to track her down again. Poor service. Then after we ordered, the food took forever to get to our table. They had three sushi chefs and would assume our sushi would come out fast but it didn't.  Poor service. So I would have to say that their dinner menu (besides the sushi) is lacking. They should open up the menu and allow the bento boxes to be ordered during dinner. So great sushi, okay dinner, weak dinner menu, and down right poor service. No wonder this place is the only place not as busy in the Scottsdale Quarter in a Saturday night. Will we be back? I can say hands down probably not.
Paradise Valley Burger Company="Oh.My.God" -says I"what?!" -replies friend"What in God's name is a Brulee burger!?!"I quickly grabbed a paper menu off of the clean counter near the cash register and flipped open to the burgers.  I know what brulee means, burnt sugar, but how could this relate to a burger.  In my wildest sugary dreams I could have never dreamt of this.  A burger, delicious and meaty, on a very nice toasty bun, with Havarti cheese, Havarti people(!), bacon, porky crispy salty bacon, a fried egg, runny and delicious, and yes, BURNT SUGAR!"Two please...wait, no no, one, two would be silly.....(but if my friend wasn't here to witness this I would probably get 7)  and sweet potato tots please"What saint, what angel, what GOD could create this masterpiece?  What twisted sugary mind could come up with this concoction?  If ever I meet the mad scientist who put together this beautiful monster I am liable to leave my husband and marry them.  And their shakes looked really good too, I'll get one next time.Family Owned and Operated hole in the wall restaurant that makes Tasty Burgers, Sandwiches, Tacos, and Taco Salads. Inside is clean and tidy with cool pictures of some of his specialties on the wall. Service is Friendly and Fast. They were in Phoenix Magazine back in July 2012 for Cheap Eats for $12 or less.Specialty Burgers include: Country fried burger smothered in gravy topped with crispy onions. The Beach House burger with roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella and pico de gallo. The Burger Brulee with a fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar and havarti cheese. The Burger Parmesana with marinara, mozzarella, parmesan and basil. They also have your basic versions as well as a Grilled Portabella. You can substitute chicken breast on any burger if you like.Sandwiches include: Grilled cheese, Breakfast club, B.L.T, Sloppy joe, Pulled Pork, Chicken club, Pulled vegetarian, and a Shrimp club on a choice of white, 9 grain, or a brioche bun.Today I went with the Paradise Bacon CHZ with an extra patty and a side of seasoned fries. It was very good. The wife had the Chicken Club on 9 grain with a side of sweet potato tater tots which I got to help finish.Definitely going back to try some of the other menu choices like the tacos, some carnival corn grilled on the cob and maybe some DEEP FRIED Ice Cream with honey, strawberry and whipped cream.Keep it Local when you can. ENJOY!Even though I've been eating burgers like it's my job lately, I stopped in Paradise Valley Burger Co. for lunch after a recommendation from a client. I was in their neck of the woods, so I took their word. Well, forget the diet! I'd eat a burger every day if I'd known about this place!A delicious, buttery burger bun, a juicy, seasoned burger with Havarti cheese and lots of ketchup! MMMMMmmmmm. It was so amazing. I also had a side of sweet potato tots, which quickly disappeared into my belly! I've heard ALL of their burgers are amazing, so I'll have to pay them another visit very soon! Also if you are nearby, check out the local scuba shop, Academy of Scuba!I love businesses that don't mind a little hand-to-hand combat.  In the case of Paradise Valley Burger Company, there is a Burger King a stones throw away in the same parking lot, a pizza place a few doors down, and a Jack in the Box across the street.  You better be good if your competition is that close.They are.The Princess and I had to check this place out after it was highlighted on the review of the day last Friday, 3/7/14.  Easy to find, just off the 51 at Bell.  Kind of  a non-descript strip mall.  Nice vibe, lots of foot traffic and yet enough room to grab a table and not be elbow to elbow with your neighbor.We both had the Beach House burger, two patties, smoked mozzella, and pico on an incredible homemade bun.  Loved the burger, very, very good.  You could taste the grill marks on the meat.  Complimented the meal with the sweet potato tots.  These were fantastic!  Some of the best I've had in the valley! (a little pricey but worth it!).  Also had a maple-bacon milkshake.  Wow!  Absolutely incredible.  Real bacon and maple with tasty ice cream, it was delicious!  Can't wait to go back and try other burgers and some of their tacos.  Service was fantastic, very quick and friendly.  Great prices and excellent food!The creativity of this ambitious menu helps PV Burger stand out in the difficult terrain between the fast food and gourmet burger price point. A slight upgrade in their ingredients and this place will quickly outgrow the strip mall in which it resides and move to the upper echelon of the Phoenix burger scene.Ok, that was delicious :) If this was any closer I'd be in serious trouble. Out with Jennifer O. (who hit the 1000 review mark today!) a group of us visited Paradise Valley Burger Co. The burgers are creative, delicious and ridiculously affordable. The Burger Brulee is served with a perfectly cooked over easy egg, bacon (who doesn't love bacon?), onion, burnt sugar and havarti cheese. The sides and shakes are great comfort food. It may sound strange, but, french toast fries are divine. It's actually what you're (perhaps secretly) hoping will be served. Fried egg bread with a side of maple syrup. (I had one! JUST one fry.) The grilled corn on the cob is lightly buttered and a surprising addition to enjoy with a burger.And in other strange (yet satisfying) fare are the shakes. Bacon and maple syrup? Yup. Hot damn that's good. (Made with legit chunks of bacon.)The setup is simple. You order at the register, pay and food is delivered to your table. The space is medium sized, sprinkled largely with 2-top round tables, which can easily be pulled together. A casual place to eat.Alas, no booze. They do have fun stuff like YelloMello and Fanta tho! The menu is kid friendly with options for the little ones.Don't drive too fast or you might pass it by. (If I hadn't been looking for the place I wouldn't have noticed it. It's to the left of a liquor store. A *drive thru* liquor store.) Pricing in PV Burger is slightly higher than their online menu. (My Brulee burger was $8, it is listed as $7 online.)Definitely a place worth checking out!Average of 4.5 stars?  Eh.....I unfortunately disagree.  This is like barely 2 stars.In honor of National Cheeseburger Day, I decided to go and get one.  I had this place bookmarked and it was close enough to work that I decided to have my cheeseburger here.  I should have gone somewhere else :-(.  It wasn't horrible,  but it was far from great.I rolled in the joint and placed my order for a Paradise Valley Cheeseburger with an extra patty, sweet potato tots and a Diet Coke.   After I placed my order, the cashier dude started talking baseball with me (I wear my St. Louis Cardinal hat all the time) and started asking how the Cardinals were doing etc.  That was cool and the best part about the visit.   I paid the man my money, $11.60 something and then took a seat.I noticed that the place was a little bit dirty.  The trash was overflowing, flies were on the windows and a lot of tables were dirty.  I hoped for the best............. A few minutes later, my food came out.  Here is how it was....................Double Cheeseburger-  Um....it was just alright.  It was presented nicely with a toasted bun and some fancy toppings, but it lacked "goodness".  This thing came with 2 small burgers, cheddar cheese, thousand island and then it was topped with veggies.  Not sure if they are trying to be fancy, but the veggies didn't really work.  They had a tomato, pickled onions which were tasteless and 3 cucumbers....not pickles...didnt taste any vinegar.  I tasted cucumber.  The burgers didn't have much flavor, the cheese was ok, the thousand island was runny.  The bun was alright.  I was not impressed.  I ate the whole thing but did not really enjoy it at all.Sweet Potato Tots-  Meh...frozen, not really crispy, no flavor, semi small portion.  I used the ketchup on the table and it was runny too (just like the thousand island).  I only ate a few of them and tossed 75%.  Meh.Diet Coke-  Even this tasted a little off.  Not enough carbonation or something.Overall I was sadly not impressed at all!  $12.00 for my meal, the burger was kind of small and tasteless and the tots were just plain boring.  The only good thing about the meal was my chat about baseball.  That is kind of sad.  I will not be coming back.I seldom dream about burgers but when I do, the Brûlée Burger is definitely one that comes to mind. Combining savory and sweet is often a daunting task because the result ends up with one of the two extremes dominating. It reminds me of those days I lay victim to endless handfuls of kettle corn popped fresh at a stand and the sweet smell paraded through the air like some jerk, "Buy me! Eat me!" The taste was and is still both salty and sweet and satisfying.      Well hello again friend. Except this time, you are disguised as an incredible rich tasting burger. Thank goodness I took pictures of you dear Brûlée Burger because I ate you all too quickly. Fried egg, bacon, onion, burned sugar, and havarti.. Ugh! Your buddies, the sweet potato tots, did their fare share of damage as well, since they too quickly disappeared in my tummy along with the chipotle ketchup!     My hubby ate a special called New Year's Burger, which was crazy spicy but delicious as well. How could you go wrong with a deep fried bun? The caramelized onions, peppers, and cheese were an unlikely but welcome trio with the burger hugged by deep fried goodness.      Don't expect a fancy pants trendy burger joint here. The food speaks for itself and will leave you smiling and very happy!What to add when Yelpers have already faithfully posted 500 reviews? I scanned through the mass of comments about Paradise Valley Burger Company and I have a half dozen observations to share. First, the counter staff is amazingly helpful and friendly, ready to explain their offerings at the slightest hint of uncertainty. You should have no fear about coming here for the first time. Second, the burgers are just the right size. Two beef patties, but not a massive weight gainer. Not a walk away hungry burger either. Just right. Third, all those reviewers who rave about the Brulee burger, the burgers of the week, the French toast fries, the sweet potato tots... Everything they say is true. Fourth, the pricing is not what you'd call cheap, but it's very reasonable, with a basic PV Burger coming in at $5.25 and more elaborate choices listed at $7 or $8. No sides are included, but I'd rather order just what I want and share anyway. Fifth, it is a small neighborhood restaurant that just happens to be  a foodie paradise. You would never find it without Yelp's help. The dining room is small, although not quite as tiny as the storefront would indicate. Simple, clean and comfy. Perfect.Sixth, kids are welcome. Space is sometimes in short supply, but there is still plenty of room for the kids. A $5 kids menu features, among other things, small versions of basic burgers (one patty instead of two) complete with a side of fries. Oddly, the menu says these meals are only for kids age seven and under?!? I assume they don't enforce that age limit.My suggestion would be that you drop your anti-DDD bias and reward yourself by giving the Paradise Valley Burger Company a try.I saw this place on the Food Network and since my wife and I were nearby, heck yeah we were going to stop in. This place is no frills, simple menu. Burgers and a handful of other options. They are known for the Brulee Burger. The concept is interesting. The place was filthy though. Staff was nice and patient. Burgers were overhyped but a fun stop. Less than desirable area.
Pizza Factory=This is a difficult review to write.  My family started eating here when they first opened. We were a once a week customer. Very happy with the food and service, pizza is delicious. Then one evening, we placed our order asking for the special we always get, a 2 pizza deal.When we received our order, they placed 2 medium pizzas on our table. I immediately asked about the pizza size as we had always received 2 large pizzas as advertised.  It turns out they have 2 specials, a 2 medium pizza deal and a 2 large pizza deal.The employee never asked which deal and the fact that we were there with 5 people should have prompted them to ask me to specify which deal.I spoke to the owner of this location he agreed to make us another medium pizza to make up the size difference to which I agreed to.Nearly 10 minutes later, the owner came to our table and told us that if he made us another pizza, he was going to have to charge us for it.I refused and now nearly 2 years later, we have chosen not to return to this establishment. My money is important to me and it should be as important to any business, especially a small local business...I now choose a place slightly further away, but one that appreciates its customers.Pizza - deliciousCustomer appreciation - needs improvementHope some changes have been made over the last couple of yearsSadly, I have to give a 2-star review to 5-star tasting pizza because the owner is rude and has no customer service skills at all! I am so angry that a place that serves such delicious pizza is run by a man with a nasty attitude that does not know how to appreciate his customers. A word to the wise for the owner: Have your wife or son take care of the front of house and please stay in the back, away from customers. You are going to end up out of business and it will be your own fault. The pizza is hands down the best pizza I have ever eaten but I would rather gag down some frozen pizza than to be treated like garbage by someone who is making money off of me. Without us (your customers) you do not have a business! Remember that and adjust your attitude accordingly or you will be out of business and flipping burgers in short order!
Tsom Vegetarian Flavors=I have to be honest; Tsom really reminded me of college cafeteria food. Based on that assessment, it seems they are in a good location being close to ASU, but as a non-college student, I was incredibly underwhelmed. While I think the idea of a salad bar is cool, especially when it is all veggie and filled with a variety of things like hummus and bean salads, the actual meals like pasta and falaffel are pretty uneventful.Sorry Tsom, I don't plan on coming back.I came in here on a Saturday around 2 pm and there was absolutely no one in the place.  I checked out the menu for a solid TEN MINUTES before a woman came out from the back.  She didn't say anything, just went to her register and stared at me.  Way to make a girl feel welcome.I ordered food to go-a veggie wrap and some spicy falafel sandwich with kale chips.  She retreats to the back of the store and I fought the temptation to eat all of the cupcakes in the platter on the counter to show my dissatisfaction.  But then I remembered that I am a "grown-up", so I decided to walk away.Twenty minutes later she hands me my food, no thank you or anything, but whatevs.  She tells me I can help myself to pickles and such on the bar.  When I open the falafel sandwich it is clear that it is the wrong thing.  When I ask her she just lies and says it is what I ordered.  I was too hungry and annoyed to argue so I said fine.  I walked over to the other food station because there was NO HUMMUS ON THE SANDWICH.  She said, oh we charge extra for hummus.  Lady, no one charges extra for hummus on a falafel.  My people didn't wander through the desert, schvitzing and kvetching so that they could pay extra for hummus.  Hummus and Falafel are like french fries and ketchup, like oreos and milk...they just go together.With all that said, if you are hungry enough that you don't care and you have your own personal supply of hummus, go there between 11-2 for their lunch special.  You get fries, a drink and a falafel sandwich for 7 $.  Just don't expect any hummus... :)
Taj Palace=Update: Still no Butter Chicken in the lunch buffet :/However, I did find a new item that I enjoyed quite a bit - Methi Chicken. The sign says the dish contains spinach. If that's true, then it's not Methi Chicken. Maybe they just figure it's easier to write "spinach" than to explain what "methi" is. In any case, it was good.I've also discovered Kheer. It's an Indian rice pudding finished with nuts, raisins, and cardamom. For some reason, I've never had this dessert before, but it is absolutely delicious.Despite Butter Chicken still being MIA, I think a star upgrade is in order.As badly as I want to try new Indian restaurants in town, I always end up leaving utterly disappointed and regretting my decision for not just going to Mint (my never-fails-me staple).  Taj Palace was no exception.Things had started off well with a nice interior and friendly service.  But then everything started to go downhill from there with a total blowup to end our meal.-Food took much too long to come out.-Free papadums were nice, but the tamarind and mint chutneys tasted old.-The garlic naan had no traceable amounts of garlic, plus it was super crunchy and almost burnt.-$5 for a bowl of plain rice.-The aloo gobi (or gobi aloo as they call it) was completely flavorless (at an Indian restaurant??).  It was just boiled potatoes, cauliflower, and tomatoes sitting in some liquid.  Not edible.I will give credit where credit is due and say that the Paneer Tiki Masala was very good.  It was flavorful and had a generous portion of paneer.The kicker was at the end when we went to pay for our meal and we were told they wouldn't accept our coupon.  It would have been one thing if there was a sign posted on the door stating this or if we hadn't shown the servers the coupon until the end of our meal.  However, there is no sign saying they don't accept coupons AND we had the coupon out at the edge of the table from the minute we sat down.  FOUR servers never once said anything about it before we ordered, despite the fact that I saw all of them look at it.I'm tired of restaurants offering coupons and then deciding they don't feel like it anymore and won't make good on the ones that are still out there.  But to wait until after we are done eating to tell us, when you know that we have a coupon waiting, is shady to me.  It's times like these I wish my mom didn't raise me to be polite and just walk away from the situation.  The paneer was their saving grace that brought them up to two stars.I'd like to amend my review a little now that I've been back so many timesI've tried the lunch buffet twice in two days. I'm officially hooked!The service is pretty attentive. Vimil (Vick) is very friendly. He makes an extra effort to remember his customers and takes pride in his job. He's remembered my name ever since I paid with a credit card. Him and other staff always keep my water glass quite full, a definite necessity in an Indian restaurant. We got there by about 2pm and the lunch buffet closes at 3pm. At exactly 3:06pm the server came over and informed us that they were closed and it was time for us to go. I thought this was a little abrupt, but we were mostly finished, so we left.I really like the varied options depending on the day. The Samosa's were really good, filled with spicy potato. These were a little spicy, but very tasty. I poured a little bit of mint chutney over the top and it was perfect. I actually wished they would have had them the second day. I also really liked the Chicken Tikka Masala, because I love the red sauce that it comes in, perfect for dipping Naan. There was also a white cream based chicken dish that was really tender. On my first visit I didn't have room to try the Tandoori chicken on the bone. But on my 2nd visit there was Tandoori chicken pieces and they were pretty tender. I like my stuff super saucy, so I dipped my Tandoori chicken in the Raita (spiced yogurt) and it was delicious. Garlic naan is the way to go. I love me some garlic!! The naan has came out piping hot... super fresh on every visit. Also on my first trip I brought my vegan friend and she had a lot of options to choose from and was very happy with the selections. I would definitely recommend telling the server if you are vegan because one of the labels above the food was inaccurate. For my second visit I brought two Indian food experts, they both agreed that it was a pretty good buffet, especially for the price. They seemed to enjoy the food, but one of them felt that the dishes could have used a little more spices. Both of them agreed they would rather have the dishes spicier, but realize that with a buffet it's usually going to be mild to medium.  I would definitely like to come back during dinner and try some of the menu items. Although I think I'll have a hard time staying away from this buffet. I love having tons of options and you can't beat the price... about $11 per person.HENDERTUCKY'S INDIAN RESTAURANTNot a food cart or truck behind a grocery store or a converted gasoline station, it's a real dedicated Indian restaurant with real Indian decor. I understand it been under new ownership for two years plus. It's our first visit under the present ownership.We came for the lunch buffet around 2 pm this Friday. There were still a few occupied tables and the buffet carts were filled with food. Of course I ordered their garlic naan plus a Kashmiri naan. (it was most disappointing).Yu-go chauffeur always eats the veggies first and saves the meats for the second plate. He loved the spiciness of the veggies but he thought the meats were a little underseasoned... but not  a problem, he dunks everything in their green, white and red sauces anyway.It's a charming place to relax and enjoy which we certainly can attest to.After a hike yesterday, we stopped here for their lunch buffet.  It was almost empty when we arrived but we must have been a draw because business picked up while we were there.They brought us ice water and we ordered garlic naan.  In fact, we ordered a second basket of garlic naan before we even started with the first.  It was quite good.The first part of the buffet had all vegetarian dishes.  Some of the standouts here were the  pakoras, large triangles filled with a spicy mix of vegetables, and the saag.  The saag had excellent flavorings and was very tasty.  I also tried some of the lentils and they were also good.In the second section, I had some goat curry, chicken tikka masala, and tandoori chicken.  The chicken tikka masala was standard as was the goat curry.  The tandoori chicken was a bit dry.A couple of things I noted that were different.  There is no silverware on the table.  You pick up utensils at the buffet when you're there or you go back and get if you forget.  I was expecting some kind of MTV India music playing or video,  but they had their TV off which was quite OK.  But instead, we had pop music which just didn't seem to fit the place.The room is pleasant, service was OK, and the lunch buffet was good.  There are a few standout items as mentioned.  I didn't have dessert, not even kheer, which almost unheard of for me.  The naan filled me up quite nicely along with two plates of food.My first time trying Indian food! What a great place to try something for the first time!When walking into an Indian restaurant for the first time, the smell of the spices and herbs they use hits you pretty hard. It was very surprising. It grows on you though.With my lack of knowledge with Indian food, I just let Nieves D. & Carl I. Take the wheel and order the food.For starters they bring out their version of Chips & salsa. it's a very thin seasoned chip that you can break.. and for the dips it includes a green spicy dip and a sweet tangy dip. Both quite Delish. Tikka Masala Saucy chicken- I can't even explain how delicious this was. The sauce had the right amount of spices to give a good kick. The chicken in it just melted in my mouth it was so good. Was not dry at all. Tandoori sizzling chicken- we got a whole chicken and it was more than enough for us. The most moist chicken I ever had! Again, the spices used give the chicken so much flavor. Spices that I have never tasted before. Chicken was cooked above perfection. Lamb spicy coconut curry- I'm not really a fan of lamb so I just took a bite and decided to stick with the chicken. But the sauce the lamb was swimming in was pretty damn good. If it had a different meat in it, I'd probably devour it. Garlic Naan- Their version of garlic bread. You can dip the bread in the sauces of the dishes you order and it pairs up quite well. You get this mango shake when you check in. The service was good, the food just took forever to com out. But it was defiantly worth the wait! They even brought out mango ice cream with a candle for my birthday! What a great birthday dinner!Great little Indian joint tucked away in one of the many plaza and business centers on Eastern. This one in particular you can find in the same plaza at BJs!I met up with some friends here for lunch on the weekend to take advantage of their AYCE buffet. We got there around 1pm on a Saturday and there was ample seating despite the restaurant itself being pretty tiny. But hey, not complaining! (I hate waiting, but who doesn't?)Anyway, it's good to note that the buffet is only available for lunch and dinner menu becomes ala carte style so if you want to indulge in the buffet like me, come during lunch hours which I believe are until 3pm. Onto the juicy stuff, the food! It's not a huge selection but it was pretty tasty. The first section by the plates are the vegetarian entrees and that includes samosas! I love samosas and these were great. I had to force myself not to grab more than one each time I went back for another round. I also enjoyed the coconut curry chicken and the tikka masala. I was a little bummed not to see any lamb dishes or butter chicken but you can't win them all. You also get naan for the table and we opted for garlic naan. Came out fresh and hot!And one of the most surprising parts of the meal was the check! The lunch buffet costs a whopping $11. I don't know about you, but that's a steal for me.Lots of parking throughout the plaza is available as well so nothing much else to report on that front.This is a good, decent, clean, strip mall Indian restaurant buffet experience.Recognizable foods on the buffet include sag paneer (high quality!), tandoori chicken, curries and chickens and such. Achaar (mixed pickle) is decent and passable. Beer is available (probably wine too). The place has a modest decor, very generic but good tables and linens. Although I  would like to complain about the size of the buffet, it is no smaller than most other Indian restaurants in Las Vegas.Always seems to be 4 or more people on staff at any given time, usually 5. That's a good sign: quality focus, managerial oversight, customer attention.This restaurant is off Eastern, in Hendo-tucky. There are fewer more heavily-trafficked thoroughfares than this stretch of Eastern, but this restaurant earns its 4 stars.This restaurant is not West-End London , or Silicon Valley California competitive, but for Las Vegas it's pretty good and they should be proud of their business. They have a right to be proud.Taj Palace was delicious. I haven't had Indian food in years, so maybe I'm biased. And hunger and good company can further sway me. I will also state right now that I'm not well versed with Indian cuisine, so I'll do my best to describe the food. Apologies in advance for the ignorance that will ensue. We came here for dinner and were starving after a long day, so we opted for the non-vegetarian meal for 2 ($50). It was definitely not a meal for 2. It was more like a meal for 5, despite both of us having very healthy appetites. We had leftovers for days.  While you try to figure out what to order, you get to munch on (I have no idea what it's called) crunchy "chips" with 2 different types of sauces. One of the sauces was really good. One was red/brown, the other green. Go for the red/brown.So the meal for 2: (There's so much it'll be a novel). appetizer - you get to choose between samosas or pakoras. We both have had samosas before so we decided to try something new. The pakoras are like little crunchy chicken nuggets shaped liked mini egg rolls on a bed of lettuce. Yea, I know that's an awful description, but it's really the best I can do. So now that I know what pakoras are, in the future, if I was given the option between that or a samosa, it'd really depend on my mood. If i wanted little snacks that you can haphazardly pop into your mouth, then I'd go with the pakoras. But if I wanted something more filling and like the size of an empanada or large cha siu bao, I'd go with the samosa.  soup/salad - we went with salad. The salad was nothing out of the ordinary, but it was very refreshing next to the fried appetizer. It was also well seasoned. entree - you get to choose ONE entree from the chicken or lamb section. This was confusing to us because we thought each person got to choose an entree. Nonetheless, we went with the mango chicken curry, which was spectacular. The only reason why I wouldn't get it again would be because I'd want to try other dishes. The flavors were so good, the chicken in large chunks, etc. I loved it. Another entree that comes with (you don't get to decide) is tandoori chicken. This is a classic dish that comes off as like bbq chicken seasoned with unique spices served on a skillet with grilled onions. There was so much food in front of us, I actually didn't try this one. I was still adjusting to the array of flavors before me. rice - the rice was so good. I wasn't expecting that. It had chicken, vegetables, and all sorts of spices. I don't think I've ever had Indian rice before. I loved it. garlic naan - The naan was not bad. This is probably the only thing I had that night that I've had before at other places. So because I have comparison, I can say this isn't the best naan I've ever had, but it was still good. I've had other naans that are more flavorful and garlicky (I'm pretty sure that's not a word). Those other naans are so good they can be a stand alone snack. The naan here was much more muted. But maybe that's just as well because if it were too strong, it might overpower the other dishes. dal of the day - Honestly, neither one of us knew what this was. We just nodded as if we knew when the waiter was talking to us. It was served in a bowl, and it went well with the naan is all I can say. It was a bit spicy. Edit: I just looked it up. Apparently dal is a dish of dried lentils, peas, or beans split and boiled. Its rich in protein and is a good source of nutrition for vegetarians. Learn something new every day. There was also a yogurt-like dipping sauce served, which was refreshing and cooling for the spicy flavors. It was a nice palette cleanser. dessert - I didn't choose it, so I have no clue what it was called. We each got a little goblet with what appeared to be 2 soggy donuts swimming in a pool of sweet liquid with coconut flakes. It was too much for me. I don't think I'd want this dessert again, but for those who like really sweet, they may like it. To give context, I find baklava too sweet but I know many people who like it. The decor of the place is very nice. I'm not sure if it was decorated more than usual though because it was Valentine's day; there was a lot of red in the restaurant. But like many eastern restaurants whose target population is often of western origin, there may be more trinkets and ornaments than what is normally found at such establishments. Yet it's pleasing to the eye and adds to the ambiance of the place. Plus, with a name like "Taj Palace," I'd expect something of the grandiose nature. So I'm not complaining, I liked it. The staff were also very friendly. Overall, I would come here again. Taj Palace has made me want to explore the world of Indian cuisine. With more knowledge, I won't have to name dishes "soggy donuts" and what not.I've only dined here for the lunch buffet a few times. It's a pretty good deal to sample several Indian dishes for $10.95. You get a choice of fresh, warm, traditional naan or garlic naan with the lunch buffet. A lot of the buffet items are vegetarian, some vegan, several types of curry - (vegetarian, chicken, goat), basmati rice, salad bar, and a few desserts.I usually stick to the dishes I'm familiar with - tandoori chicken, tikka masala, saag, basmati rice, samosa, etc. but I'm always willing to try new dishes. I tried some potato & cabbage side, rice with almonds and raisins, vegetable curry, chicken curry in a tomato based sauce, etc. This is probably my least descriptive Yelp review. Forgive me. I'm not too familiar with Indian food. I wanted to take pics of the descriptions at the buffet station but I didn't want to be that dorky Yelper who takes pics. Even though I didn't know some of the dishes I was eating, I enjoyed my buffet. I think some of the curries could have been spicier but they were still fine and tasty. The restaurant is well decorated & charming with the traditional Indian decor & vibrant colors. The service was very attentive & welcoming. I think 4 or 5 different servers helped me. One guy suggested I use two different sauces for my samosa when he saw that I just grabbed it without a sauce. It was a minty sauce and a tamarind glazed sauce?I was full off 2.5 plates, garlic naan, and kheer for dessert. I'll be back and hopefully I'll remember the names of the dishes I've had. If you happen to know what I had from my weak descriptions & food pics, please educate me. ;)
Rice Paper=I never would have thought a Vietnamese restaurant would put me in the holiday mood, but it did! I will get to my reasoning, but first let me say why I'm giving Rice Paper five stars. It's because they have an adorable restaurant with a perfect atmosphere, they have delicious food and they have friendly staff. Rice Paper is situated on a busy Phoenix road but once inside the adorable little historic house, it feels like you've been transformed into a home away from home. They restored a historic house and adapted it into a restaurant that can accommodate those looking for a meal or those looking for some cocktails alike. The atmosphere is very modern zen-like with each table places perfectly apart from each other, quaint light fixtures warming up the restaurant and a long bar with seating and plenty of drinks to choose from.Most importantly is the food. The food here is delicious. It's the perfect combination of filling yet light. We started with the spring rolls and here I must warn you that if you order one that has "spice" mentioned at all in the description, be warned that they do not go light on the Sriracha. The spring roll was delicious but so spicy, my mouth burned for a good 20 minutes following. I think I also made the mistake of drinking diet coke in attempt to ease the burning but it really only made it worse. The burn from Sriracha seems to only disappear if you power through it. Rice Paper is know for their Pho so it's a must to order it! I went with the chicken Pho and this is where I entered into the holiday spirit. The Pho is warm and filled with wintry spices that remind me of Christmas with each warm sip. If I closed my eyes I could have imagined looking outside to see a crisp snow-filled day (instead of busy 7th street on a 70 degree day). I actually ordered the vegetarian Pho and added chicken in order to get all the vegetables. It was the perfect meal. It was filling but felt light and didn't put me into an afternoon food coma. I can see Rice Paper being the perfect spot for a date night or lunchtime meeting. It's great to stop by for an appetizer and cocktails before heading out for the night, or making this your main stop for the night and staying for a meal.I'm going to try to sound as professional and as objective as possible.+ Luke Warm Broth: "Ohhhh hell naw!"+ Brown Sprouts and Wrinkly Basil Leaves: "You're kidding, right?!"+ Stale Rice Noodles: "Can my lunch get any worse?"+ Dried up Lime that had no more Juice: "Definitely ohh hell naw!!!"+ Wait time for the Pho: "Beyond ridiculous."Hi Owner, I hope you are reading this.  Pho at any V-nese is absolutely the numero uno dish that must have no flaws if you want a repeat customer as myself.  I'm sorry, but the dried up lime was just blatant! There's no excuse for not having fresh limes on hand! I've had my share of cutting up limes and I know how much juice I can extract.The standard for broth temperature should always be hotter than the sun! I should be able to finish my pho with some hot soup remaining.  Brown sprouts and wrinkly basil leaves?! Inexcusable.Considering the place was below half full, the time for Pho to come out should be fairly quick, not 30 minutes that felt like an eternity.Its a big time shame.  Your awesome decor can never make up for the quality of food I had last time here.  Its by far the most modern, trendiest V-nese joint I've stepped foot it in.  I respect your Crate and Barrel-like furnishings and high-end bar with TVs, but at the end of the day, it comes down to the food that I expected to shine if we are going to pay a leg and arm for.  $10 Pho? Enough said.I've never been a huge Vietnamese fan, but Rice Paper has shown me the light! This little joint is run by two sassy sisters who are a hoot to be around and make delicious food. The spring rolls here are amazing - I think its the best thing on their menu - and they are so cheap that you can order several of them, tapas style!  They are always made with fresh ingredients and are packed with flavor.I also love the vegetarian pho.  It may seem expensive but it is HUGE and comes with a number of ingredients - tofu, lime, mint, jalapenos, sprouts, onions.  Whenever I am in a soup mood I turn to that pho.If only they would have put the same amount of time and energy into training the servers, and working on the food itself, as they did on the styling of the restaurant, this place could have been great.  Value is way out of line. $4.50 for ONE below average spring roll. We tried three types and all had only one sliver of the ingredients listed.We were given only  one menu when we were seated, WTF?  Another table near by saw that we had not been helped after about 5-10 minutes and notified the manager who was working the bar, and he didn't do much at just send some kid over to us.Was not given a drink menu until I asked for one AFTER we ordered food. WTF?Summary: Super trendy/hip/stylish place with a least double overpriced food, inexperienced  wait staff, and  management who doesn't have a clue about customer service.It's rare that I have a date with my husband on a Monday afternoon/evening, but this past Memorial Day, we did just that.  After a quick visit to the Science Center (the Van Gogh alive exhibit is a must-see by the way), we were hungry so we headed over to Rice Paper.  Neither of us had ever been before, and we were pleased with our experience.It was a tad bit too hot to sit outside, although they do have a covered patio with misters.  We walked in and were seated and greeted promptly by Al, our server.  He's quite the character.  He made us laugh quite a bit in addition to being attentive and making some recommendations.  We enjoyed the stylish renovated house / hip colorful atmosphere as well.We ended up ordering a few things and sharing.  Highlights included the firecracker shrimp. a spider roll, a shrimp roll, and a zen salad.  Everything was light and tasted fresh.  We really enjoyed the dipping sauces that came with the spring rolls.  They've got such a huge selection of the spring rolls, that I can't wait to return to try some of the others.  They don't have a huge selection of Vietnamese entrees, but it appears that they will custom create a bit upon request.I highly recommend going for the "food happy hour."  It's from 3pm - 6:30pm and includes $6 appetizers & $1 off all spring rolls.  Such a deal!  We didn't take advantage of it, but the "drinks happy hour" is actually 11am - 6:30pm and specialty drinks are $6, house wine by the glass is $5, well drinks are $4, and draft beer is just $2.75.If only Rice Paper was a tad bit closer to home, I could see myself being a regular... Instead, I'll keep it high on my list of spots to return to when I find myself heading downtown!Where are the owners? When was the last time you have been in your restaurant? You are failing big time and here's why...This is the 5th time I have reluctantly been to your establishment due to my love of pho however it will be my last. First off when you arrive to the parking lot there is trash and broken down heaters piled up for all to see. This is your first impression to rice paper...trash. You walk in and there is a leaking ac unit in the entrance where water is standing which speaks to another issue I will mention shortly. You walk in and your not greeted you are ignored by an obviously  untrained wait staff who appear to have better shit to deal with then customers who pay their salaries. We sat at the bar while the bartender talked endlessly to her friends and texted. Looking around the dining room you see junk everywhere. You have things on shelves that have no purpose nor appear to have been used or cleaned in years. The place is just dirty. You have wait staff bussing to the bar right were we are sitting. Putting dirty dishes next to where I'm eating is gross and unprofessional. Also get rid of the televisions if your not going to have something worth looking at on. It would be cute if you had romantic movies playing or something of that regard. Infomercials or sports is not the way to go if you considering your self fine dining. Further if you are going to be this run down and not care then lower your prices so that we are paying for what we're getting. I have experienced bugs at your location twice. A small roach walked out on the counter once while I was eating. Absolutely disgusting. This place needs an overhaul. If your the owner I challenge you to eat at your restaurant and consider this feedback. Clean it up and start caring about the customer experience. There is no sense of urgency to the customer experiance. I asked for my pho to be hot, super hot as it is always Luke warm. Sure enough it came out Luke warm which makes me think that you guys just have soup stock sitting to which you add ingredients into. Take the message not the tone. Clean it up. Train your staff.
Zipps Sports Grill=Is this place actually supposed to be . .  . you know. . . . a business?We showed up at about 7 on a Tuesday, putting us in the no-mans land between happy hours. That part didn't matter much to me, but as we seated ourselves I wondered if we might be catching them in a dead spot. Maybe that explains the rest of the review. I'm not anxious to try again. At any time.We chose to sit in the bar area where more of the tables were full than in the restaurant area. We were just there for a couple drinks and some apps.  The waitress shows up and my friend asks what they have on tap. The waitress recites a voluminous list from memory, blandly. However, neither of us could hear her well enough over the Brian Adams or some other droning shit they had playing too loudly in the background. My friend asks to see a printed beer list. The waitress--a bit perplexed--explains that they don't have printed beer lists. My friend settles for water and starts searching "Zipps Phoenix Beers" on her iPhone. On the other hand,  I--determined to get my drink on--order up a vodka tonic and throw in an order of some wings.We wait.I get my drink. The tonic water is flat as a stretch of Nebraska Interstate. Waitress comes back around. I tell her that it's not working for me and since I suspect that their tonic has gone flat, I order a vodka Diet Coke instead. She apologizes and takes the drink away. A few minutes later she's back with the Diet Coke and vodka. Which is also flat. And apparently made with "vodka" made from straining Sterno through gym socks. Waitress is now off in the distance carting around dishes. I try to wave her down. No response. I take it to the bar. Bartender not paying attention. I look back to our table. The waitress is back, but empty-handed. My friend is now searching various blog entries from 2007 looking for hints of which beers they offer besides . . . y'know . . . fuckin' Bud Light, which might be all they usually sell.I decide to have a beer instead, taking the time to walk back to the bar to look at the taps. I order an IPA.  My friend says "oh, that sounds  . . . ok . . . ". Ok then: Two. Make it two IPA's. The waitress slowly walks off, carting with her the last abortive attempt at a cocktail and our inspired beer order.We wait. I look over at the kitchen and was reminded of an order for some wings placed way back . . . oh. . . .a couple of screwed-up drink orders before. Seems like sometime back during the days of Weimar Republic by this point.  I notice that although the bar area is well-occupied, the restaurant area is basically empty. I don't see any orders up on the kitchen window. Servers and the cooks are standing around talking. I look at my friend across the table. We look at the bar, and back at the kitchen. No beers. No wings. The taste of two lousy drinks still on my tongue. A gradually-accumulating wave of bitter resentment rising within me.We got up and left. The Garage was right across the street and was everything that Zipps wasn't this night.In a word: A business.
Café Allegro=After spending two hours looking at (and listening to) some wonderful instruments, Violeta and I decided to meet up at the cafe.The place was hoppin'!  It was 1pm, and there were actually two sections in this room.  While they had the same furniture, one area felt like a coffee shop, with the rounded counter adorned with cookies and deli cases filled with bottles of water and juices, and I don't know what else, since we decided to sit in the other section, which had a more "open" feel to it.  Large glass windows that allowed nature to envelope you, at least a little bit, and, I would have to say, it felt like a bustling bistro.  A bustling tree-hugging green bistro (and I type this in a loving, respectful way).  Wished there was more than just one busser, though.  If there were more, it certainly looked like there was only the one.  Waited for awhile for tables to be cleared.  Finally, I had to walk up to him to ask if he'd clean up ours.  If I hadn't felt rushed to sit and relax while waiting for the food to arrive before leaving for school, I wouldn't have minded the wait so much.  I liked the organic, high-end feel to the place, and the busyness of the line cooks, who looked more like they should be cooking at a fancy steakhouse, and the presentations of the menus and food make you feel like you're really paying for quality here.  The menus allude to the usage of local produce and the occasional organic item, but I'd like to see higher-quality oils being used-- say no to GM soybean, canola, cottonseed, and corn oils!  I enjoyed my 6 oz. grass-fed burger and perfectly-crisped and seasoned sweet potato fries.  Next time, I'm going to have to check out the desserts.  Some looked absolutely devilish!p.s.  Didn't like having to retrieve my own cutlery or napkins.  The atmosphere calls for cutlery enfolded in cloth, and on the table, not sitting in metal holders, like you're at a buffet or at the cafeteria at work.  The paper napkins were of high-quality super-absorbent material, though, I must say.Ever since MIM opened in 2010, I come to their cafeteria for lunch a few times a year. I am always pleased with lunch I get from here.  Limited menu. Local, Global or some sandwiches.  I always get "local". Menu changes not sure how often and I won't know what is served until I get there.Local menu is made from ingredients they source within 150 miles of MIM. All fresh and some organic. I like the food when I can actually taste the ingredients.Today's local dish was chicken salad.  Chicken was so juicy and tender, chicken and blue cheese was a perfect combination, Brussels Sprouts was cooked to perfection, salad was fresh, beets tasted like beets should taste.  I also had a side of tomato soup today.  Again, I really like the food when I can actually taste the ingredients and the soup was no exception.  While the salad looks small on the picture, they are actually large.  Some beans on the salad, I became full before I finished a half of the salad.It's cafeteria style but serves very fresh food.  Cost more than average cafeteria.  You have to carry your own tray to the table.  Staff here is always friendly and efficient.  Did I mention I really like the food when I can actually taste the ingredients?
Texas BBQ House=I was on a quest...BBQ and smoked goodness that could meet or beat the standard set by my favorite BBQ place, Rudy's, which is a Texas based chain with locations in Albuquerque. I rarely give 5 stars on first visit and this was pretty darn close...by PHX standards this is easily 5 stars!Fate delivered an article in a local food Blog, It was touted as being like Rudy's as a result I took that as a challenge. Via Yelp I bookmarked it to try.  The locations is clean and casual. Just enough booths and tables and a small outside patio. The employees and the owner/manager were very friendly and helpful. He gave me a sample of their brisket. While not as smoked as I like was super tender and delicious. I decided on their Yelp Check In special (which is also a regular daily special) of 1/3# Brisket, side, bread and drink for $7.99. Here you buy the items a la carte and the meat by the pound. Like Rudy's there are no plates as they serve and you eat on Butcher paper. For my side I choose Creamed Corn...he gave me a sample first and dare I say this was better than Rudy's.  What I love that other places lack is the little bar with sliced onions, dill pickle slices and pickled whole jalapeños. The bread offered is your simple sliced loaf bread, his is traditional and typical of Texas style BBQ joints. You put a little meat onions, pickle and sauce o keep a slice of bread fold in half/eat taco style and enjoy.The sauce is a hint sweeter than I like, but the smoked flavor was what I enjoyed most. I didn't see smoked baked potatoes on the menu, nor did I see the cobblers that Rudy's carries but that may come later. They do have have pecan pie, banana pudding to satisfy your sweet tooth. I already am planning my next trip so I can try more items on the menu.  They also have a nice small selection of bottled beer. What's BBQ without beer or fresh brewed sweet tea which they have as well.I was too full to dig into my homemade banana pudding. Rudy's...you've found your match and I have found my go to BBQ in the valley.[It's CASH ONLY. They do have an ATM on site.]Sweet baby Jesus. All of my prayers have been answered. I left the Great State of Texas three years ago and have been disappointed by so many bbq restaurants throughout the state of Arizona. I was saddened by the "best bbq" in Tucson and decided that, until I lived in Texas again, I would just live a meaningless bbq free existence. As I moped through another day in the hottest place on the planet, my very thoughtful partner suggested that we try the best bbq in Phoenix, according to the Phoenix New Times. I resisted. I said I was tired, I made up lame excuses, I feigned heat sickness. When I had no more excuses I finally relented and joined him in what would be the most delicious dinner I have had in three f*in years. Highlights of the meal:Brisket- Tender, delicious, excellent rub and crustRibs- Fall of the bone meat with great flavorSauce- Just enough tang and sweet. Balanced like a god damned ballerinaColeslaw- Sweet, sour, crunchy, yummyPotato salad-  Oh how I love theeI will be back again. I will blog about them. I will tell my friends. You will not be disappointed. If you don't believe me, go anyway. They offer free samples. If you don't cream your jeans, you can just walk out the door.Granted it was my first visit but I don't get down that way often, but i was underwhelmed. The building looked good from outside but it sort of went down hill after that. The deli style, by the lb, served in cartons, butcher paper, cash only, one sauce thing was overload...negativly. I ordered the "cutters choice" brisket, side and drink for 7.99.  I was given a 3.5 cuts of dry brisket on was paper, a small side of beans in a styo cup with a lid, a plate which is another section of wax paper all folded, two slices of WALMART white bread, on wax paper served in a huge 2 liter pepsi container used to carry 10 or more bottle at a time with more wax paper under it all. The drink was a styro cup, with an individually wrapped straw, individually wrapped fork, knife and spoon and more styro cups or paper trays for the pickles, onions and peppers. The entire thing was a freakin mess. I had more trash to throw away the a family of four in a normal place. Yet they only take cash because they want to keep costs down...WHAT?The brisket was ok, the sauce was ok (one type yet there are buckets under the cooler of beer that say HOT SAUCE on them?) The beans were ok. Really nothing to bring me back which sucks because they are better then my review and I know it.Unlike most of the folks who wrote real reviews down below, I'm not from TX and I've never tried TX BBQ.  I can't compare it to any place in Austin, Dallas or Lubbock.  But I have taste buds.  And they liked it.  They liked it a lot.  I love BBQ.  Sure, there's better and worse BBQ around town based on where ya go, but generally speaking if I go to a BBQ place, I'm going to enjoy myself.  But that doesn't mean I'm going to recommend the place, or come back again, and it really doesn't mean that I'm going to write a review on it.  But as I sit here wondering how I ate that whole freaking sandwich, I know that I have just had one of the best BBQ nights in a long, long time.  And once my stomach isn't full (say, tomorrow afternoon?) I'll be calling friends to plan our next trip there.  OM-frickin-G it is awesome!  As has been mentioned in other reviews they hooked us up with some samples when we said we hadn't been there before.  Sure, their brisket leaves this taste of buttery meat in your mouth (if you don't understand that, I'm sorry for you) and makes you want much much more - but why has no one mentioned the turkey?  We only got a sample of it, but DANG I could eat a lot of that!  One day when I'm trying to be "healthy" I'll get that but today was not that day.I got what I believe was called the Big ol' Boy sandwich.  When he called back for the guys to make it he said to make a BIg ol' Girl.  Nice touch dude.  So the sandwich is 1/3 pound each of BBQ chopped pork, brisket and hot links.  I am not a fan of hot links, but figured I'd give it a shot as I liked the general concept (It actually comes out as a sandwich vs. it being a make your own thing...).  I LOVED the hotlinks.  That casing had an awesome "pop" as you bit into it, had a black pepper-y hint that I loved, and was good enough that I would almost contemplate trying one solo.  And I have NEVER felt that way about a hot link before.Between our samples and our meals I got to try all 3 kinds of brisket and I don't know that I'll be able to tell you my favorite.  Like picking a favorite child.  Sure, Bobby is the juiciest, but Jimmy tastes intense and smokey...well, you know what I mean...Not sure how new this is - but they now have 2 BBQ sauces for your eating pleasure.  Normal and HOT.  Hot won't burn your lip, but definitely makes the tongue to a double take.And the service.  Clap... Clap... Clap..Clap..Clap.Clap.Clap.Clap!!!  Right on point.  By the end of the end of our introduction to the food we knew what things were made fresh that day, what things were made every other day or weekly, and which ones came from his Grandma's kitchen.  Thank you Grandma - for both the recipes and raising folks right.  Folks were just as sweet as that tea.  I was also happy to see that even though we got there around 6:20pm and they close at 7pm, there were 3 big parties and 1 to go order that came after us.  Please folks - keep these people busy!  Don't you dare let this place go out of business because I have found my new BBQ heaven.  Review done.  Tummy still full.  Texting friends to make our next trip...*A desert landscape at midnight. A few men gather around a campfire seeking its warmth and the rare company of a passing stranger. One man, equally ravaged by the sands of time and the desolate landscape began to speak with just the smallest glimmer of contentment in his voice.*I had heard for years the ever-so-tantalizing cry of "melt-in-your-mouth brisket" sung to me by oh so many men who had come before....men far more accomplished than I. I remember them telling me as a young boy, "Son, some day you will find your brisket." I stared up at them with a gleam in my eyes. An innocent and naive sense of hopefulness filled me to the brink and then poured over the edges of my soul as I thought to myself, "Yes! I will find my brisket."Many years have come and gone since that time. The months like an ever strengthening gale storm pushing me further and further from my deepest, darkest desire: to find my lost brisket. Lo, the days were long; the minutes past like decades. Soon my cynicism began to take the best of me. A crusade of the mind against the heart ensued as brisket after brisket entered my gullet and filled my disposition with neglect. Some were flavorful, sure. But none would fulfill the promise my elders had made to me as a young boy.None, that was, until I found the Texas BBQ House of south central Phoenix. I knew the moment I walked through their doors that I was in for something special, but just what, I could not have told you. I watched a man behind the counter wield his blade flawlessly as a woman kindly prepared a basket with bread and cheesy macaroni. She had potato salad and and sausage and all sorts of other wondrous items. And then the brisket was placed before me. I could see the tenderness of the meat as its juices glistened in the daylight. I saw burnt ends that I could swear were calling for me by name. I thought, "Could it be? Have all my dreams come true?!" My heart went aflutter with the still unfulfilled promise of my forefathers.Finally, the moment had arrived. I prepared a slice of bread with a few slivers of meat, and a helping of barbeque sauce. I slowly bit down as my eyes closed, hoping and preying that the day had finally come. It was like I had died and gone to heaven. I saw Jim Morrison. I went towards the light. Only...when I walked through it, there I was. Sitting at my table, across from my father, with some brisket in a slice of bread that now had a single bite taken from it. I was happy. Down to my core, I was filled with contentment. And I realized at that moment, that I hadn't been searching for that "melt-in-your-mouth" brisket all along...I had been searching for myself. And now, I had found it. I had found...me.*hold for applause*This is the Q I have been waiting for!!!! Awesome brisket, both the lean and juicy are fantastic. The sausage was the next big winner, followed by the potato salad and then the mac, but actually everything was fantastic. The hot bbq sauce has quite a kick to it, but its a whole-mouth warmth kind of thing so its quite pleasant. Without a doubt the best bbq I've had to date, and I will be back.I've been here several times and have always left happily satisfied.  On this particular visit my friend and I had an amazon deal where we got a pound of brisket and two drinks.  We also ordered Texas cream corn, coleslaw and mac n cheese to share.  We got the small portions for all of them and the size was just enough to try everything and be satisfied.  Brisket was amazing without the sauce, but even better with it.  Super tender.  Coleslaw and cream corn were great and I'll definitely have those again.  I absolutely LOVE the cream corn.  I could have a big ol' container of just that.  The mac n cheese was good.  Not great, but good.  The sweet tea was AWESOME.  They should bottle that up and sell it.  The staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and offered suggestions.  I loved the little boys that were working and hanging out.  From the look of things it seemed like their dad owns or runs the place.  One of them was so sweet and polite.  We would ask for things and he would say, "yes mam, no mam, thank you mam".  He even asked how everything was.  I'd go back just to hang out with him.  The only thing I noticed different from when I visited over a year ago was that they no longer sell beer and while I'd like a Shiner to add to my Texas bbq experience, the food and the staff are enough to make me come back.I love TX BBQ and always go out of my way to find it. This was my second visit here. The first was with my wife and friends. Nice little restaurant that reminds me of what we would get along the train tracks in the poorer areas of TX.Menu has your basic items that you would expect at a BBQ joint. The meats are all served by the pound and you can get as much or as little as you want. They also have several side dishes that go great with the Q. The Texas Cream Corn was a treat.Normally get the Brisket and some Jalapeno Sausage. They have a small area off to the side with onions, pickles, jalapenos and some hot sauces. There are two different house sauces that they make and serve. One is mild and the other hotter.Food is pretty good but not super great. My Brisket and Sausage seemed to be at room temperature and not very warm. The Sausage was dry and could of had more fat in it. The white bread was not very fresh and tasted like it had been sitting out too long.Be careful where you sit down. I tried one of the red booths and about killed myself. Apparently the springs are shot and you end up lower than your body was expecting. Play it safe and go with the chair.Definitely better than a lot of the sweeter styles that are offered around town. Give them a try and see what you think. Located south of the river in an area of town that could use some urban renewal. SMOKIN A-OK!3.25 STARS
Carlos' Kitchen=It's not very often that the owner of the restaurant is your server. It was kind of funny. At first I thought he was the chef since he was wearing a white chef jacket, but then he came up to us and said, "My name is Carlos and this is my kitchen." He introduced himself AND explained the name of his restaurant.I kept reading about how specials are posted on a board, but I couldn't find it at first and I didn't want to just get a regular sandwich or burger. I eventually noticed it behind the bar area and for today they had Enchiladas, a Southwestern burger, and a turkey ruben. I asked Carlos what was in the Southwestern burger and he said it had Pepper Jack Cheese,Roasted Peppers Grilled Onion, Lettuce,& Tomato with Chipotle Ranch. I was going to order it, but my mom jumped on that before I did, so I went with the Enchiladas. We both got iced tea that was always refilled once it hit the halfway mark. While waiting, I took a look around the place. It's definitely Arizona Charlie themed, as Lucy E stated and it doesn't have the best ambiance. When we first walked in, we were greeted by a strong smell of smoke, but we just sat at one of the tables farthest from the bar area and it was fine. The furniture is pretty outdated with some old looking floral print fabric and our table cloth kept trying to fall off. Normally I would knock off some stars for that, but the food + service was outstanding. It seemed like everyone working at Charlie's Saloon was involved in the restaurant. The bartender in the saloon went up to us a few times to see how we were doing, gave us our menus when we just sat down, and asked how the Enchiladas were. When I told him they were great, he said, "That's what I'll be having for lunch. Everything in Carlos' Kitchen is amazing. You could probably throw a dart to pick anything on the menu and it'll come out awesome." Before we even ordered the burger, Carlos said all their burgers are very good. You can tell that Carlos and everyone that works here is very proud of the food. Carlos came out with our plates. The first thing I noticed was that the Enchilada plate looked a lot smaller than the ones you'd get at Mexican restaurants, but it was the perfect portion. Normally other places will just fill the plate with a bunch of sauce and watery beans, but this plate just had the two Enchiladas in the center and a small portion of beans and rice on the right and left. At first I thought the sauce was going to be overbearing because it looked like there was a lot of it, but it actually had a nice subtle flavor that complemented the Enchiladas perfectly. I'll be honest, I scraped my plate clean. I don't even remember the last time I ever did that, but I couldn't help it. The Enchilada plate was just so yummy and the portion was perfect. It didn't leave me overly full and I didn't have to waste any of it.I took a bite of my mom's burger and it was good. The patty was very juicy and I actually really liked the Chipotle ranch that was inside. When I took a pic of the burger, it looked like there was A LOT of cheese in it, but the piece I ate didn't have any cheese on it, so I can't really comment on it ruining the burger (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w3pRWx5xOnPmmuZL7c9Pvw/l.jpg). My favorite part about that dish was the beer battered french fries. They are soo long, so crisp, and perfectly breaded (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ie6f7x2-KBkbpdbxKJAuRA/l.jpg). I absolutely love their fries!When we were done with our meals, Carlos talked to us for a while. He told us about how everything they make is from scratch including their soups. They always have a different soup and they just create it from whatever vegetable is in abundance at the grocery store or whatever is in season. He also told us about the New Years Eve Feast they're having for $20.12 (clever, right?). It includes: Mixed Greens with Poached Pears, Bleu Cheese and Champagne Vinaigrette,Grilled Filet Mignon topped with Two Sauteed Prawns, Eggnog Pannacotta with Brandy Caramel Sauce and fresh Whipped Cream. It's an awesome deal and it's served from 4pm-midnight.Everything about our experience here today was excellent an I'll definitely be coming back to try out some more of their daily deals and definitely some of their soup!Tips:*Carlos' Kitchen has an app that you can download for free! It shows you their daily specials, menus, and restaurant info*Daily specials are posted on a board on the left side of the bar area. It's next to the kitchen doorI read about this place in Las Vegas Weekly a while back and learned that the chef used to be an instructor at Le Cordon Bleu. Gaming taverns aren't exactly known for their food, but this one might challenge others for having the best bar food around.Looking at the menu there's a lot of typical bar fare -- burgers, wraps, salads, nachos, wings, etc. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted because nothing stood out. It all sounded pretty average... nothing unique. But the execution, at least with the one item I got, was excellent.The buffalo chicken wrap ($8.99) was about the size of a Chipotle burrito, filled with plenty of crispy chicken tossed in a wing sauce (your choice of mild or hot) with blue cheese dressing, lettuce, and tomatoes. It was accompanied by some delicious fries that were both light and crispy.I'm willing to go back for more, I just wish the menu had more personality... more items that differentiated the place from other bars... unique dishes that you couldn't get anywhere else.To all previous Yelp friends who reviewed Carlos' Kitchen--THANK YOU!  I was aware of Chef Carlos when he was at the other place a few blocks away but never went there.  After being reminded of him by Susie H.'s recent review, this was on my to try list ASAP.We arrived early last night (Sunday) after the Ribbon of Life show at the Smith Center.  We were the only ones in the place.  The server told us to sit anywhere we liked and she handed us the menus after we were seated.  Before leaving, she read the specials of the day.  There were two dinners, a wrap, and I believe a salad special.  She had me hooked with the first thing she read--bleu cheese pasta with steak!  I ordered that and my wife ordered Chicken Angelina.The bleu cheese pasta was made with penne rigate and the steak was grilled, sliced, and placed in strips on top of the pasta.  The bleu cheese sauce was exceptional.  A great bleu cheese bite with every taste and there was extra bleu cheese crumbles spread on the pasta.  My wife chicken Angelina was a seared chicken breast served on top of garlic spinach and mashed potatoes with large pieces of mushroom.  It was topped with artichoke and there was a dijon cream sauce.  She enjoyed it a lot!Although we were both full, we had our minds set on having dessert we had looked at online earlier in the day.  She got a chocolate molten lava cake and I got the chef's indulgence.  Both were outstanding!!!  The menu describes the indulgence this way:  A Cheesecake Spring Roll, Crunchy Bites of Brownie and Mini Banana's Foster Cheesecakes, served with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Fresh Strawberries and House Made Berry, Caramel & Fudge Sauces.  For the single version there's one brownie bite and one mini bananas Foster, but that's more than enough.  There are sweetened tortilla strips on the bottom of the plate.  This is one of the most creative desserts I've seen.  Chef Carlos came to the table twice to check on us and we chatted about the food and what he'd done since he moved to this newer spot.  The restaurant is almost completely closed from the VP bar so there's almost no smoke smell from the bar coming into the restaurant.  I can really see this place coming onto our rotation list of places to go again and again.  I'll call and ask the specials before I go.  What a wonderful gem hidden away in this video poker bar!  And, what a fantastic and creative chef Carlos is.  He cares about his food and his customers.Okay, Mr Carlos, you got my attention with your 4 1/2 star average. Now lets put it to the test.When I pulled up to the building, it says Carlos's Kitchen but when you stick your head in the door, (which happens to be two of them. One on the right for the bar and one on the left for the restaurant) you can get really confused as to where to go if the server is not there to greet you. So I stood there for a bit wondering if I should play video poker at the bar or just sit down and wait.So the waitress finally sits me down after she sees me just standing there like a statue. At first I didn't know where she came from but then realized there was no hostess for she was both. I assumed she came out of the kitchen because like I said, it is kind of confusing where to go.So while im looking at the menu, she is going on about the daily specials but I had my mind made up on the Spicy Chicken from the tip I saw off the Yelp business listing. I gotta say it was a good choice. The sandwich is decent size, the chicken breast was juicy, and the sauce that was on it had that extra kick to wake up you taste buds. Also the french fries that came with it deserves some attention as well. There is some kind of breading on it that gives it a certain crunch and extra flavor. I cant put my finger on what it is, but it is definitely good to the point that you want to finish your fries.Service was, let's just say a bit slow. I don't know if it was because there was only one server or the cook takes his time or what. I noticed there only 3 other tables being served so im not sure if this was your typical lunch crowd. As for the prices, they are comparable to Denny's or Chili's. A typical meal will run you 10 to 15 dollars per person. Lastly, since the bar is right next door and there is no barrier that segways from there, you will have secondhand smoke coming in from there, which is quite a negative if you ask me. My suggestion would be to put a swinging door there of some type and that should stop most if not some of the smoke from coming in.So Mr Carlos, what other Yelp peeps are saying are legit. It's just that I cant really spend more than 45 minutes for lunch and eat without having to think about lung cancer. Your restaurant is definitely worthy of good quality time spent with friends and/or family.While waiting for my daughter to finish a magic the gathering tournament at the nearby Little Shop of Magic, I wandered into Carlos' Kitchen and the connected Spectator's bar  I will review Specator's separately.The menu in both locations is supplied by Carlos.  Carlos is a former instructor at Le Cordon Bleu and I am glad he came out to discuss Burger philosophy and general cooking techniques with me.  He truly loves the art of cooking and I enjoyed meeting him.I started with onion rings which were lightly battered and fried to a golden glow.  The batter was unlike other batters as it had a sweetness to it.  I followed the rings with a bacon cheddar burger.  Now I have been searching for a truly great burger since I moved here.  I ordered the burger medium (I knew I was in for a treat as most places don't even ask).  The burger was perfectly cooked Angus beef with just the right amount of pink without being undercooked.  Carlos takes pride in the quality and flavor of the meat and it shows.  The bun was crisp on the outside and soft inside and the cheese was melted so it covered the top and sides but didn't fall out onto your hands.This is one of the best burgers in the area and the price is right.  Burger, fries and onion ring appetizer cost me only $17.00.I can't wait to come back and sample some of Carlos' other creations.  This is a diamond in the rough.  Don't miss your chance to meet Carlos!
Curry Corner=UPDATE:  Looks like the health department can confirm my personal experience.  5 negative findings on their most recent inspection (http://phoenix.about.com/library/blrestinspectbad0613.htm). Meanwhile, the owners keep messaging me to get me to delete my review.Oh Curry Corner.  I loved you since the day I met you.Your takeout orders were usually wrong.  But I forgave you, for each time I came inside, my food was just right.I was wierded out by your self-service beverages, and your water always tasted so awful that I drank tea or soda.  I figured it was a ploy to sell drinks, and I was OK with that, because your food was so cheap and so delicious.I was excited to come in last week to find Guy Fieri's visit (can't stand the dude...wtf is with his hair...SERIOUSLY) prompted a major renovation.  Gone were the mostly disgusting and crappy booths near the kitchen.  Hardly an improvement to remove booths and replace with tables and chairs, but this was.  They cleaned it up. And it looked great!Well, I was pumped that my friend, who is mostly an Indian food virgin, enjoyed this place and his first foray to the cuisine.  So much so, that (well, until he reads this review) I couldn't bear to tell him what I saw when we checked out.A roach.  Not a dead one.  One still clinging to it's life.  Legs in the air like he just didn't care.I immediately bugged (ha!) my friend who had originally turned me on to the place to tell him my woeful tale of a roach at Curry Corner.  OH, he said?  I saw one the last time I was there, but I assumed it was just a fluke.No.  It was not.  And no thanks, CC.  I'm over you.Seriously, am I missing something??? I seem to be the only person who has had better Indian food.  The fam and I decided to give this place a try, even though it is very far from home, but with a recommendation like DDD, what could go wrong?  Well, first off, it's a bit chaotic when you walk in.  No real system to be seated and the tables are weirdly situated.  Once we were seated we were rushed to order... thankfully we mostly knew what we wanted.I tryed the marsala fries, which were BY FAR the best thing we ate.  Those, I must say are amazing.  I also had a bite of the samosas, which were ok... not really that favorful, and the chicken tikka masala.  Honestly, it was ok, but I've had better... even from Trader Joes.  We also had the goat... this too was ok... better than the masala, but so fatty it was hard to eat.So, long story short... if you live near here then perhaps hit it up.  Otherwise, check out some Indian food closer to home... that is my recommendation.  You're welcome.I am very disappointed by this place. I eat Indian food at-least once every couple weeks. I decided to go here based on the show Triple D (Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives). Well let me say this place is high up on the dive end of scale and I will never go back.I placed an order for take-out and ordered the Chicken Tikks Masala (my favorite), Matar Paneer, and Cheese Naan. I walked into the restaurant and there were only two tables taken. That should have been my warning to leave, but no... I said I will give it a try based on Triple D. I pay for my order and head back to my hotel. No issue with service, I only walked in and picked up my order. I get back and sit down ready to partake on what I am expecting to be some good/great Indian food. This is where the disappointment starts setting in... :-(I open up the soup container of Chicken Tikka Masala, and I notice something isn't right.. The Masala sauce is very loose, almost like they used skim milk vs heavy cream. So I opened the container of rice to add to it and I took a bite... no seasoning. Just bland white rice. No flavor of cumin, clove or cardamom, not even salt. I taste Tikka Masala sauce and it wasn't good, almost seemed like they left some important spices out.I then proceeded to open the soup container of Matar Paneer. This was loose as well. I am really getting frustrated now. I take a spoon and search for the peas and a chunk of the Paneer (homemade cheese). Instead of Paneer, it tasted and had the mouth feel of tofu. Very disappointed. I closed up the containers of Chicken Tiki Masala, Matar Paneer, and rice and threw them straight into the trash. The only thing that was good was the cheese naan.I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, in fact in my opinion, it is a disgrace to Indian Food. I have ate at one other Indian restaurant; Indian Place (Indian Delhi Palace - http://www.yelp.com/biz/indian-delhi-palace-phoenix?hrid=vLH0tzET4aC02gSgEAWkMw) in the Phoenix area, and I should have just went back there.
Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill=The omakase, like Holly C had mentioned in her review, is indeed insane.  We ordered 3 $100 omakase and watched teh sushi chefs prepared it while we sat at the sushi bar.  The experience alone is something that can't be quantify in dollars, especially if you are a foodie and enjoy seeing food prepared artistically, as well as enjoying the delicious edible works of art.The starting price for omakase here is $100, and can go up from there.  Seeing the results of the $300 omakse platter as we were exiting the restaurant, kind of reminds me of the feeling of watching the Food Network Challenges (I would love to be one of the tasting judges if they ever do an extreme sushi challenge).  And in my opinion is an interesting and extravagant way of splitting a meal with friends or impressing potential clients.  After the meal, you will definitely have something to talk about.The sushi here is good. Granted all the fish is trucked or flown in to the restaurant, just like for any other sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. But thus far the volume of customers that seemed to be served every time I walk past Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill (BRSBG) is pretty high, so the inventory of fish must be pretty fresh. The rolls here are good too, even though you will be paying a premium for it.  The sushi chefs here are not too talkative.  But we also didn't buy them sakes or beers, so that might have been a contributing factor. But they are skillful bunch and what they served up reminds me of the sushi I used to eat when I was much younger (presentation is still very much an important component of the food served).Our servers were good.  As the food was served, they identify them so you don't have to guess what they are (especially since we really have no idea what is going to be served with the omakase order).Desserts is probably the only uninteresting part of the meal, as the selection was uninteresting and expensive (I'd rather walk to Bellagio or Aria and get some Jean Philippe Patisserie pastries or dessert crepes, and still pay less).I posted the pictures I took from the dinner, so if you want to get an idea of what you might expect from ordering the $100 omakase, please check them out.Decor: 4/5 Very nicely decorated.Price: 3/5  Expensive, but you do get what you pay for.  Can't really compare the price to AYCE sushi restaurants.Food:  4/5  Very good.  The uni and the amaebi are both very fresh (the shrimp was still swimming moments before it was plucked from the tank, prepped and served. Service:  4/5  Fine dining style of service.Parking:  3/5  Cosmopolitan is getting busier every time I go,so finding a good parking space seems to be harder and harder.  But there is always the valet option.Location:  5/5  Right on the Strip.  Perfect for tourists and locals having a fabulous night out on the Strip.Overall, a solid 4 stars from me.Make no mistake, this place is pricey. Unless you're a serious baller (like the Green Bay Packer players we saw rolling out of here) you're going to feel the hurt when paying your bill. With that little detail out of the way, Blue Ribbon is worth checking out.The place has a modern Japanese feel and is divided up into three areas. When you first enter there's a small sushi bar to the right. Past that is a spacious lounge and bar area. Beyond that is the main dining area with a larger, U-shaped sushi bar. The tables in the main dining area are rather intimate, with many booths lining the walls and tables that are separated by thin wood dividers. So, if you're looking for a place where you can have some personal space and are more than 6 inches away from the nearest diner, then this is the place for you.Service was spotty. Our server was nice enough, he just didn't seem to know what was on the menu and couldn't recommend anything. Luckily, one of the managers came by to suggest a few items. Although he was casually dressed in jeans and a polo shirt so when he first came up to chat I thought it was just some random dude wanting to talk about the menu.Here's what we ended up ordering:Tuna sashimi. 2 pieces. Pricey, but deliciously fatty and silky smooth. Possibly some of the best tuna sashimi I've had in the city.Kanpachi - Amberjack with yuzu pepper. The order came with eight slices of fish with the yuzu sauce poured tableside. Smoked pork belly kushi yaki with pickled onions and baby watercress. Two decent cuts of pork with a nice amount of fat that added to the richness of the flavor.Negimaki - broiled beef with scallions and enoki mushrooms. It was a cute looking dish with eight slices of beef wrapped around the scallions and mushrooms. It was a good, savory dish with a hint of sweetness from its sauce, but probably not something I would order again.Miso marinated black cod. Two sizable pieces of fish per order. You usually can't go wrong with miso black cod, but I've had better. The piece that I had had a slight fishy taste and smell.Crab and truffle fried rice. The menu says it's $55 per order. That's ridiculous for any type of fried rice, but since everyone seems to rave about Blue Ribbon's fried rice we gave it a try. The manager said we could get a half order. Perfect! There were plenty of chunks of crab and mushrooms and slices of truffle. Definitely the best fried rice I've had, just don't tell my mom that (sorry mom, your fried rice has been bumped down to number two).I thought this would make a great place when my friends staying at Vdara wanted to do sushi. But when we sat down and were handed menus...they were asking where the pencil and checklist were. Realizing these guys were not sushi connoisseurs whatsover we almost bailed and went to Sushi Mon. The ambiance was great though and the cocktails convinced us to stay. Glad we did. I am so anti getting edamame at restaurants it's not even funny. Why would you pay $4+ for a little bowl when you can buy a whole bag for less and eat it at home? But that's the first thing my buddy orders...go knock yourself out man..for $8! I had a couple of them and it was ridiculous. If I'm paying that much for edamame..it should be at least served cold like in real Japanese restaurants and not straight out of a boiling pot. Give me a break. AYCE places whatever...I always assume it'll be served hot but $8 in a place like this?!? Its just the principal itself goddamit!! Anyways...the quality of fish was outstanding. The maguro served had that really deep red color I sometimes dream about. I savored every single piece of sushi and sashimi I had. I was also eyeballing some really cool items I plan on ordering in the future with sushi snobs like the lobster sashimi. I will certainly be doing the omakase next time I'm here.Excellent rating only because of the trendiness of the ambiance and excellent service.  The food is only OK.I'm from Hawaii where we have some of the freshest and best sushi in the world.  I have also traveled to Tokyo and Kyoto where sushi rules.  Sadly Blue Ribbon charges the high prices but misses the mark on quality.The ultimate test of a sushi chef is the Tamago Nigiri.  Sad to say, the rice was overly packed and on 3/5 occasions, the tamago was overcooked.Other sushi items are very fresh but portions are very small.  The fish to rice ratio is nowhere near Tokyo standards.Hot entree items are very good to OK.  The tempura is perfectly cooked but the broiled fish is consistently over cooked.If you want a perfect dining experience, order the Blue Ribbon Special.  Its basically omakase. Its near perfect.  Only problem for less adventurous diners is that you leave yourself in the hands of the chef.  Well worth the risk but at $200, very pricey.The sake list is good, the wine list is OK.Prices are high.Service is excellent.I'm not someone who blows a lot of dough on these overpriced restaurants in the strip hotels, but this time, it was a paid meal for a business meeting with only 3 people, so I jumped at the opportunity to try this place out as the Cosmo's restaurants seem to maintain high quality although overpriced as expected.  I would usually sit at the counter and talk to the chef, but my party was 3 and they were already seated at the table, so I went with the flow.  When I first read about the blue ribbon restaurants originating in NYC opened by a couple of jewish restauranteurs...I wasn't so sure about this place.  Besides, no authentic sushi chef would ever name their sushi restaurant "blue ribbon".  However, my worries were whisked away as soon as I opened the menu filled with mostly old school sushi and appetizers.  Yeah, there were a few fru-fru rolls and wagyu just so that non-sushi eating americans can still enjoy the meal, but the menu was appealing and mouthwatering for the most part.  When going to a sushi restaurant, it's always best to go with "omakase".  I talked to the waiter who really couldn't tell me that much about the omakase, so I asked who the Japanese sushi chefs were, and 3 out of the 4 chefs at the tsukeba were Japanese (a good sign), and the waiter led me to the head sushi chef.  So I asked what his recommendations were today, which were botan-ebi, uni, aji, and sakuradai...very good, and when I asked him if those would be included in the omakase and he confirmed, so I went with the $100 omakase.  He seemed a bit surprised that I spoke to him in Japanese as I was in a group with 2 caucasians, but it's always good to talk to the chef in Japanese to: 1) make sure that the chef is Japanese and 2) to let them know that you are Japanese because really... you can't screw around with Japanese customers who know their stuff.  We started out with some Kumamoto oysters on the half shell with ponzu....excellent (not part of omakase), and then we got a HUGE plate of sashimi consisting of: uni, ikura,, scallops, sakura-dai, aji, hirame, seared salmon, blue fin tuna, isaki, hamachi, and botan-ebi (I may have missed a couple).  This was pretty impressively presented on a plate that must have been about 2 feet long.  It was an omakase order for 2 people.  The waiter actually asked us if we wanted two identical plates or one big plate with more varieties and I was glad that we went with the latter.  It was truly a HUGE spread and every sashimi was impressively fresh and delicious.  I was especially surprised that they had a quite a bit of white fish, which is more of an acquired taste as you are tasting more of the amino acid/protein rather than fat.   I feel that talking to the chef beforehand had something to do with that, as most Americans would not know what they were eating and probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.  Then we had a large sushi plate with blue fin tuna, kanpachi, salmon, giant clam, king crab legs, spicy crab roll and some other fancy roll.  Overall, excellent sushi/sashimi with a quality that surpassed my expectations.  I would have preferred to have had a few more nigiri's instead of those Americanized rolls, but I would say that it was an excellent meal overall  As for pricing...$100+tax+tip seems a bit on the expensive side.  Would I go back on my own dime?  Hmmm.....that's hard to say, but I'd rather spend $100 on what I ate today than $100 on an overpriced steak restaurant on every other big casino on the strip.  If there is a next time, I would sit at the counter and have my nigiri made one at a time while talking with the chef.  That's how sushi should be eaten.LVRW2012: Restaurant Week, if for anything other than charity, is lightly considered an opportunity for people to experience a restaurant they wouldn't normally enjoy in their everyday life--usually for the first time. Diners often need an "excuse" to eat out and spend money frivolously; I am one of those diners. Because eating at a fine dining restaurant a few times a week, just because, is a ton of empty calories and quite time consuming. At first glance, Blue Ribbon's prix-fixed restaurant week menu stands out as "a good one." You have the choice of two apps for your first course, a taste of sushi, three entrees of which only one looks good, and a dessert. But that excitement is let down soon after the third course.The bisque was exceptional with large chunks of sweet, tender meat. The heat warmed the cloud of wasabi crème on the surface; when combined with the soup, it really complimented the lobster flavor. Upon further investigation, I found this is not on the regular menu. Generally, I'm against non-menu items on LVRW menus, but I was satisfied by this course.The spicy tuna roll was by the book. No disappointment, no intrigue. And as a pleasant surprise it was served alongside a piece of chutoro and hamachi. I'm not fond of amberjack but the tuna was pretty good. The pork cheek and trout entrees are not on the regular menu and everyone swoons over the "Blue Ribbon Style" fried chicken. At $26, this luxury fried chicken had the potential to be great. Its coated lightly with matzo meal and flour, then seasoned with a spice mix of togarashi, paprika, cayenne, and sea salt. Whatever unique, stand-out flavor I was searching for was overtaken by a vat of old oil. It was served with a dipping sauce made with--supposedly 'real'--wasabi and honey specially-imported from Mexico. Now that I would pour on just about anything but it just can't make-up for that stale oil taste.The chocolate bruno is rich, dense, and extremely chocolate-laden and was supposed to be served alongside a green tea ice cream. They were out of green tea and substituted chocolate ice cream without letting us know first. Just what I wanted, more chocolate. I sampled a bit of the gingerbread pudding. The clear winner of the two. Am I impressed? No. Would I go back? Yes, but only to settle the rumors that their oxtail fried rice is really the magnificent creature they say it is. After the fried chicken fail, I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't worth the $30.Loved it. Probably more so because we had like 5 bottles of hot sake but I promise the sushi we had before we were intoxicated was still wonderful. Racked up a bill way over the norm and ordered just about everything on the menu, but it's Vegas, you can't really hold back in Vegas. (Normally this might be 4 stars for the price but it's sushi in Vegas, what do you expect)Had like 48 Oysters - they were awesome. I kept ordering... 1 more dozen, 1 more dozen. I felt bad for our server but he was SO cool. Totally didn't care that we kept ordering more and he was always checking in and making sure we were doing okay even though the restaurant was packed.Had all my favorite sashimi and sushi and was definitely happy with the fresh-melt in your mouth fish.The black Cod was sweet and extremely tender. Perfectly cooked. As were the scallops. Oxtail Rice was recommended, I wouldn't think to order this at a sushi restaurant but wow, so delicious and totally worth trying! Had so much more food but this was after the first couple bottles of sake.... so yea... it was good? Hah. Only my third time at Blue Ribbon but I haven't been disappointed yet!As a sushi bar, meh.  As a high end, contemporary Japanese eatery, win!Gaijin sushi.  Purist understand.  The seafood, exceptional.  The rice, very sticky, over seasoned and poorly handled, misshapen and sticking to the hands of the chef.In all other areas, ultra high quality ingredients, controlled creativity, a respectful nod to Japanese culinary traditions equals outstanding dishes.Order family style and in courses.The beef marrow with teriyaki sauce and bonito flakes served with a simple piece of toast is mind blowing.  Rich, unctuous, the roasted marrow perfectly carries the teriyaki sauce as it coats the palate with comforting flavors.  The "Blue Ribbon" style fried chicken, very good.  A crisp coating surrounds a juicy, wasabi and honey seasoned morsels of chicken.  Add some togarashi powder for the perfect spice kick.Very creative fried rice.  The standouts; braised oxtail, bone marrow, fresh shitake, and crispy daikon (great blend of flavors coddled in the melting fat of the marrow) and the king crab, shaved truffle and egg (a flavor explosion with sweet crab and umame from the truffles).Ready to splurge?  How about A4 Wagyu from Kagoshima Japan. The real deal.  Three exceptional preparations.  (1) Seared as thin cut sashimi served with either ponzu or sea salt (the barely warmed surface releases fat that mixes so well with the ponzu increasing it's sweetness).  (2) Seared with miso butter (the fermented back taste of the miso sets off all kind of flavors in the beef), (3) Grilled New York steak (4oz / 8oz - $104 / $198 simple and good eats).Raw seafood is the best of he best.  The chu toro tartare with bits of scallion mixed with light soy and sesame oil topped with quail egg is a real treat.  Mix it all up for the best flavor.  The sashimi plates of kampachi dressed with yuzu pepper and hamachi with jalapeño and ponzu are both very good.Very good selection of sake.  Excellent service.  Contemporary vibeA pity they can't get the sushi right.  Oh well...I fell in love with the oxtail bone marrow fried rice when I visited the NYC location. You can only imagine the smile on my face when they told me they served it here in Vegas, as well!Score!We started the evening with a bottle of nigori, that drink gets me buzzing from the get go and at 19% alcohol on the Genshu Sake I knew I was in for a treat!Our first dish was one of the restaurant's signature dishes kanpachi Yuzu which was delicate with a soft supple texture but with a nice acidic finish from the yuzu. Great start!King crab truffle fried rice - dare I say I found a new favorite?!? I think I died and went to fried rice heaven!! The truffle added just the right amount of fragrant aroma to this drool worthy dish to make my mouth water and the moist and flaky king crab took it up to whole new level! AMAZEBALLS!!!Oxtail bone marrow fried rice with egg - as deliciously magnificent as I remembered! Rich, flavorful and marvelous!!!!Bone marrow - Rich, smooth with deep flavors enhanced by the accompanying sauce! You really don't need the accompanying bread but the contrast in textures are inviting!Fried chicken - served nice & hot! Perfectly crisp on the outside and beautifully juicy on the inside! Finger lickin gooooood!We were running late for a show so the thoughtful staff had us sign sealed and delivered before we could even say "check please!"Overall, great food, courteous staff and cool hip ambiance! The prices are a bit high but what do expect? IMO, this a great place to dine if you're into Japanese cuisine/Asian fusion. Happy Eats!This restaurant really has it going! Not only is it situated in the Cosmopolitan Hotel but, it's created a unique entrance that really makes it stand out from the other restaurants surrounding it. With a variety of seating arrangements it has a dim, classy feel to it but, everyone is super down to earth and they were playing Salsa music when we arrived! Sushi restaurant playing salsa music that was a first for me. Talk about over the top hospitality. They must have rotating floor managers aside from your waiter. We were asked by three different people if we needed anything, like nothing I've ever seen! Hospitality reached another level. Let's talk about the food (prices were not bad, but on the expensive side) they definitely had dishes that were "different". We wanted to try some of those and did. The Duck was amazing! Honestly, everything tasted great. There were no complaints on that end at all. You can see that the food was fresh and prepped right in front of you. Definitely a nice romantic dinner in the cosmopolitan this is the place to be.
Alchemy N' Ale=Update Number Two.Another rave review!I have a hunchyou might just love the brunch!I love this place.  No apologies (well, except for the lame poetry (?) above). It might sound like I'm an A & A cheerleader, but the cheers are well-deserved.  Oh, the brunch!  It was everything I'd hoped it would be!Let's start at the beginning.  The hub, the kid and I were seated at the sunny table in the window overlooking the goings on outside.  Immediately Brittany came and took our drink order.  The pre fixe menu was $20 INCLUDING a choice of a mimosa, sangria or a bloody Mary.  Helllooooo...you know my choice!  And apparently the bloody Mary fixation runs in the family...make that three, please.  While we looked over the menu, Britaney brought us a basket of pastries including croissants and sweet rolls and a plate with housemade blackberry jalapeno jam and a lovely fresh strawberry jam.  Butter, too, of course.  I tasted the jams, delightful.  My fave was the blackberry jalapeno.  Let's see....the choices were (as I recall) a frittata with potatoes and choice of bacon or sausage, drunken stuffed French toast with the same sides, housemade lemongrass ginger granola, pork belly with redeye gravy , poached eggs and those same crispy potatoes, bloody Mary crab and shrimp ceviche, espresso cured salmon and country fried chicken and biscuits with white gravy and a side of spinach.  You'd guess I got the bloody Mary ceviche and you'd be....wrong.  I can't resist the pork belly.This pork belly was one very lean piggy belly!  More like a crispy pork roast than the bellies I've had in the past.  Oh, before I go on anymore about the food, let me tell you about Patrick, the chef.  Having advised our waitress about my gluten issue, she came back to tell me Patrick would do the pork belly for me without the redeye gravy and make potatoes that hadn't been fried in the same oil as breaded items.  Now THAT'S a chef I can love.  He understands not only WHAT gluten-free issues are, he cares!  Thanks, Patrick...mmmwaahhh!  Okay, back to the food.  The pork belly, eggs and potatoes melted together into a dish I swooned over.  I can only imagine what it would have been with the redeye gravy.  Mmmmm.The hubster had the French toast.  Browned and beautiful, he enjoyed it very much - but raved over the sausage!  I don't know if the sausage is housemade or not, but it isn't Bob Evans!  Yum.The kid had the frittata with bacon and potatoes.  She loved it.  She loved Alchemy and Ale.  She loved the vibe.  She lives in Cleveland which has, probably, the best array of Sunday brunch spots anywhere - so impressing the kid is no easy task.I forgot to tell you about the bloody Mary.  THE BEST in Pittsburgh because  A & A has the BEST bartenders in Pittsburgh.  Richie was working and crafted those beautiful red libations with some mad btending skills!Not only was the inaugural Sunday brunch at Alchemy and Ale a success, it was a bargain.  We'll be back.  I can't wait.We went in today for Brunch.  Without a reservation, we were concerned about a wait.  But getting a table was no worry.  We were greeted right away by Brittany.  BJ got his favorite Bloody Mary and I got a Mimosa.  My drink was one of the best I have ever had.  We also loved the pastry basket.  My fav was the cute little sweet roll covered with almonds.  So good.  The spicy jams were also a very nice touch.  BJ had a difficult time with his choice, but ended up picking the Chicken and Biscuits.  I was anxious to try that much Yelped about Drunken Stuffed French Toast.   I have to say, I was very disappointed.  I did not like it at all.  Not good.  Didn't like the combination of flavors, didn't like the crispy crap it was dunked in.  I couldn't even eat more than two bits.   I believe that even if I was the drunken one, I still would not have liked it.  Also, my eggs tasted weird.  The sausage was the only edible thing on my plate and even it was a bit hard and not moist at all.  Strange.  BJ's meal on the other hand, was good.  He finished up every bite.  I even had a couple.  The chicken was good and so were his potatoes. The best part of our meal were the drinks and the service.  So, we are still on the search for the perfect brunch.  Boy, we didn't find it here!This place is great.  I had brunch here with a few of my girlfriends on a Sunday.  We started our brunch with some great drinks: mamosa's, sangria, and bloody mary's.  The sangria was one of the best I have ever had.We were seated at a charming table that was meant for a king & queen.  The large seats and table were all made of wood and went perfectly with teh brick walls.We were treated with delicious pastries while looking at our brunch menus.  You could tell the pastries were fresh and there were a variety of them.The menu for brunch had a variety of delicious items such as drunken french toast, chicken and biscuits, crab & shrimp ceviche, and fruit and yogurt.  The food was delicious and served timely.  The group ordered a variety of things with the drunken french toast as the most popular item.  Everyone seem to enjoy their food.The service was great and the people were very friendly.  The bartenders and waitresses seemed to love what they did and created a laid back atmosphere.One item to note is that there is no air conditioning.  It was warm on the day I went and the room was not uncomfortable but it could be if the place was packed.I would reccomend the brunch to anyone.  It is completely worth the $20 for the food, friendly service, and decor.
Saigon Kitchen=I've been here a few times (not by my choice) and this place is mediocre at best, so I have no idea why so many people are giving them raving reviews. Let me go through my phoanalysis...Pho:The broth is nothing to write home about. It's not terrible nor bland, but it's certainly not memorable. The meat, noodles, and vegs were fresh.Spring rolls:Decent, but once again, not amazing. There weren't any mint in the rolls I had and the peanut sauce is disappointing. Where the restaurant lost huge points with me was the inflated over-priced menu. The small bowls of pho are $7-8 and $8-9 for large, depending on which one you order. The bahn mis were $5-6, are you kidding me? And $5 for two spring rolls. It defeats the whole purpose of eating pho which is supposed to be cheap and convenient. Saigon Kitchen has more of a modern lounge feel to it, and that's not what I want in Vietnamese food. Focus on the food, not the decor.Some bonus points for the bar. They have variety of beers on draft: Sapporo, Kilt Lifter, Blue Moon, Coors Light, and some type of pale ale I couldn't make out. There's a small selection of liquor available also.Overall, I'm not a fan of SK. But my friend who lives nearby drags me there once in a while. I'd much rather make the trip to Central King Eggroll who has the best pho in the valley, so far, from my experience.Came here to try their much talked about Pho but settled on something else.  Nonetheless, this place was Pho-nomenal!Location & Aesthetics - located on Bell Road (corner of Bell and Litchfield) between Longhorn Steakhouse and Carrabba's.It might be easy to miss from Bell Road because what you see from Bell Road is the rear of some (not all) of the restaurants as their facades face south.  The sign to the restaurant is large enough from Bell Road so I'm thinking you won't miss it. Even if you miss it while traveling west, it's not a problem and very easy to make a U-turn on Bell as there are enough U-turn options available on the road.Lots of parking in the rear, and the parking lot was well lit.The interior of the restaurant is well-lit if you're dining in the evening as we were, and I'm guessing if you're dining in for lunch too, you won't have a problem as the restaurant is surrounded with glass windows.  There is also the option to dine alfresco at the side of the restaurant.Normally I would minus a point here as the restaurant was on the small side and felt cramped however the owner - Dennis did come around and happened to introduce himself to us, asked how we knew of the place and picked it (told him Yelp of course!), as well as indulged in some small talk, and did mention that he was expanding the place by taking over the space next door which will be occurring mid-December to sometime in January, and even extended a personal invitation for us to attend the grand re-openinging.The place was also exceptionally clean.  The noise level was average as it was a Friday evening but wasn't overly loud that I couldn't hear anyone in my party.Despite the place being really busy for a Friday evening, I didn't notice anyone having to wait for seating.Service/Menus - menus were provided to us as by our waitress soon as we were seated.  Very easy to read and understand.  Even our questions were answered promptly.  Our waitress took our drink orders immediately and gave us time to think about what we wanted to order.  Drinks came promptly and our waitress even saved us some money.  We came in a minute before happy hour was finished (3-6 PM).  Thankfully our waitress put in our drink and appetizer orders just in time so we ended up paying a little less (Happy Hour prices) for those items.Food/Drinks - For libations, I ordered the orange martini which was delicious and not too tart.  For appetizers, we ordered the shrimp & pork spring rolls (2 and its cut in half so you end up having 4 bites) - lettuce, bean sprouts, rice vermicelli, and mint served with a peanut sauce dip - very tasty particularly the ingredients added to the rolls like the mint and bean sprouts which served to enhance the tastiness of the shrimp and pork.  The rice vermicelli also gave the rolls a particularly nice transparent appearance.  For the main course, I thought I was going to have the Pho but instead settled for the Filet Mignon Shaken Beef - which is seared cubed beef tenderloin marinated in their house special soy, and served on a sizzling skillet with onions.  When this part of the dish, came out, it was sizzling and I even had folks who were passing by asking me if I ever had this dish and commenting on how great it is, and it's the only thing they order when they're there.  By itself, the beef was tender, moist, juicy, and very flavorful.  The soy wasn't overpowering or too salty, and the onions were sautéed beautifully and not burnt at all.  They will ask you how you want the beef cooked, and for me it was medium, and it was done exactly like that!  It was also recommended by the wait staff to mix the lime and salt and pepper that comes with the dish first, then use that to dip the beef in (as an option) to enhance its flavor.  I tried it and they were correct in that it did seem to multiple the flavor(s) tenfold!This dish is also served with jasmine rice which was warm, fresh, sticky (as rice should be in my opinion) and very tasty; a side salad; and a scallion broth which was hot and just the right thing to clear those sinuses (though mine wasn't in need of clearing).Well, my intentions were to come here to sample their Pho and despite that not happening, I don't have any regrets coming here at all.  As promised to the owner, I will return to try their Pho!
Tanzy=Dear Tanzy,Today you sadly disappointed in the service you provided. I spoke so very highly of your brunch buffet with unlimited mimosas, but sadly things did not go as planned. Let me start by saying that although the day ended not as planned, all of your staff were quite nice, very friendly, and extremely apologetic. I arrived on time and checked in, and I let the hostess know that my dining companions were running late but I still wanted let them know that I was there since I had made the reservation ( which by the way was cancelled on opentable after I checked in but that is another story) .  5 mins later another dining companion arrived and we were seated while we waited for others.  (FYI there was a total of 8 of us including my friend's daughter) Kevin our waiter introduced himself and let us know that he along with another waiter would be taking care of us. Score!  We get to fabulous men to take care of us. We were offered the endless mimosas but were SADLY informed that the brunch buffet that was once before offered was no more and that a new menu for brunch was being introduced.  I was so disappointed as that was the main reason why I had picked Tanzy as I had raved about the brunch buffet and how good it was.  This should have been our queue as to what was to come.Fast forward to around 11:30 and the rest of our party finally arrived. Everyone was happy to so each other and Kevin came by to offer the unlimited mimosas and again let us know that he and another waiter would be taking care of us. Cool. 10 mins later we are ready to order and regretfully our waiters are no where to be found. 20 mins go by and we are still waiting for our waiters so my friend went to the hostess desk  to ask where our waiters were and the hostess herself graciously came over to take our orders. But then we wait, and wait, and wait. We see other tables that came in after we did, get served there meal, eat, and leave. We even asked a party that was across from us, who came in at the same time that we did, if they had even ordered yet as they appeared to be waiting just as long as were were. An hour and 15 mins later ( not kidding) we finally say we are done. I go and look for our waiter and say please cancel our order because we are leaving. The manager comes out and apologies and comps our drinks but we were still disappointed. I am not sure what happened today but after speaking your praises   you let me down as well as all my girlfriends. Will I be back? Maybe but it will be awhile. Seriously  Tanzy, you dropped the ball today.Love, EbonyPS Bring back that yummy buffet please!Update 11.12.12: I received a phone call and an email from the General Manager Michael  today. WOW! Thank you for both the call and email. You went above and beyond what I expected. For that I give you 5 stars ( but I won't change the stars on this particular review) But again just wow, thank you!!! See I told you guys that the staff was great! :)Wow, what can you say about this place that has not been said.It is awesome in every area. There is so much going on here that I will just review for today the Restaurant of Tanzy itself.The beautiful setting is amazing. Plus free parking in the covered Garages.The staff is lovely and all the Managers really care about this place and your dining experience.  Which makes all the difference.We had a lovely table and the wine here is so nice, spectacular actually.The food is really good , The Braised Beef Short Rib is simply the best to me.I am not really a huge fan of Red meat either but, this is awesome. The Gnocchi they serve with it is unreal. Even though I know I am packing on the pounds I cannot stop eating it.Next time I think I will try the Muscovy Duck Breast and candied Fig.  It too looked wonderful. The Risotto is very good as well , and my boyfriend had the Mediterranean Chicken Penne.There is something here for everyone's taste. Plus the chef will totally make something in your direction if you are a vegetarian. A flour less Chocolate cake is my absolute to die for. Second time I have had it, and I love it.  I could come in again just for that.The restrooms are beautiful and clean.High end price but, good for a fancy night out. Dress up, because, you just feel better when you do.HAPPY NEW YEAR!High praises for the attentive service and friendly staff, but that's about it.The experience began with cocktails; a fruit martini tasting almost clinical due its unbalanced high vodka, low fruit ratio, and a Manhattan ordered with 'only one or two rocks' served up in a full glass of ice. Two for two thus far.The lobster salad, (Valentine's Day menu) a mountainous pile of frisee with a few small chunks of lobster buried deep within, made for a nice game of hide and seek as I watched my date feverishly pick through the lettuce in search of what little lobster was embedded within.The cedar planked salmon entree was another huge disappointment. A good cedar planked salmon should have the aroma, smoke coloring and caramelization of, well, cedar planked salmon. This was anything but. This salmon, while cooked properly, was tasteless, other than its normal salmon flavor.Now, plop it onto a flat, (non-fluffy pile) wet, soggy serving of cous cous and you've really got a plateful of disappointment.We also ordered the duck, which was delivered roasted and rare. So rare, it was like cutting raw chicken due to it being so flubbery. But again, as I mentioned, the staff was extremely helpful in bringing out a new plate of duck, this instead of the kitchen simply heating up the unwanted serving.After this level of disappointment, desserts were out of the question, but interestingly enough, our server never even offered us to see a dessert menu. How weird is that?It was like he had ESP.Throughout dinner, a woman, (we surmised a floor manager) paced the dining area as if overseeing the staff. Too bad she didn't stop by to inquire how our meal was or if everything was alright. Another disappointment.Ironically, if you read other Yelp reviews of Tanzy, nearly all of them feature a management response, either praising Yelpers for their high marks, or, apologizing for their less than stellar experience. Tanzy, please, there's no need to respond.I don't want an apology, or some lame reason why things weren't the way they should've been. I'm afraid that would be much too little, too late.The time for that was while we were still captive within your domain.What you should do instead is:Gordon Ramsey your Executive Chef.Make the mixologist sample his / her creations until they bleed vodka out of their eyes.And finally, have the person frantically pacing the aisles put a smile on her face and actually interface with the patrons, asking about their experience... seemingly pretending to give a poo.I really like this place.  This is a great place to have lunch or happy hour drinks.  It's located at the Scottsdale Quarter right next to a very nice iPic movie theater, so it's convenient for pre/post movie cocktails as well.Lunch is my favorite time to come.  The Prosciutto di Parma Ciabatta and the Turkey Panini are two of my favorite dishes.  They're both only $10 ea and comes with Parmesan Fries, which are addicting...yum!The lunch crowd here is relatively light for Scottsdale, which means you'll get in/out pretty fast.  Service here is always very good.Return Factor - 90%For August Breakfast Club the place picked was Tanzy, I for one was pretty excited about it! I didn't even know they were opened for bunch so when I got a look at the bunch menu I knew I was sold!  Tanzy does offer a prix fixe bunch menu for $22 that comes with a lot of options, but they also have a breakfast menu too. After checking out both menus I knew what I wanted. I went with the traditional eggs benedict. It was the perfect dish, with the right amount of hollandaise sauce; I just love that golden yellow tangy sauce! Yum! The eggs were cooked perfectly, the smoked Canadian ham was tender and moist, not dry and the English muffin was cooked perfectly too, firm and yet able to be cut when taking bite.  This was a great dish, can't wait to come back and try it again! The only down side to this breakfast was I wasn't able to get a order of the crispy Brussels sprouts, as it was too early to order them. Service was great; the restaurant is an opened lay out and nice, it even has great views of the valley. If you are in the area, regardless if it's for breakfast or dinner, give Tanzy a try! And if it's for dinner, do the crispy Brussels sprouts, man they are delish!Met a friend here yesterday before a movie.  I actually arrived first, around 5:50 pm, told the bartender I was waiting for a friend who was going to join me at a 6:15 pm movie and asked if I could order the Table-side Mozzarella For Two to take with us.  He said there wouldn't be enough time to order the app, but that we could order apps on the happy hour menu list and take those, so I chose the calamari and the meatballs, which were $8 each.  The calamari smelled fishy (not the sea-fresh scent) and had terrible texture, as if it was undercooked. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tanzy-scottsdale?start=100&select=Kdc4C3svJf6R7QmXrGo5ZQ#Kdc4C3svJf6R7QmXrGo5ZQ  The meatballs were good, albeit on the smallish side**, with a nice dollop of ricotta cheese, but the dish wasn't accompanied by any crostini, unlike my previous orders, which were admittedly a year, or more ago. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tanzy-scottsdale?start=100&select=nNFXqb2B8vN8envJcgRl7g#nNFXqb2B8vN8envJcgRl7gI  I asked for a little bread, but didn't have time to wait for it as we had to leave for the movie.  Don't know if I'd order the meatballs again, especially since the crostini were omitted, but my friend and I will be back to try the Mozzarella for two soon.**This is what the meatball crostini app looked like in March 2013! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tanzy-scottsdale?select=9aiYhoNUaF_nJWOkYu-yjg#9aiYhoNUaF_nJWOkYu-yjgA perfectly safe corporate restaurant incorporating recent trends in Italian and making them palatable to the trend following yet unadventurous Scottsdale majority.  Solid mozzarella and seafood options.  Not destination by any means but a solid pairing with a movie next door.Five stars for the AMAZING interior architecture and sexy ambiance! Negative stars for the taste of food and quality. My pasta sauce was sour in taste, and our desert was freezer burned. Our server was sweet and made a great effort to communicate in a seasoned, well versed manor, but overall a rookie at luxury service. The restaurant is so beautiful inside but lacks the quality in experience and flavors.

We went on Sunday after church. As we walked to the door to enter the restaurant we were greeted by a very nice girl who must of been leaving at the end of her shift as she was wearing a black Carmi t shirt. We seated ourselves and were quickly greeted and our drink order was immediately taken. F.Y.I. The sweet tea is delicious! My wife and I both ordered the Southern Fried Chicken meal which consisted of a thigh and a drumstick. For our sides we both choose the southern mixed greens (greens, cabbage and ham hock) I choose the baked mac & cheese and she got the potato salad. The chicken was seasoned to perfection! The skin was crispy and crunchy, The chicken was tender and juicy! It reminds me of the chicken at Busy Bee Cafe in Atlanta. The southern mixed greens were a little spicy but still very good. The mac & cheese was amazing as well. I prefer stove cooked mac & cheese but, let me tell you, this was just as good! My wife and I really liked the potato salad as it was almost as good as her's. You get a lot of food for the money and the portion sizes are just right. Our daughter got the burger and fries. Big surprise! If you follow my reviews you know that she always gets that! I must say that they serve some of the best fries I have ever tasted. They are fresh cut and really, really good. She loved her burger also. Carmi seems to be a family business as their children, grand children? are the wait staff. I must say that it is very refreshing to see such polite, well mannered teenagers today. Service was very good and my glass never got more than half empty. My only complaints are that there is no kids menu. They don't deliver and the decor is dated as others have said but, who cares?! The food is outstanding and we well be back often!Better than ever!We hadn't be in a while so we decided to visit Carmi again after church on Sunday. After we parked and were walking to the door we all noticed the new sign outside. Upon entering we were greeting by Gospel Music playing and were all pleasantly surprised by the updated decor. The walls are now two different shades of brown and a dark red. The ceiling is chocolate brown and there are new table coverings, lighting and even new menus with the husband and wife team on the cover. Keionna was our waitress and she took good care of us.We started out with Sweet Tea for our drinks. My wife and I both went with the Fried Chicken dinner which comes with soup or salad, two sides and cornbread. For sides I had fried corn and mac & cheese and she had mac & cheese and greens. Our daughter got the chicken and waffles.I went with the chicken and dumpling soap and the wife got a salad. The soap was simply delicious. The last time I got it, it was way too peppery. This time it was perfect.Now let me tell you about that chicken. I don't know what they changed but it was better than ever! The skin was nice and crispy and the chicken was hot and tender. The mac & cheese was also better then I remembered. My only complaint was that the fried corn could have been fried for a few more minutes. It wasn't cooked quite long enough for my liking. My wife loved her chicken, greens and mac & cheese as well. And of course our daughter was pleased with her meal as she tried to save half of her food for later but, just couldn't resist finishing it off. My wife and I could only finish half of our food and took the rest home.All and all our food was very, very good and better than ever. I won't wait so long  before we return. I must say after this visit I can honestly say that Carmi Family Restaurant is THE BEST SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT IN PITTSBURGH!!!
Thai Patio=BIG news for East Valley Thai Lovers! The daughter the famed Thai Basil (Phoenix location) proprietor is all grown up and has opened up her own shop. Let me tell you, the apple does not fall far from the tree - she is on a solid path to out-do her Dad's culinary greatness in no time. Besides that, Thai Patio is an overdue and  sure to be welcomed surprise to Thai deprived north east Mesa dwellers. I went in for lunch with a group of co-workers today and each of us fell instantly in love. The amazing smells that greet you when you walk through the door are enough to make you want to come back, but the food itself is just epic. One member of our group (I won't name names) actually could not resist finger licking the remaining green curry remnants off his plate. Thai Patio is just that good. Can't wait for the work week to come around again so I can go back and try another of their super yum (and super affordable - $6.95) lunch specials! Yay!
Butters Pancakes & Café=Oh, Dragonfly Cafe, why did you have to be closed for breakfast today?  I was almost at DC's doorstep when I decided to use my Yelp app to check on the cafe's hours, and darn it, it was closed!  So, I ended up at Butters, instead.  I arrived at around 10:30a, a bit of a late start since I had to switch venue plans, but no worries, as I would only have to wait about five minutes before being seated outdoors (and it was such a beautiful morning, too!).  I'd have enjoyed listening to the water fountain across from my table a lot more if traffic sounds didn't intrude, but what can I do?  I quickly got over it.I knew to stay away from the sweeter French toast concoctions, since the pumpkin bread variety I chose for my first visit was too sweet for my taste.  It took me awhile to decide what to have- blueberry pancakes or strawberry cheesecake French toast?  In the end, the write up on the "house strawberry-mascarpone blend" made the decision for me.  Ooh, I was looking forward to this!I wish I had more time to order a cup of coffee from the coffee shop next door, since Butters' drip coffee isn't a fave of mine (or of my Mom's).  I gave it a second try today, and I still don't like it.  The wait for the French toast wasn't long, about ten minutes.  I found my first three or so bites to be delightful, but then I got bored.  I don't think I'd order the dish again, unless I were to share it with someone else knowing that I had another dish to look forward to.  I suppose not all breakfast sweets can be as great as that of the Herb Box's Red velvet pancakes, or even that of Dragonfly Cafe's Bananas foster French toast...  Perhaps I should just stick to the savory items on the menu, such as that salmon/lox omelet we enjoyed on our first trip here.2.5 stars, but the service was OK, so rounding up to 3.  A shout-out for Rafael and the busser today.  You guys did a great job!The Butterfield's brothers have done it again! Butters is everything I look for in a breakfast or lunch spot. It's open and airy, the staff is friendly and fast and the food is fantastic. Oh and did I mention that the patio is dog-friendly? All pluses in my book! Since so many of the reviews are about breakfast, I am going to talk about lunch!Their wraps are amazing. The tortilla bread is soft and fresh and the combinations are mouthwatering. I ordered the Southwest Veggie Wrap with the addition of turkey. The wrap has Black beans, jalapeño cheese, corn, red bell pepper, avocado, scallion, lettuce, tomato & chipotle mayo. Every bite is better then the one before it. For my side, I splurged and ordered the sweet potato fries. Oh sweet happiness, I am so glad I did! The lunch was heartier than I typically opt for in the middle of the day, but when the food is this good, it doesn't quiet matter as much! The server was friendly and efficient. In fact, I had only had 1/3 of my Diet Coke and she brought me out a new one! That's service. This is definitely a eatery that shouldn't be missed.Wow! I absolutely loved eating breakfast here!  The Wild Berry Bliss pancakes were truly amazing! I guess you can't go wrong with fluffy marscapone filled vanilla cream pancakes. We read other Yelp reviews and found this to be a fan favorite! If you ever want a true taste of happiness in your mouth, then I urge you to order this!Irish Benny - For some reason, I've always loved the Irish fare of corned beef hash, but Butters restaurant decided to combine it ingeniously with eggs benedict, and voila! A match made in heaven! The hollandaise sauce covering eggs benedict with corned beef with a side of scalloped breakfast potatoes harmoniously complemented each other well, and I would not hesitate to order this dish again!My hubby ordered the Mexicana omelet and the chorizo had just the right amount of spice. He couldn't stop talking about the right texture and fluffiness of his omelet either. He's always picky about how his omelets are prepared and they really hit the mark here!Don't sweat the wait here, it is far worth it to experience breakfast here! I just wish it was a lot closer or at least had a branch on the northwest side of the valley because we would come here a lot  more if they did!OMG....The Wildberry Bliss Pancakes are absolutely wonderful. The name of the pancakes did not lie! The pancakes are blissfully fluffy and buttery on the outside that just melts in your mouth with all that fruit goodness and mascarpone. These are the best dang pancakes I have ever had!!! If I ever come back to visit AZ I will be coming back here for brunch.Also had the Irish Benny which was delicious as well! It's a eggs benedict (My favorite breakfast item) with corned beef hash. I have never had an eggs benny this way but it was super flavorful. The eggs were poached perfectly. Must get the OJ! Freshly squeezed! Ohh so refreshing!"This vanilla latte is the best coffee I've had all year." It wasn't the artistic foam on top that sold me. The coffee was robust without a hint of bitterness. My table companion's regular cup of coffee was delivered with thick, heavy cream. (So thick watching it pour was entertainment.)I'm sorry I didn't grab the name of our amazing server. But I did very much enjoy breakfast during a late lunch hour on a Sunday. Overwhelmed by the breakfast menu I selected a skillet. Why? They are served with a side of pancakes. (Or toast. But really, if you're going all in - GO ALL IN.)The New Mexico skillet offered a spicy chorizo, avocado, peppers and potatoes. If heat is not your thing perhaps this dish is not for you. I luuuurved it. No need to sprinkle a dot of hot sauce anywhere! Shhh! We used bank parking as it was Sunday. (The signage is clear. But it was Sunday!) This can be a popular joint for good reason.That's one helluva pancake! Dang delicious, melt in your mouth butter! Yummmm not to mention the fresh squeezed orange juice is so amazing! Great service, but expect a wait for a table any day of the week!With a name like this, you know it's got to be good. There are also zero illusions as to what ingredients may be in your delicious breakfast delights. Get out margarine, you don't even go here!This is a favorite breakfast stop for my Phoenix friends, so on my second day in town we came here to partake. The wait was substantial, but we didn't call ahead. The food, it turned out, was well worth the wait. Let's talk for a minute about these life-changing pancakes. You know when places offer "specialty hotcakes" and they're usually regular batter with junk dumped on top? That is not how it's done at Butters. Every pancake has its own signature batter recipe, in all these amazing flavors. Oreo? They bake the oreo into the pancake. They shove cream filling into the pancake. Whatever toppings you want are baked in and sprinkled on top. Like, what is this even? Heaven? That's right. Hashbrowns were sliced up seasoned potatoes cooked to perfection, and the Irish Eggs Benny was such a brilliant idea. Nothing like corn beef on my eggs. Mmm-mmm good! Hollandaise sauce was one of the best I've ever tried, slathered liberally all over the top.  Three cheers for Butters. It's like breakfast at Grandma's house. Don't bring the diabetic grandkids. Portions are huge. Sugar and Butter reign.
ZK Grill=Well I can say I am a frequent diner and very happy to say I will continue to eat here again. For a while I had been passing by now wishing i would have taken a chance on dropping in sooner. Groupon is what sold me. I got a killer meal deal which drove me to come in. I am surprised by the reviews as I have not had anything but great experience every time I have visit this location along with quality food. I don't eat Shrimp or Lamb so my reviews are on everything else. The meat is seasoned very well. The salad is amazing. It is not your typical mixed green salad they actually make it pretty loading it with the color veggies that make a mixed green salad taste well. I typically just eat there Champagne Vinegarate but they offer many other salad dressings. Along with the grilled tomato and pita bread make the meal even more enjoyable. My last order was #19 the Chicken Kaboob Meal. This was Grilled Chicken, Rice, Salad, Pita Bread and a Grilled Tomato. Everything was perfect. Fresh flavorful and hot. They cook everything to order so be prepared to wait at least 15 mins but it is worth it for good food.All the staff on deck are welcoming. It is a small little place with plenty of seating. Stop on in grab a drink and be prepared to enjoy.
Five Guys Burgers and Fries=I -had- to try Five Guys tonite, and well....I'm glad I did, for many reasons.Yes, I'm an In-N-Out gal, there's nothing better than a Double-Double, animal style, no tomato and the fries WELL done. HEAVEN.Pros: Five Guys had -one thing I liked: The cajun seasoning for the fries. Mainly hot paprika, and salt, but it was a very enjoyable flavor. It all went downhill from there, sadly.Cons: A -greasy- burger, no matter how much the propaganga on the walls tells you otherwise. (the little reviews/write-up from mags, all along the walls. The one i'm referring to it the article nearest the bathroom.) The meat has very little flavor. The "juiciness" they brag about was just oozy grease, so be warned! The toppings I chose: grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce, pickles and mustard. I ordered the bacon cheseburger, for those of you curious. The mushrooms? They use -canned- button mushrooms; those godawful slimy, discusting things with little flavor but of what I like to think of as ASS. A BIIIGGG thumbs-down for using such a gross item; it took away from any potential tastiness of the burger, and I ended picking them all off, after 2 bites.The fries: Wow. TOTAL let-down, but for the seasoning. They were soggy, limpy, greasy, PARTIALLY UNCOOKED, and the worst french fries i've EVER had in my life. They also cook them in peanut oil, so they have a unique 'tang' to them that I did not care for in the least.In-N-Out has NOTHING to worry about, this place isn't even -close- to being a contender for a good burger joint!I'm not going to waste time comparing this place to In-n-Out. They are completely different. period. I prefer a bigger meatier burger with mushrooms and bacon but everyone has their own personal preferences. The fries both here and at In-n-out dont' compare to the industrially-engineered unnatural (yet perfect) fries at Mcdonald's, but they are both natural fries and that's the way it is. They aren't great, the fries at in-n-out aren't great. I dont really eat many french fries so I don't care. My burger was perfection (I actually LOVE canned mushrooms so I'm so pumped they give me these included in the price), and the bacon and cheese and meat was all delicious. As an added plus, they have 100% beef Hebrew National hotdogs. You can get cheese melted on them too, or cheese and bacon. I split a yummy cheesy hot dog with my husband in lieu of fries ! So I'm taking a star off because I used their online ordering system so I could skip the lines. I pulled up to the extremely crowded, busy restaurant (they had 17 people working in the kitchen so they definitely weren't understaffed!), and told the order guy "I'm Blair, I have a web order, do you know how I pick that up". He gave me a clueless look then asked the manager. She fiddled around a bit and then said "uh yeah, it's being made". Ok, fair enough. The problem is even though i told him my name and that I ordered online, they only call the orders out by number. After he called "43" a whopping 5x, I asked him "any chance that's for me". He shrugged and handed me the bag- sure enough it said "WEB ORDER - BLAIR" in huge letters on top. Hey clown, when I tell you "I'm blair, waiting for a web order" maybe don't call it out by  number??!?!? How are web orders supposed to know we are order "43"??? Call web orders out by name, idiot!Anyways, despite my little web pick up mishap, the food was delicious and wonderful and I will be returning many times. I'm hoping because I went on their 2nd day of business they will iron out the issues (like internet orders) and when I return this week they will be better.Here we go again. Another overrated burger joint. Five Guys was everything I dislike in a restaurant!!! 5 Gripes about 5 Guys Burger and Fries: 1. The lighting- Did you gain inspiration from an operating room? Who wants to eat under a spotlight? Disturbingly too bright! It actually made me uncomfortable. The music was also way too loud to have a conversation. That's when the peanuts came in handy... 2. The Peanuts- We aren't elephants or at the circus, stadium or bar so I don't get it! Just made me thirsty. 3. The staff- There were entirely too many employees standing behind the counter goofing off and doing nothing. You would think between the six of them as a team they could have managed to get my order right. FAIL. 4. The burger-  A backyard BBQ burger at best. Unoriginal. While that's not a bad thing it was just missing the WOW factor for me. It was good, but nothing I can't recreate in the comfort of my own home. 5. So I lied. I only have 4 gripes about 5 Guys Burgers=) Overall there was nothing appealing at all about this place. The combination of the bright lights, loud music and mediocre food was very disappointing. 5 Guys has officially been voted off of my island and out of the circle of trust. Sashay away.The first time I've heard of this place was in New York. It was my brother's first year of school, and we were talking about In N Out, and his roommate had no idea what we were talking about, so I asked him what their In N Out equivalent is, and he said Five Guys was their east coast burger joint.  Ever since then, I've been waiting to try the so-called best burgers in town!! I didn't have time to actually try it in New York, and I did not have the time to try it in CA either, so my friend and I went on a whim to the Las Vegas location!!We were excited due to long overdue curiosity. So when we finally get in, I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and small cajun fries. When I took my first bite, the first thing that came to mind was In N Out and how the burgers are wayyy better there. The burgers were good, but not great!! This place has just been overly hyped, I believe.What a waste of $20. Seriously?! This place caught my eye because its only 2 miles from my house, and the area really needs a good burger place. In my husband's words, "If you've ever eaten a Wendy's burger, you've already been here". For $5.99 for a burger (yikes!) and $2.99 for fries I was expecting at LEAST In-N-Out or SmashBuger quality. Dry, small, and just....lacking flavor. Wayyyyy too loud music, you literally have to yell to give your order or talk while you sit and eat. Not going to start on their horrible lighting. Surface of the sun anyone?! Their burgers are made to order....right?  You tell them the toppings you want. I'm simple. Ketchup, Mustard, Lettuce. .....and they STILL got it WRONG. With 13 ...YES, THIRTEEN people behind the counter they still managed to mess up my order. When I see the tomatoes, (which I did not order, and made a point to tell them I was allergic to) they roll their eyes, take 10 mins to remake it, without an apology. $20 for 2 burgers and 1 Fry and 1 Small Drink is not bad if it was AMAZING or in a nice restaurant, but for a fast food type of place, they need In-N-Out prices. No Military Discount either :(I don't understand how this place is in business. I heard all the hype and we tried it last week for the first time. Well, it will be our last time. It was so over priced! for 2 burgers, drinks and fries it was almost $25! They didn't even get my order right. They seem like a wanna be In-N-Out Burger. I don't know what the hype is about this place   but the West Coast knows not good but great burgers and I don't see this place cutting it for much longer. I don't even recommend giving it a try just go across the street to In-N-Out where you will get great tasting fresh food on the cheap!good burgers and fries with generous portions!Came to this location for the first time this afternoon. I was impressed ,nice red,white, and black decor.Food was about $20.94 ,for 2 Burgers, one fry and one drink.We ate it there,but outside. It was a beautiful day, so good to sit outside.They even provide Peanuts on the table so while you are waiting for your food to be cooked you can enjoy cracking peanuts and eating them. Bathrooms were nice and clean, as I went to wash my hands before I ate.Place was clean, even outside.Food was fantastic!  the bun should be toasted it would not fall apart so easily.Free refills on drinks. Their drink machine is very different in looks, but works great!Fries were fantastic, we were going to get 2 but, the girl working said one was enough for 2 people. It was the regular size and it was enough for 2.We enjoyed it and will go back again for sure.This is the best burger I've had for under $10.I think In N Out is one of the most overrated things in life.  I don't get it!  My wife loves it and could eat there twice a week no problem and I've had my fair share of bites.  I just don't see what the hype is about.  No doubt the price is better along with their fries but I'm not coming here for that.In my world, a great burger always has a ton of toppings and ordering your burger "all the way" is the only way to go.  These patties are super juicy and taste fantastic.  I also love the melty, oozy greatness of the cheese is put in between the 2 patties.  On a side note, the soda fountain machine is tremendous.  It's truly straight out of a Jetsons (automatically dating myself bigtime!) episode.  I've never had that many choices for beverages at a burger joint with quite a few flavors I've never seen like raspberry diet coke.  Now I have 2 unhealthy vices that I might have to indulge in once a month.  This and Nothing Bundt Cakes!Five Guys Burgers and FriesFive Guys Burgers and Fries Five Guys Burgers and FriesTry saying that three times really fast. It just rolls of the tongue. I have always admired this place since my days in Florida. Honestly the only thing that I would change is the noise level. The burgers are cooked in 100% pure peanut oil. The ground beef taste fresh as well. They have a plethora of peanuts in multiple places. At the entrance and near the cashier looks like they have stacks and stacks everywhere, plus they are free.Over all the burger was very good. Grade  A The employees are super friendly.I was truly excited to try Five Guys because of all the wonderful things I've heard and basically, the hype around it. My brother and I ventured one afternoon and I was less than pleased. I did enjoy the fact that everyone was extremely friendly and not being charged for extra patties! Plus, the restaurant itself is nice and I was mesmerized by the high-tech soda machine (I wish I were able to utilize it, but no soda for me!). Our cashier, also really nice and friendly, was clueless about their ingredients! Their menu states one of the toppings to be "green peppers" and since I was unfamiliar with their burgers, I asked her what type of green peppers the menu was referring. Confusion. I continued, "Are they green BELL peppers, green CHILI peppers..?" The cashier responded, "Oh yeah, they're peppers, but, uh, I don't think they're spicy." All right...so I thought, okay some roasted or marinated green peppers? That sounds good on a burger. So I ordered two patties with green peppers, onions, lettuce, and tomato. My brother and I shared regular fries and cajun fries.You can imagine my disappointment when I opened my wrapper and realized that my first assumption of green bell peppers was right, but the cashier failed, not only to acknowledge that thought, but told me otherwise. How can you not know that your restaurant serves green bell peppers?? I amounted this to, hopefully, ignorance. It didn't add to a good experience for me because had I known they were bell peppers, I wouldn't have ordered it. Who wants raw bell peppers on their burger? It was so awkward. Plus, my burger was absolutely flavorless. I actually had to season my own burger with salt and pepper. I probably should have ordered cheese and condiments, but a good burger shouldn't have to rely on those accompaniments. The burger was tender and cooked well though. The fries were also good. I love handcut fries, so this was no exception. The cajun fries though, I will pass. I love cajun seasoning, but I felt like I was inside their shaker of cajun. It was SO overwhelming that it took away from the pleasantry of the fries.I don't know; my brother really enjoyed his burger and I take partial blame for not ordering my burger with cheese and other condiments to add flavor (I was trying to be healthier), but the burger shouldn't be flavorless alone! The fries are really great though (without the cajun drowning). So, I may take another stab at Five Guys - get a completely different burger and enjoy the fries..we'll see.
Two Hippie Beach House=Last night I was in the mood for a burger, but wanted to try someplace different.  Did a search on yelp, and found that Two Hippies just opened a location here in my hood!  I've heard such good things about them from thier Phoenix location that I had to give them a try.The place is small, but warmly decorated hippie style.  Family friendly, with plenty of games on the tables for adults and kids to play.  They have a nice menu of Breakfast items, Tacos, burgers and a few homemade desserts as well.The gal at the counter was wonderful! So friendly and helpful.  She checked on me to make sure my food was good throughout the meal.  I went with a hamburger, fries and a drink.  They seem to have an awesome lemonade selection here, but I stuck with a Sprite myself.I will be back in the future, as i was happy overall with the food and experience here.  Next time I will probably try the tacos.
The Great Greek=Who needs a Fat or Mad Greek when you can have a Great Greek. The Great Greek really does hit the nail on the head. What was so great about my meal? Everything, start to finish. It was a completely enjoyable experience. Dinner with fellow Yelpers, Judd and Lynn L., put this place on my bookmarks and it was about time to pay them a visit. With two other Greek food lovers in toe, we came out to try as much as possible. One Mezze Plate, Two Beef Slouvaki Plates, two fountain drink, one bottled water, Rice Pudding, a Baklava, and two secret Greek Coffees (explanation later on) cost a little under $50. There was even left over after I tried to cram as much in as possible. As I write, I lay in bed in a semi-comatose state. The Mezze Plate is a combination of vegetarian favorites; spanakopita, two dolmas, hummus, pita bread, tsaziki sauce, and two falafels. The puffed pastry was flaky, buttery, and filled with spinach and cheese. The falafels were crispy on the outside and light inside creating the perfect combination. The Slouvaki Plate boasted the most tender and juicy beef. They were drool worthy at medium rare and the juices oozed into the rice. Taste bud overload! With the second plate there is an option to pick between three different sides; rice, fries, and Greek salad. The gentleman behind the register gave us all salads on top of one rice and one order fries. The guest service is amazingly friendly. We were continuously checked upon during dinner as well. After our meal, one of my friends pushed me to ask about coffee. It is not listed on the menu, but it could not hurt to ask. The same guy who took our order made a joke that it was on their secret menu and it was no problem to make. Now to desserts! The Rice Pudding is thick and rich. The Baklava had great depth and not too sweet. They are definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in town. On the way out, we even got a warm farewell. Thorough is a good way to describe the service.I came late to the party because I didn't know Gyros could be this good!!I was so used to going to that other Gyro place on Eastern, but now I realized I settled for mediocre food there.Well Thank you Great Greek and my Yelpers for opening my eyes to what a Gyro should be. The presentation was wrapped in a pretty and neat package.Tender seasoned meat sliced perfect, with a tzatziki sauce that actually has taste (I always thought tzatziki was a bland yogurt sauce) and the freshest feta cheese, lettuce & tomato. Nice touch with the pepperocini on top to add a little zing. Bite then drizzle juice on the gyro. The bread was soft and allowed the gyro meat to shine without getting in the way. The perfect vessle to hold this delicious creation.OPA!! I can't wait to come back!Sadly, my knowledge of Greek food comes from My Big Fat Greek Wedding and a killer hangover from a few too many shots of cheap ouzo and pine sap Retsina to wash down "Greek" takeout in Hawaii. With those credentials to back me, here goes.  The Great Greek makes very good, tasty Greek food.  Simply put, proteins are juicy and properly cooked, breads are fresh, everything is flavored with fresh herbs and well seasoned.  Dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with rice dill and other herbs) a real surprise.  Dense, moist and herbaceous, the leaves so tender you can eat them.Lamb and beef gyro and grilled chicken gyro are real standout.  Juicy, well seasoned, sliced beef and lamb or chunks of chicken , atop simple veg, bathed in a zesty tzaziki, piled with a tart goat milk ricotta all enveloped by a fresh, warm, fluffy pita.Grilled steak souvlaki, no complaints.  Deeply flavored, juicy tenderloin on skewers over a fluffy rice pilaf.  A squeeze of fresh lemon to brighten up the dish.   Done.  Finally, desert; baklava.  What's not to love, flaky filo, butter, sugar, walnuts, cinnamon all bathed in honey.Friendly counter service.  Clean dining area.  Reasonable prices.Poker Pro Tip:  Give a bud who lives in the area a ride to the WSOP. On the way stop for lunch.  For days after "hey, you want me to stop at that Greek place and get you something?"  Heck yeah!Ponder if you must, is the food so good because it's different from our norm or is it the difference from its norm that makes it delicious?  It's all Greek to me.There are a lot of good Greek restaurants in Henderson.  From my house to this place is like climbing Mt. Olympus but it's soooo worth the drive.  Holy Michael Bolton, this is my favorite Greek restaurant in all the land!  It's a small but very clean restaurant.  This may be irrelevant to most people but for somebody who freaks out a lot when the battery on my phone is less than 90%,  the high top tables against the wall with outlets was a great plus! Oh yeah, the service is great too.  It's quick, to-go orders are quicker and phone-in orders are quickest.The steak souvlaki is tender and has great flavor.  It comes with Greek salad and you can get it with either rice pilaf or fries.  What I always get is the beef and lamb gyro and feta fries.  Soft and warm pita bread hugging slices of meat topped with melted feta cheese and tzatziki...underneath lettuce, tomatoes and red onions.  It's heavy yet portable and non-messy.  I can eat their gyro hot or cold.  Raw onions give me a headache but theirs is sliced rather than chopped so it's easy for me to just pick them out.  The feta fries are amazing.  Each fry is lightly breaded for that extra crisp.  Hot fries topped with feta cheese = cheesy goodness!"I'll be there someday, I can go the distanceI will find my way, if I can be strongI know ev'ry mile, will be worth my whileWhen I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong" - Michael BoltonI don't come to this side of town often, but as soon as I decided to meet my friend with the big fat greek appetite I knew we would be coming here.  Great Greek is certainly where it's at for gyros! A hearty portion of wonderfully flavored beef/lamb meat is sliced thick and surrounded by a warm fluffy pita (the kind you'd feel comfortable resting your head upon if you weren't ready to devour it) in this truly special gyro!  I'm not sure if I would bestow it with the title of best gyro in the valley, but it is certainly one of the best. ... add some Feta Fries and a Greek Salad if you brought your beast appetite... or just want to save some for later because both are great options here. I tried some of my friends Avgolemono Soup...another great addition!I haven't had the opportunity to try any of their other dishes, but I would order whatever I was in the mood for with confidence based on the quality of what I had.Came here for dinner the other night and I was glad to finally check this place out. Inside isn't huge, but it was clean and there was a girl constantly cleaning tables and the floor under them. The woman at the counter who took our order was nice and gave us a number to put on the table. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out, but the place was busy and they claimed to be making everything fresh so I didn't mind.I ordered a side "Classic Greek Salad" priced at $4.95 with house made Greek vinaigrette. The salad had crisp greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, kalamata olives (has pits...be careful!) and feta cheese. The salad tasted fresh and the dressing was delicious. The salad also came with some grilled pita bread that I put some cucumber and tomato on and folded it up to grub on. Yum! Hubby got a burger (said the patty seemed frozen) and made it a combo with "Feta Fries" for us to share. The fries were excellent! Especially dipped in some of their tzaziki. I will be back to try a gyro and baklava. They also have tables outside if eating inside isn't your thing or you can call ahead and place your order to-go. Ask about their family meal deals, they have a couple to choose from.This place should be renamed "cucumber heaven" in my opinion lol. I haven't had this type of food before so when I saw a lot of things with cucumber and tzaziki onthe menu I knew my order would be customised. The lady who took my order seemed friendly but she might need a q-tip because my order was eff-ed up. I ordered the Athenian Burger and when the lady said it had the tomatoes, salad, and cheese would all be mixed together in tzaziki I told her to leave all of that salad stuff off and just put feta cheese on my burger. The wait for my burger was long and that was okay but when you bring me a burger that is obviously a frozen patty and put the salad on it that I asked you to leave off something is wrong. I did say something but it would have been a 15 minute wait for a new burger so I just said I would take the salad mixture off of my burger and deal with it. The burger was terrible. Then I tried the Feta Fries that I ordered and hot damn they were good! The fries were great but the gross burger and my lack of taste for cucumbers will not bring me back here.It was my turn to pick lunch and The Great Greek had been on my bookmarks for a long time.  The location is small inside and seemed to be busy the entire time we were there.  There is also patio seating that will accommodate once the weather warms up a bit.  I had excellent service.  The gentleman helping us was very helpful since we told him it was our first time in.  I had ordered the grilled garlic shrimp plate.  It was accompanied with feta fries and pita bread.   Delicious!  There were 2 skewers of shrimp with 4 on each.   This was definitely plenty to fill my stomach.  Not to mention the outstanding fries.  This was my first time having these and I love feta cheese.  Yum.   My plate also came with a side salad which I didn't finish.  The dressing was a little bit much and overpowering.  But overall it was great.   I had asked the gentlemen if they had lemon potatoes since they weren't on the menu.   They do!  You just have to ask them to make them.  I might just have to go back soon to try those out! So the business name fits the review - Great Greek! Opa!I really don't know why I see so many 5 star reviews, where are people's taste buds? I think its because it's the most decent "Greek" you can find in Henderson. I got suckered into the hype but I have had way better. I called in an order for pick-up. The guy put me on hold but I hung up after hearing him chat the whole time with another customer about irrelevant stuff. Second time I called the guy took my order and I liked how fast he turned around my order, said it would be ready in 15 minutes. The restaurant is a bit small but it's really cute. It has an outdoor seating area with shades and a water fountain. The inside looks very clean and organized. I ordered two gyro sandwiches and a combo which comes drink and fries. The guy that took my order was a lot nicer in person and very cute I must say. When I got home I chowed down and it was satisfying but not out of this world. The amount of meat was good, how gyros should be, but it was not that marinated it was bland. The tzatziki sauce did not taste much like cucumber or the fresh dill it's described as but it had a lot of feta which made it taste better. The fries were ok.I want to give the greek bowl a chance. Place is convenient for Hendersonians but I rather drive and use my gas tank to Las Vegas and go to The Fat Greek on the corner of Flamingo and Decatur. My review is from 2011, check it out but my thoughts have not changed. Maybe I held my standards high for this place in comparison but I'll update this review if my mind changes.We came on a Thursday for lunch and ordered1. Athenian burger combo with fries, 7.50+2.95- Grilled Angus Beef, Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions, Feta Cheese, Tzaziki2. Great Greek gyro combo with rice, 7.95+2.95- Chicken or Lamb. Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions, Feta Cheese, Tzazikifor $23.08Side choices include: French Fries, Rice, Greek Salad, Avolemono Soup,Feta Fries (50c more)- Nice patio seating. Food delivered to us. - Wait time around 15 min. Fast food style but wait time like a dine in restaurant.- Big portioned burger. Fresh and crispy fries. - Packed Gyro. Lame rice.- Good taste. A bit pricey for what it's worth. Worth it for 1 try. - Hard to compete when there are so many around for about the same taste with coupons for cheaper. - Uncertain if I'd return.Two weeks ago on Tuesday evening 10/27th, my son and I participated in a search and rescue mission for the best gyros in Henderson. We may have found the place!The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill is located south of Sunset Station on Warm Springs at the corner of Julia Street, 1 block east of Stephanie.3 words describe this restaurant:*simply.**delicious.***Greek.Elegant outdoor patio dining was packed with people, so we went inside and ordered at the counter and sat down with our #10 sign awaiting our food that came out within 15 minutes or less. The Great Greek was definitely worth waiting for. This is certainly not fast food, although takeout and catering is available from this fine establishment.The seating area inside is about the size of a 2 car garage or 400SF and does not feel small at all. This A Graded restaurant has large mirrors intermittently placed along one entire wall that gives the illusion of more open space, very smart decorating idea!*Flowers and wall photos of Greece!**Pretty sounding Greek background music!***Cute little Greek statue on the front counter next to the Parthenon.****Wine offered by the glass or by the bottle. We enjoyed our sodas w/ Free refills! We also enjoyed our gyros, salad and baklava! Quite possibly the best gyros in Henderson, maybe even the Las Vegas Valley. The pita bread was soft, warm and fresh out of the oven, embracing a perfectly prepared combination of savory beef and lamb, mixed with fresh tomatoes, red onions and flavorful tzatziki sauce. Good size traditional gyro for $6.95.The $11.95 gyro plate offered a generous portion of tender sliced gyro on pita with a choice of rice pilaf or french fries. My son chose the french fries and they were also delicious. I want to come back and try their rice pilaf!I devoured their large classic Greek salad containing crisp Romaine hearts, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, Kalamata olives (watch the pits), Greek Feta, and a variety of fresh herbs. Decent size portion (large) at $7.95.No Great Greek restaurant patron should ever leave without trying their baklava.....amazingly delicious! Possibly the best I ever had besides homemade from Greek friends. This classic Greek dessert had layers of filo dough, walnuts and honey syrup. See photo below!  Honestly, I would come here for any of the above....a single trip in just for the gyro, just for the gyro plate, just for the Greek salad, just for the baklava......I also would come in here just to admire the very friendly ladies that work here who are very service oriented asking "How is everything?", "Can I get you anything?", Thank you for coming in!", "Please come back again!", etc. We will return soon for more delicious food and friendly hospitality :-)See 10 photos below...YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #244It's almost comical how often I've eaten their food without actually making a visit. Now that I have, it's time to review.My friend and I were going to try another Greek restaurant closer to my place, but they had already closed on Christmas Eve. Luckily, we had a plan B that was still open: Yelp and Las Vegas Weekly "Best of Las Vegas" darling The Great Greek.It's tougher than expected to reach it because whoever designed the plaza inexplicably didn't add enough entrances or even paths. Even though you can see the restaurant from Warm Springs, you'll have to make several turns to arrive at the parking area. It's welcoming enough once you finally enter, with indoor seating for around 20 and a TV with ESPNEWS in HD.The Great Greek Gyro ($7.95) with a beef and lamb mixture (or chicken if you really, truly must) is a solid lunch option. In addition to the tomatoes, red onions, and tzatziki of the "Traditional Gyro" ($6.95), this pita comes with lettuce and feta. I had experienced this in an assemble-it-yourself form many times with trays ordered for group events, and while it was certainly fresher and warmer at the restaurant, it still didn't truly tantalize my taste buds.That said, it's at least on par with if not better than any other recent gyro that I've experienced. And it's really cool that they cut it in advance per request so that I could share it with a friend.I also split one of the "traditional plate" menu items. The Grilled Garlic Shrimp ($12.95) has two skewers of four marinated shrimp a piece. The shrimp was cooked properly and had that juicy bite to it. I can't say that the stated garlic, and oregano were particularly prominent flavors, but I liked squeezing the lemon wedge for acidity. The pita was good, the tzatziki was fine, but... the fries.Specifically, the feta fries, which I think was a slight upcharge (maybe I'll back-calculate from credit card records) from the regular fries. But it was worth it for the rich feta and its creamier partner in crime. Sure, the fries alone are the fairly thick, floured kind that I enjoy the most, but do the feta fries if you can.There was also a small salad included in the plate, with a simple vinaigrette not really contributing as much as that ever-present feta. It's cool though. I mean, what are you doing here anyway if you don't like feta?I'll probably be back, but not in a huge hurry or anything. My first visit bore out my past perceptions that the food is really solid, but not the be-all and end-all of Greek cuisine.
Kyara Japanese Tapas=Excitement soon turned to disappointment after the first bite.  Everything we tried seemed more middle of the road flavor and we tried a lot of stuff.  Perhaps, I'm comparing the "wow" factor that I get from Ichiza, but Kyara isn't there, yet.  The only wow items were actually the two desserts.What we ate....1.  Daikon Salad - visually appealing but just tasted like it was dunked in regular soy sauce.2.  Maguro and Ume Madai sashimi - Not so fresh3.Maguro Yukke - Tasty because it was slathered with spicy ponzu concoction4.  Albacore w/Drew Special - Similar dish from what Naked Fish has to offer over there.  It has ponzu and jalapeno.  One of the better tasting dishes, but only because you can't go wrong with ponzu5.  (Sunomono) Abalone sashimi - fresh, but bad choice on our part.  Abalone sashimi is kinda crunchy.. hmmmm6.  Gyutan (beef tongue) - just a tad too salty7.  Beef tataki - ponzu sauce to save the day again8.  Spicy tuna and rice crackers - enjoyable crunchy texture with spicy/sweet tuna9.  Dashi Maki Tamago Yaki - Sweet egg omelet, meh10.  Age nasu - fried eggplant, meh11.  Deep fried skewered fish - fluffy fish, but i'm not sure about the cheese imbeded with it.DESSERT... wowsers1.  Vanilla Tofu Mousse - The tofu was so smooth and creamy and wasn't too sweet.  perfect compliment with the raspberry sorbet2.  Chocolate Fondant (a.k.a. Chocolate souffle) - The server failed to mention during the meal that this particular dessert takes 10-15 minutes to make.  Definitely remember to order before you're done with your main meal if you don't want to wait.  .... but.... WORTH THE WAIT!!  This rivals the best souffles out there!   Ooey gooey warm and sweet.Conclusion:  Through so many dishes, I couldn't help but feel that there was something missing.  I won't give up, yet, Kyara.  I know that you're trying to break out and do something different than your sister Naked Fish.  I hope you shine soon.Now this was the visit I was wanting from my previous visit.  Flavors were delicate, yummy and textures were there!  For the first time, I thought that the bomb items would naturally come from the "special" menu, but this time, we went with the gut feeling and ordered more instinctively from the main menu.  This time is was truly good.Bonus appetizer:*Deep fried yamaimo (Mountain Potato) - It was like eating delicate fries.  The potato had tempura batter and very lightly salted.  Crispy and delicious!*Albacore w/Drew Special and Tuna Carpaccio- I'm going to group this dish with the Tuna Carpaccio in terms of flavor.  Both had tangy sauce that complimented the tuna.                                *Agedashi Tofu - Kyara makes a slighty darker and saltier sauce, but I appreciated the delicately fried tofu cubes.*Eggplant Steak - This was on the saltier side, but I enjoyed it overall*Butabara - Bacon slices on a stick!!!!  Being the piggies that we are, we ordered one order each of the salt and soy sauce/terikyaki-ish versions.  I'm a lover of most things greasy and bacon. This was a winner and the soy sauce version was the overall winner of the two.*Kaisen Chawanmushi (steamed egg custard with seafood) - This was probably our favorite of the evening.  The steamed egg custard was perfectly salty infused with the essences of the seafood within it.  Slurped it all up.*Chicken Garlic Ponzu - This is basically a super tender pice of chicken cutlet with my fav flavors of garlic and ponzu.*Tori Meshi - soboro (seasoned ground chicken) with rice, hearty rice and seasoned chicken.  Good!Conclusion:  I am warming up to Kyara.  It's definitely not Raku caliber Japanese tapas, but it will do if you forget to make a reservation for Raku.With the sudden and sad departure of SHIN Yakitori House in the Spring Valley area, Kyara comes as a welcome addition in this neighborhood.Call it a cross between Ichiza and Raku, this town has plenty of room for another izakaya type of establishment and many hungry customers waiting in the wings.Kyara is located in an unassuming and relatively quiet area along Jones and Sunset next to a Tropical Smoothie Cafe.  The mood is set when you enter what feels like a upscale restaurant.  Chaos is not what this place is about.There are plenty of counter seats where you can watch the kitchen in action, but with the Baby in tow, we sat at a table. The restaurant is set up in sections making private parties a great possibility.Once we were seated, there was a slight lapse where we thought we had been forgotten. Instead, they were deep frying a fresh taste of their mountain potato to get your taste buds working.The menu is easily broken up with their daily specials being the star. It's very much a revolving menu as items available two months ago aren't offered now.Our dinner items:* Deep fried Yamaimo - This mountain potato was lightly fried with a sprinkling of furikake.  The delicate flavor surprisingly impressed us and had us wanting more of this complimentary offering.  As someone asked, was it gooey...and not at all!* Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad ($7.50) - Five slices of salmon along with greens makes this a tasty dish.  Assembled quite simply but satisfyingly.* Albacore Jalapeno ($7.50) - Seven slices of albacore that had a sauce that we enjoyed.* Spicy Tuna Dip ($5) - A generous ball of spicy tuna alongside crispy rice crackers.  We spread the tuna onto the cracker and enjoyed the crunch along with the spice.* Agedashi Tofu ($4.30) - Good, but not quite my favorite although I still enjoyed it.* Negi Ma ($1.90) - The chicken and green onion we chose to have sauce on it, our mistake.  Skip the sauce next time.* Enoki Bacon ($2.30) - Anything wrapped in bacon tastes good!* Kawa ($2.20) - Grilled chicken skin...a dash of salt and togorashi is all you need.* Butabara ($2.20) The pork belly was a rather disappointing since it was dried out and not fatty enough for me. * Daikon Salad ($4.20) - I'm not usually a fan of daikon salad but the simple additions to their version makes it a nice and subtle dish.* Gyutan ($5.50) - The beef tongue was good, but not as tender as I would have hoped.* Kaisen Chawanmushi ($5) - Their version of a steamed custard was the real winner of the night.  It was super super smooth and luxurious and probably among the best chawanmushis I have ever experienced.  It also came with a decent amount of seafood inside and the Husband and I were both thoroughly impressed.  Worth getting your own and not sharing.* Koro Steak ($9.50) - We were told it was quite tender and that is the very truth.  We both loved the steak, but could have done without the beansprouts...something else would have been better.* Soft Shell Crab Appetizer ($5.80) - My only real complaint was that it lacked something...a dipping sauce of maybe ponzu, tempura sauce, or Japanese mayo would have been nice.  But then again, maybe that's how I usually get it elsewhere and that's how I'm used to having it.* Tofu Mousse ($4.80) "Homemade Vanilla Tofu Mousse" - We're all about homemade tofu and definitely wanted to try their sweet version.  It was accompanied by a raspberry(?) sorbet-like granita that could have been broken down a bit more.  It arrived in chunks that made it   difficult to get into with the wooden spoons provided.  Nonetheless, we still enjoyed this sweet ending to our dinner.  Overall, it was a lovely Mother's Day dinner.  Service was polite and what you would expect from a real Japanese restaurant.  We were impressed by the number of Japanese diners there along with the families as well.  It brings a different ambiance and we liked it.  There are a few things that are a bit more costly than what I'd expect, so be prepared.  We'll be going back again to see what other specials come up!* * Update! We returned on 06.24.  Additional items we tried included:* Beef Tataki ($9.50) - * Homemade Tofu ($4.80) - We love the simplicity of homemade tofu.  Here it is accompanied with wasabi, bonito shavings, finely grated ginger, and scallions.* Tofu Miso Kushi ($1.50) - Three pieces on a skewer, grilled with some miso sauce.  Simple and tasty.* Wakasagi Age "Deep Fried Surf Smelt" ($4.50) * Ayu Shio Yaki "Grilled seasonal sweet fish from Japan" ($9.50) * Hirame Carpaccio "Halibut - South Korea" ($6.50)* Gyu Shabu Salad "Sliced Beef & Spinach" ($6.50)* Chocolate Fondant "Homemade Chocolate Fondant with Vanilla Ice Cream" ($6.50)We were offered a different complimentary taster, but we craved the deep fried yamaimo.  They were nice enough to fry us up a batch!  Love it! Dessert was free because it was the Husband's birthday! 4.5 stars from 4 stars!Without ever having been to Ichiza or Raku I can't say where Kyara fits in the hierarchy of Las Vegas izakayas. But, I can tell you that I'm a fan. Not only is the food delicious, but the layout of the restaurant is inviting yet intimate, with it's small, separate dining areas surrounding its open kitchen. The look of the place is that of a modern japanese motif without being heavyhanded and over-adorned with unnecessary flair.But, what you really want to hear about is the food, right? Here are the hits and misses that we ordered:HITS:+ Maguro carpaccio ($7.50) - brilliant, brightly colored tuna, thinly sliced. Wonderful flavors. So good we had a second order. Loved the garlic chips atop each slice of fish.+ Albacore with jalapeno ($7.50) - delicious, fresh. Another dish we had to order seconds of.+ Veggie spring rolls ($2.50) - light, crispy, not the largest spring rolls, but delicious nontheless+ Veggie tempura mix ($4.50)+ Cheese tempura ($6.50) - three slices of fairly mild cheeses (mozzarella, havarti, brie) accompanied by a fig jam. I liked it but it's a difficult dish to share if you want to split each piece of cheese.Misses: - Spicy tuna dip with rice crackers ($5) - not my favorite. I wasn't a fan of the paste-like texture of the tuna and it had little heat to it.- Pork belly ($2.20) - 3 per skewer. They were ok, but after having the pork belly at Sushi House Goyemon a couple days earlier I was disappointed. The biggest turnoff was the tiny bits of cartilage in two of the pieces of pork.I thought everything was reasonably priced. Expect to pay anywhere from $20-40 per person depending on how hungry you are. And, they have some good wines by the glass for around $5. That's tough to beat in this town. Good food + good prices = I'll be back often.If you want to travel in style, hang out with royalty!My last minute Kyara UYE gave me the opportunity to dine with Kyara's duchess, Debbie N.  We sat at the bar, where we could see a clean and active kitchen, and a nice view of the small establishment.  While waiting for Debbie I ordered "iced green tea" and ended up with a can of  green tea over ice - fine, but probably not worth $2.50.  The rest of the experience was well worth the cost, which was very fair for what we ate!We started off by ordering homemade tofu, which I was hopeful for after reading David S.'s review, but they were out.  We got the rice crackers with kabocha dip.  It was sweet and velvety.  Debbie sensed a vanilla flavor, and it was topped with chopped peanuts.  Next, the agedashi nasu (eggplant) topped with shishito pepper.  I loved the broth, and the eggplant was only lightly fried.  The broth was so flavorful!Then, the magical yuzu chili salmon.  Delicious!  Debbie N. loves salmon so I made sure she got more, and I ate more of the greens in the yuzu dressing.  Delightful!  Then my pick, the seared mackerel with ginger, daikon and ponzu.  It had a grill/smoky flavor but yet the perfect cross between firm and delicate texture that I love about mackerel.  This was a winner and the portion was very generous.  The man next to us was the Kaeru Kid, a west-coast travel writer who had been all over the world.  He let us sample his tofu steak with bean sprout dish, and it was hearty!!!Debbie N. said I must try the kaisen chawanmushi since I never had it.  It was so delicious!  It had a sort of egg-drop flavor to me, but the texture was unique and it was so full of seafood - bay scallops, shrimp, kamaboko fish cake, oyster or mussel, calamari...wow!We decided to get one more dish.  Our waitress had sang the praises of the beef tongue stew and said it was on special tonight, so we opted for it...only to find out it was sold out too!!!  Two strikeouts for us.  We decided to get the soft shell crab appetizer and it came with ponzu.  We missed Teri C. here by 4 hours apparently, and Debbie mentioned how the restaurant must pay attention to reviews and make changes (like adding a sauce to the crab as Teri C. suggested).  Two of the chefs behind the counter recognized Debbie and greeted her personally.  I like the atmosphere, the prices are very reasonable, and there are a lot of unique options to try.  We didn't try any skewers this trip, so I need to return for some of those.  We leisurely dined and relaxed for two hours, and our waitress brought me water when my can of tea ran out.  Good service, lots of yelling irrashaimase and gozaimas as people are in and out, and the food speaks for itself!By far the nicest setting for an izakaya in town. So cool how everything is set up. We took a couple of seats at the bar to watch the chefs do their magic while we ate.Definitely over-ordered based on our initial excitement over the menu choices and prices but no big deal. Stand outs included the best chawamushi in LV, yuzu chili salmon and grilled squid. The only thing we weren't into was the ika no shiokara (fermented squid guts). I never liked that dish but even my Japanese wife who normally likes it thought it was too creamy and a bit off. Aside from that, the whole dining experience was great. The staff was super friendly, very helpful and accommodating. Just what you'd expect from a high end izakaya!**Summary**       - Flavor - Everything we had was either good or great. It was definitely a treat for the taste buds.       - Authentic - From the decor to the staff to the food, this is truly an authentic Japanese Izakaya place.       - Skewers - The sauce they use for the skewers is phenomenal. If you sit at the bar you can see them watch over the skewers the whole time. They take care to cook them perfectly.       - Value - You'll probably pay more here than getting a bento box elsewhere, but the portion size and flavor is well worth the price.       - Ichiza - I finally found a place closer to my house that's like Ichiza but better. Now, if only they had honey toast, I'd never have to go to Ichiza again.**Appetizers**       - $7.50 Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad - Five pieces of slightly seared salmon with arugula on the side. Salmon was fresh, texture was great, and the sauce gave it a little kick. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=IoNSnP5EADvdByH5lc0Okg).       - $3.50 Garlic Potato - An interesting dish. Simple and good (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=5SVXlhiZh5wVmGDmIkbIQw).       - $3.80 Ikageso - Fried squid legs. If you like squid, it's pretty good. If you're expecting calamari, you might be disappointed.       - $5.50 Gyutan - 6 thin slices of beef tongue. It's ok, but a little pricy for the amount you get (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=KTEPF6K1bZ2ettteQdBPug).**Skewers**       - $1.90 Shoniku - Chicken thigh & leg skewer. The sauce they use for this was awesome. A must try (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=NEgW0jgTSRdEKcLsyZaiaw).       - $1.90 Negi Ma - Chicken with onion skewer. I preferred the shoniku (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=XEcS2FIyQQh0N-oZ0iJQbw).       - $2.20 Butabara - Pork belly. It has just the right amount of pork to fat ratio.       - $1.90 Sunagimo - Chicken Gizzard skewer. The gf said this was good. I don't really like gizzards.**Mini Meals**       - $5.00 Tori Meshi - Seasoned ground chicken on rice. Wasn't enough chicken. Nothing special.       - $6.50 Maguro Zuke Don - Marinated tuna and rice. The marinade on the pieces of tuna sashimi was fantastic. You get about 7 pieces. They give you too much rice though.       - $3.50 Mini Udon - A pretty decent sized portion for the price. The udon broth is better than most places (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=RMx6mzBzs9eaE6ljMWJEPQ).       - $9.50 Koro Steak - A hefty portion of bite sized steak (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=2y854wHXS3PICcqGLHVOcA).**Misc**       - $5.00 Chawan Mushi - Steamed egg custard (with shrimp, scallops, squid, and clams). It's pretty hard to find in Vegas. The only other place in Vegas I've seen it is at Ichiza. The one they serve here is better and they put a lot more seafood in it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=WEMCUr8IfnhZjTl91hYI-Q).       - $6.50 Yamaimo Teppan - I expected deep fried potatoes and got potato paste. Needless to say, it wasn't good and pretty salty.       - $6.50 Chocolate Fondant - Chocolate Souffle with a size of ice cream. Takes 15 minutes to make and is well worth it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=nmJILyCSEzADl7xQzVmmEA).**Recommendations**       - I'd recommend this place for anyone looking to treat themselves to some delicious non-sushi Japanese.It took a few visits, but once Kyara grew on me, it's become a favorite!  Every time I eat here I try something new that I really enjoy.  Which is more than I can say about that other place that starts with an "I."  In-N-Out?  Island Style?  Anyways.  Point is, it's rare to visit a place multiple times and discover a great dish during each visit.  So what are the hits at Kyara?Curry rice with Chicken Katsu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=87dospmcjfGzayBR-YnztQ): This is one of the lunch specials, and makes me wish I worked nearby!  The curry has a great balance of heat and flavor, while the katsu is lightly breaded and not burnt at all.  Highly recommended if you're in the area.Garlic Chicken Ponzu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=80gTRDZO6f20tLoWDYQY7w): At $5.80, this is a great portion for a tapas place if you ask me.  Garlic is delicious, ponzu is delicious, put them together and it's double delicious.Aburi Shime Saba: Seared Mackerel with yuzu ponzu sauce.  Mmm mmm good!  You get a good serving of mackerel with this dish.  It's also very lightly seared.  Like maybe the chef prepared the dish within view of a flame; that lightly seared.Tsukune: Ground Chicken and pork skewer.  Tasty and freshly prepared.  A bit crisp on the outside with a hot and juicy interior.  Service here has been consistently good, along with food quality.  If you're headed to Kyara, be sure to invite me along!Excellent little tucked away corner of Japanese styled paradise. The bill tends to add up as you're tempted by low prices and a variety of tasty treats so be sure to take advantage of any specials or deals they have going on. Aburi Shime SabaSeared Mackerel with yuzu ponzu sauce  - Absolutely amazing the natural flavors of the mackerel that's been lightly touched by a blue flame then served with a side of tangy ponzu sauce. Absolutely amazing Chicken Garlic PonzuStir fried chicken with Garlic Ponzu - When Anthony M recommended this i wondered why. Who goes to a Japanese place and gets stir-fried chicken?? Holy Moley  this breast is divinity served with am amazing sauce. The chicken breast is still juicy and tender while the dry rub and garlic ponzu sauce just kick it up a few notches. NICE! Salmon Ikura DonSalmon and Ikura (Salmon raw) on bowl of rice - Our waitress put this order in when all i wanted was a salmon rice ball. In the end i just decided to eat it anyway seeing as i was a bit hungry that night. Not exactly what i ordered but hell i didnt complain. Only thing i can point out is based on personal preference, would have been nice of the salmon slices were chilled a bit more.SKEWERS!!Negi MaChicken Meat with Onion- Think it's hunks of breast meat but man when you bite into that grilled onion wooo makes it all worth it.SasamiChicken breast- Very nice, nicely seasoned with a bit of salt but grilled to perfection. Still juicy on the inside and perfectly tender. KawaChicken skin - Good thing Tony T was also with us to point out a few techniques and methods. According to him the chicken skins had the fat rendered out so it's just all skin. If you're going to order this be sure to get it sauced (Shio). Sauced makes it so much better than salted.TsukuneGround Chicken and pork (Tare/Shio) - Ground meat reformed on a stick! Good stuff couldnt identify what kind of herb was used to add additional flavor but sure glad they did it. Anything Wrapped in Bacon- The asparagus wrapped in bacon was good. Very high quality bacon they use and they sure know how to grill it. Perfectly cooked and nice and crispy. The bacon wrapped Enoki mushrooms on the other hand was perfect. ShishitoJapanese pepper - If you havent had these yet give them a try. Wonderful flavor and Jin C's favorite. Who else orders 6 skewers?!Depending on your perspective, Kyara is either the poor man's Raku or the rich man's Ichiza when it comes to Japanese izakayas in Las Vegas.    With Raku, there are potential issues with time constraints and difficulty in making reservations on short notice along with the hefty bill whereas with Ichiza, it is always crowded/noisy and service can be shoddy along with variations in quality across the spectrum of items offered.  The dining experience here is laid back and refined, prices are reasonable (and even a steal if you come during happy hour), and the food is consistently delicious and served with impeccable timing.  Having recently gone with 3 friends visiting from out of town, we were able to explore a wide spectrum of the menu, and I was very impressed with the range of offerings as well as the consistency in flavors.   Some notable highlights include the following:Yuzu chili salmon salad- fresh thin slices of salmon sashimi drizzled in a yuzu vinaigrette, the slightest dollop of japanese mayo and ring of jalapeno served alongside a well-dressed bed of arugula, a nice combo of punchy bold flavors that do not overpower the palate.  Ika Geso Age (Deep fried squid tentacles)-  flash fried tender morsels dredged with the slightest bit of batter served immediately out of the deep fryer; add a fresh squeeze of lemon, and you may not ever crave (Italian)calamari ever again.Chicken Karaage (japanese fried chicken)-  an izakaya staple, the most common slip-up is that the chicken is overcooked or under-seasoned, but both pitfalls were avoided so I was unduly impressedSeafood chawanmushi-  velvety egg custard intertwined with fresh scallops and shrimp, you will want to get your own cup to savor every bite all to yourself without sharing.Motsu Ni (pork intestine stew)-  the wild card order that was offal-ly good.  Unctuous simmered broth with tender strands of intestine, nice cubes of yam cake, a wonderful warm soup for a cold day.Yamaimo Teppan (mountain yam on hot plate)-  a sure crowd pleaser both in terms of presentation and taste;  a thin bed of grated mountain yam served on a hotplate covered with bonito shavings and seaweed, it's fun to see the bonito curling in the heat as though the dish were alive, and one is also given a long spoon to scrape the yam off from the hot plate.  The best way I can describe the beautiful synergy of textures is akin to biting into an omelette, grilled cheese sandwich and mashed potatoes all at the same time...culinary magic.Other notables include the seared mackerel, grilled squid, and chicken garlic ponzu, and other yelpers have complimented their dessert selection as well.  Perhaps the only criticism may be that some dishes were a bit on the saltier side, but I think this may be intentional since much like the salty American bar staples of hot wings and nachos, these Japanese pub offerings are all meant to be enjoyed with ice cold beer, sake, or even single malt Japanese whiskey alongside the company of good friends.Solid izakaya.  Good food, reasonable prices, with just the right amount of  culinary weirdness to remind you this is Vegas.As a fellow yeep stated, "Kyara is either he poor man's Raku or the rich man's Ichiza"  So true.  Dishes do not deliver the authenticity or finesse of Raku but nor do the prices.  A good thing for the izakaya noob.For starters, top props to the spicy tuna dip served with rice crackers.  Clean tuna flavor without the cloying mayo.  Great textural contrast when eaten on the rice crackers.  Other sashimi dishes are less successful, swimming in sauces that quickly "cooks" the fish (ceviche) and overpowers the subtle fish flavors.  Deep fried items deliver great flavor but do not order too many at once.  Maybe it was busy on my visits but the oil is not hot enough, so the food gets soggy fast.  Items with cheese; yes cheese, take on a very greasy, cloying mouth feel.  Not good eats. Stick to simple items.  The squid tentacles are absolutely delicious.  Ranging from tender to tough with a salty finish.  The gobo chips simple and earthy.Finally, skewered and grilled items are all very good and averaging $2 a skewer, dirt cheap.  Chicken and pork options moist, veg barely cooked exuding freshness, both with a delicious hibachi char.  Great tasting marinades and sauces that give them all a flavor punch deserving of any beer.  The enoki clusters wrapped in bacon is a must try. Special note:  Yamaimo is offered in many preparations on the menu.  If you have never tried it before, it is very challenging texturally.  Slimy and starchy.  You either like it or you don't.  Just sayin.Friendly and efficient service.  Very reasonable prices.Had this placed bookmarked for months & my experience today w/ my bf was a complete disaster. First, when we walked in, it took awhile for anyone to acknowledge us because there was no hostess at the wait area. Finally, when a server did, she said that it'll be a a few minutes. We basically stood up the whole time since the small couch was occupied by 2 people and there was no way we can squeeze in.  12-15 minutes later, we were finally able to sit down. Walking in the dining area, i noticed there was plenty of seats at the bar area and she didnt bother offering that to us. We went there around noon-ish for the lunch special. I ordered the Salmon Miso combo and my bf ordered the Spicy Salmon bowl combo. When they brought out the entrees, they forgot to bring out my Salmon Miso entree and the waitress stated "it will be ready in a few minutes." First of all, why would you bring food when one of them is not ready??...6 minutes goes by until i can finally catch someone's attention (only 2 waitresses working there at the time). My bf had to start eating his food without me. When i asked her, "where's my salmon?" She said, "oh, i'll get it right now"...So basically, my salmon was ready & she totally forgot about it.When we saw my bf's Spicy Salmon bowl combo, we were totally shocked at what it looked like. We thought they made a mistake. It looked like grounded up bright orange paste (i thought it was pureed smelt egg for a second). The bowl was 90% rice, 10% fish. My bf stated "it's more mild than spicy and all i can taste is rice). My salmon miso was good, miso soup was ok and veggie tempura was typical. The waitress assured us the food was the spicy salmon.The 2 waitresses that interchangeably served us never once checked on us. I have to keep flagging them down to even get their attention. We were both still starving after our meals. It looked plenty but it wasnt satisfying. For the price, I was happier and fuller with a bento box at Sumo sushi. I asked for a check and waited about 8 minutes. Finally, i had to flag the OTHER waitress down to bring me my check. When i gave her my credit card, she stated "oh, our POS service is down. We have to make a carbon copy of your card." Really??? That was just the icing on the cake. She noticed my bf and I did not look happy. She asked us if our food was ok. I was happy with my Salmon Miso but told her about my bf's Spicy Salmon bowl. My bf told her he was expecting it to actually look like a fish, kind of like the same form as my Salmon Miso. The waitress then stated "Oh, the other waitress FORGOT to tell you it was RAW". They didnt bother stating it was raw on the menu, yet alone explained it to us!!! My bf expressed his unhappiness with his food and all she can say was "I'm sorry".The waitress, (one of their names was Yumi) didnt bother giving us a discount, yet alone comp my bf's entree. What kind of place does not state or even write that a particular entree is raw??? Some people do not like raw fish. I told my bf, "maybe the food will be better for dinner", but he was so turned off that he stated, "I dont ever want to come back here." Service makes a huge difference as well! I had such high hopes due to the glowing yelp reviews!!!Kyara has been on my to try list for awhile and tonight was the night I got the chance to go.  Having read many of the reviews from friends, I had some good tips to follow when dining here.I sat at the sushi bar a place I like because it's always fun to watch the chefs working their magic and you see a kitchen at work.I started by ordering three items, Gobo chips (fried burdock root), Iko Geso Age (deep fried squid tentacles), and Enoki with bacon (thin Japanese mushrooms wrapped in bacon and grilled on a skewer.)  The Gobo chips reminded me of very thin French fries with a bit different texture and a different flavor.  It's the root of the burdock so it has some of the flavor from where it grew.  The seasoning on the Gobo was excellent.Iko Geso Age, deep fried squid tentacles, were uniformly cooked and seasoned with some salt.  The squid was very flavorful and almost every bite was tender.Next was the enoki with bacon.  I think most people have seen enoki, either on TV or in the produce section of a market.  Enoki is a very thin stemmed mushroom, white in color, and in this preparation, a number of the mushrooms are gathered together something like a sheaf of wheat and carefully held together by being wrapped by the bacon and placed on a skewer.  It's then grilled.  It is a very tasty dish!This is what I like about tapas style restaurants, I've eaten three dishes, well actually four, and I still have room to try one more thing.  I asked about their mountain potato on a hot plate.  One of the chefs explained to me that it might not be pleasant to my palate that it was slimy and it had a taste that you either loved or hated at first bite.  He also said the dish was too much for one person in size.  OK, next time I go, I have to go with a group of Yelp friends.  Instead, I ordered a butabara (pork belly)  skewer with salt.  They'll do it unsalted, salted, or with salt on the side.  What tasty pork!  This is reason to return although there' still so much to explore on the menu.I mention and extra dish but didn't explain it.  When you check in on Yelp, it brings up a screen that gives you a free appetizer.  It was small and had some fish and other items.  It was a good starter and a nice perk for a check in.Dinner wouldn't be complete without dessert.  I've had my share of chocolate recently, so I went with the green tea waffle dessert.  You get two waffles, vanilla ice cream, and two small containers--one with warm honey and one with melted butter.  I used a bit of the butter and only a small amount of the honey.  The dessert was very good.  And as one person's review stated, it is very filling.Service was great.  I was there when Kyara opened so there wasn't a crowd there.  I was served twice by one of two servers and I received some of the other dishes over the bar from one of the chefs.  They allowed me to stand and peer over the side of the counter so I could see them making sushi and one of the chefs was trying a new dressing for a salad.  Dinner was very tasty, service was excellent, and I will be back.It's sad that I didn't give Kyara a try earlier, as it is merely a few minutes from where I live. Japanese Tapas has always been a little intimidating to me, as I don't really know what I'm ordering a lot of the time. I've been missing out -The food at Kyara is excellent, as far as I can tell. There is time and effort put into a lot of their dishes, along with quality ingredients. I've now tried nearly a dozen of their different items, though there are still many more to be tried. My favorite at this point was a simple chicken and rice bowl called Tori Meshi. Uncomplicated to say the least, but still very delicious.The Chicken Garlic Ponzu is also truly tasty. It has strong flavors that jump out at you, but is unique enough that it is intriguing. Another excellent dish was the Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad. The salmon is very lightly seared and the texture of the dish is amazing, as well as the presentation.Some other highlights so far have been the deep fried cheese, which while straight forward, was tasty and had some nice variety of cheese. Their pork belly skewer is average, while the Negi Ma (chicken and green onion)  skewer was very tasty. The sasami (chicken breast) was not as good, as it really was just a piece of chicken on a skewer. I also tried the bacon mochi skewer, which, while interesting, wasn't necessarily that strong of a combination.I would probably pass on the potato salad, which really was just that, and the Niku Jaga was good but also just seemed like sukiyaki. Still, there are many dishes that I would like to try.It is definitely worth noting that their desserts are extremely good and priced very cheaply, in my opinion. The Yuzu Fromage Mousse is really quite amazing, as is the Green Tea Waffle, which is enough for 3-4 people and only costs around 5 dollars.Service here is a little on the slow side, which is really my only knock on the place. A table was ready and we were asked to sit for a good 5 minutes for no real reason other than they had some trouble keeping up with the crowd. I'm not sure if that's a normal situation, or if they are short one or two servers during the busy hours.All in all, Kyara is a very good and reasonably priced option for those desiring to try a multitude of Japanese-influenced flavors, and I see myself returning here many times for it's convenience to my location as well as its excellent food.The best 4 star place I know of, Kyara has plethora of great items...really, really great items!What they are:One of the best options in town for Japanese Tapas / Izakaya.What they aren't:The best sushi spot in the southwestA high-end Izakaya joint...although the value you get here is something special!My favorites include:Yuzu Chili Salmon w/ ArugulaCabbage Ra-Yu--this is one of the tastiest raw cabbage dishes I've encountered!Inaniwa UdonHealthy Kushi Mori (Bonus tip--we always keep the Ra-Yu oil left over from the cabbage and used it to dress these veggies.)I always make a point to check out their monthly specials as many of these items have been quite good.  They recently had a Tomato Nabe that was UNBELIEVABLY GOOD!  Another of my favorites was a Stuffed Shishito Pepper they were doing for a while.Lots of friends are really into their lunch specials, but I don't ever make it in for lunch.  I am all about their small plates and skewers! I wouldn't argue with anyone that wanted to give Kyara 5 stars.  I just think that they are not as good as it gets on multiple items that they serve.In closing, please note that Japan has over 50,000 people who are over 100years old...widespread debate abounds as to the reason why.  Most assume that it is due to the use of toilet slippers to keep the rest of the house clean. Others point to Kancho on the playground, KFC on Christmas Eve, Yaeba, or Inemuri.  I have scientifically eliminated these ideas and narrowed it down to two possibilities: Soine-ya & Hadaka Matsuri.  I'll let you come up with your own conclusion though.Kyara is a pretty awesome restaurant. Over the years of attending this place, there has been a consistently solid experience from a service, food, and ambiance standpoint. I would chose this spot over any other yakitori in the valley (still haven't tried Raku). I personally like the location of Kyara. Sometimes, SMR can get overwhelming. That's why I like being away from the hustle and the bustle, occasionally. The inside is small, but very intimate, with lots of Japanese aesthetics going from wall to wall. The open kitchen is immaculate, and due to great ventilation, you can hardly smell the meat wafting through the air.The main reason to come here is for the yakitori, or "meat on a stick". But not really because they also have a wide variety of items that they skewer, such as, vegetables, poultry, seafood, etc. I think what separates this place from other similar locations is due to the smokiness of the cooked items. Kyara does a great job of imparting that flavor onto them. They use high quality and fresh items, and you can really tell while savoring the food. They also carry other items such as appetizers and entrees, which most of them are very good as well. I particularly like the takoyaki balls.One of my favorite spots, I like about 90% of the things I've enjoyed here. I think the skewers are a good deal, but, I do hope they bring back their $1 skewer nights, that was the shiznit! This spot gets 4.5 stars from me.
Jimichael's Restaurant=THE BEST: Fish Fry in the Phoenix Metro Area;Consistently Great,Reasonable,worth the trip! DrSJC outstanding
Divine Cafe & Market at Optima=I want to love this place, I reeeeeally really do. My boyfriend lives in the Optima so when I saw this little cafe open up, with its little patio by the fountains, I had visions of warm evenings with a glass of wine & appetizers or grabbing a late night latte or cup of gelato. They even have a small market with a little produce, some personal products...even pet supplies! On paper, this place sounds awesome.However, Divine continues to disappoint me, my boyfriend & our friends...even though we all CONTINUE to give them chance after chance after chance. Sad face.I have worked in different restaurants for over five years. I understand a little of what it takes to make an establishment work. Customer service is HUGE. It is obvious to me that this place has no real management & barely any training for any of their staff. The service is so terrible. No one seems to know what they are doing. The employees are usually friendly, but totally, utterly clueless. Actually had to grab a bag of cat food this morning...apparently $18 for a small bag of food, according to the cashier. When we reconsidered (obviously), she said, "Ohhhh wait, well...how 'bout $6.50?"  WHAT? This is not the first time prices have been negotiated for something from their market.I have waited for a turkey sandwich for over half an hour. We waited for a pizza for an hour+...& while a man who I assume maybe was the owner? came out to apologize a few times, that was all he did. He seemed totally frazzled & out of it. They had three other tables in the restaurant at that time - COME ON. Most of the time they seem to be out of at least half of what is on their menu. I'm 99% sure their "soup" is canned Campbell's. Their hours vary...I think depending on when (or maybe if) someone decides to show up. We went by & thought they had finally closed up for good...but the next night it was open with someone playing live music? So confusing.I keep going back because their food isn't bad, once you get it. & they have an awesome selection of teas & a pretty nice wine list. & it is just so gosh darn convenient!I hate to be so negative about a place that has sooo much potential, but seriously. They need to get their shit together. I think their concept is a great idea, but Divine is just falling SO far short.
Pura Vida Bakery & Bystro=Finally! Somewhere in Las Vegas that I can get brunch, besides my own kitchen!  Now, I know what you're thinking: Jen - isn't brunch mainly an excuse to swig bloody Mary's and/or Mimosas and be drunk before 2pm? doesn't being vegan and not able to eat anything besides dry toast and fruit make that easier?  Well, yes.  You got me there.  But sometimes, I actually want a little protein or maybe a waffle too/instead.  Is that so much to ask? Apparently so.Until now.  I'm gonna be honest.  I had tried some of Chef Mayra's catered food before at events and had not been blown away.  They were fine, always just a bit bland.  Not so with the brunch! Fortunately I went with three friends, so we just got one of everything on the brunch menu and shared.  I'm usually not a big fan of sweet/carb-y breakfast food, but the waffles and french toast were outstanding.  OMFG, that chocolate waffle.  It was like the most delicate delicious brownie... I don't know if I could eat a whole one, but 1/4 was the perfect breakfast dessert.  I also loved the regular waffle and the sausage with peppers that came with the French toast! The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the breakfast burrito.  It was a bit cold, with unmelted Daiya cheese, and the flavor profile just didn't hit me right.  But the side of beans that came with ..... damn.  One of the best things I've tasted in awhile!  I admit I probably took more than my fair share... Great coffee, with lots of different flavors of coconut milk creamer.  And the ultimate in refreshment - citrus cucumber water. Yum.We had very attentive service, the chef even came out and spoke to us personally.  Our total bill for 4 with coffees, an entree and fancy waters was under $60.  We all left completely stuffed and quite happy.Can't wait to come back and try the lunch menu; if it's as good as my favorites on the brunch menu, I'll probably round this up to 5 stars.  So thrilled to have an organic, all vegan place that's close to home!Chile Relleno = BOMB. COMFirst off, let it be known that I am neither Vegan nor Vegetarian, so I'm a bit standoffish at dining in a restaurant whenever it's 100% vegetarian due to bad experiences in the past, but I have NO complaints about the food or service at Pura AT ALL. The food was VERY Delectable, Luscious & Flavorful, a great dining experience overall!. Will definitely be returning for breakfast or lunch in the near future.Thanks again Chef Mayra for the Culinary Orgasmic Experience!.As I stated in my Red Velvet Cafe review, I think it's essential for me to point out that I'm not Vegan, nor in my wildest or tamest dreams could I ever become Vegan.  My love for the flesh of cows, pigs and chickens rivals that of Romeo and Juliet, McAdams and Gosling, and Kim Kardashian and (insert current boyfriend here).  In seeing the great reviews for this place here and on John Curtas' blog, I was skeptical to say the least.  Upon seeing more and more pictures of the My Love burrito though, my skepticism began to fade, enough so that I decided to call in an order.I'd read here about the wait and their website made mention to give plenty of time for an order to be prepared, so I placed it accordingly and was told it'd be ready in 35 minutes.  The location isn't the greatest and neither is the parking lot for a parking challenged individual for myself.  The food came out from the kitchen right when I arrived (perfect timing!) and the woman running the front of the house graciously allowed me to try some of the flavored waters they had available that day.  Wasn't too crazy about any of those but got some blended tea drink they had that was tasty.Upon getting back to the office and finally getting a chance to see the food, it looked as remarkable as the pictures I'd seen of it online.  It was one of those things that I could almost tell was going to taste amazing before even having a bite, vegan cheese notwithstanding.   The following bites confirmed this, and the medley of tofu, beans, veggies, potatoes and yes, fear in my heart striking vegan cheese tasted blissful.  I wont get into my vegan cheese exploits of the past, but this experience erased those past experiences quickly.  The My Love burrito is quite simply the best vegan meal I've ever had, and I'd put it toe to toe against most meat filled burritos I've had.At $11, it's pricier than your average burrito, but then again this is no average burrito.What a unique cafe...Unless you've been here before, you don't know why. But it's true. Unique is the best word to describe it. So here's the rundown:- 100% vegan (animal-free)- 100% cruelty-free kitchen- All gluten-free options are prepared separately in their gluten-free kitchen area. So awesome!!!- GMO free, organic, & fair trade whenever available I know you meat-lovers & non-vegans out there are thinking. How can this food be delicious? It is. Trust me. In my quest for better health & attempt to be vegan (ok, I'm probably vegan 95% of the time, I can't lay off dairy! Err!) I am saddened by the fact that Pura Vida is not in my neighborhood. Far from it, but I still attempt to come whenever I can.What's on their menu? Waffles, French toast, pancakes, scrambles. Their newest items this week: PB + Banana + Chocolate + Raspberry Mini Pancakes. Or Cinnamon Walnut French Toast. In the mood for lunch? You can have sandwiches, quesadillas, create-your-own wraps, chili, & empanadas. They make daily bakery items, chocolate cakes, muffins, etc. I tried their chili, empanadas, & one of their gluten-free Latin'tude (posted pics). Yum :)Pros:Service - incredible. Their servers are very knowledgeable about the menu & will try to accommodate any dietary requests or allergies. Very friendly & helpful.Yumminess - I love the efforts they make to provide great tasting food, using organic whenever possible. They prove that you don't need to eat any animal products to have a fulfilling meal. Portions - huge! Took home leftovers every time!Cons:Location - not the most convenient wholesome neighborhood. I think Cheetah's is right down the street. I'm glad I'm here during daylight hours.Timeliness - this isn't fast food. It's good wholesome food made to order. They ask customers to give them 40 minutes for take-out orders, and it seems to be the same when you eat there. That's why they urge you to call in ahead of time. You could even call a day before (I can imagine most people can't plan that well like me, but I love that they offer the option) They will reserve a seat for you if you give them notice. They did for me, table for one.Price - good ingredients comes at a cost. Most complete meals are $11-18. I'm more than happy to pay for quality, but I understand some people want to spend less on breakfast or lunch. The portions are well worth your money, in my opinion. One dish has always lasted me for two sittings or more. And I don't know about you, but knowing you're eating a great healthy meal, feeling good about what you ate is worth the extra dollars. Consistency - availability changes daily. So do the specials. The gluten-free chocolate cake you got one day is not there the next time you visit. Bakery items sell out fast. They've informed me though that anything can be available if you call. You want vegan pumpkin pie? I called a couple days before Thanksgiving & they made it. Plus, she'll prepare it to any dietary specifications you want. Planning my next return to Pura Vida. Soon!Disclaimer: I am not a vegetarian or vegan. I love meat and I cannot deny my usual distaste for vegan eateries because of my experience with foods that lack of flavor and have strange textures. Having said that, the meal I had at Pure Vida today was one of the best and freshest lunches I have had in a long, long time!I read through their menu and website prior to arriving, so I was well aware that everything is prepared fresh and can take 30-45 minutes to prepare. No problem for me, because I enjoy long and quiet lunches. When I walked in, Cindy directed me to a table and gave me an abundance of information as well as about 5 different menus that had specials and drinks and other specials and lunch and breakfast and dessert, etc. I immediately ordered a lime-mint blended essential oils water ($3: NOTE: they no longer offer free refills as of Jan 13, 2013). It is free of sugar and home made and unbelievably refreshing! For food, I settled on the lunch special (a little pricey at $14.99, but it came with so much food that I cannot complain at all!) and chose a salad with creamy garlic dressing and the "My Love" burrito. The "salad" was a GIGANTIC plate of fresh veggies including spinach, sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, etc. and the dressing came on the side, which was great. About 20 minutes later (it wasn't very crowded), my burrito was served: sun dried tomatoes, cuban black beans, vegan cheese, spinach, roasted garlic potatoes, avocado, chipotle peppers. Let me tell you, it was one of the best burritos I have ever had (AND I LOVE MEAT, AND IT CONTAINED NO MEAT!). There was a little kick to it, but nothing that made my mouth burn or detracted from the wonderful flavors of the fresh veggies and toasted tortilla. If you aren't a vegetarian or vegan, who cares? Support this little gem because it supports chemical free, organic, healthy dining options that do NOT skimp in flavor or portion size. Absolutely wonderful. The ambiance is also very relaxing and peaceful. Cindy, my waitress, was extremely helpful and friendly and made me feel like we were old friends. She even gave me a sample of one of their apple cookies and made some recommendations for my next visit (which will likely be tomorrow, lol). I cannot recommend this place enough. It is my new favorite lunch spot!First of all, this is a generous 1 star only because there is no option for no stars.I have nothing to say about Pura Vida's food because we never got to try it since this supposed community-friendly small business would not serve us at 1:45 because their clock said 1:50 when their hours clearly state they close at 2 pm.Here's the story... my vegan friend is visiting so i bought the Groupon deal. On Saturday we planned to go for lunch and thankfully we called first and they said they close at 2. So on Sunday we tried to look at their menu online and were going to call in an order to pickup but their site had a bandwidth error message and so we could not see the menu.  As of right now you still can't see their website.So we drove all the way across town and arrived at 1:45. As soon as we walked in the woman called out while we were still standing in the doorway that they were closed with an obvious grateful tone to turn us away. We tried to explain that we had tried to come for two days and it was a special treat for my vegan friend. She carelessly dismissed everything we said saying that they take the last order at 1:45 and that it is "the policy of the kitchen because the food takes so long." We practically begged to be served by this place and the woman had no care in the world.  I wanted to talk to someone else in charge but then I thought why bother this woman obviously doesn't want our business. So, I told her I would NEVER come back and she is very bad for business. Of course she couldn't care less. As we left I was further annoyed as I noticed a flashing open sign in the window. UGH!Between my friend and I we have lived and worked in the service industry in Las Vegas, Miami, LA and Portland and have never experienced a small business having such audacity to turn away wold be happy customers. It was such a bad business move in these modern times of such high competition among businesses and the great opportunity for online reviews and word-of-mouth. Shame on you, Pura Vida.It seems this place has good reviews and good food, but we will never know since we refuse to go back. We are all in favor of supporting local businesses, I am a Las Vegas native. In Las Vegas where the competition against big corporations is so great. We should all be supporting our community establishments, but when they make it clear they do not need our business what are we to do? Dominos pizza got our money today, again, Pura Vida, shame on you.We will be refunding our Groupon and telling everyone we know to not bother going to Pura Vida before 1:45 pm, or ever.I got fooled by Yelp reviews!My boyfriend, his mom, and I had not only the WORST experience at this restaurant, but also the most UNCOMFORTABLE experience!We decided to dine here for breakfast when we saw the great reviews and noticed that the location was walking distance away from the outlet. We took a taxi from our hotel and arrived to the restaurant at 9:20 AM on Saturday. The restaurant looked closed. My boyfriend tried the door and it was locked. I decided to be resourceful and call the restaurant to see if they were open. (I wish I never made this call! We should've left and eaten elsewhere!) They answered and said they were open and had forgotten to unlock the doors.The restaurant looked dirty (typical whole-in-the-wall type of place). We were seated and menus were distributed. When we rummaged through 3 different menus, we were horrified at how haphazardly the items were placed and completely confused on how to even order. To make matters worst, the server tried to explain the menu to us - even more OVERWHELMING and EXHAUSTING! Items that had fruits and avocados listed will now only come with bananas since avocados and other fruits were "not in season" for the restaurant. Some items would take over 45 minutes and other items you can't even order unless you made a reservation ahead of time.Crap, we're stuck here. The taxi driver already left. So we decided to order a WOW, french toast with a side of WOW, and Tha' Waffle. However, we asked for the WOW to be made without potatoes (my boyfriend's mom is severely allergic). The server was completely confused on how to place the order. Apparently, the cook can't make that dish without the potatoes. So she suggested to order the items that come on that plate as a la carte. Fine, we ordered as a la carte. We were tired of looking at that puzzling menu.15 minutes later the "Chef" decides to come talk to us about how the WOW plate would be prepared. (Wait, she didn't even start on the food yet?) She said she wouldn't be replacing the potatoes for something else since the potatoes are the bed of the plate and everything else goes on top, but rather she would be removing the potatoes and adding extra bit of this and that. So she was trying to UP-SELL us because my boyfriend's mom is allergic to potatoes? My boyfriend had to clarify to her that we are not going to pay extra. We don't care if she adds more of whatever she wants or doesn't add anything at all, just take out the potatoes! She continued talking and moving her hands and flailing her arms trying to describe us the plate. She kept emphasizing how she WOULD NOT REPLACE the potatoes but would be REMOVING them and adding other stuff. What in the world? Does this person know what the word "replace" means?We say fine and she finally goes back to the kitchen. A table near us receives their food in a timely manner (15 minutes after ordering). We've been waiting 30 minutes now. The server says "THEIR FOOD CAME OUT FIRST BECAUSE THEY ORDERED YESTERDAY." What in the world?!?? After 45 minutes of this grueling wait, my boyfriend's mom's food comes out. The chef comes out, too! (Not again, stay in the kitchen please!) My boyfriend's mom is displeased and when the chef asks how her dish is, she says "So-so" (my boyfriend's mom's English is very limited, I'm surprised she didn't spit out what was in her mouth back on to the plate). Then the chef says, "All I want is a smile from her!" The audacity of this lady!!There was a yellow flower placed on top of her plate of food. She took the flower off the plate and placed it on the table. When my waffle came out a few minutes later, the chef came out again! Then she takes the flower off the table and places it on top of my waffle and says, "You get a flower too!" Is this place that cheap that they have to reuse garnishing?!??Overall, our experience was horrifying! I've never had vegan food before and if this is the best that a vegan restaurant can offer, then I can never be a vegan.If you still want to dine there, here are some tips:1. Order your food the day before you plan on actually eating it2. Be ready to wait for at least 45 minutes for your food if you didn't order yesterday3. Don't get an explanation of the menu4. Stay away from talking to the chefThe bill was $49 before tip - we ordered only three plates and no drinks. A little pricey for disgusting food and even worse service.TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.  Do not waste your time or money and...Possibly the meanest thing I can say about a local business in this city. I'm counting the days till this place goes out of business...and it will, here's why;- Disorganized; menu, kitchen, and staff.- Poor customer service.- Consistently poor customer experiences (Most of the 1 star reviews are consistent and accurate, I should have read them before)- Overpriced specialty menu.These people obviously have ZERO clue how to run a kitchen or a business. I don't know if they are out back harvesting the wheat and soybeans for their tofu but seriously, I could have birthed, raised, slaughtered, and cooked a cow in the time it takes them to make a goddamn waffle!We (2 of us) were the 3rd table sat. NO ONE had food. The other two tables had already placed their orders. We placed our order on what appeared to be a menu designed by epileptic 9 yr old with a sever case of Aspergers syndrome (note: As someone w/epilepsy, I find this menu design  VERY insulting).  We attempt to order Tha' Waffle and their  insanely overpriced breakfast burrito. 15 mins later 4th table fills, then eventual the remaining tables slowly fill.  25 mins later the 4th table gets all their food. The 3 original tables are still without. Some polite banter between us the waitress to see what the hold up is and never a clear response.The waitresses are now telling people who are slowly filing in that there is an hour wait and that, "we're closing at 2:00...that will only leave 15 mins, so don't bother waiting." (yes, this is an actual quote)  "They all just came at once" (which is total bullshit, I've been sitting here for over an hour.) At this point it had been an hour SINCE we placed our order. We walked out Went up the street to Omelet house. We were seated, orders placed, and served in 20 mins and spent $20. If I had actually paid for what we order, bill would have been about $32. running a vegetarian or vegan restaurant is not super expensive unless you are a complete f*ing moron.  If I could rate them on a CFM scale, 5 Stars!*le sigh* I really didn't want it to come to this because well, as a vegan there are very few places I can go to eat, but after disappointment after disappointment I'm sorry to say I will not be coming back to Pura Vida any time soon. This was my letter to Chef Mayra after the Titanic x Hindenburg disaster that was their Valentine's Day dinner. "I hate to say it but I am livid and a bit appalled after tonight's Valentine's dinner. We paid $75 for 15 courses; you gave up after 12, and a couple of the courses were thrown & plated together last minute instead of being the separate courses they were advertised as. When you pay for something, you should receive it. Not only were we denied the extra courses, but it took forever to get them - you asked us to come early and that dinner would be served 6-9 PM; the first course wasn't even served until 6:40 PM. We left at 10 PM (we had plans at 9:30 - oh well!) confused as to where the rest of the courses were. There was very little explanation or communication and definitely poor planning. As a vegan I was excited for this opportunity and have eaten at your establishment many times, as well as referred you to others, but this will most likely be my last time. My husband really wanted this year to be special, but it was a huge headache. If you do this next year I hope you severely edit the menu and the prices so everyone leaves satisfied and at the designated time. You knew how many people were coming well in advance and should have had a test run of some sort. The only semblance of apology came from your servers when the food was not being served in the beginning. My husband is now even complaining he's still hungry as we didn't eat earlier in the day to fit this event in! This is one of the worst of not the absolute worst restaurant experiences I have ever been privy to and I hope to never repeat this episode of Vegan Survivor ever again."I appreciate that everything is made ready-to-order, but when you're serving FIFTEEN courses to 40 guests who you asked to arrive early and did actually have a definitive ending time of 9 PM, you have to make sure it goes smoothly which it did not. My husband and I were starved for over an hour before the food started coming. We estimated our time of exit by how "quickly" the food was coming out and it should have ended past midnight! Completely awful. A bunch of people left (and I wish I were one of them), and I'm pretty sure every single person left unsatisfied. This establishment has absolutely 0 business acumen and it is going to hurt them. You don't even have to watch a couple episodes of Kitchen Nightmares to realize Pura Vida is doing it wrong. If you have to come out and explain every menu item as well as feel the need to put pictures of the food in the convoluted menu, as a diner you should run immediately. Now I was going to give Pura Vida the benefit of the doubt since they did email the patrons and offered the rest of the courses, we just had to email & give the time we're coming in. Which my husband did. And apparently he had to confirm back which was not explained whatsoever. So he is currently at Pura Vida waiting for them to make the final meal we will enjoy from there. I sincerely wish Chef Mayra luck (she's going to need it!) but I will not be back. P.S. To the servers - good luck, you were the best part of the place, always trying to make it work when you are as confused as the customer, and I hope she supplies plenty of aspirin for the hourly headaches you have to have from working there.I like to eat at Pura and I bring all my non vegan friends/family all the time... I don't mind the 1 hour wait for the food... I even think the waitresses are nice.   I want to support a restaurant that is cruelty free.But something happened today when i went to eat there... I ordered pancakes, and the table next to me ordered pancakes too.  Now, I was there before that table sat down and ordered.  So i'm waiting very patiently for my food ( i am waiting an hour)  when finally the waitress put my pancakes on my table.  As soon as I was gonna dig in, the other waitress comes and takes it off my table and says it's for the table next to me.  My waitress asked me if I had that same order and i said yes.  She then came back to tell me that since a kid ordered pancakes.. they want to get food out to the kids first.  I just thought that was the stupidest reason ever!!! I was like WTF.  What restaurant does that?  I don't care who ordered pancakes... i ordered first!  I'm grouchy when I'm hungry :)  (Imagine waiting an hour for your food, only to have the table next you who order after you.. get your food)   This just turned me off!!!!!!!!!!!!!I don't know what to say about this incident.  I think I'm going to take a break from Pura for awhile. :(This place is pretty awful. The decor is all over the place. Random crap on the ways, pictures of turkeys, bad pics of what I presume is the chefs mom, and a weird slide show on a random monitor. Four or five really unorganized menus that are explained to every detail. Many items are unavailable or don't have all the ingredients. Food takes forever to get to the table and when it did it was cold. I got the tofu scramble which comes with cheesy potatoes, sausage, and random cucumbers.  I have never heard of cucumbers with food that is supposed to be hot. Anyway, as I said before the food arrived cold. The potatoes and sausage were cold and not to mention the sausage tasted like rubber. The hold plate looked like they just threw everything on the plate. No technique and no real concept of an actual meal.  I could only manage a few bites until I had to tell the waitress that the food was cold and quite frankly, not very good. Before taking it back she mentions the window might have made it cold. This shit was cold when it arrived.  I've eaten vegan food plenty of times and this place is no where the other places I've been.  I eat at Native Foods in Southern California often. Their food has never been cold even when I'm actually outside.But I digress, the chef comes out and makes some passive aggressive comment about the window.  Bitch it has nothing to do with the damn window.  She tells me," everyone else loves that meal. Next time I see your face I will make sure I cook your food at a 160 degrees and bring it right out to you." She continues with excuses like I don't know shit about food. She says," we don't use a microwave and the food gets cold at the pass."  A few minutes later she brings my girlfriend's food at and says some other bullshit as she sets it down," let me make sure it's out of the way of the window." It's not the window!! You gave me cold ass food which was also disgusting. The food is all over the place. Well I know I will never be back. The food was shit and as soon as I let them know that I was served bad/cold food the service became bad as well.I wish this place would was chosen for Gordon Ramsey's kitchen nightmares. He is the only who could save that place.I strongly advise against going there.Recap: pretty bad quality, unorganized menus and way too expensive.Just don't go there.Here's a list of things I could hypothetically do in the amount of time it takes Pura Vida to make lunch:- Read a few books on the subject of restaurant ownership- Build an organic  farm in my backyard- Grow an entire crop of fruits and vegetables- Learn to cook an entire menu's worth of vegetarian recipes- Get a restaurant business license- Get a small business loan and lease a suitable property- Grow a full, luxurious beardI had a lunch reservation at 1:45. At 2:30 they called me up to tell me that they could not have my food ready until 3:15. I ordered a quesadilla and some soup, not The Great Pyramids of Egypt. Instead of apologizing for wasting my time, the chef immediately got defensive and indignant with me. The whole restaurant got to watch a soap opera moment unfold as she blamed her employee for poor time management, then she blamed me for not being flexible. Dinner and a show! I do not recommend you to go to Pura Vida Bakery & Bystro.Very poor customer service!Went to try with the family after hearing a lot of good things about the food.  We arrived exactly an hour before they closed and after waiting a few minutes(although we were seen by employees upon entry) at the front were asked if we had a reservation by someone running helplessly back and forth behind the counter.  We replied  that we did not and she stated that they would not be able to serve us then because they were " way backed up and would be closing in a few minutes" (even though we were there an hour before listed closing and there were at least five tables open).  We advised the lady that we had a Groupon that was expiring that day and maybe we could use it for take out or at least the bakery.  She declined but did inform us that THEY would still allow us to use it for the original value we paid.  I told her that this was Groupon's policy already and not the restaurants and she just shrugged and said "sorry".This poor example of customer service unfortunately cannot change my mind about this place no matter how good the food is supposed to be.  If this is how this establishment chooses to operate they shouldn't be in the sit down restaurant business.  Because of this experience, I will be sure to STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST ANYONE TRYING THIS PLACE.I have been eating at Pura Vida since they initially opened. As a matter of fact, I have been a customer of Chef Mayra's since BEFORE this restaurant opened-- my father hired her to bake me a vegan cake for my 21st birthday.In terms of Pura Vida, the food at this establishment has been consistently good. Yes, the wait is long; yes, the menus are all over the place; yes, the place is run in a discombobulated fashion; yes, sometimes the staff is short with customers. But the food has always been tasty. My visit earlier today, though, will mark the last time that I patronize them. Ever. Please read of my experience below:My friend and I walked in around 11AM and were briskly told to "read the sign!" Looking around, we were unsure of what sign to read. When it was pointed out to us, it stated plainly that no Groupons would be accepted this weekend following the 4th of July, and that if we have a Groupon we can come back tomorrow. [This immediately gave me a flashback to Father's Day weekend '13 when I came in with a different friend and, upon attempting to redeem her Groupon, were told that they would not accept it due to the holiday weekend. Even though it expired that weekend, and no where on the Groupon did it say that it was void on holiday weekends]. Continuing on... Not having a Groupon on this visit, my friend and I didn't worry about the sign. We were then asked, rather shortly, "So do you still want to eat here?!" I could barely get the 'yes' out of my mouth before we were then asked, "Well, do you have a reservation?!" Having not EVER made a reservation, save for Mother's Day '13, I said 'no'. We were then met, pretty much, with a, "Let me see if we have room for you". Thankfully, after a brief time, we were seated. Upon choosing our meals, our orders were taken. I decided on 'Tha Frenchie', which is a french toast dish with syrup, bananas, fresh berries [when they are in season], and "A DRIZZLING" of chocolate syrup. Having ordered this dish on Mother's Day and not able to eat more than two bites because it was absolutely DRENCHED in chocolate syrup [and had no berries, since they were not in season], I politely asked three questions this time: 1) Are berries in season? (yes) 2) So there will be berries on my french toast? (yes) 3) Can I please order the dish with no chocolate syrup? (yes)After some great conversation with my friend, our meals arrived. My french toast had no chocolate syrup on it, but neither did it have any berries. Before the waitress walked away I said, "Oh! It looks like the berries are missing. May I please have my berries?" to which she replied, "Let me check".Puzzled by this response, my friend and I exchanged looks.Chef Mayra, the owner, then walked abrasively up to our table and lectured me on how my choosing to get no chocolate syrup messed up the flavor profile and, essentially, how dare I think that I could further ruin the flavor profile by enjoying berries on the dish with no chocolate syrup (?). It really made no sense at all, so I then said, "Well, the menu says that the dish comes with fresh berries...I just didn't want the chocolate..." Chef Mayra then continued and stated that I am "lucky" that she is here today, else her chefs would not have even altered her "Signature Dish" to the extent of not putting chocolate syrup on it because they are trained to not alter the Signature Dishes. Oh, but this is a special day--- so she then handed me one large strawberry, sliced up on a plate. "Here is your berry this time. But we won't be able to do this next time".Wow. I felt like that was a huge slap in the face. And the whole deal still doesn't make much sense to me. Why was she in such a bad mood? Why was she so offended that I didn't want chocolate syrup? To be sure, I didn't mention the thirteen wasted dollars on Mother's Day due to the french toast being ruined by a gallon of chocolatey goodness. Maybe I should have? In any case, I felt like a very undervalued customer today. In the time since Pura Vida opened its doors, I have brought A LOT of varied business to them-- business that would have, initially, never even considered this restaurant less I suggested  it.It really is too bad to see such a good restaurant idea not live up to its potential because of bad customer service. As a vegan, I loved to eat here. But my money (and my partner's, and my friends', and my family members') money will be spent elsewhere. At restaurants where we aren't treated like annoyances.These folks don't understand that good service makes up at least 50% of the equation if you want to run a successful restaurant. Good food alone doesn't cut it. Hubby and I went here on the reco of some friends. Food was tasty, but service and most importantly, the staff's attitude, was unbelievably poor. Do yourself a favor and pass on Pura Vida.
TastyBunz=This thought was running through my mind as I ate these buns, "Why haven't I had dim sum that offered buns as tasty as this?"  Sure, you could argue that you're not going to find spaghetti filled buns while eating dim sum, but that's beside the point!  Here's a breakdown of the menu: (pictured here http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=MZ000fT2g5Ww9Tw8OkCtYg)Bacon Bird - cheese dough w/ creamy chicken & bacon filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=UB2iCvcS_b-gaEbgQ1K1Gw)  Probably my second favorite.  I'd probably like it with more cream sauce and bacon, but that's the glutton in me talking.McCheesy - mushroom dough w/ truffle mac-n-cheese filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=TJH2HWSRDAAnawTsC3QSJQ) Dominant truffle flavor, not as cheesy as I would have hoped, but still tasty with that mushroom bun.Sloppy Bun - thyme dough w/ spaghetti filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=ZcKOhk0T89Of2_HxyR2JXg)  This was my favorite!  Maria L. was spot on with her comparison to scooping up the last bit of spaghetti with your bread.BBQ Rib - cilantro dough w/ Mom's BBQ beef filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=M21vsLD4RpfI6WtqpzNLCw)  I was surprised at how moist the beef was inside the bun.The Dilly - green onion dough w/ Pop's ground beef filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=IEV7U49flzyc4QKdInZnpA)  Not my preference, it was okay.Hot Pig -  jalapeno dough w/ spicy pork filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=bXvr9e0_TQ83RI3nZwDdsg)  I didn't really get any spice.The Sloppy Bun, Bacon Bird and McCheesy were my favorites; you could eat these blindfolded and know what they were easily.  The other three didn't seem to have a distinctive flavor profile; yes, I knew that the main meat was (shredded beef/ground beef/pork) but it didn't excite the taste buds.  On my next trip I'll have to try the truffle tator tots and some dessert!My one suggestion for eating at TastyBunz is this: don't come here on an empty stomach.  I ordered six buns for $11, and ended up eating them all!  In the end I was satisfied, and not overly full.  TastyBunz seems like the perfect spot to hit up with a couple of friends when you want a snack.  Split the cost, get the tots, try some desserts; I think it's more economical than spending $11 on one meal!I'll be sure to try the sides and desserts on my next visit!I was really excited about this food truck.  The concept is definitely unique and who wouldn't like a bun stuffed with mac and cheese.  The staff is really nice and I really like the sides.  The truffle tater tots are to die for and the Frisco garlic fries are also great.  But the buns are pretty bland.I came to the grand opening at Costco and I've tried to visit every time they are at Costco so I could try all the buns.  I've tried everything except the sloppy bun, a bun stuffed with spaghetti, which I am eager to try but they've been out.The pork special (now called Hot Pig?) is ok but not spicy.  Dad's picadilly is interesting, but not very tasty.  Like taco meat with some vegetables in it.  There is dill in the bun, but I couldn't really taste it.Mac and cheese bun (now McCheesy, I think) is mac and cheese in a bun.  There is supposed to be mushrooms and/or truffle in the bun but I could not taste either.  But the second time I tried it, I got more truffle flavor in the mac and cheese. But I think I built this one up too much in my head and it just disappointed me in the end.BBQ rib bun was ok.  There is cilantro in the bun, but I can't really taste it.The bacon bird bun is probably my favorite so far.  Nice bacon flavor and very creamy.  But again, not getting much flavor from the bun.I also tried the Me fries but they are a little overwhelming with the egg.  I could not finish it all.  I'll probably stick with the Frisco fries.The dessert potstickers are super sweet.  So sweet they hurt my teeth somehow.  Unfortunately I just can't deal with the sweetness, but I've only tried the smores potstickers, which are fried pastry potstickers stuffed with chocolate and covered with condensed milk and graham crackers. Maybe others are less sweet.  You can try all three if you order the happy ending.  Cute.This is the only food truck I've encountered anywhere that does not include tax in the price.  So bring change or expect to get a lot back.  3 buns are $6 without tax but $6.49 with tax, if that helps.That being said, it's a new truck and has a lot of potential.  It looks like they are changing up the menu and making new items.  So I'll likely be back for the sloppy bun and other menu items. If something strikes my fancy, I'll definitely re-review.I have a new love for Tots... as I walked over each Food Truck to see what they offered outside Tommy Rocker's.. I came across TastyBunz. It was hard as hail to read their marker writings for the menu selections on their see through windows, but I came across the word.. Tots and a photo of it on the truck. What got my undivided attention, which people with A.D.D indeed are less prone in having... a Truffle flavored Tots with fancy Truffle Sauce... Hmmm Veeery Interesting I told myself. Something else caught my eyes, but that's something left to my imagination. Ordered one and it was steaming hot.. all packed up in a sturdy white box and had the utensils inside all ready for chow down. I thought just that was appealing to see.As I received my Truffle Tatter Tots, the aroma filled my nose with deep heavy scent of Truffles. It even made me salivate from inhaling this flavored Tots. The portion and size was beyond generous... amazing outer crust crunch. Crisp and light... the center was soft and steamy. I literally made the Oh face hot look. I like the fact that even when 20 mins. went by.. those Tots were still packed with steam. The flavor was sexy, fun, jammin'!!! Absolutely the best Truffle Tatter Tots to date. It was the perfect blend without the crazy salt or spice. I loved it!The service was exceptional. He was ready to take my order right when I walked up. Very attentive and made sure that's all I wanted. If the service is warm and welcoming... it can bring Anybody back. Big winner with my new love for Tots. This is on my Hot List... for more reasons than one.

Whether or not you believe in such as a Higher Power aka God, we will find common grounds in Harold's Chicken and Fish. Tracy at HC&F's beliefs are parallel and very evident that she believes in dressing the great food served here in it's best and highly presentable in her very new location on West Cheyenne. Barely a Las Vegas local, Tracy came here about a month and half ago from Southside Chicago taking along with her the deep and fresh tastes from Chicago with her version of Chicago's soul food! Don't be fooled-- the other Harold's are owned by different folks!A few of my friends and I planned to get sandwiches, but when we were waiting to turn into the plaza, my gf mentioned that HC&F has a sign saying "NOW OPEN". I honked at my brother and with all my knowledge of sign language, I frantically tried to signal him to look at HC&F's sign! Little did Tracy know, that the reputation of HC&F precedes them and we've been waiting for them to open for quite a bit of time already. We walked in and started to take in the place. The entire restaurant is likened to a very large dining room with 2 flat screen televisions, sofas, chairs, plenty of tables, and jazz decor. The menu is self-explanatory but if you have questions, Tracy would be very happy to answer them. When we walked up, I asked what "perch" was. I've never heard of it and Tracy was so kind and generous to give me an explanation and offer a sample for me to try it! That's hospitality! :)After we ordered, we sat for no more than 7 minutes until our food arrived. We were the only customers, but 7 minutes for all the food we ordered came out to us brought by Tracy herself in pretty good time! We ordered the catfish and dark meat chicken combo. The combo came with 3 catfish filets, 1 leg, 1 drumstick and some fries. It didn't come with a drink though. That'd be nice if it did :) The catfish was fried in a corn meal kind of crust and had just the right amount of that fish-y taste and flakiness. Tasty, indeed! The fried chicken wasn't very different, but reminiscent of Popeye's. Popeye's is one of my favorite chicken places, so for me to say it's like Popeye's is a good thing. Fries are fries so there isn't much to mention about that. However, the perch, is something I'm new to and am probably going to replace catfish with it! Tracy's description of the perch was spot on: more meaty and a little bit saltier. Prepared the same as the catfish, the perch's flavor really broke through and collided with my taste buds!Tracy was very hospitable to let us try some of the perch already, but just when you though that was it, she came through with some freshly cooked shrimp that were te size of prawns! She told us to give them a try and let her know how they were. So, this goes out to Tracy: "The shrimp and perch was the BOMB!" :D This particular HC&F has potential to become something exceptional and definitely a local favorite! The space inside is large enough to host a live band on Friday or Satirday nights! Just a few ideas! :) Not only did the food have soul, but Tracy and her crew straight from Chicago had the spirit in them today too! I look forward to out next trip. Next time, we're bringing the whole crew down!A couple of weeks ago, I passed by this shopping center in my neighborhood and saw the sign "Harold's Chicken, Now Open!".  I thought to myself "That place sounds familiar, where do I know it from?"......a couple of weeks go by and I forgot about it.  Then, the other day I was starving and looking for a new joint to check out.  I looked on my Droid Yelp App and started doing a search for places....that's when I saw a review from Aljamin S on this place.  As soon as I read it, I remembered where I saw Harold's Chicken before.....in Southeast Chicago a couple of years ago.  I get really excited and call my friend in Vegas that's from Chicago who took me there.....he got excited and told me to get over there ASAP to check it out.When I pulled up, I saw a sign that mentioned they were from Chicago...I got excited.  I asked the cook who was standing next to the cashier if they were the same Harold's Chicken from Chicago...he said yes....JACKPOT!I eagerly ordered the 1/4 Chicken Dinner w/White Meat & Hot Sauce (2 Wings, 1 Breast, Fries, on top of a slice of White Bread, $5.99) and a Pizza Puff ($3.15).  After a short wait, they brought out my meal.....I opened up the bag with the Chicken and the smell of the Hot Sauce burned my sinuses....yes!  I couldn't wait to take a bite.  The Chicken and Fries drenched in Hot Sauce with the White Bread on the bottom to soak in the flavors was just as I remembered it in Chicago.  The Chicken was delicious and full of flavor.....my Hot Sauce tolerance has elevated since the last time I ate at Harold's, so the Hot Sauce tasted more mild to me than I remember....but it was good!  The Fries were soggy with the Hot Sauce....I forgot they did that and would have preferred them dry, my bad  I should have asked them to do that.  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!Next was the Pizza Puff....if you've been reading my reviews for a while, you'll know I love Pizza Puffs and will order one any time I can find it.  They serve the Il Taco brand Pizza Puffs here....which is what I'm familiar with from Chicago.  mmmm......Pizza Puff goodness, yes!  If you are unfamiliar with a Pizza Puff, imagine a wallet sized pocket of Pizza Dough, with Pizza Sauce, Cheese, and Sausage in the middle.....it's not a Calzone because the crust is much thinner and it has a distinctive taste and flavor to it.  It's also deep fried....although you can bake it as well.  Anyway, I suggest you try one if given the opportunity.Overall, it was an exciting day.  I called all of my Chicagoland friends who are transplants in Vegas to tell them about this place.Will I return?  Oh yeah!"Medicinal Fried Chicken"Sounds kinda funny, but I've been sick and the antibiotics made me even more crappy and the first thing I could think about was I want some fried chicken. It did hit the spot.The BF and I shared:A combo of white meat fried chicken & fried perch which was 3 big filets of fish, a breast and wing, 2 slices of white bread, and a handful of fries- plenty big portion. I was happy to find perch since I don't really see it often. It was pretty noms- fresh tasting and was juicy. Fried chicken was tasty with a good crisp and seasoned batter. Fries are pretty standard. We were curious of the pizza puff so we got also a pizza puff w/ fries. I've heard of it and finally got to try one.... it's like having a meat lasagna baked into a puff pastry crust. I'm not necessarily the pizza pocket type, but pretty decent stuff and I get why people like it. Drinks aren't from a fountain, but are bottled sodas. They do have a decent selection though. I saw they have fried livers and I kinda have a weak spot (probably literally- a nice and clogged spot) in my heart for that. I do wish they have gravy to dip em in, but that's just a personal preference I can't hold against them too much. Maybe I'll bring my own. Will be back for more fried fare!
Planet Sub=PS has been getting a lot of my lunchtime business lately.Usually go for the sub, but on a whim, decided to order a Chipotle chicken wrap.  Why do they call it a wrap, because essentially, its a sandwich, in a burrito.I'd much rather be eating a "Sanrito", which makes me think of Hello Kitty.  Conversely, the "Burwich" makes me think of Burma, now called Myanmar, which makes me think of self-immolating monks... which brings me right back to the roasted chicken in this here wrap.
Pan Asian=Pan Asian is a bit of a misnomer. This is one Asian restaurant that does not deserve to be panned. Good food. Great service. I'm definitely a fan of Pan.The interior is pretty tiny. There is a meager total of 12 chairs in the whole dining area (which was 75% full while we were there). I'm not sure what kind of capacity they can achieve in that space, but if Dal Lat can squeeze in seating for 34 in their tiny restaurant, Pan Asian could probably at least double their current seating chart.Anthony M and I both ordered the Massaman Curry - I went with beef while he got tofu. This curry dish is on the sweet side, but the heat balanced it out for me. It was a good serving size and I enjoyed everything about it. The large chunks of potato and carrot, the ample pieces of beef, and the flavorful curry all came together very well.For some reason, the chef offered us some fried banana on the house. It was a generous gesture, but it strangely took a long time to come out and quite honestly, I didn't really enjoy it. It's probably a Filipino thing, but thanks to Turon, any fried banana that doesn't come with jackfruit automatically falls short.Nevertheless, I enjoyed my meal and will definitely return to try other items. I was almost tempted to "pull a Misti" (yes, we are hereby coining a new phrase) i.e. I was tempted to come back for dinner on the same day. (I didn't).Pan Asian is literally just down the street from where I am currently living at. It has been opened for only 2-3 weeks and without a splashy and eye catching sign, it may be easy to drive past on Durango unless you are really looking for it.The restaurant has a large kitchen and prep area, but the dining area is comparatively small.  At the moment there are not too many tables and chairs setup (seating capacity is probably only at 16-20).  The interior is decorated simply but nicely.  The owner David Wong and his wife, the chef, are both super friendly.After my first spontaneous visit after just having had dinner at another new restaurant that recently opened just down he street, mainly based on Misti Y's positive comments about this new restaurant.  So I was looking to see what their menu offers and try some desserts.  The Thai dessert looks interesting, but I was told that it was not available that day and to try the Cheesecake Tempura. It was regular slice of cheesecake that was cut into smaller pieces and tempura fried. It has a different texture and if you enjoyed fried desserts, this one is probably something you should try.The next day I dropped by after a stop at the Costco Food Truck Fest #2, and tried the Massaman Chicken Curry.  It was tasty and the portion was generous. Before I left, the chef also gave me a large cup of longan tea (on the house)  that she brewed from dried longan that her relatives visiting from Thailand had brought her.  The flavor is sweet, as it was sweetened with brown sugar, and maybe that was why it also reminded me of the Winter Melon Tea that I used to drink when I was in Taiwan.  I really enjoyed the drink and the generous gesture.Day 3, I had a Sababa Groupon to redeem before it expires. So after finishing the Sababa Special, which I thought would fill me up, I still had room for dessert and dropped in again to see if Thai Sticky Rice and Mango would be on the menu.  Lucky for me, the chef said if I was willing to wait a few minutes, she will make it from scratch for me.  It was a simple and very traditional Thai dessert served especially during the summer, when mango are in season.  And My T and his wife just happened to drop in for dinner.  With a friendly couple that runs the restaurant and serving good food at reasonable prices, Pan Asian is already starting to get a decent Yelp following.  I know I will be back soon to try more of the menu.Decor:  4/5  Minimalist decorations that just works for the space.Food:  5/5 I enjoyed the food I have ordered thus far.  Service:  5/5  The owner and his wife, Chef Lisa, are both super friendly. Can't have a meal prepared and served to you by a nicer couple.Price/Value:  5/5  The price is fair and the portions are pretty generous. Lunch menu portion is the same as the dinner, so an even greater value.Location is super close by, and even after I move a little further away, still worth the detour back from work or to satisfy a Pan Asian craving.Swung by here for some takeout after Paolo's UYE Photowalk.  All I can say is yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!  I got the Massaman curry, Thai spicy chicken salad, and basil fried rice.  All the dishes were freshly, yet quickly made, and soooo good.  I think my favorite was the spicy chicken salad, but everything was super tasty.Friendly owners and they sing!  Whatever's playing, they sing along.  So cute!  I think they were singing Come Together by the Beatles when I left.  Awesome.  Yelp comes through again.Oh, and there is free wifi.  I don't know if it's a mistake or it's coming from another business, but it's there.  Yay!Vegas has weird weather at times and last week it was windy and cold, the perfect weather for soup. I just didn't know what, and I didn't want to go far for it.  I asked my cousin and he suggested Pan Asian. Looking at the menu, everything listed looked so appetizing.  I wanted to try them all.  My budget for that day for lunch wasn't more than $6 so I ordered Tom Kha soup made with coconut, chicken, some different herbs I've never seen or tasted before, lemon grass, and amongst other things.  It was the exact kind of goodness I just needed on a cold windy day.  The sour taste was just perfect and not overpowering the whole dish.  Everything together was combined well.  The service was also comforting as the employees all were very patient, and easy to talk to.  It's also great to be able to speak with the chef.  It's rare that chefs talk to their patrons anymore.  It definitely was a nice change.I am curious about their penang curry and the other curries they're serving.Ding ding ding, we have a winner folks!  First of all, thanks to Misti and the crew for finding yet another gem.  This place advertises itself as an Asian fusion restaurant, but at its core it is a gourmet, mostly authentic Thai restaurant.  And you know how I love Thai food...  We ordered the Massaman Curry with beef, the Rad Nah with pork, and the Vietnamese Shrimp Ravioli.  After eating these, I am convinced that this is one of the top three Thai restaurants in Las Vegas, maybe top two!  (UPDATE: This is THE BEST Thai restaurant in Vegas currently).The Vietnamese Shrimp Ravioli were quite interesting as an appetizer.  The presentation was very gourmet and beautiful.  The ravioli noodles were soft and sticky, wrapped in a shrimp that's cooked in interesting spices.  The flavor was perfect with a little bit of red chili sauce on it (I skipped the soy sauce that came with it).  Not Thai, I know, but definitely yummy.I am not really a fan of Massaman because it tends to be sweet, but with all of the talk about it here, I thought I would try it.  This version was sweet, as it is supposed to be, but it also had a ridiculously intriguing and complex flavor!  There was a definite peanut flavor, but also another flavor that I couldn't put my finger on.  The chef makes her own curries, so I attribute this complex flavor to the homemade curry sauce.  I probably would order this with less sweetness next time, but this dish was amazing.  It came with big potato slices, carrots cooked to perfection, bell peppers, and beef chunks that were nicely prepared.  The Rad Nah here is extremely good, and won me over.  This is probably tied for the second best Rad Nah I have had!  The cook said that it was one of her favorite dishes, and so she takes a lot of pride in her recipe.  This dish smelled absolutely amazing.  Smokey, lightly sweet aromas.  The taste was just as good.  The pork was nice and juicy, and the Chinese broccoli was fresh and crunchy.  The sauce was slightly more rich than the other two great Rad Nah recipes I have had, which gave it its own character.  Not a lot of places can make a great Rad Nah, and Pan Asian makes one of the best I have had.  Great job, Pan Asian.I am so glad to have this restaurant available in Las Vegas.  I will have to take some breaks from my usual spots to explore their menu some more.  The Thai food is mostly authentic, but they do have to Americanize certain dishes a little bit.  So, if you want the real deal, just order it "Thai style".  We rattled off a few exotic dishes that we like, and the chef said that some of them she can cook very well (very spicy Pa Cha).  I can't wait to go back!Edit: I've been back a number of times and have loved every dish I have had (roast duck, red snapper).  One dish really stood out yesterday though, the red curry.  I had it with beef, spicy level 10, and it came with fresh peppers and pieces of pumpkin!  It wasn't as sweet as the other curries, so you non-sweet curry lovers will enjoy this one!  The sauce is homemade, and full of fresh flavors.  I believe that it may be the best red curry I have ever had.  Dave said that this is how the royal family eats red curry.  I don't know about royalty, but if this dish isn't fit for it than I don't know what is!Second Edit: recommended dishes for Thai food lovers, may not be on the menu: the Red Curry dishes (served with fresh pumpkin!), Pa Cha with tilapia, Red Snapper, Duck curry, fried banana.The family has been planning to come back since our visit Mothers Day.  I figured since I've been twice in a row this week, I should write a update.I planned to have lunch with my mom and grandma in law and they were suggesting to come back. They wanted the Stir Fried Linguini and Massaman again. This was definitely a test in consistency and it was right on and just as good. This time the massaman had avocado pieces which made it even better for me! I also tried the Chicken Tom Khar. Lisa (chef/owner) came and said it wasn't coming out the way she wants with consistency since she changed and tried a different coconut milk. I thought it was still good as the flavor of the spices came through and made up for a lack of creaminess from the coconut milk. I guess the BF felt shafted we went without him so we went for lunch the very next day. We had pork pad se ew which had a great flavor. The noodles were a little sticky, but I rather like sticky noodles than the usually greasy treatment of this dish at other places. We got chicken red curry. This is different than most reds I've had, less thick and a bit more watery but the flavor is much more complex. I loved the addition of eggplant and squash to this dish as those went well with the curry flavor. I love meat, but I equally love vegetables that are fresh so it's a big plus for me that the curries here isn't all sauce and meat. The BF and I had a good talk with Lisa about her food and a bit about their past restaurants and such. I loved that she said that since they don't have overhead they spend it on proper good ingredients because it's about the customers. That good food needs good ingredients to become a superior dish. If only every single business adopted that instead of cutting corners on ingredients they might have solid dishes and avid fanbases! And it's not like she is just saying that....we can see her cook and I see that their ingredients are quality (like our Thai Tea had organic Horizon milk) and fresh (herbs from their garden, fresh kefir instead of dried they obtain from LA, Melissa's produce). Considering the quality for the price, it is a steal of a meal! Many places charge about this much for much less quality. I LOVE this place! It feels so comfortable to dine here with how friendly they are. It's like being in the Wong's home. This is THE BEST Thai food I've had in the city and reminds me of some great Thai food giants in Los Angeles (if you didn't know- has the largest population of Thai in the US) solid Thai home cooking. I thought Thai Grill solved all my Thai food answers here in Vegas, but I think this has definitely bumped to my number one.  I rarely endorse a place this hard, but if you are gonna read any of my reviews and decide to go to a place, I hope I influence you to give this humble place a try. A small UYE coming soon so check the calendars!*This is a tribute to Misti Y.*I just HAD to go to Pan Asian before my Texas vacation, so I steered myself here which made me also have to go back to Patisserie Manon and buy every flavor of macaron to take on the plane back to the French mama.The owners of Pan Asian are super sweet.  Chef Lisa has a great name, doesn't she?  I was the only one there, and I told them my friend Misti recommended them so highly that I drove from the other side of town!Some things Chef Lisa and her husband said:"Misti sure has a lot of friends!""Misti just ate here yesterday!"...and when I ordered the massaman curry with fried tofu, "Misti prefers her massaman with steamed tofu."So I smiled and giggled, and enjoyed that Misti is like the fabric of the restaurant (well, there are brick floors but you know what I mean).The massaman was unlike any massaman I ever had.  I am used to thick, dark, and sweet coconut-milk based sauce.  This sauce was savory, almost buttery, and thin.  I am not sure how I feel about the butter instead of the coconut flavor.  However, it was CHOCK full of big chunks of veggies (potatoes, red peppers, green peppers, carrots, onions), crisp peanuts, ripe avocado, and then of course, the tofu.The spice was right on.  I told them I was going to Thailand and Cambodia for my honeymoon and wanted to keep up with the heat.  My nose ran, always a good sign.  Lisa's husband told me he lived in Cambodia, and Lisa told me about her travels in Phuket.  The lunch special came with a canned drink, which I found out after I got Thai iced tea, so I ended up with 2 drinks.  However, I got my can of coke served with a straw, and for anyone who knows I drink soda through a straw, that is pretty cool.I definitely want to come back and try other dishes.  The atmosphere is pretty and clean, the owners warm, the food spicy and tasty.  And even if Misti isn't physically there, she is definitely "there"!I came here yesterday for lunch with one of my gfs.I was really excited to try out this new hot spot with awesome reviews.I was really bummed out with lunch yesterday and will not be coming back.We ordered pad thai with chicken and singapore noodles with chicken. Both dishes were horrible. I'm a huge pad thai noodle fan and was not impressed at all. Both were lunch specials ranging around $7. On the other hand, my gf thought it was good.Parking and seating wasn't a problem.Our server which could be the manager/owner was nice but then forced the issue of us coming back tomorrow... which I told him I live very far and he insisted I still come back. Ummm no thanks.I wouldn't recommend coming here and I won't be back. Such a bummer, I was hoping to find a new lunch spot.Sorry Pan Asian... Next!A majorly delayed review, I have eaten at Pan Asian at least 6 times since it opened and I have to say, if you want a noodle dish, go with the Thai Linguine with vegetables. This dish is one of the best looking (and tasting) bowls of noodles I've ever experienced. The pasta is perfectly al dente and the dish is wok seared in a light soy-sauce with spice level dialed to request. The veggies are bright and fresh: red/green bell peppers, white onions, sliced tomatoes and asparagus. This is THE dish to crave, and Chef Lisa describes it as her 'favorite' as well. First-timers are making a big mistake not ordering this one. The woks are perfectly seasoned at Pan Asian. No weird aftertastes from cheap sesame oil or five-spice here. This is something to take note of anytime there is a wok involved. Do the right thing - GET THE LINGUINE, spice level 3 and you will be good to go.Pan Asian. Which means go spicy or go home!Me and the wifey wanted to try this place out finally after driving by it so many times. The one time I actually stopped by to try them was when they went on vacation for almost 2 months. I guess everybody deserves some time off especially if you have your own restaurant. After looking over the menu I decided to go with the Chicken in Spicy Garlic Sauce. The wifey was not all that hungry so she went with the Spicy Tom Yum Soup. Now back to my very first statement. Our server asked us how spicy we wanted the soup. He said choose from 1 to 3. Now from what I remember skimming on some of the reviews, their spiciness is hotter than the norm. So when my wife wanted 3 I politely interrupted her and said to go for a 1. Im glad we did because after tasting the soup, (which was awesome btw) my lips were burning. Combine that with the Chicken in Garlic sauce, wow! That in itself was spicy. Im glad my dish came with a bowl of white steamed rice because if it didn't, I would literally have steam coming from my head!Now im assuming not all they have on their menu is burn a hole in your stomach spicy but once I was done with my meal, my clothes were all soggy with sweat, like I just came from the gym. Now if I can actually lose weight while eating here, then I am set! Who said multi tasking was hard?As for service, we got our order pretty quick. But then again there were only two other tables being served. So next time the real test is when they are packed. Which means more trips to try other awesome food on their menu!The only thing I thought that stuck out were the prices. We only ordered two items, but with tax and tip it was about 21 bucks. I think that's why lunch time is a hit here with the lunch specials.  Im kind of glad it was spicy because I probably would have ordered more food. Needless to say, we left satisfied.Although very out of the way for me, I happened to be in the neighborhood while going to see my hair stylist. I was a little bit early so I decided to grab a quick lunch. I saw the ratings and thought this was the place. The service was solid and the prices were pretty standard. It was on a weekend, so I did not see the super awesome lunch special deals that some raved about. I ordered my go to dish that allows me to best gauge a new place - drunken noodles with chicken. These were probably the best drunken noodles I've had out of countless places that I have already tried. The price was around $11 and we also shared the calamari appetizer which was delicious at the time, but pretty forgettable. I wouldn't drive across town for the calamari, but I would go for their drunken noodles every time I am in the area to get my hair done (once a month on average). I heard the waiter make curry recommendations to other patrons, so after I have had my fill of the drunken noodles, I may venture on to the curry.Move over Lotus of Siam, there's a new kid in town! I was introduced to this place by one of my favorite bloggers, Wendy C. of  http://wendyfulworld.com/  She was on the money! David Wong's is now my go-to Thai in Las Vegas. His signature dishes, the Shrimp Mango Salad and Crispy Duck in Red Curry, are out of this world! The Pad See Yew and Pineapple Fried Rice are also authentic and tasty. They have a numbering system of 1 to 10, but beware, 5 is incredibly spicy!The bonus is you can bring your own wine or beer here, no corkage. I wanted to try their Mango with Sticky Rice but they were out. We ordered Fried Banana instead, but that was a disappointment. Guess we'll just have to come back for the Mango with Sticky Rice!HAPPY LUNCHI once lived along Florida's Gold Coast and so did Pan Asian's David Wong. And I've been to Thailand multiple times in recent years. We chatted a bit about the cost of living in Bangkok and how it's become so expensive to live there. David also mentioned one of the reasons he moved to LAS from Naples, FL.  Snow birds aren't full time residents and his restaurant business needed full time customers.Being that I'm from Hendertucky, it's a long trek no matter how I wanted to zig zag across the valley streets. Fortunately, I had a few appointments on the west side of the valley and so it was a must that I try Pan Asian.David Wong is a very charismatic man especially with his friendly Thai demeanor. We decided not to order from the lunch categories but from the dinner selections. Of course the Pad See Ew with pork is a must and for a market test his Panang curry with eggplant and chicken. We sort of came in at the tail end of the lunch rush, so our lunch arrived post haste. The aroma from the simple dishes were irresistibly enticing that Yu-go chauffeur almost didn't take his photos of our meal. By way of David's advice we ask that the Thai heat (spiciness) of three be applied.  We're talking three out of ten.I have to say we were most impressed with the wok skills of Lily, David's wife. Ingredients meeting at the right temperature that enabled the Thai spices to meld into a consistent experience of Thai cuisine in it's intended full fragrance and taste.Now that I've eaten here,  I can further appreciate David Wong's other advice while he was serving our lunch: "Children, do not fight for the food." with a smile. Let's just say both dishes were crazy good.The BEST Thai in town. Not just in my hood, but the best period. I'm not usually regretful but I'm seriously upset that I just recently discovered this gem. The Massaman curry is amazing. With big chunks of sweet potato and buttery avocado, "It's the best Jerry, the best!" Spicy #7 is ALL I can handle. They do 1-10 on the spicy scale and we're talking serious heat here. If my Thai food doesn't cause a runny nose, I don't wanna eat it. David Wong's does the trick every time. If you order spicy #5 at your usual Thai joint, you probably wanna cut that down to about a #2 at Pan Asia. If you LIKE Thai food, try David Wong's, and you will LOVE Thai food.It's been a while since I've returned to Pan Asian, but I don't know why.  This place still serves up some great food.  My friends and I came in for lunch on a recent Friday after a morning of training; food tastes even better when it's recovery food, IMHO.  The lunch specials are still a good option. We shared the still fabulously refreshing tiger shrimp mango salad and I had the chicken panang lunch.  My only gripe is that brown rice is $2.50; really?  I am not willing to pay that much.  Other than that, I still love this place and I really won't wait so long to eat here again.Oh yes, it is true, I have found a new favorite Thai place. And yes I will drive back to the complete other side of town for this spice again, and again, and again. I was dining solo, and on Durango so I figured  would take my fellow Elite yelper Shawn's recommendation for Thai. I walked into Pan Asian and was greeted and told to sit anywhere. As I went over the menu, I couldn't help but hear the table of 6 across from me talk about this place and "their spice level". One guy said how he won't go over a level 5. If you know me, and spicy, I was instantly intrigued! I ordered some pot stickers (some of the best I have ever had) and the order of garlic and black pepper chicken, level 8. The boss/server guy looked at me and said "here, level 8 is very spicy, not like other Thai" I simply looked back, smiled, and said "GOOD."When my plate arrived I could see the spicy. I started to get a bit nervous but then brushed it off. I was there alone, and I just told the boss I can handle it, can't wimp out now! It was perfection! Yes I may have ordered a 2nd Thai iced tea, and my eyes may have been a bit watery at times. But did I finish it? YES. Will I order it again? HELL YES. I love being the white girl who impresses the old Thai people. When my guy came to check on me he asked if it was too spicy, I told him it indeed was spicy, but perfectly spicy. It's about time there is a place I can brag about to my friends when they want a real heat level. Good quality Thai food, and great service. I can't wait to return and try something else!!All these raving reviews must be from non Asians or Asians with bad taste. This place is at best mediocre. Greasy. Small portions compared to what real Chinese restaurants offer. And a grab bag of Asian cuisines all clumped under 1 roof. You don't see a "Pan European" anywhere and hear the French exclaiming how delicious the food is.New favorite restaurant! I was on the hunt for spicy food, some of my fellow yelpers recommended this place so I decided to give Pan Asian a try. As a starter we ordered the Gyoza, it was good, crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. For my main meal I ordered the linguini noodles with chicken, my palate is very sensitive so on the scale of 1 to 10 of spiciness I ordered a 2. Let's just say I'm ordering a 1 next time. The noodles were amazing though, they were packed with a lot of flavor and a great amount of kick, my nose was running like niagara falls the entire meal. I'm not sure what noodles my husband ordered but he did order the noodles a level 8, he said he liked them as well but was expecting the noodles to be spicier, he's going with a level 10 next time. For dessert we ordered the deep fried cheesecake, it's like a slice of Heaven in your mouth, its so rich and creamy and it's served with whipped cream and ice cream. Overall we loved our entire meal, and the staff was extremely friendly! Plus it's inexpensive, for an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks, and dessert, we only spent $38. I highly recommend Pan Asian, I can't wait to come again and try more of their dishes.This tiny restaurant packs big flavor! Feeding my cold, I had the filet mignon pho (I ordered small, which I still didn't finish). I ordered it at a spice level of "2". I'm a heat wimp, so this was actually still a bit much for me, but it sure cleared the sinuses! My friend ordered the chicken rice noodle soup (but he kept poaching from my bowl, so the clear star of this dining experience was indeed the pho). The service was extremely fast. Our server was super cute, and I will definitely come back!I am really surprised at the high ratings for this place. I came here three times thinking maybe the next time will be better. I have ordered Tom Yum Goong, a grilled shrimp mango salad, and a Filet Mignon pho. The Tom Yum Goong was just awkward with the glass noodles & big onion slices. It wasn't the Tom Yum Goong I was used to. The shrimp mango salad tasted fishy. I wasn't sure if they put too much fish sauce or if it was from the shrimp.For my most recent visit. I went with their $5.95 pho. I ordered a spice level 5 which turned out to be too spicy. Call me a wimp but I couldn't finish the broth because it was too spicy. I enjoy a little kick but not too much to the point where it's painful to enjoy and eat. That's why I ordered a spice level in the middle. Their Thai version of pho was not my thing either. I'll just stick with traditional pho. Note, the $5.95 bowl is kid size. You'll probably be hungry after.The lunch specials does not include soup, egg roll, and a fried wonton like the other Thai restaurants so that's another negative for me. Service was slow the first two times and OK the last visit. If you enjoy extremely spicy food and your butt being on fire, you might enjoy this place. Not for me.I was visiting my best friend in Vegas and met her for lunch here. I let her do the ordering because she obviously knew what was up (she comes here like once a week!). Honestly, I had low expectations because it's totally unassuming, but OMG their pad thai is sooooooooooooooooooooo so so so so good! Saucy and flavorful and so damn fire, I loved it!!! Might even be better than the pad thai at my favorite spot in Thai Town, LA! I also really enjoyed their tom kah. Would highly recommend Pan Asian for anyone in Vegas craving bomb Thai food.
Poppyseeds Bagels=I visit this place at least once a week, because I think that it's important to support small businesses and the food is good. However, the last three weeks I have had the unpleasant experience of having my order taken and rung up by a young lady who seemed bothered to have to be working there. I think that she is the daughter of the owners and she has been very rude all three times that I have encountered her. The other employees are all lovely and chatty and the food is excellent. Unfortunately I am going to have to give up on this place because this young lady does not understand that being rude to customers is not good for business. I will spend my money somewhere else.
Red Velvet Café=Looking down & spying the bright "Red Velvet Cafe" sign from the upper floor of the Fashion Show mall had me doing a quick search for the closest escalator. If one wasn't nearby, I was considering jumping over the rail and Spidermanning it down to this beacon of red velvet in the middle of a mall. Was I bored with shopping? Sure. Was it time for Red Velvet? It's ALWAYS time for red velvet, foo.Well, guess what? This isn't just any old corner bakery red velvet cupcake or Grandma's Christmas cake either. It's a Vegan Red Velvet Cake. Yep, VEGAN. Giddy-up cause I'm getting one to eat right then and there. The lady at the counter brought it to our table with two forks and couple glasses of water. The individual cake costs $5.50 and is perfect for sharing or just eating by yourself. Olivia Z. and I split it since we were heading to a buffet in a couple hours.Soooooo... how was it? Oh, you mean the Vegan Red Velvet Cake. It was great. I don't know how they do it without butter and such, but the flavor was rich, the cake moist, and the frosting near perfect. If you are sick of the uber-sweet fake red velvet at your local supermarket, the Vegan Red Velvet Cake at Red Velvet Cafe is a treat. Sure, they have other stuff like sandwiches, salads, coffee, and juices, but save room for a healthier and yummier take on a classic American dessert - the Red Velvet Cake.This review is for both Red Velvet Cafe locations.I'm not saying they don't serve delicious healthy food. I'm not saying their sweets are yummy. They are, for that, I'm giving 2 stars. However, I won't be returning to either locations again.http://www.reviewjournal...To summarize really quick, this article tells about how people LOVED Red Velvet Cafe's infamous chocolate cookies, which claim to be only 27 calories each. Too good to be true? Yes. A Las Vegas author had these cookies analyzed and found out they were actually 157 calories! So the six-pack of cookies Red Velvet claims to be only 162 calories is actually 942 calories. Read the article and judge for yourself.I've had Red Velvet vegan cakes many times, the ones that are supposed vegan and around 200 calories. As I try to stay fit and eat a sensible diet, I always appreciate establishments who offer vegan healthy alternatives. However, if I find a food I really want it, I'll buy it, sometimes regardless of if it's low-calorie. I'll eat a 900-calorie triple chocolate cake if that's what I really crave, but at least I KNOW how much I'm eating.I know that not all eateries provide their nutritional information on their food. I understand some recipes are kept secret. However, if you are going to be proud to claim how low calorie your delicious chocolate cookies are, they better be true!I just don't appreciate the dishonesty Red Velvet Cafe displayed. People rely on accurate information on what they eat, if that information is available. Now, I cannot trust anything Red Velvet Cafe says about any of their food. Can you? Their food may be delicious, but their actions left a bad taste in my mouth.I'm slightly embarrassed to admit I've been buying cookies from the Red Velvet Café for years. My girlfriend, too. We're both health-conscious people, and we were attracted to the cookies' low calorie count. "Red Velvet Café's Famous Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies: Approximately 27 cookies & 1 gram of fat per cookie!!!," read the sign--look for yourself. That equates to 162 calories per six-cookie box. The more I thought about it, the more it seemed too good to be true.And it was; a food chemical breakdown test, conducted by the Pacific Coast Analytical Services, showed that Red Velvet Café's cookies actually contain 157 calories each. So when I thought I as eating a 162-calorie box of your cookies, I was actually eating a 942-calorie box.I learned about this last week, in the Review-Journal. And a couple weeks before that, I began to grow suspicious myself, so I snapped the picture shown above. I also took a secret video of a Café employee walking me through the BS calorie counts of the various baked goods. Then a guy--I believe he's the bakery's co-owner--assured me that the cookies had been tested after baking, and the calorie count was 160. A total lie.A week ago I went to the Café to ask for my money back. I gave my info to the assistant manager, who assured me I'd hear back by Tuesday. Tuesday came and I never heard back. So I'm suing.Am I crazy for wanting my money back? The way I see it, I didn't get the food item for which I bargained. Am I crazy for thinking Red Velvet Café needs to be punished (through punitive damages) for its outrageous, egregious untruth? I don't care whether they were willfully deceiving or just reckless with the truth; I just care that these people are punished for all the years they made money on a total lie. I'm suing them in Clark County's Small Claims Court now.Vegas is not known very well for its extensive vegan options, so I was happy to hear that a vegan-friendly cafe was minutes away from the Trump Hotel, where I was staying. All I had to do was skip across the street, make it through the mall, and there it was!It is very cute, in an open are in the center of the mall. There seems to be plenty of seating, and rows of desserts lining the shelves.Not everything is vegan, but they do specialize in vegan food and desserts. I didn't get a chance to try any of the desserts, but I decided to splurge on my meal.I got the veggie panini-vegan style. That means they use the vegan pesto and vegan daiya cheese instead. She asked if I wanted to add vegan chicken in for a few dollars more, but I opted out because I felt like the flavors in the sandwich were probably rich and filling already. I stuck with the salad, but added on the plain roasted potatoes on the side.It is on the pricier side, especially if you decide to start adding ingredients. ($3 potatoes here, $3 faux chicken, $1 avocado, etc.)I should have splurged a bit even more and added the chicken and went for the seasoned potatoes.The sandwich was good, but nothing extraordinary. It quickly got soggy and the flavors were surprisingly not rich and filling. It felt like it was missing something. The pesto just fell flat. But it wasn't bad, I still enjoyed it.The salad was overdressed, and the dressing itself was nothing to write about.The potatoes, advertised as roasted, were nothing more than steamed potatoes. I like that they use exotic potatoes, such as red, blue, yellow, etc. But the fact that it was simply steamed meant that it didn't have a hearty "roasted" flavor, not was it seasoned at all. Very very bland.In the end, it was not unenjoyable, but nothing too memorable. A bit overpriced, but what isn't in Las Vegas. I'm just glad I was able to find something to eat so close to my hotel!Friendly staff, good food (not great) but in my opinion not worth the price. It was $40 for our bill for 3 people (we ordered a veggie pizza, a veggie wrap, and 2 juices all to share). KUDOS to being a good vegetarian option! They have non-vegetarian dishes on the menu as well.  I understand that it's the Fashion Show Mall, thus I shouldn't expect cheap prices but the food in my opinion wasn't delicious enough for me to pay that much. I would recommend looking at the food court or go up the elevators towards Auntie Anne's for a more wallet-friendly mall-session meal.
China Poblano=What do Mao Tse Tung and Frida Kahlo have in common?  Besides their intimate connections to communism and controversial personal lives, they also both appear as projected photographic wall art at China Poblano.  I adore Frida and collect mementos from her life.  I can't say the same for Mao but don't mind seeing his picture every so often at this restaurant.  China Poblano has a fresh concept, delicious food that mixes quality ingredients with creative combinations, and an artistic urban atmosphere.If you come alone, sit at the bar, it's communal and gives you a peek into the kitchen with cooks demonstrating their skills.  If you come with a group, sit by the wall with exhibits of colorful Chinese masks and Mexican figurines, which appear surprisingly similar when displayed together, (these tables also have cushioned benches that are much more comfortable than the ones under photographs of Mao & Frida).Everything is tapas style, we discovered about 2 items per person is a good amount of food.  Scallop dumplings are very tasty and served in authentic bamboo steamers.  I also love the Dan Dan Mian, wheat noodles in a spicy ground pork sauce.  Hot & sour soup has real content, not just broth.  But my favorite is the Singapore Sling, their signature cocktail.  It's very good gin paired with pineapple juice that they make in house plus other delicious things that come together for a fabulous concoction.They did forget a couple of our orders so it seems like management is still settling in.  All forgivable under this prismatic fun house where I can eat delectable fusion food.Everything is pretty small and served like tapas, but somehow its surprisingly filling.  There were definite highs and lows to this meal, but I think there were a few dishes that excelled while only a few weren't quite what we had hoped for.There was a big group of us so I managed to sample quite a big portion of the menu.Highlights:Carnitas tacos-served with guac, pork rinds, and a verde sauce!Like water for Chocolate- fried quail served with dragonfruit and edible flowers.  Chilaquilles- tortilla chips cooked in a pan with a salsa verde and cheese.  Kinda like nachos.Mango "sticky rice"- this is something quite interesting.  The sticky rice part was made into a mousse and ripe mangoes.  I've never seen this before and it was really cool.  The "rice" element were like rice crispies on top.  Chocolate "terrain"- Awesome chocolate mold of a Chinese soldier with a spicy chocolate mousse inside.  It was served with cookie crumbs to look like sand, and a ginger ice cream that was spicy and sweet all at the same time.Things to skip:Oceans Nest- fried noodles served with stirfried saucy seafood and veggies.  We ate all the lobster out of it and then left it there.  It was super bland.Lamb potstickers- pretty presentation with the little edible flowers and everything but it was bland and looked more exciting than it tasted.Overall, I thought the place had a whimsy to it that I thought was fun.  The ambiance was interesting and diverting, the waitress and wait staff were helpful and went out of their way to see to our requests.  While some of the food is a bit overpriced and small, I really enjoyed their desserts, there is something light hearted and comical about them.  They were the highlight of the meal.  If nothing else, come and have dessert and a laugh all at the same time.Allow me to preface, i seldom give 1 or 2 stars: A lot had to be missing for any dining establishment to fall in this category. it was a saturday night at the Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino.  H and I were in a hurry to grab a quick bite before heading to the Marquee Night club.  The cafe would surely prepare a hearty meal, but as the minutes ticked away, we knew that time was not on our side.  Luckily (or unluckily in this case) China Poblano jumped out of nowhere and had a sign that said "to go or take out."  instantly, i'm thinking it's kinda like Taco Bell fast, but let's just say that we're lucky to get our food in less than 20 minutes.the menu was a fusion of chinese and mexican food.  unique? not really.  anybody can make any type of meat and throw it in a tortilla shell and call it mexican food.  anybody creating this type of concept needs to think it through to create a unique dining experience for everyone who passes through the doors.  come'on, people travel from all over the world to come to vegas.  is this is best meal the Cosmo can offer?  i believe not.THE PORK SIU MAI were a disgrace to Chinese people who invented this dish.   i have eaten this all my life in OC & LA & even SF and have never seen anything so tiny.  it was literally the size of a quarter, all 6 of them, looking pretty sad and lonely in this takeout container that it was tossed into.  no shredded lettuce or cabbage for garnishment.  just 6 puny little siu mai's squished to the corner of the container.  i finished them in 2 minutes and naturally was not full at all.  the taste -- it was ok, not spectacular.THE TACOS that H had were another dismal dish that appeared from the same menu.  i can't quite comment on the taste but the size was disappointing.the prices.... were not cheap. both microscopic & macroscopic items came in slightly less than $30.  what?  does money grow on trees?  Asians are taught to get the best bang for the buck and to bargain our way through life... this time i felt jipped & helpless.  left the establishment with a more than half empty stomach & feeling robbed.THE EXPERIENCE:ok, granted we order takeout, but there was no place to sit outside in the hallways of the hotel.  it's just not sexy or classy to eat in the hallways.  meanwhile inside, the bar was completely empty (as in zero, zip, zilch, nada patrons).  We asked the girl cleaning the bar if we could please sit there for a few minutes, and she said yes. then, like a bat out of hell, the hostess stormed over and said we cannot sit there.  what?  did you not realize we were not fighting for seats but actually making your establishment appear fuller than it is?  so, she escorted us to these benches behind the bar with pillows that we could sit in.  for all the commotion that she caused by moving us, we could've finished our food in the 2 minutes that it requires to consume our so-called meal.IN CONCLUSION:this place is not suitable in such a gorgeous hotel as the Cosmopolitan.  it does not compare to its elegance, its grandeur, and its sophistication.  the people who work there need to grace better manners and accommodate its patrons a little better.i would highly suggest you save your money and go to the cafe downstairs or win a couple of hands in blackjack and eat at Blue Ribbon Sushi or STK instead.Picky eaters do not apply. To enjoy this place, you have to be an adventurous eater.  If you just get chips, queso fundido, or a pork bun, you will not be happy.  For foodies who won't turn their nose up at a beef tendon taco, this is the place for you!  Super creative food and a great bargain for what you get.  We started out with the Pozole Rojo ($9) which is a spicy shredded pork soup with chickpeas, cabbage, pork rinds, chopped onions, radish, and avocado.  This was a really good portion size for $9 and so tasty.  You can get it with a shot of tequila for an extra $3 but our server didn't recommend it unless we just wanted to do a tequila shot. Apparently the tequila is offered for hangovers.  Hair of the dog, you know.Next we tried the Viva China taco ($5.50 each) which has beef tendon, a Kumamoto oyster, and Sichuan sauce.  Yes, beef tendon in a taco.  This was extremely tasty.  I could eat ten of these.We also tried the Cochinita Taco ($4.50 each).  It's pretty much pork and pickled onions.  Pretty good, but the Carnitas taco topped with pork rinds is so much better.Another great dish was the Papas with XO sauce ($6).  French fries covered in a dried scallop sauce.  They serve it with lime, which you think would be awful.  But it's actually really, really good!The big surprise of the night was the Gaspacho Morelia ($10).  This is a huge plate of very fresh, very tasty fruit covered in freshly squeezed orange juice.  Some of the fruit had some spicy seasoning on it, which enhanced the flavor of the fruit.  Pineapple, watermelon, mango, jicama, dragonfruit, strawberries, and queso fresca. Very good and light.The cocktails are also very inventive.  I don't think I can ever have a normal margarita again after having the salt air margarita ($12) served here.  The salt foam is a perfect compliment to the margarita and doesn't have the harsh taste of salt on the rim.  My husband had the lychee sour ($12) which was also very good.  $63 before tip and we were very, very full.  Service was impeccable and very friendly.  Just focus on the more creative dishes.  Yeah, you can get a pork bun in Chinatown for cheaper.  Of course you can get a carne asada taco at a taco truck for cheaper.  Come here for the creative dishes that you can't get anywhere else.My traveling companions decided to go and get pampered at a hotel spa and rely on a trained professional to provide some comfort into their lives, but I nixed that idea because for me comfort comes in the form of good food passing from my mouth to my belly.I found myself exploring the Cosmopolitan on my own when I came upon this unique second floor restaurant which announced Chinese food in one window and Mexican food in another.  I stopped to study the menu and learned it was exactly what I thought it to be, a restaurant specializing in dim sum, noodles and tacos.Since I was dining alone I was seated at the dim sum bar where I had a front row seat watching the ladies prepare, fill and fold fresh dumplings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=zE32BWJoqOAZL4TmaNlT3w) and roll out fresh hand-cut noodles.  I decided to order from both the Chinese and Mexican menus in order to sample the cuisine a little bit better.For starters I ordered one of two Agua Frescas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=W60P4p4WhAKZMHqhVyGHmw) available at the time choosing one made of blood oranges and pomegranates.  From the Dim Sum menu I selected the Sui Mai Scallops made up of ground pork, bamboo, mushrooms and peanuts and the Har Gau which combined shrimp and pork belly in its filling.  From the Tacos menu I selected an individual Carnitas taco and the Pescado Frito taco.  I agreed to have my selections brought out as they were prepared.The Pescado Frito (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=8cIp34h9uM_xmdh4LajsUg) taco arrived first.  On paper this was supposed to be fried fish and a Mexican salsa, but the fish I had inside my taco certainly didn't seem fried.  No matter its preparation I liked it as the flaky fish was bursting with flavor and hot juices running amok.  This was a very simple but very good fish taco.The Carnitas taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=9WJy0kQq33M7dBVaCtAbNw) was up next.  This was braised baby pork, creamy guacamole, chicharrones and lime at its best.  When the server told me this was her favorite it took me just one bite to understand why.  If I really wanted to pig out I could have easily devoured another three of these.The dim sum were served in individual bamboo steamers with the lids left on until I was ready to enjoy.  This helped keep the little morsels hot and steamy while I worked on my tacos.I had the Har Gau (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=ugVecr8s4E13Ak4f0t3P8w) first.  These were quite unique as there was actually a pocket of broth inside the chewy, translucent shell much like what is usually experienced with xiao lung baos.  The shrimp was so fresh it was crunchy and while I didn't notice anything special with the added pork belly the juicy har gau was delicious enough to stand on its own.I saved the Sui Mai Scallops (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=OG_yUcneFS9wu0I9ejqQLg) for last.  These were easily some of the most eye-appealing sui mais I've ever had topped with a bit of tobiko and some micro greens.  In terms of flavor and originality it was another winner.  The soft peanuts mixed in with the pork and the mushrooms gave these a very pleasant earthiness.  I enjoyed each one slowly, and stayed in my seat contemplating the delicious food I just sampled until it was time to meet up with my friends again.Uh, guys, I won't be joining you for dinner tonight.  I'm stuffed!!When I first saw China Poblano, I thought it was just some gussied up Chinese joint at the Cosmopolitan.  When I looked a little closer, I realized it was some kind of combo Mexican-Chinese restaurant.  When I checked them out on my phone, I learned they were a Jose Andres creation.  When my friends suggested them for lunch, I was game.  When we were done, I was sorely unimpressed.Now, it's probably my fault for assuming, but looking at the place, I was under the impression that China Poblano offered a fusion of Chinese and Mexican food.  In reality, they mostly offer Chinese AND Mexican food.  As in, one and the other.  Not as in, a melding of two very different cuisines.  Disappointing enough already, but that also meant having to get two things in order to try both sides of the menu.  After asking the waiter for suggestions, I took his advice and ordered a couple of tacos to go with my noodle dish (he warned that the portions were "small-ish"):- Dan Dan Mian (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=1znpnNpUi4mUde6NTXRxEA) - underwhelming.  The noodles themselves were okay and I liked how the pork sauce was actually spicy, but the dish seemed salty.  Really, the only flavors I could really get out of it was spiciness and saltiness.  I didn't expect much and they still fell short.- Carnitas Taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=BqnTT9gfKS5Ol5gszHWr2A) - FAIL.  Unlike my noodle dish, I actually had hopes for this one.  Rather than crispy, grilled meat, I was greeted with a mound of shredded pork dripping with oil (check out the ends of the wrapper) and a topping of deep fried fat (think pork rinds but worse).  No bueno.- Pescado Frito (fried fish) Taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=ilJU8hdfD1EXVL_EZKfFeA) - by default, it was the best thing I had.  On its own, it was only decent.  The fish and pickled onions worked, but I thought the flavor was too muted.  If it was a little stronger, I would have liked it more.Given the celebrity chef owner and China Poblano's location on the Strip, the meal wasn't cheap.  To charge $5.50 for that carnitas taco (and to a lesser extent, $6.50 for that pescado taco) is practically criminal though.  With just the $12 I spent on the tacos, I can find a better Chinese noodle dish and tacos, and still have change to tip.  Unless you're a big Jose Andres fan, you're better off going elsewhere (like Holstein's next door).I had to edit my review because I gave a low rating the first time, but I have genuinely liked this place way more since I've come back a few times.I will keep this short and sweet, the portions may be a little small, but most dishes are eloquently designed and they make you savor each bite.I've had some things a little over done w too much oil (ie street taco). But there are also many dishes that are quite refreshing and made quite clean.***Jose Andres' China Poblano in the Cosmopolitan Hotel scores a mediocre score of 3 stars on Yelp, but I found all of the food (I had two of their savory courses and 1 dessert) to be good to very good***China Poblano features a mix of contemporary Mexican and Chinese dishes.  Some dishes are gussied up with contemporary cooking techniques or high end ingredients while other dishes veer more on the fusion side.  I started with one of their tacos--a carnitas one topped with guacamole, fresh lime and chicarrones.  I thought the fillings were great.  The carnitas was moist and tender.  It was also nicely seasoned.  It had a good flavor and wasn't too salty (which happens a lot with carnitas).  The guacamole was cool and refreshing and it was a great contrast to the warm and savory carnitas.The chicarrones were crispy and light.  The soft corn tortilla was fine, but it wasn't a good vessel for the meat juices.  The only problem with the taco was that it was too wet.I also has the twenty vegetable fried rice and it was very good.  The rice had a nice soy flavor, but it was not too salty.  The vegetables provided great contrasts in textures, but with that many vegetables, which were cut up into small pieces as well as paired with a flavorful rice, the individual flavors of the vegetables were (as expected) kind of lost.Still, there were a lot of vegetables including fresh greens, crispy sweet potato, haricot verts, squash, turnips, carrots, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, and watermelon radish.  There were also proteins like soft tofu and scambled egg.For dessert, I opted for their flan and it was very good.  The flan was incredibly smooth, creamy and light like a panna cotta.  It was topped with a great cajeta gelee (rich caramel flavor).  There was also cajeta ice cream (incredibly dense and a great rich caramel flavor).  The plate was garnished with good pineapple, which was not too tart.Service by the bartender Victor was excellent; he was incredibly personal and helpful with the menu.  You could tell he really wanted all of his customers to have the best experience possible.Prices are not too bad considering that it was Vegas.  The fried rice dish was under $20 and it was a very generous portion.  Some portion sizes seem small in a few dishes when considering the prices (like the tacos), but it is still a better value than the many overpriced Vegas restaurants serving just so-so food.In terms of the decor at China Poblano, the bar gives you a view of the chefs making the dim sum.  There is a main dining room, but I wasn't a fan of the tables (they kind of looked like what you would find at a gourmet order-at-the-counter spot).  Overall, the decor was forgettable and not that great.I thought the food at China Poblano was good.  The food was pricey, but Vegas food tends to be pricey and there are places in Vegas serving much more expensive food that is not nearly as tasty or refined as what you can get at China Poblano.  I think China Poblano is a good spot for an upscale lunch.  And since the same menu (with the same prices) is featured at dinner, it is a good spot for a nice dinner with a more casual approach and more reasonable prices than the many overpriced high-end dinner places in Las Vegas.I believe the Cosmopolitan offers both complimentary valet and self parking.There's no Mexican-Asian fusion going on in this restaurant, except that the 2 menus and decor are intertwined. It's almost like someone could not decide if they wanted to open a Mexican restaurant or Chinese restaurant, so they decide to open both in the same space, with separate kitchens. I love both Mexican food and Chinese food, but this is neither here nor there. Two cuisines that are normally best in a hole-in-the wall spot, and inexpensive - this is just the opposite: overpriced and mediocre.We ordered everything family style and tried to get a good mix of both Mexican & Chinese food:Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita ($15) - I liked this margarita a lot. I don't care for the taste of tequila, and the blood orange seemed to mask this well. It had a spicy kick to it, but not so spicy that it was undrinkable.Guacamole & Chips ($15) - Handmade, and delicious, but the price is about double what I would expect to pay for fresh guacamole. Chips were light, crispy and fresh.Tacos (about $5 each) - I'm used to dollar tacos (maybe $2) at a taco truck. I got the Tinga Poblana and it was good, but unless I'm expensing my meal to work, I would pass on this - much too expensive for tacos.Lamb Potstickers Stuck on You ($12.88) - 6 pieces - This was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. The lamb inside was tasty and I liked the crispy lace (sweet onions) design on the dish. Would recommend this.Sui Mai ($13.88) - 6 pieces - The only cool thing about this were the gold flakes on top. The rest was just okay, and tasted heavy on the ginger. At a normal dim sum restaurant, you can get 4 sui mai's for $4 that taste better.Dan Dan Mian ($12) - Wheat noodles and spicy pork sauce - This was definitely spicy, nothing that blew me away though. At least the price was reasonable for the portion-size.Col de Bruselas ($12) - These are on the acidic side - tasted really limey. I wouldn't get this again.Shrimp Mojo ($18) - 8 pieces of shrimp = $2.25 per piece of shrimp. Sauce was good, not too spicy, this was one of the better dishes we had.Bistec con Mole Amarillo y Hongos ($20) - Grilled hanger steak with mole - there were about 6 sliced pieces of steak - again, with the small portions. It was one of the better tasting dishes we had, but expensive.All in all, it's an interesting concept and I was there for work so I was able to expense my meal. With tip and tax, it was $60 per person - quite honestly, I would rather eat at a Mexican food truck or a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place for 1/4 of the price and more authentic food. With so many other options in Vegas, I'll be going elsewhere.China Poblano is such a waste of money. DO NOT COME HERE! As I was walking through Cosmopolitan, I didn't really pay much attention to this little Asian-Mexican joint because it looked like an unappetizing fast food spot, BUT what did catch my eye was Jose Andres' name plastered in front of the restaurant.  I've fallen in love with Jose Andres ever since my enjoyable experience at The Bazzar so I just had to try it.  Of course I knew it wasn't going to be the same, but this just wasn't even good... for any type of standard.  I wanted to try an item from both sides so I opted for the lobster taco and their dan dan mian noodles.  The lobster taco was about $10 and the noodles were around $16?  Both were extremely overpriced for what I got and I honestly don't mind forking out the cash for good food, but this did not even come close.  The portions were extremely small for both, not to mention that my lobster taco was soggy.  The dan dan mian noodles were supposed to be one of their more popular items and I can tell you that there are about a million places in 626 that do it better for about $6.  I regret coming here and should've just gone to Secret Pizza.  China Poblano, how dare you taint Jose Andres' reputation like that!!I am very turmoiled about this place. I've seen it several times and my guitar instructor/friend has been here 5 times and loved it every time. I had big expectations. Thursday night, the middle of the Pac 12 tournament week around 9 o'clock in the evening. Not too crowded but people were scattered around the edges of the restaurant. With all the room in the restaurant, we end up sitting at a table against a wall nestled in between about 4 other tables a super tight sardine type squeeze. Our red headed male waiter did not come around for awhile, but we watched him attend to the table directly to the right of us and a few tables left of us. I kind of felt like we were playing that childhood game, Red Rover, wondering if I was ever going to get picked and the anticipation was killing me! I just wanted to order. He finally comes over with his rehearsed speech. Yes, my hubby and I order margaritas, and then he disappears for a long time again before we get to order food.Fast forward sometime later.. The guacamole and chips, hubby's choice, make their appearance first. Very good stuff. Not mind blowing but definitely worth a try!I enjoyed my "air" foam topped margarita and my chili pepper spicy margarita. I had one of the most unique tacos I ever had - a duck tongue - lychee corn tortilla taco. Although I really enjoyed the duck taco, I definitely liked the beef lengua taco more since the duck tongue taco was too unique for my tastes. I also loved the Hao Gao dim sum - the insides combined pork and shrimp when its usually just shrimp. Very tasty stuff. The six pieces disappeared in my tummy quickly!I also ordered a carnitas taco, but it never came out. I inform the waiter of this and he said I never ordered it. I could have sworn that I did. What happens next? We receive our check, and the carnitas taco was on the bill! The supposed taco that I never ordered! I think the manager noticed my dejected look. He came over and asked us if we were okay and we told him what happened. Our waiter never returned but the manager helped make the correction on the bill and sincerely apologized. My summary: Food very interesting! Manager and hostess very friendly and nice. Waiter - I think you were having an off day or honestly forgot about us. You probably were tired or overworked and were ready to be done with the day. We had come in from a long road trip and just wanted to relax and have drinks and food. It was just a bad date between us and the restaurant that night.I had a really incredible lunch here that was a pleasant surprise. I almost didn't eat here due to the mediocre reviews but I am so glad that I gave it a chance! We were looking for a lighter, healthy lunch, not an easy thing to find in Las Vegas. We ended up at China Poblano as there weren't many other options near by. I thought it was going to be a mix of Chinese and Mexican flavors but it was actually just a combination of Chinese and Mexican dishes. The shrimp mojo was incredible. Eight shrimp were smothered in a yummy black garlic sauce that had a great kick with green poblanos. The tuna ceviche was another winner. Amaranth seeds gave it a nice crunch, but it was just a tad too salty. The beet salad was beautiful, simple and small. Pieces of beets, oranges and avocado were topped with slivers of pickled onion and an orange dressing. The golden pig dim sum was my least favorite item. They were super sweet and there wasn't enough meat in them. Overall service was very friendly. Food was great. It was surprisingly expensive as a lot of other reviewers have commented. I would come back but I'd skip the buns!
Grand Café=3 IN THE MORNINGOnce in a blue moon, we feel lucky (crazy) and play the slots into the wee morning. Of course, when we play hard, we get hungry too. Not an abundance of places open during this time of the morning. Grand Cafe is pretty much it for a Hendertucky selection.  It's been years since our last visit and then,  it wasn't so memorable. Yu-go's memory is like an elephant and he was not esstatic about my choice of this cavernous high ceilings cafe. Ordered corned beef deli sandwich on sourdough served with French Fries ... big thick lean tender meaty .. only take down is the cornbeef is served at room temperature  ... still enjoyable.Yu-go opted for prime rib dip also served with French Fries ... we both agreed it was of high quality without  the normal dry mouth attack episode from using a sandwich dip. BTW ... A++ for the fries.Past experience for waitstaff service was sparse. Not so this time around. Jarri was very much on top of everything. Most important, there wasn't a long wait for our food.A four star rating for good quality and pleasantly professional wait service. Can't imagine what business would be like if they ever decided to serve oxtail soup Hawaiian style, ramen and Tonkatsu Japanese curry over rice. More tgan Half of the diners happened to be Asian this morning.This place is for sure hit or miss. When I come here after 11 pm it seems they have way too many customers and not enough servers. I try to stick to coming here for lunch or in the early evening dinner but after a concert or night out on the town this cafe is open 24 hours and has pretty good late night specials. While out with some friends and it being after 1 am we decided on coming here. We were seated right away but as usual because of the hour it was, there was just not enough servers and service was slow. The following prices are from the "All-Nighter Boarding Pass Specials Menu" so you will need to have your stations boarding pass handy. I had the "2 Egg Bacon Skillet" priced at $3.99. My bacon was burnt and hard as a red rock (pardon the pun tee-hee) so I passed on eating anymore of the bacon then what I already disgustingly ate. The eggs were good, the hash browns were good even though they didn't add the cheddar cheese I requested when ordering, and the sourdough toast had way too burnt grill marks on certain sides. They did bring the cutest little jelly jars to the table in grape and strawberry. I used one to try and cover the burnt taste of my toast but did keep the others. I figure I can make a PB&J sandwich with it at home which will taste better. My hubby had the "Short Stack" priced at $1.99, "Biscuits & Gravy" priced at $1.99and a side of sausage. He enjoyed his meal. The pancakes were actually really good and priced perfectly. My friends ordered the "Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs" priced at $4.99 and the "NY Strip Steak & Eggs" priced at $5.99. We like to sample each others and one of my friends said her chicken fried steak tasted sour. I tried a bite and it had NO flavor. The server was kind enough to remove the charge from the bill. We all shared a "Tiramisu Cup" and it was more like a custard with no flavor. That is all.Went here at 2 in the morning with my fam and some Yelp peeps after just getting done with our bowling UYE.Already I have a bad first impression because as soon as the hostess saw there was about 12 of us, she told us it was gonna be about half an hour before we can get a table. As I looked around, it didn't seem like they were busy at all. I would say overall you had about 8 tables of customers being tended to. The feeling I was getting was that the hostess didn't really wanna be there.So after about 35 minutes we finally got to sit down. It took about 10 minutes before our server came to get our order. We were all actually ready with our orders but she said she was gonna take our drink order first and to put that in. That's stupid. We already had 10 minutes to go over the menu and decide what we want but yet she insisted on getting our drink orders first. So she brings our drinks out after about another 10 minutes. We give her our order and off she went. What happened next almost made me walk out. It took 30 minutes, yes, 30 MINUTES for her to bring out our food. She could have refilled my soda at least twice in that time frame and for your information she never did. So by the time we got our food, it was just a little after 3 am.I know what you're thinking. Since we had a party of 12, of course its natural that making that much food will take a while. Only thing was that all the food we ordered was off the graveyard special menu, meaning pancakes, eggs, biscuits and gravy, etc. So all the items we ordered were simple and quick things to make.The first couple times I ate here around the same time, it was decent. This third time, I am now convinced not to eat here any more. It seemed everybody's attitude that worked there was like they did not wanna be there. If you don't like your job, find something else. We as a party did not demand anything special or were rude in our interactions. Even the manager I spoke to said it was usually slow around that time. I think he didn't wanna be there either. So in closing, just because they are 24 hours and they have graveyard specials, that doesn't always translate to great service and great food. For this place, the food is decent but the really bad service gives you a bitter taste in your mouth. I recommend going to Fatburger in the food court. They are 24 hours as well but I guarantee you wont have to wait an hour to get your food.Great for breakfast plates!The reviews on this place aren't the best but I still enjoy it and if there's a long wait you can seat yourself right at the bar which has no wait time at all. It's actually a fun spot to chat with the bartenders who are always great and just enjoy your food. Breakfast is always great here with perfectly crispy bacon, hash browns, fresh eggs and toast that comes with whipped butter and a selection of jellies. I prefer strawberry & lay it on :)The actual restaurant is very pretty with lots of nice details & yes it's always busy especially in the evenings. I always say that's a good sign. The service is good and I wouldn't say they are the fastest so don't come here if you're in a rush. I prefer to enjoy myself & take my time...Overall it's a great place with a good traditional menu and the prices aren't too bad. I come here all the time to grab breakfast for dinner.
El Hefe=A friend and I stopped by this joint after having a few drinks at the W.  It's a short walk, couple of blocks, away.  It was the middle of the week around 9 pm and the place was half full....good crowd, decent vibe.  We saddled up to a table near the bar and close to the patio.  We ordered a couple of drinks and people watched for an hour or so.They serve a specialty Margarita here that's served in a large glass and a full Corona bottle turned upside down inside the glass, they call it a "Beer-garita".....it looks ridiculous.  Even more hilarious was the number of people who were walking around drinking this monstrosity....it reminds me of the tourists in Vegas who walk around with those giant tubes of Hurricanes or Margaritas....great people watching I tell ya!Our server was very attentive and made sure our glasses remained full.  The music was pretty good too....a DJ was playing house/dance music.  Overall, it was a fun time.Return Factor - 90%I'm NEVER coming here again!When I first came I was waiting in line forever while the security/bouncer let several people ahead of me. I didn't see them check anything off a list so they couldn't be VIP or anything like that.Then, I finally get in and the service just ISN'T there. I wait and wait and finally the bartender takes my order, and gives me a very weak drink! HELLO? I DIDN'T PAY $7 FOR A GLASS OF COCA COLA!! I ASKED FOR A JACK AND COKE!Don't believe the hype, this place sucks!Also El Hefe claims to have amazing tacos... I've had better tacos from a taco bus back home in Seattle, Washington.This place...just wasn't for me.  The company I work for took us on a mini-retreat to Scottsdale for a weekend, and a crew of us made our way over to El Hefe.  And...it was just....how do I put this nicely?Just not the Midwest.  All the women with fake tans, fake boobs spilling out of tanks, faux sexy hipsters mixed Men wearing tight Ed Hardy's with overly gelled hair & possible steriod use?  Just not my thing.And it wasn't just the crowd of people there.  I ordered two gin & tonics (same gin) and they tasted VASTLY different.  On top of that, there were the overly surly cocktailers who seemed to be pissed off that people were there drinking.  I mean, I get that you want to finish your side-work and get home, but when a bar is open (and it's not even midnight), you can't get pissed off at your customers for putting down a drink on a table in an open section.My favorite part of the night?  Leaving.  Sorry Boss.I really like to hate on this place. It's so easy (cue Staples Easy Button) - it's douchebag central. Ladies, if you want to find a roided out meathead, bro-tank wearing, Scottsdale doucher fist pumping the night away, you've come to the right place. Fellas, if you're looking for two-bit skank with hooha's hanging out of her child-sized wifebeater, you're in for a treat. So why the 4 stars? Because, when you're blacked out, this place is fun. Not gonna lie. It's the type of place you go to when you're already 5 shots deep and you're just lookin for trouble. I, personally, am a fan of house music so I love the loud, in-your-face music blaring overhead. Some people can't stand house, so preeettttyyyy sure this ain't the spot for them. Those of you looking for a mellow spot to sip on a marg should probs walk over to Cien Agave and relax there. But those of you looking to make some bad life decisions and who might want to make out with strangers should def head to good ol' Hefe. If it's not absurdly busy with people stomping on your feet with their 8 inch hooker wedges, def get a bulldog margarita. It's delish and can def help kick start your buzz. Proceed with caution friends.DO NOT BUY BOTTLE SERVICE HERE.... We called ahead and reserved a table.  They told us the table was 1 bottle minimum .  We usually get 1 bottle of grey goose and then just order drinks and shots from our server (spending just as much as a bottle).  Server was pouring EXTRA drinks without putting mixer in them and leaving them on the side of the table. Then I noticed her take one of them away as if it was an empty. Our server was also pouring very heavy, I don't usually mind and understand the server wants the bottle to finish quicker so we buy more. Once the bottle ran out the server told us we needed to buy another one. We said we would rather just run up a tab and buy shots, mixed drinks, etc etc.  (there was 8 of us and we would have easily ran up more money than a bottle in the same time frame of drinking a bottle).  THE SERVER TOLD US TO GET OFF THE TABLE SINCE WE ARE NOT BUYING ANOTHER BOTTLE....  This has never happened at Revolver, Smashbox, Firehouse, Axis, or American Junkie.. We said we would be running up an equal amount, she said the only way she would allow us to stay is if each of us racked up a $200 tab. Cliffs:Server was constanting pouring extra drinks and leaving them around our table.Server booted us from table for not buying another bottle even though we were willing to run up higher $$ tab.
Spanish Fly=Spanish fly opened where the old Drift was, and I gotta say that the minute you walk in you feel like you are on vacation. The palm trees, the colorful mosaic tiles, fruity cocktails and pool area complete with a water fall take you away from  your day to day routine. There are a few tables set up, as well as ample seating in the bar areas, and lets not forget the cabanas! My friends and I received great customer service from the bartenders, and when we moved over to check out the pool area the servers were just as attentive. The menu provided an array of cocktails that were both tempting and seemingly refreshing, as well as a variety of food items. Im sure this place will be busy for the summer pool party season.You do realize that this isn't the pool at Mandalay? And you realize, on Monday, you will have to go back to the cash register and US Magazine? And really, you thought it would be a good idea to get a tattoo of your dog on your shoulder?...next to the tribal swirl? All questions I didn't ask, but did wonder, while at Spanish Fly. If you want to hang out at or near a pool with Scottsdale's "finest", well this is the place. It is presently Exhibit A. Of course, at night, stay out of that pool! No, I am serious, they will physically take you out if need be. But, during the day, you and dog tattoo boy can hang out in the water all day. The service is friendly, well minus the typical Scottsdale door people, who generally fail, as always, to remember that they are not working the new hot club in LA or NYC (come on people, South Park makes fun of Scottsdale!!). Oddly, at night (because of the pool I presume), you need to sign a waiver...I will leave it aside as to whether that waiver would ever hold up in court. The drinks run the norm, but I've never had the food, however I did see someone carrying out sushi rolls to a table in the 100 degree heat...ummm, no thanks. The DJs...ehhh, the usual, but better than Drift. If you want to see 20 somethings in bikinis, a few cougars on the prowl, high rise baseball hats, shorts and high tops, and really bad tattoos...plus catch some water and sun, this is a good spot. It is worth a 30 minute show if there is no cover, but it is hard to swallow as an afternoon hang out, and I would never pay to get in.Reserved a cabana for a friends bachelorette through VIP Services (highly advertised on their website).  Had been here a few times before, no issues, had a lot of fun.  Once I determined that Spanish Fly would work for us, there were multiple e-mails back and forth between the VIP host and myself about details for the event and I had confidence that everything would be made perfect for our group of 25 girls that night.  I talked it up to many in our group because others had made different suggestions as to other places for the evening, but I really pushed for Spanish Fly because of the way the communication was going with the VIP host and myself.  I truly felt they would make my friend feel special.  Unfortunately, I could not have been more wrong.  When I arrived with the 20+ girls in my group, I discovered that absolutely none of the decorations I hand delivered in 2 separate trips that day (at the offering/suggestion of the host) had been set up in our cabana (which was not even a cabana...just a square couch with a folded down umbrella. Cabanas are reserved only for those getting bottle service).  I was taken to a back office to speak with the hostes and a manager and was told that there were multiple bachelorette parties that evening and there was some confusion as to who's decorations were for which party.  I had clearly labeled my decorations with a very large slip of paper with the bride's name on it (who the reservation for the evening was under) so I'm not quite sure where the confusion came into play, and the other bachelorette party I saw there that evening didn't appear to have any decorations.  I also sent the host an e-mail after I finished dropping off the 2nd set of decorations the day of the party asking if I needed to do anything else to be sure that the decorating was taken care of as I wanted to be certain everything would be set up for us when we arrived.  It was a terrible disappointment that it wasn't.  Not only did I miss out on all of the fun at the hotel pool with the rest of the bridal party so I could drop things off at the club, but the situation made me, as the organizer, look like I was the one who let the ball drop.  To make matters worse, while the host ran around trying to set things up at the last minute, nobody was told to come and take care of us while we waited.  The manager should certainly have been the one to be sure that was happening rather than continuing to sit in the back office.  The host finally showed us to our seat, which wasn't the area where I had originally requested at all, but completely on the opposite side of the club and as far away from the dance floor as possible.  We were finally brought some complimentary shots, and what I thought were complimentary pitchers of drinks to make up for our trouble.  However, at the end of the evening, I was charged for the pitchers as well.  Every other bar we had been to that evening happily to provided our party with complimentary shots, even if it was just in passing.  Had I known the shots were all that the hostess was providing us with for this huge faux pas, I would have asked her to give me my bag of decorations and left.  Awesome service by Jenn, can't say enough good things about her.  DJ and his house music sucked.  When the server has a party who's been seriously pissed off, get over yourself and play the bride-to-be a remix of the song she wants to hear.  Have written a letter to the owner.  If he corrects the situation, I will change my rating.
Coasta Cantina=While on this side of town taking care of some errands, I suggested this place to hubby since we were passing by it anyway. I have eaten here many times in the past but it had been a while so I was curious to see what had changed if anything. They now have a "Coasta Cantina Express" which is right where you walk in to be seated in the actual restaurant. If you don't want to eat inside this gives you the option to just grab it to-go. I would think you could just order it to-go from inside the restaurant the same but maybe people don't think about that and having the express makes them realize that they want a taco. The express menu is limited compared to the menu inside but has the standard favorites. You can choose tacos, burritos, salads, rice bowls, quesadillas, nachos, soda, water and it wouldn't be Vegas unless they sold beer and they do that too. $4 a beer! Eating inside gets you free chips, salsa & bean dip but if you want it from the express it is going to cost you $3.50 (no beans just chips & salsa) and $1.95 if you want to add rice and beans to your order. Now that I was finished being nosy about the express option I decided eating inside would be better for us. We were seated right away and had our drink orders taken. The person bringing us refills was spot on he was quick to refill our chips & salsa or ask if we needed anything but our server lacked a lot of things. It took her 15 minutes for her to even come over and see us and then 5 more minutes until she came back to take our order. We finished 2 rounds of chips & salsa before she came over to us. They weren't very busy at all so I don't know what the deal was. The chips & salsa are good and the bean dip is amazing. It tasted just like I remembered it. When it came to the main course I ordered the "Cheese Enchiladas" made with flour tortillas. It came with a side of beans (I know I said it but the beans are so tasty!) and rice. It wasn't terrible at all but it wasn't spectacular. I think it could be due to the fact that the plate wasn't very warm when it arrived. I was able to get it for $7.99 after I showed my players card. Currently if you have a players card then on weekdays before 6 pm you can get a 2 item combo for just $7.99. My meal would have been $11 with out the deal. Score! Hubby ordered a "Shredded Beef Burrito" priced at $12 and had it smothered for 99 cents more. He enjoyed it and found the size to be good but again the food was sorta cold. This could have been easily given more stars by me if the server did her job and if the food wasn't on the cold side. I will more then likely leave this location to the tourists and stick to the location closer to my home.
In-N-Out Burger=It's been a while since I've had In N Out, so yesterday I decided to stop by for lunch. I had been to the dentist earlier that morning & my teeth were still hurtin, so I decided to avoid any long drive thru lines & go after the lunch rush at about a quarter till 2pm. When I pulled up there was still a bit of a wait, about 6 or 7 cars were in front of me. I can only imagine how long that line gets at noon! Any way, I ordered a #2 animal style with a dr. pepper. Everything was so tasty & I finished it all! Total for a cheeseburger, medium drink & fries was less than 6 bucks, so awesome. Best fast food burger by far!P.S. I love how pleasant the employees working at In N Out are, it's very refreshing :)
The Las Vegas Grille=Driving to the library I noticed a white banner advertising the opening of another new restaurant on W. Sahara Ave (same strip mall as Swish).  So I decided to give The Las Vegas Grille (former site of CJ Texas BBQ) a try on my way back.  The restaurant looks spacious, tables are not crowded together, and the chalkboard menu looks beautiful, and there is a big smoker near the cashier.  It is a barbecue restaurant with a menu that can be categorized into the following major groups: barbecue meats, handmade sausages, meatballs, and sandwiches made from barbecue meats or meatballs, salads, side items, and desserts. The lady at the counter plus all the staff at the restaurant were all very nice.  As this was my first visit, it took me awhile to look at the entire menu, but they were patient and offered suggestions to help me decide on what to try.  I was thinking about the St. Louis BBQ Ribs, but ultimately went with the 4 Meats 3 Sides Combo, which consisted of Beef Sirloin, BBQ Chicken with Pineapple Ginger Jerk Sauce, Applewood Roasted Herb Crusted Pork Loin, and Handmade Sausage (Artisan's Bratwurst)  for the meats, and Bavarian Potato Salad, Rainbow Slaw and Rotini Pasta Salad for the sides.  Before I was done with my meal, I also ordered all three of their meatballs (Arisan's Fusion Meatball made with beef and pork, Sweet & Sour Hawaiian made with pork, beef and ham, and finally the Southwest Green Chile Meatball made with chicken and turkey).As long as I can remember, I have always enjoyed charcuterie items, from Taiwanese and Chinese sausages to artisan German and Italian sausages and hot links from the South.  After culinary school and having had the opportunity to attend a master's class on charcuterie taught by CMC Fritz Sonnenschmidt (master chef, author and leading authority on the subject), I learned to appreciate it even more.  And out of all the items I ordered, I would say that their Artisan Bratwurst was my favorite.  It is also very healthy, as far as cured meat products goes, as they do not use nitrites, nitrates or MSG in their curing process, instead they utilized a high heat smoke curing method.  The result is sausages that have a nice flavor, good smokiness, and not overly salty.The Applewood Roasted Herb Crusted Pork Loin was also very good.  It has the nice smoke ring, indicative of true barbecue, and the pork was still juicy and packed with flavor.  Undoubtedly, it would be great in a sandwich as well.The BBQ Chicken with Pineapple Ginger Jerk Sauce has nice flavor, but was a little on the dried side.  The White Oak Roasted Beef Sirloin was okay, it definitely has the smoky flavor, but was otherwise too much on the well done and dried side for me to appreciate or enjoy it.The meatballs were pretty good. Served as it, it is too salty for me (but my personal preference leans towards less salt), but serve it in a sandwich it will be just right.I like restaurants that strive to serve healthier and more natural foods, and this place definitely does that!  Although they do not make their own breads, they do sourced them from a local artisan bakery (Great Buns Bakery), which makes a good pretzel bread.Overall, it is a good barbecue restaurant that can be even better with more fine tuning.  And personally I would be here just for their sausage sandwiches, which currently is available in the following selections: Artisan's Bratwurst, Italian Fennel Sausage, Keilbasa Polska, Kids Beef Frankfurter, Mediterranean Sun-dried Tomato, and New Mexico Chile.Food:  3/5  Some items are super good, while others were okay.Price:  3/5  Reasonable.Ambiance and decor:  3/5  Spacious arrangement, minimally decorated restaurant with a giant shinny barbecue smoker right inside the restaurant, staffed by friendly restaurant personnel. Location:  West side, just down the street from the car dealerships on W. Sahara Ave.Parking:  4/5  Plentiful parking.Cleanliness:  5/5  New, and kept in pristine condition by the restaurant staff.A-OK!Eating at the Las Vegas Grille was like watching the first season of the Simpsons.  Very, Very rough around the edges but you can tell there is a lot of potential there.My first visit to this new entry on the Westside dining scene was on a Saturday night and I found the place to be more on the empty side.  I attribute this to a an odd location within a non-descript strip mall on Sahara.  I was impressed however with the gigantic electric smoker they have staring down at you as you walk through the doors.  The menu immediately strikes you as shouting "not your typical bbq place."  Sure they offer standards like Ribs & Chicken, but they also have a selection of fresh made sausages, meatballs and other non-traditional bbq meats like pork loin.  You can order the meats a la carte, in sandwich form as as combo.   Rather than bore everyone with the fine details of the meal, here were the highlights:-The side options are phenomenal.  Not only do the offer a unique variety, everything we had was top notch.  I absolutely loved the Bavarian Potato Salad (no mayo, with vinegar) and the Red Cabbage.  -The Kielbasa on the pretzel roll was tasty, large, and a definite value at 7.99-The pork loin and sirloin were both captured the essence of properly smoked meats.  I could tasted the rich earthy taste that smoking gives meat.-The guys running the place seem passionate about making the restaurant into something great.  They were friendly and genuinely wanted us to understand their menu.-Prices were reasonable for a meat joint.But there were some lowlights as well:-The ribs had a great rub on them, the sauce was tasty but there was very little meat.  By that I mean they give you a fair number of ribs per se, they just use really small ribs. -Speed of service.  You order at a counter giving the impression the food will be coming out relatively fast, yet we waited 1 minutes despite their being only one other table.  Im all for waiting for quality, but let the customers know that it might take that long and perhaps offer free biscuits or cornbread....just a thought.I really liked a number of things at the Las Vegas Grille, but you can tell they still haven't found their feet yet.  I hold out high hopes for them because its always good to see the Vegas dining scene diversify with unique choices.  My 3 stars represents a restaurant in their first month, but it certainly doesnt capture all the potential that is there.The Simpsons were able to refine their show before they got canceled, lets hope the Las Vegas Grille can do the same!Been DYING to come back here after Misti's wonderful CMYE at LVG last month.  The restaurant.com coupon made the meal even better although $35 worth of food for 2 is basically a buffet at the table :PLVG has the best ribs I've eaten in Las Vegas.  It's true!  I'm all about St. Louis style ribs now and on the verge of texting baby back ribs to tell them we're through.  The juicy tenderness and smokey flavor make them truly unbeatable.That's not the only thing that's awesome here.  Thai green curry sausage!!  Amazing.  Phil's a genius!  Not me but the owner haha.  The bbq chicken is also super good.  The breast was actually juicier than the thigh somehow.  The red cabbage, red potato salad and pasta salad sides accompanied all the meats perfectly with the pasta being our top favorite of the 3.  We were on senior citizen time and ate dinner around 4pm so we were the only ones in there.  We chatted it up with Phil for a good part of the dinner and he informed us of some great new additions to the menu coming up in December like prime rib and double smoked ham.  Like you needed more of a reason to come here...more of a reason to come here everyday!!!This is a hard review to write.  Not because I don't know what to say, or how to say it.  No, this is a hard review to write because all I will be thinking about for the rest of the day is The Las Vegas Grille's BBQ.  After trying Phil's homemade sausages, I feel like every sausage I've had up to this point has been a lie.  These are the links you've been looking for.The sausages here are truly homemade, from the grinding to the smoking.  Phil, Las Vegas Grille's owner, has absolute control over his final product.  The first half of the equation is what to put inside the sausage.  The other half is the wood he uses to smoke the meat.  It may be cliche to say "quality over quanity," but it totally applies here!  The easy way out would be to throw all of your different meats into the smoker, and cook them all at the same time, which would give a similar flavor profile to all the meats.  Instead, Phil takes care to pair each meat with a specific type of wood and smoke them separately.  Longer process?  Yes.  More unique and distinct flavors?  Absolutely!My favorites have been the Thai Curry sausage and the Sundried Tomato sausage.  Yes, they really do taste like curry and sundried tomatoes, and have an awesome smoked flavor as well.  In my pre-LVG life I would have said that sausages came in two varieties: plain or spicy.  Phil has opened the door to artisan sausages, and there is no turning back.  Sausage sandwiches?  Not no more.  You don't need bread interfering with what these sausages offer. You can also order combos and get different meats for your meal.  On my most recent visit I went with a 2-meat 1-side combo for $9.99: Thai Curry Sausage, Sirloin with red wine sauce, and herb roasted potatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DO3FefiMYiPYsEl6O8W2dw?select=-lGXHtFOQ8wCSmeD3YE8dA).  The sirloin was oh so tender and came with a swiss and horseradish aioli.  I found myself using a lot of the aioli, as the red wine sauce on the sirloin was a bit sweet for my tastes.Excellent experience all around.  Friendly service that will walk you through the menu.  Be sure to talk to Phil to truly see what makes this place so special.  One of his newest menu items are smoked chicken wings, which I haven't tried yet.  Looks like I'll be making another trip to The Las Vegas Grille real soon...Although I'm one of the most proud Texan girls you will ever meet, for whatever reason I escaped a Texas upbringing without developing a fondness for BBQ. In fact, I kind of hate BBQ. Some might say I'm not a real Texan, but I digress...I waited a long time to try this place for some silly reason. I guess I figured it was yet another BBQ place, and I'd hate it just like all the rest. Luckily, LVG is something DIFFERENT! If you are craving Memphis or Texas style BBQ, you might be disappointed.. but for those of us who don't like BBQ or for you BBQ-lovers who can appreciate a completely different experience, this place is nirvana !So my favorite item on the menu is actually the smoked salmon sandwich. In general I hate fish sandwiches and find them icky, but this is the best fish on bread this girl has ever eaten! They smoke their own salmon and pair it with a lemon garlic aioli.. YUMMMMM. I like mine on ciabbata - it's perfection! (On a side note, the local bakery they get their breads from is INCREDIBLE, and they have the most fresh perfect ciabbata ever ! I have yet to have a sandwich on stale bread here!). Another favorite of mine is the BBQ chicken sandwich with that insane pineapple jerk sauce.. So many things to try and love! Meatballs, sausages, wood-fire roasted wings... .this carnivore couldn't be happier! The staff is friendly, the restaurant is clean, the prices are reasonable.. GO NOW.. :)
Viva Las Arepas=Yummy cheap street eats. It's a happening food truck without the wheels, no need to follow em' on twitter, they are here to stay. I am in no way shape or form an expert on the food of Venezuela, but I know delish when I taste it, and there are some mighty fine treats coming out of this window. I sampled strictly the Arepas. What the heck is an Arepa? Kind of a grilled corn shell, like a mash up of a sope and papusa, but hand sliced down the middle like a hamburger bun. After that just pick the filling(s) you want and enjoy. I particularly like the black bean and cheese and the tongue. Perico is the kitchen sink and really good too. Don't forget that crazy good green sauce, don't worry, it's not hot, but does burst with flavor. Arepas run $2.75-$4.00 Empanadas are $1.99 Venezy drinks are $1.49-dude hooked me up with free refills, don't know if that's the norm though. I tried 2 beverages Parchita which is a very sweet fruit punch thing, and the star by far was the Guanabana drink, which comes from the native southern hemisphere fruit of the same name. Very light, clean and refreshing taste. Bonus, they claim only fresh ingredients and no MSG, no microwave, and no can openers.Hit I LUV AREPAS for a quick lunch snack - I think it's actually smaller than a food truck !  I originally thought it replaced the Naked City Sammie space but not true - a stand alone shack on Dino's  parking lot ( maybe it uses the NC space for prep work ... not sure ) Had the pollo arepas ( $3 ) and the carne ( $3.50 ) Comes with a side of spicy and mild sauce - damned if I know what's in them  the spicy had a smokiness to it, theMild a cream base - both very good.The arepas ??  I actually like the pollo more but both were very good.  They basically take a corn based thick pancake,  cut in 1/2 and stuff with meat - no frills - simple food with great flavor .I wanted a bacon dog ($2.25 ) but not ready yet - next time because there will be many next timescrappy pics addedYUM.  I tried arepas for the first time last night, and I'm sold.  These things are amazing.  I was swooning with every bite.I had spoken with the owner earlier in the week and he told me that the arepa dough is made with milk, but that he would be happy to make me a special vegan one if I was willing to wait for it.  Well, Saturday night, drunk and hungry, I was more than willing to wait.  And I am so glad that I did! He made me a gorgeous arepa filled with black beans, and topped with freshly sliced avocado and tomato.  I have not stopped thinking about this food since I finished eating it, and I will definitely be going back soon.The arepa dough was crispy from the grill on the outside (and btw, they cleaned the grill and made mine off to the side of all the other ones!) and almost fluffy on the inside.  The fillings were so fresh and tasty too! Every bite put a smile on my face.  As a regular at Dino's, I am so thrilled to have a late night, vegan friendly food option to help me soak up the booze! And I really appreciate how super friendly and accommodating the folks who run the place were.  My carnivorous friends went crazy over their non-vegan pork arepas too... and in fact everyone I saw get food there seemed pleased.  If you've never tried arepas you have been missing out!Love at first bite! Wow! Wow! Wow! Finally had the chance to enjoy this Venezuelan treasure! My gal pal and I got the Royal treatment on our first visit! I ordered a Pepsi with my order, and the Head Chef/Owner Felix gave me a sample of the Passion fruit juice, I said yes I'll have that!!!!! Natural Fruit Juices...Mango and Passion fruit mmmmm so yummy! You must order a fruit juice, forget soda. Trust me! I ordered a shredded beef empanada, my friend ordered two different types of Arepas, we both got a natural fruit juice. We sat in my (air conditioned) car to eat as it was hot hot hot outside and this was 10pm at night, ugh. They brought us our order to the car where an awesome conversation was started with the Owner Felix. So we chatted with Felix for a bit at the car, we informed him it was our first time trying them out. He gave us a bit of the History behind it all and how he previously worked with Mario Batali! He said I must try something so he went and made a Reina Pepiada Arepa for me to try! He told me I am the Reina Pepiada, whatever that means, lol Wow, it was Amazing! Delicious, melted in my mouth, full of flavor! He also wanted me to try his Cod empanada since I told him how much I love seafood. Mmmmmm yummy soooooo good, that also melted in my mouth like butta! The best way I have ever eaten cod fish in my life, in form of an empanada. Not just any Empanada but his which is the best! He also made a beef empanada for my girl Karen to try, mmmm she loved it, the best empanada ever. Felix...thank you for treating us so special and taking the time to hang out with us! You truly hooked us up and spoiled us so well!We will be back sooner than you think! Muchos Besos!I have long avoided this place for two reasons: one, I despise the food truck trend. And two, my previous experience with arepas was limited to some mystery-meat-stuffed weirdness at a bus depot in the Venezuelan hinterlands.But yesterday, as I was driving past the street corner where the Arepa boys do business...out of the corner of my eye I noticed that the proprietors were two hot Venezuelan dudes of childbearing age. Hell-O! I did a quick U-turn and pulled into the parking lot. As mentioned, my previous experience with arepas left me skeptical...but the hotness of the staff, and the fact that it's not actually a food truck, but more of a dingy kiosk unadorned with Twitter and Facebook logos, convinced me to give 'em a second try. And now.......... I, too, Love Arepas!I only had one -- the bean and cheese. But it was fantastic!! WAY better than the ones I had in Venezuela (they hate Americans down there, so they probably pissed in my arepa at that bus depot). At $3.50 it was a filling mini-meal...and actually stuck to my ribs through three cocktails, preventing me from getting wasted and doing embarrassing things down on Fremont St.IMO this is hands down the best dining in all of Vegas -- cheap, unpretentious, delicious and al fresco. You can sit at the little tables in front of the arepa pod and enjoy the scenery of the neighborhood: a strip club, a dive bar and an all-night drugstore patronized by pimps and weirdos. I will MOST DEFINITELY be coming here again and again and again -- and that's just with the hot proprietors. I'll come to the kiosk again, too :-)Hidden GemHole in the wallSmall crappy looking shack that serves delicious grubAll three of these phrases perfectly describe Viva Las Arepas, but I like the third one the best!Located at the end of the strip, on Las Vegas Blvd, just a few blocks past the Stratosphere Hotel, sits a small, ugly white shack in a deserted parking lot that serves up some of the tastiest little snacks in all of Las Vegas. Viva Las Arepas serves up some of the best tasting Arepas I've ever eaten. For those of you who aren't familiar with Arepas, they're pretty much small, fried cornmeal pockets stuffed with meats, cheese, veggies, sauce, etc, etc. Viva also makes empanadas, a few hot dogs, aguas frescas, and a few sweet treats like flan and more. They also have these two amazing shack-made sauces. One is a lime green color that's mild but has an amazing flavor and the other is a spicy red sauce. Since my wife and I were going to have a big dinner the same day we visited Viva, we decided to just get a few items to try. This is what we purchased;Lengua Arepa W/ White Cheese & Avocado Slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=8lN2NE_nQzG-VFNGfeR1hAGround Beef & Shredded Cheese Arepa  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=-dY7b8L5QpT1MPtSHG34ugBlack Bean & Cheese Empanada http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=D_dkKgnCHti4moXUxO85vQAll three items were incredibly delicious. The cornmeal pockets were perfectly fried yet still had a soft center. The Lengua, which was shredded and cooked in a delicious sauce, was my fave of the two. It was savory, sweet and slightly spicy all at the same time. The ground beef Arepa reminded me of a Taco Bell Chalupa, but obviously much better. The black bean and cheese empanada was also very good. To wash down our yummy snacks we had a large Passion Fruit aguas frescas. It was super sweet and super refreshing. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=Wz0vow2OgM5E5N6lMQP07Q The prices for each Arepa are about $3 or $4 bucks a piece, which isn't too bad considering how delicious they are. The guys who were working in the shack were all friendly and got our food out to us quickly. If you're in LV and feel like something quick, tasty and cheap, don't go to some crappy chain place like McDonald's, head on down to Viva Las Arepas and treat yourself to some phenomenal Arepas. Trust ME.My first Arepas and is was Viva Las Vegas good!I had to try this place after reading Craig R's review.  I've never had an Arepas before so I was looking forward to trying it.  This place is a stand alone shack on the corner at the end of the north side of the strip.  Seriously its a shack, you cant miss it cuz it sticks out!!!  They have some tables set outside so there are places to for you to eat there.  Saw a few that just swung by and got it to go.   An Arepa is a flat, round and soft patty made out of cornmeal, which is grilled, making it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and then it can be stuffed with beef, chicken, ham, cheese, beans, shrimp, and many more. These delights are gluten-free, and wheat-free.  Aside from arepas (hot/cold) they also serve empanadas and hallacas which are like tamales.SInce I was having a really late dinner I decided to try 2 and got a #5 and #7 with a mango drink to wash is down.  I sat down and waited about 10 min and the guy brought it out. #5 Roasted Pork Butt  (Pernil) which is Slow Cooked Marinated Pork, Fresh Tomato Slices and cheese.  Damn this was tasty good.  Great flavored pork, tender and juicy.  The cornmeal was grilled perfectly with a crisp!#7 Reina Pepiada which is Shredded Chicken Breast, Avocado,  Mayonnaise, Cilantro, Green Peas.  Was like a chicken salad as this was a cold version.  They look small but they are actually pretty big and was only able to eat half of this one as I was totally full. The guy told me about the 2 homemade sauces they have on the table.  One is green and a milder version but with a really good flavor.  I would buy some of this good stuff.  The red was obviously spicy and so I didn't really use it but it was good.  This place may look questionable but let me tell you this is a great hole in the wall place to hit up when your in LV.  It's way off the strip so you wont have to deal with lines and strip prices.  They have great tasty food Eyes ~ Ok its on the corner and the seats are pretty much on the sidewalk.Nose ~ Not much to smell when your outside and the wind whipping!Ear ~ Cars cars cars!Mouth ~ Damn tasty arepas!Tummy ~ Stop stuffing more food mouth, I'm freaking full yo!The BF and I were close and needed some snackies. We ordered a pork arepa, 2 bean and cheese empanada and mango to drink. The mango drink was really good. It was not too sweet, fresh and refreshing. I coulda had a few of those since it was a hot day. When our order came it was the wrong order. We got one meat arepa and a bean and cheese arepa so we figured maybe she didn't hear the empanada part and perhaps got us a arepa instead? Oh well, we'll eat it anyways. The bean and cheese was yummy with flavorful beans. The meat turned out to be beef (unless my taste buds are wonky) but it was so tender and fantastic. Normally shredded beef is somewhat stringy, but not this. I normally wouldn't order beef but here I would definitely consider it. The arepa was wonderfully crispy on the outside and had some chewiness inside that was addictive. I can eat those alone even. Don't skimp on the mustardy hot sauce and the creamy sauce as both make the arepas even better, I think! Eventually I guess they realized it wasn't that they got our order wrong, we got someone elses order! The guy on the grill (I'm assuming is the owner) was apologetic about it and gave us 2 bean and cheese empanadas anyways which was cool of him. It was not what I expected at all. I was thinking more like pastry dough type empanadas, but the consistency was like the breading that is around corn dogs which lead the BF and I trying to figure out how they make it. These were tasty but since I'm a Hot Dog On the Stick fan, I'm definitely ordering just a plain cheese one next time. Now that its hot, it's gonna suck to come visit but I definitely enjoyed that meal and want to come back again soon.Blame it on the A-a-a-a-a-alcohol if you want, but the food this place puts out was like mana from heaven at midnight last Saturday night. We were leaving Dino's and a friend suggested we get Arepas, since I'd never tried them before. We got a beef arepa and a lingua arepa. When i tasted the yummy, cheesy, tender filling surrounded by the moist corn flour wrap I could barely put it down. I love that they leave the sauce on the side, so you can add it to your liking. The shredded beef was so tender and hearty. The lingua (beef tongue) tasted very similar to a slow cooked pot roast that had been shredded and sauteed with peppers and onions. It was spicy and the accompanying sauce made it even more so. It was delicious! It took some liquid courage to get me to try it, but now I'm hooked! I'm actually considering driving there on my lunch hour today (completely sober of course)! This place is a must try if you've never had an Arepa, or if you're close to downtown and hungry!Short review!  (will include an update in a month)Viva Las Arepas!!!  Oh Viva Las Arepas!Located on an unseemly street corner (Believe it was LVB/just pass Charleston - be sure to be on the look out!)  sits a tiny little 10x12 shack of goodness!This past Vegas trip was all about exploring the local food scene outside of the main strip, and boy did we experience some delicious treats such as these Arepas!Since it was simply a tasting... our part of 4 decided to share on one arepa... Reina Pepidas!  Yes... 4 sharing one......Reina Pepidas is this arepa (corn meal bun toasted with savory fillings) that is filled with shredded chicken mixed with cilantro, avocado, green peas, and mayo..... just think of it as a chicken salad sandwich on steroids!Super delicious!!!!!  The flavor of the cilantro and avocado coupled with slightly crispy buns of the corn meal made this a super filling yet delicious treat before actual lunch!  Sauces comes with it too... I believe one of them is a delicious non-spicy cilantro sauce while another one is a spicy salsa that could potential knock your socks off!  Mixing all the flavors together will create a different yet awesome flavor that you surely don't want to miss.Our party was looking at the pork butt arepa but since we were heading over for actual lunch, we decided to give it a try next time...Is there a next time?  Hell ya!  They've done pretty well to a point that we noticed that an actual storefront is in the works just closely down the street... I bet it's going to be crowded when that completed...But in the mean time, be sure to keep your eyes open for the little tiny shack that is on a street corner.... don't judge the book by it's covers.... you will be pretty amazed on what you find here at Viva Las Arepas!  Until next time Arepas!!!I wanted to have lunch and try something different and Viva Las Arepas came to mind.  As I drove down Sahara, I was wondering if it was wise of me to go here today when we were having a sprinkling of rain and take a chance of sitting outside in 50 degree temperature or else eating in the car.  What a surprise to find they had moved from their small stand with no interior except for cooking and serving into their own strip mall store!  Having read my good friend Holly's Yelp review, I knew I was going to get the pork arepa.  That and a can of diet Coke came to $4.99 plus tax--a great price for a good lunch.  After placing the order, the woman at the counter said they'd bring my lunch to the table and she told me to sit anywhere I wanted.The sandwich came quickly along with three plastic bottles--one with mayonnaise, and the other two with their sauce, one spicy and one mild.  They're in mustard/ketchup kind of plastic squeeze bottles with the mayo in white, the mild sauce in the yellow container, and the spicy one in red!  Appropriate.  I tried some of the spicy sauce and I was hooked!I wish I had taken a bit more time to really savor this wonderful sandwich but I snorted a few times and it was gone!  The pork was very flavorful and tender, and the arepas dough was cooked very well.  This was my first time having one but it will not be my last.  I have to go back and try some of the other things.  It's too good of a place to pass up anymore.  And now with an indoor restaurant, I won't stay away because it's over 100 out and I won't have to worry about a few raindrops on my head!Viva Las Arepas!NO LATIN TRANSLATOR NECESSARY!It seems like everytime I go to any Latin restaurant, I need a real live Rosetta Stone for any questions I have. Either that or I need subtitles when an employee talks to me. LOL.Anyways, back to my review. I have heard good things about this place from all my Yelp buddies so that alone is good motivation. I have heard of arepas but never actually had them. For those noobs like me, its a dish made of ground corn dough or cooked flour, very prominent in the cuisine of Colombia and Venezuela. So you can put two of them together with your choice of meat and other toppings. I ordered carne asada with cheese. I scarfed it down like a it was the last piece of food I will ever see again. They have other delectable choices as well but when you go to a highly recommened place, you get what is popular so their namesake lived up to the hype.Service is awesome! They answer all the questions you have and even make suggestions based on what you are leaning towards. They bring it out to you where you sit with two ketchup bottles. One has a light green colored kind of sauce and the other has a light reddish tint to it. Both have different spices to it but the reddish colored one has a little kick to it. Not overpowering, but definitely gives your food that extra oomph that keeps your mouth watering.As for their location, they used to be half a block up the street in a little taco stand. They are now on the corner of Oakey and S Las Vegas Blvd, just kitty corner to 7/11. Look for the weird Indian statues because they are neighbors with an Indian antique store.  I guess with their recent popularity, they moved to this spacious building. They have plenty of tables and chairs so bring your friends. Plenty of room.The only negative things I can see is that the parking is kind of limited. The old Indian statues take up several parking stalls and the stalls are small to begin with so be real careful in parking and backing up. Also they charge 50 cents for using cards to pay for anything under 10 dollars. So if I ever make a trip to South America, at least I know what and how good arepas are. VIVA LAS AREPAS!Viva Las Vegas? Nah, Viva Las Arepas!A couple of buddies told me about this place and how they have cheap yet satisfying food. My cousin and I took a trip on a Tuesday afternoon for some grub. The restaurant is located on the left when going north on Las Vegas Blvd on Wyoming. The place is quite clean and large with tables and booths.  There are pictures of their food items posted all over the restaurant. Those helped with familiarizing myself with their food items but didn't help in the sense for me to choose what I wanted since they all looked so delicious! After reading Yelp reviews and getting a recommendation from the girl behind the counter, my cousin and I decided to get the Reina Pepiada. In between two warm cornbread slices, there was shredded chicken breast with avocado, mayo, cilantro and green peas. The consistency was almost like a chicken salad. I was a little thrown off with how warm the cornbread slices were and how cold the chicken concoction was. But I got past this in a hot minute and chowed down happily. We were given a red bottle (spicy hot sauce) and a yellow bottle (mild hot sauce) to have with our arepas. A little sprinkle of some hot sauce (I like the spicy but the mild is good, too) with each bite is key to elevate flavors. And a side note, don't be fooled by the "small" size of the arepa. This little baby fills you up. I walked out of there overly stuffed. To wash it all down, we each ordered a fruit juice. What's cool is that they let you try samples before you buy one. My cousin ordered the guava juice and I ordered the mango. I expected the juices to be a little thick, but they weren't. Very refreshing and not too sweet. Doesn't taste artificial. I think I will end up craving their mango juice during the hot Vegas summer months.If you find a silly Asian girl chanting "long live the arepa!" here, that's me. If you find a female Asian bum on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming with a sign that says "will work for arepas," that's me, too. That being said, you all get the point. Go get some arepas!I woke up this morning and all I could think of was AREPAS! I asked people where this place is at since all I know is that it's close to Olympic Garden. I used my GPS to help me find this place and brought me to Art of Flavors. Where is this place? Ah, it's right next door to Art of Flavors tucked in the corner.After a yummy experience from an arepas foodtruck, we got garlic shrimp arepa, pork butt arepa with cheese, Reina Pepiada arepa, wood fire chicken arepa and fried plantains. They have more options here compared to the foodtruck which is not surprising. The prices are about the same. But the arepa itself is less toasted and is heavier than the foodtruck version. The cilantro sauce is equally as good, this place's spicy/red sauce is spicier. I had to try their guanabana juice to compare it to what I had when I was a kid. Garlic Shrimp Arepa:No tomatoes or veggies, just straight up garlic shrimp. I liked this a lot especially with the cilantro sauce which elevates the garlic flavor of the shrimp.  5/5Roasted Pork Butt:Comes with tomato slices. Add cheese. In case you didn't know, pork butt = pork shoulder and not the actual butt of a pig. Tasty pork. Both the spicy and cilantro sauce work well with this. 4/5Reina Pepiada Arepa:Cold chicken with mayo, avocado and cilantro. Tastes just like the one from the arepas foodtruck. A much better version of a chicken salad. 5/5Wood Fire Chicken Arepa:Really flavorful chicken with tomato, onions and lettuce. 4/5Fried Plantains:I love this stuff. My mom would fry some plantains for me as a snack when I was a kid. So simple and easy to make yet it tastes so good. The natural sweetness of the plantains come out when you fry them in high temperatures. Eventhough they could have gotten rid of the excess oil, I still like these things. 5/5Guanabana:AKA soursop juice and in Filipino, guyabano. This tastes like concentrate mixed with lots of sugar and water. I couldn't taste soursop. 3/5After that meal, we headed next door for dessert. After dessert, I decided to come back here so I can try the chicharron with fried yucca. Shawn tapped out as I was enjoying chicharron and yucca. All he said to me was "I can't believe how you're still eating."Chicharron with Fried Yucca:The chicharron wasn't the same crispy fatty pork I was excpeting. The yucca was good with the cilantro sauce though. It was as if I was eating garlic fries. Yum! 4/5I did some wondering around after having some gelato from Art of Flavors and noticed Viva Las Arepas right next door. It was spacious but there weren't a lot of people inside. The menu seemed like there was a lot of going on, don't know when I'll be back again and had to get it right, so I had to rely on the Yelp app to see what everyone was getting. The Reina Pepiada was mentioned pretty frequently.  I wasn't sure if it was something I should eat or someone I should meet. It was an arepas filled with a mixture of chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro. It wasn't that big and didn't taste that amazing on it's own. It was too much avocado and mayo and not enough chicken for me but it was only about $5 and it was enjoyable after dumping whatever sauces were inside of the red and yellow containers.  They did lack customer service. I explained that this was my first time here and if they had any recommendations or customer favorites. They could not help me with that and seemed rude about it, even went back to whatever they were doing before I asked for a menu, sat in the corner, and brought out the Yelp app. I didn't feel as welcomed as Art of Flavors felt like I should go back there. Customer service is big for me, it's not that hard to be friendly, courteous, and give your attention to paying customers.The rest of their food do sound and look good, from the reviews and pictures posted, and I'm sure they're well deserving of the 2 star I gave them but since the food from what I had was just OK and the service wasn't to my liking there is no way I can give them a 3 star, OK, to something I was not OK with. Another visit will happen but not anytime soon.Short Review:I'm a fan of Arepas. I'm just not a fan of the Arepas served at Viva Las Arepas.  I got their Beef Empanada and Beef Arepa.  Both were greasy and not worth the price. $5 for an Arepa the size of your fist??  I've had this place bookmarked. Now, bookmark checked! Time to move on.Longer Review:Viva Las Arepas has been one of my bookmarks since I was introduced to their neighbor, the great Art of Flavors. Yes, Viva is located right next door in case you didn't know.  Upon entering, you're hit with nothing but orange and a menu with a decent selection.  At first, the prices looked pretty good until you get your food. I got the Beef Arepas and a Beef Empanada.  They both tasted "Just Ok" and were super oily. For a minute, I thought I was eating a beef chimichanga. Both were also so small that I was able to finish my Arepas in about 3 bites.  I know I can't mention names, but I have had better Arepas out here in Vegas. Better in regards to price, value, and most importantly, taste. All is not lost though.  Their plantains and the service were both excellent.  I may be back, but most likely for their plantains only.  See Ya' But not here...I'll be next door enjoying the best peanut butter gelato.It's a shame, but after each visit, I've become less and less impressed. My first visit was phenomenal and my second visit was still pretty great (as evidenced in my previous review). The Wood-Fired Beef was a bit dry during my third visit, but I brushed it aside attributing it to a fluke or bad timing. However, my last visit has solidified my disappointment and necessity to write an updated review.Since I've had five of their arepa options, I decided it was time for another one, so I chose the Vegetarian (avocado, black beans, tomato, peppers, onion) for $5. I was confused at first because all I saw were black beans with a little bit of avocado barely surfacing (reference photo). Maybe they got my order wrong? I searched for vegetables through the beans with no success. It wasn't until I took a few bites that I finally located a very sad tomato piece. I figured that was just how they made the "Vegetarian" arepa. The beans were nicely seasoned, but their overwhelming quantity made it incredibly difficult to eat in an arepa. The arepa itself was delicious, as always. I was already disappointed by my selection because of the lack of vegetables, then I saw photos of what the Vegetarian Arepa should look like or have looked like and now I'm upset. It costs the same as or more than their meat options and they can't include a heap of vegetables? Not cool!Also, after four visits, it doesn't seem like a coincidence that my table is consistently ignored. No one ever checks on us (it's usually me and Ruben), while they seem more than happy to visit and chat with several other customers. It has made us feel unwelcome. I'm really sad to say this, but I will be getting my arepas elsewhere from now on.If I wasn't sitting shotgun to a Vegas local, I would have never made it to Viva Las Arepas... bonus points for a punny and city-appropriate name. Seeing that it's far removed in all directions from the "action," and the fact that I have never had an arepa before would have made it next to impossible for me to find it or even want to go there. Props to my buddy for carting us around and opening my eyes to something new and incredibly awesome. Thank, Drew-fus.The place is clean, there are pictures lining the wall, the menus are in both Spanish and English, (great sign), and ordering is a simple as strolling up to the counter and taking a chance - something tells me that it's hard to go wrong here. I ordered the hot garlic shrimp arepa and the grilled chicken empenada. If you have never had an arepa, I really don't know how to describe it. I guess it's like a crumbly corn bun with your choice of filling piled up in the middle. Does that sound right or even make sense? Who cares, they're delicious! So great in fact that I've now tracked down a few places in SD serving arepas that I can only hope compare to what VLA is serving up in Sin City. Oh yeah, the empenada gets some love too. The grilled chicken that they loaded up in that bad boy with a drizzle of their house sauces made for a perfect and timely hangover cure.I'm a bit torn in writing this review. I've had Viva Las Arepas (VLA) bookmarked for the better part of two years now, hell maybe more and it wasn't until recently had I been able to finally stop in. I love that there are still highly rated,  non-boojie, cheap, no frills food near the strip. I love even more that it's Venezuelan food.  Unfortunately, I may have been driven by the hype so much that I was left slightly disappointed. After a very long, grueling work schedule, my beau (bless his tired heart) was sweet enough to bring me here because I listed it on my top 3 places to eat while in Vegas.  We drove up to VLA, which isn't a stand anymore, they've transitioned to a brick & mortar. The parking lot is shared with other establishments and can get crowded during peak hours. The menu is large enough to spell some confusion for those salivating tastebuds. I know these arepas can be filling so I definitely had to strategize my meal. The man just got himself a carne arepa (non shredded) and 3 shredded beef empanadas. I got the pork buttt and carne arepas in addition to a chicken empanada. Our plates came out hot and fresh within a few minutes and those empanadas were super hot--so hot that a piece of it was left thrown and regurgitated back onto our tray lol (wasn't by me though). We enjoyed both empanadas though I will say the shredded beef was better than the chicken. We also both agreed they needed more meat in them. I love the arepa itself, and they generously filled 'em with our protein of choice. Unfortunately, neither of us were impressed with their beef. It was tough and lacked flavor. Even with all that drippy sauce, there was just something amiss with the beef. The pork butt I did enjoy. It was moist and tasty, and once I was carb loaded, I picked out all the pork and gobbled it all up. As cheap a meal as I thought it would be, we still paid $30++. Overall, I'm saddened this long sought bookmark didn't wow me, but I wouldn't mind giving it another try.Items Selected:Fried Pork Rinds & Yucca RootFried PlantainsWood Fire Chicken Arepa with Tomato, Lettuce, OnionsRoasted Pork Butt Arepa with Tomato and CheeseGuava and Cheese PastelitoSet beside Art of Flavors, where another star-studded sampling had just concluded in the best 'ice cream sandwich' ever to cross my lips, it was with long-held interest and a touch of gluttony that I finally entered Viva Las Arepas; my "some for now with the rest for later" order rooted not only in convenience but also in hopes of avoiding a later trip from home for dinner.  Ever popular amongst locals and tourists alike with a menu focused on the Venezuelan flatbread sandwich alongside additional items both grilled and fried the time was just past two on my arrival to the deceptively large space and greeted by a short line with the dining room 2/3 full it would not be long before I found myself standing at the counter, a friendly middle-aged man expediting orders and assigning me number #36, my five boxed selections delivered to the table a mere fifteen minutes thereafter.   Clearly a restaurant vested in its core with a menu infrequent to change it was in a duo of 'sides' that my meal began and although bland plantains dripping with excess grease quickly proved inedible the unlikely star of the show would in fact be the wood-grilled pigskins, a crispy exterior overlying supple fat with intense brine offset by tender chunks of fried yucca.  Moving next to a pair of arepas it was with the wood grilled chicken that I started yet with flavors no better than the frozen stuff from Roots sold at Walmart I quickly moved to the pork-butt, the flavor almost indistinguishable from the bird as a trickle of oil ran down my hand into the napkin below.  At this point tossing what was left of each sandwich to instead sample the rinds and root with accompanying sauces it was finally with the $2 Pastelito that I finished and although tasty enough to stand on its own I couldn't help but think that for a buck per bite I'd have been better off staying next door with another scoop of gelato.*Yelp 100 challenge complete!As much as Vegas is founded on facades and paradoxes, I found it pleasantly appropriate that perhaps the best food I had in Vegas came from this hole-in-the-wall place in the corner of a sketchy looking strip mall far from the Strip as opposed even to the meal I had a L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon!One of the benefits of Vegas is that can you drive a few miles and start your morning with some Hawaiian Poke, have some French for lunch, and finish with Venezuelan food. I'm glad we came here, saving this local gem for last.The Arepas here were fantastic all served piping hot. To rank them in order:1) Reina Peplada: Chicken Breast, Mayo, Avocado, Cilantro2) Wood Fire Beef - think carne asada3) Garlic Shrimp - big pieces of shrimp just not the best shrimp in qualityThe corn meal bun is crisp and houses some incredibly tasty meat. They give you sauces but thats not necessary with all that is going on in the arepas. Also the Yucca Root fries were good fat fries but I will go with their normal french fries next time.And I know it is just rotisserie chicken but something about that actual hickory wood fire grill really brought out the flavor in the Wood Fire Chicken plate ($14.99). It was perfectly moist and tender and the skin was the right amount of char and crisp.I thought the Passion Fruit juice edged the Mango juice and it is refreshing and the right complement to the arepas.My advice to Vegas-goers is to take a slight detour to Viva Las Arepas for some very delicious comfort food. Then make it extra special by going right next door to Art of Flavors (one of the best gelatos I've had in the city). Viva Las Arepas!Tip: Ask to sample juice flavorsThis popular downtown eats has been on my recent bookmarks to try. Arepas...a South American sandwich made of corn flatbread and various fillings.Located in the popular area of other Yelpdom heavy hitters like Art of Flavors and Goodwich, I figured Viva Las Arepas would be a no-brainer favorite.The restaurant inside is clean and warm, with more seating than parking available. If you haven't been, parking in the front is nearly non - existent.We ordered the Reina Pepiada, which is a featured review item and wood fired chicken arepas, plus an order of Yucca fries.In seeing the photos of the Reina Pepiada, I expected the sauce to be a light, creamy cilantro avocado type of dressing. What I actually experienced was very heavy and overly sauced chicken. With each bite, I kept thinking how the addition of a nice fresh slaw could cut some of that richness. The tortas were also heavy and chewy and again my expectations of a light, fluffy flatbread were dashed. I did like the peas, though. They provided additional sauces, which was unnecessary considering the meat was already drowning in it. The yucca fries were nothing special.  My daugter seemed to enjoy her wood fired chicken arepa. The Reina Pepiada didn't sit well with my wife as she was sick the rest of the night.Viva Las Arepas fell short of what I wanted to experience. I so wanted to love this place, but didn't. I will continue to search to hopefully find my ideal arepa.Ok, so I read a couple of reviews where people say this is located in a scary neighborhood. Nope. Asides from a few drunks and homeless folks wandering around, It's pretty tame for Las Vegas. The dining area is pretty clean, and they just recently added an outdoor seating area in the front.I go here at least a couple of times a month because:- it's cheap- I don't have to think about what I'm gonna get, since I always get the same things- it's right next door to AOFThe arepas range in price from $4 for a cheese arepa to $7 for a garlic shrimp arepa. I usually stick to eating the Reina Pepiada, (chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro), or the Perico, (scrambled egg, ham & cheese, onion and tomato). If I'm not mistaken, the Reina Pepiada is the only arepa served cold. Kind of reminds me of a cold chicken salad sandwich, but with a lot more chicken. Nice to have places like this to dine at, especially if you are budget-conscious. Beats the hell out of going to a fast food chain. For $20, you and a date can grab an arepa here with a huge order of fries, then bounce over to AOF to grab dessert. After dessert, have some fun and browse the selection of lingerie and adult novelties in the boutique next door! Cheap and convenient date options!Wow. What a difference since the first visit. I ordered the same thing I had before, shrimp arepa, yucca fries, and soursop. I took a bite of my arepa and immediately had to spit it out. The shrimp tasted rotten and the arepa was so greasy it made me sick just looking at. Then I bit into the yucca fries, they were dry rotted. $14 for one arepa, fries and a drink. I'm so mad at myself for not going back and demanding a refund for nasty, rotten food. Never again.I promise you that Viva Las Arepas is a little piece of heaven just on the outskirts of the city where you allow all your sins run free. In addition to mindless betting, grandeur casinos, and endless shopping boutiques, Las Vegas is about good eating, and there is a lot of it. I was feeling a little disinterested from fine dining everyday during my little Vegas weekend getaway so my date wanted me to try his cherished best kept secret in Las Vegas which is now one of my treasured eateries that I look forward to trying again upon my next visit.Located just outside of The Strip near The Stratosphere, Viva Las Arepas wouldn't be noted to be in the prettiest part of the neighborhood. As well as the establishment is not the most elegant, the food was spectacular.Without knowing exactly what an arepa was, I ordered the Reina Pepiada, a cold chicken salad covered in avocado and mayonnaise dressing whilst my date ordered a wood-fired chicken arepa. We added an additional cheese empanada for me, and a beef empanada for him since I have never had an empanada either.Once our order was ready, my Reina Pepiada arepa reminded me of an overstuffed torta, but better! and once I tasted my arepa I knew this place was a special gem. The avocado mayonnaise sauce is really something that distinctively brought out the flavours. They also provide two bottles of their signature sauces; reach for the lighter green + garlic one, it is pure heaven, I wasn't shy to spread it all over my food.The cheese empanada was still warm with gooey cheese. For just 3 dollars, this was delish! They also threw in a little extra extra for us; a sweet guava + cheese pastry, mm!I cannot stop noting about Viva Las Arepas to my friends and other fellow Yelpers, this is one place not to be missed. I mean, if it wasn't for the cheese empanada order with the surprise sweet treat, I would order two of these on my next return xFlavorful experience!I've had this place on my mind for several months and finally made our way over to it for a late lunch on a weekend. It was a beautiful day and wanted to enjoy our food outside since they have a cute little corner space. We ordered - a chicken arepa with avocado and a pork butt one with cheese. Next came a beef empanada, fried plantains and a sugar cane drink with lime. The chicken arepa had some type of sauce on it and it was way too wet for my taste. I loved the pork butt and it was my favorite part of the meal, especially with the delicious creamy cilantro sauce over it! The beef empanada was ok, expected more flavor. The plantains were fantastic and the perfect way to end the meal. I would skip the sugar cane with lime drink as it was very sour. Here's the rest of the story and why I couldn't give it a higher rating. As I mentioned above we chose to sit outside because the weather was perfect. A homeless man came over and sat next to our table and began staring at me. It was nearly impossible to enjoy my food and we ended up buying him food. He chose to sit next to us and eat it as he continued to stare me down. Then came over a couple who were high as kites and the male wanted to show us his junk. He was committed to this and with every passing minute was also screaming at his female friend. I wanted to crawl under the table. So next time I'm siting inside no matter how beautiful it is outside!I was trying to think of a dumb arepa joke and didn't have much success.  Knock, knock. Who's there?Arepa. Arepa who? Arepa any man who brings me delicious venezuelan sammiches. Womp womp womp.  I told you it was going to be dumb.  Went on Saturday 11-7-15 around 8pm to grab a quick bite.  $10.57 got me a chicken arepa with black beans and a beef empanada. This is actually my second time here and I really like arepas.  Being from the south and eating lots of hominy and grits, an arepa is kind of like if you made a hamburger bun out of really thick, fine-ground grits and then stuffed it with lettuce, cheese, chicken, etc.  They are really tasty.  I think next time I'll just get the beans and cheese kind because their chicken is sooooo salty.
Burger Bar Crescent=The service was AWFUL!! let me elaborate: 1. we tried to use Groupon we had by showing it via our smart phone. They said we needed it printed out or they won't accept it. so the suggestion was 'either give them the printed version or COME BACK OTHER TIME'2. the server spilled my coke all over the table and never give me another bottle or any refill3. our Groupon promotion states that we are supposed to get 12 chicken wings. Only 9 were served. When we asked the server, she said that they 'go by pounds, not numbers' Seriously? how should we believe that? 4. It took a long time to get a check even though there were enough servers that we almost missed our movie5. Unsatisfied with the service, we barely left any tips. When the server saw that, she said 'DON'T COME BACK' to our face. FYI, I will NOT BE GOING BACK THERE. Never mind the food.A bunch of friends and I had out Friday dinner here. Didn't have to wait for a table, that was super nice. The burger was really tasty. I had québécois burger with onion ring. I like their bun especially, very soft. The atmosphere was pretty great too, the music wasn't overwhelming loud. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because their sweet potato fries wasn't crispy.
Bobby C's Cafe=Update timeI had an eggplant sauteed in olive oil and spices, served on a hoagie roll with 3 cheeses, and egg, lettuce, tomato and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. IT ROCKEDBobby will customize anything you ask if he has the food to make it. JUST ASK.No sides just plenty of sandwich.Funky little breakfast and lunch cafe with an ecclectic menu.Some may say a jack of all trades masters none, but to know a little about everything is exactly the kind of knowledge a cafe "chef" should have.Where else in the known universe can one indulge in a Rainbow Doughnut and breakfast burrito in the morning, then come back to the same place and not be able to decide if you want a pizzasteak sandwich, spicy Terriyaki chicken bowl, or fried bologna for lunch?Awesome friendly service from Bobby, too. Yes, that's him. Say hello and make a special request.  If he has the food in the building, he'll cook it for you however you like!
Sushi House Goyemon=I'm seriously considering going back to all my AYCE sushi reviews and moving them down a star. THAT's how good it was. I can't believe this is the 3rd Japanese restaurant in this location in 5 years. To go from Sushi Hana to Shin to this. Goyemon has by far the best decor of the three. Sushi Hana just had these gross green painted walls and an old ass TV showing ESPN for chrissakes! Along with your usual suspects for nigiri and rolls...they have a ton more including daily specials. Highlights included their inhouse smoked salmon (smokiest salmon ever!), big eye tuna nigiri and "kobe" beef nigiri although the beef being kobe was highly suspect. No big deal. Pork belly was like the best piece of bacon ever. I also like how yellowtail collar (1 order per person) is on the menu. So good! Its like a super meaty fish chicken wing kinda sorta. A must. We were pretty lucky to be seated around 6pm since there was a bit of a wait for tables about 10 min later. Not that many seats so definitely be prepared to stand around for a while. I love how this is so close to my place. No more drives to Sushi Mon on Sahara for me. I'm actually ready to go back here...like...now.A tough week calls for a pick me up dinner. Sometimes I worry about going to a new place with crazy rave reviews as I feel my standards are jilted to high and come out feeling like it was over hyped even if the place is good I ate words- like "yum", "oh that's fresh", and "lets get another order". We really wanted to try all the specials so we started off there. Today the chalkboard had:Big Eye Tuna- had a richer, tuna taste than regular tuna. Anago/Saltwater Eel- this was delish. It's softer and less slimy than freshwater and as much as I like unagi, I wish more places would have this. Japanese Snapper- this was very delicate of a flavor and very fresh. I find some snapper has a very chewy texture and almost muddy taste. Aji/Spanish Makerel- this was nice. I like the grated ginger on top, but I love gingery stuff. White Clam- the BF doesn't normally enjoy such thing but even he appreciated the flavor. I thought this was good and must for people who love the chewy nigiris like tako, hokkigai, ika. Regular nigiri menu:Cajun Albacore- good seasoning. I appreciate that their ponzu sauce isn't overtly citrusy and is much more delicate than other places. There's some places that have that "fake" lime taste and kills all other flavor.Albacore- good and freshSuper White Yellowtail- buttery in texture- very freshMackerel- good, but with the cure+ soy is too salty. 2nd order I asked for ponzu and it was much better this way. One thing I noticed about the nigiri cuts is that some have a very faint citrus note on it. Not like someone squeezed lemon, but I suspect that they wipe their blades with a citrus water which imparts a hint of it. If you douse your rice in soy, you won't probably taste it, but I barely dip any soy onto my fish. This is something I've seen done in Japan so kudos if that's what flavored it. Even at my current favorite place, there's some days where certain fish is just okay. Everything today was fresh and on. The daily specials rotating is a great idea since those are intriguing and were all fresh. I like there is half rolls- we tried the Calico and Ecstacy which are both pretty decent as far as rolls go. Appetizers: The famed pork belly was pretty tasty!- Crispy, melty, salty, sweet and tangy balance. Dynamite- most places but too much mayo. BF liked this and I appreciated it was a bit crispy on top. Orgasm salad- nice that you get a little sashimi salad action and it wasn't overly dressed or too much greens to fish ratio. Hamachi Kama- we love yellowtail collars and theirs was good. I wish the skin of it was crispier though....nothing beats when it's like fish skin chips, but only one ayce so far grills it to that (Island). Grilled Yellowtail- this was on the specials board and was a good piece with some sweet glaze Dessert: I like that you can get more than just one dessert (though some desserts have a 1order pp limit). BF and I shared the green tea creme brulee, green tea cake and tofu cheesecake. The green tea creme brulee was the winner for both of us. It isn't light on the matcha though so if you don't like the strong green tea taste then it might be a bit much but it is creamy, bittersweet burnt matcha and sugar goodness. Service was great! That was one that put it over the edge for us. Servers checked on us often, was on top of drinks, had some suggestions and were friendly. It wasn't too busy until the end of our meal and the service didn't suffer just because we weren't the only ones there. The sushi chefs were super nice, funny and personable. We had Tony during the first half of dinner then Fredo came in. Fredo is all jokes and curses. I'm all for it, but just a warning to those who can't handle a fucking joke. I also like the decor in here- definitely one of the nicer ambiance ayces around. We will be returning soon (and I will be coming sooner for the UYE) ! I feel we might be coming here on a regular and making this our favorite spot if this service and quality stays true.EDIT- Just wanted to say that the UYE had so many people (25) plus a filled restaurant and our service was still friendly, organized as possible (had separate checks ready for all us) and a reasonable pace on the food. Kudos to the staff! They work really hard here to keep up with the crowd.This is a review of their a la carte options.The Skinny: Although we didn't partake of their AYCE, their a la carte items and bento were below par. FYI - if you do not have their AYCE, the menu and pricing can be confusing (2.5) Service: messed up bill which my hubby had to actually grab a menu and show the waitress that she was wrong (2), Value: given the experience here, I wouldn't come back.(2).I was enthused to see a highly rated sushi place. So I nagged the hubby to come try this place out. When we arrived. we weren't hungry enough to try their AYCE option. Instead we ordered their deluxe bento (with a side salad and miso soup), katsu curry and a side order of the grilled pork belly.FYI - if you order a la carte, the prices are all on the actual fold-out menu NOT what's on the AYCE sheet or the supplement page on the placemat. Make sure you check your bill because we were charged for the more expensive price for pork belly (ie, supplement for the AYCE add- on) instead of the a la carte price. The waitress asked the chef instead of checking the menu and didn't believe us. My hubby had to ask for the menu to show her the difference. The deluxe bento suffered from many problems but let's just start off with the baby upchuck masquerading as some sort of misguided egg salad they put in the top right hand corner. (see pic: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q&select=pNoiIE--ccKc0V8o2PwRgw) Or perhaps the completely anemic "teriyaki chicken" which didn't even have grill marks on them. The fried salmon and tempura were both soggy. We had to ask for tempura sauce. Sashimi - the fish was cut into thick chunks but isn't cut in the proper matter allowing the fish to melt in your mouth. For what it's worth, the California maki was okay. There was little to no katsu with the katsu curry.  (FYI - the cutlet in the photo represents about 40% of the entire cutlet which is rather small for $8 see pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=tl0GrsOs4ViWjApsgaBvog ). The curry itself was overly thick and bland due to the addition of perhaps too much potatoes.Finally, the grilled pork belly. While the texture of the pork belly was nice, the flavour of the pork was overly smoky for our tastes. The addition of the rather oddly sour tasting mango salsa was a deteriment to the dish. Certainly not something we would order again and we found it expensive for the price.Overall given our experience with a la carte, we probably won't be stopping by for AYCE. But certainly check your bill if you do decide to do the a la carte tasting.So when i was asked what i would like for dinner on our final night in Vegas i said Sushi please!!  Lucky for me, Minh D knew about this awesome place that is located off the strip and is moderate priced       ($26.95 for AYCE) and open till 3:00am. Parking wasnt bad and we were warmly welcomed and seated at a table right away.Hungry and not knowing what to order first (I love sushi and could probally eat my weight in it). Minh said he was getting the AYCE which was unlimited sushi that had to be consumed in 60minutes with no left over rice on the plates, if there was any traces of sushi or rice left overs they would charge you A La Carte prices. You can not share with other non AYCE people at your table, however you can share if anyone at your table is partaking in the AYCE challenge which is a good thing and highly recommended!! So after really thinking about it i decided to challenge myself and do it!! Heck you only live once, gotta try different things!!In no order and from what i can remember before the sushi coma totally took over:Grilled Tofu Salad-Grilled Tofu and spring mix served with a garlic sesame dressing.Tryed some of Minh's Grilled Pork Belly-Grilled pork belly served with mango salsaHalf roll- Philadelphia Roll-Salmon,Cream Cheese,Avocado,Cucumber topped with smelt eggsHalf roll-California RollFive piece Roll (no half boo)- Spider Roll-Deep fried soft shell crab meat,cucumber,avocado with eel sauce and wrapped in soybean paperHalf roll- Chicken teriyaki roll (Do not order, sadly the chicken was so dry it almost gaged me)Between all those rolls and eating some of Minh's i started to realize that i could not finish all of this. Taking a rest and also walking around the food just wasnt wanting to settle. Sadly i had to tap out half way through the challenge. This little cupcake has had her fill of sushi for the next month and a half!! I was looking forward to saving room for dessert which they had Green Tea Creme Brulee (my favorite).  Untill next time we are in town, i think i will come better prepared for such a challenge!!WHERE: Located on Tropicana & Decatur.WHEN: 5pm-3am (dinner & late dinnertime!)WHY: Have you ever posted "best sushi in LV" topics on Yelp Talk? If so, no need to ask anymore, because this is it!! THE BEST ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI JOINT IN TOWN! WITHOUT A DOUBT!WHAT: Firstly, we got to test out the new party room! There were 20 of us sushi-eaters ready to devour and take advantage of that AYCE sushi menu! The servers were all dolls! They were extremely helpful (knowing how hectic a large party can be) and us paying separately did not scare them at all. They were well-prepared! COOL points for the staff that night!So, on to the food! I would just like to state the fact that each dish was made with such perfection! From the many attractive flavors, to the presentation!SOME THINGS I TRIED:Orgasm salad: Something a little bit different! The sauce blend had a little tang and zest to it, which actually made the salad.Pastel roll: shrimp and crab wrapped inside soy paper, shrimp and avocado on top, slightly drizzled with spicy yum & eel sauce on top!911 roll: To all of you spice-aholics, you need to try this one! I personally thought that I would be able to take some HEAT, but I had to LEAVE THE KITCHEN for this one! After several drinks of water and patiently waiting it out, the spice stuck to my tongue! So, the tip for this roll: BEWARE, AND PROCEED WITH CAUTION! hahaI LOVE BAKED ROLLS! So, I love the fact that they have a handful of great ones!O.I.D. roll: shrimp & asparagus wrapped in salmon & baked with yumyum sauce! Oh whatt?!!Baked 428: I had to try this one just because it said baked chicken inside the roll! I have never tried a chicken roll =)Goyemon lasagna roll: I love japanese lasagna rolls, so I always try it in every sushi spot. & this won my heart over! My absolute favorite lasagna roll of all time!DESSERT! Oh how I love the end of beautiful beginnings solely due to dessert! So... there are a couple of desserts you may choose from on the ayce menu, (tempura, mochi, etc) meaning you can get as much as you'd like?! There is a separate dessert menu you can choose from as well, where you are only allowed to pick one on there! And on this beautiful menu lay "GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE," which happened to be my pick! =D It was completely marvelous!Lastly, I would like to give a shoutout to my fellow yelper, Nelson Q., for introducing me to such greatness! You got me hooked, my friend! So hooked that I will be back there next week!WINNER, WINNER, SUSHI DINNER!OK, it's a 5 star review, but was almost 4 stars.  Came here on a Saturday night, and it was of course busy, but there were two tables of 2 open that I could have been seated in way sooner.  The staff were trying to wait for the table between them to get up so they could seat a party of 6, even though there was another table for them opening up shortly, so my party could have been eating sushi sooner.  But whatever, I won't hold that against them.The AYCE sushi was awesome, as all the other reviewers already covered.  The toro was just out of this world, and so was the sweet shrimp.  Everything else was pretty well above average, except for the salmon, which was nice and big but just wasn't as delicious as a few other spots I've been to around town.   Oh yes, the hamachi was great as well.  Kept ordering "one more order" at the end of the meal.Had a couple 1/2 rolls that were ok.  I'd much rather eat nigiri.  Also tried a few of the unusual (for AYCE at least) items like the crispy rice with spicy tuna and the grilled pork belly.  Again, everything was delicious.Also was offered a punch card when I paid, which I wasn't sure if they'd have or not.  Kind of rubbing it in my face, because I had a fully stamped card from Sushi Hana, the place that used to be in the space Goyemon is in, and then they shut down.  OK, let's try this again.  8 meals to go!Every time I've been here it's always been busy even at 5 which is when they open. I always sit at the sushi bar, it has the best & fastest service. I've been here about 4 times now and it kills me that I don't remember the sushi chefs' names but my favorites are the hispanic chef and the Hawaiian chef! They always remember & take care of me and are so helpful. I pretty much only eat nigiri on my AYCE adventures so I can't really comment on any of the rolls. All of the fish are always fresh & delicious and the great thing is that they don't pack on the rice! I'm not a huge fan of the pork belly side dish but the hamachi kama is a winner! They also have Monta ramen available but trust you don't want to be filling up on noodles when there's sushi to be eaten lol Make sure to always check their Specials board for what's hot on the menu for that day! They have a really good dessert menu and you can sample each one! My favorite is the lychee sorbet, simple yet refreshing and it satisfies my sweet tooth! I love this place because it's clean, the quality is great and the service is amazing! So be sure to take care of your sushi chefs and servers! Also make sure to get a stamp card because at $26.95 you want to get ALL your money's worth ;)The Husband and I have been anxious awaiting our turn to check out this newly popular AYCE sushi joint in the southwest part of town and we finally got a chance last week!  (After all, this location once housed Sushi Hana and SHIN Yakitori.)Open only for dinner from 5:00 pm to 3:00 am, we made it our mission to be waiting when the doors open.  We weren't the only ones on a Sunday night to think of this, but were definitely glad we did.Beyond the standard sushi rolls and sushi, what makes Sushi House Goyemon a star higher than others?  These were noteworthy in my book:* Specials board: Oh my goodness!  This is what got me!  They had off the standard menu fish like bonito, kampachi, sardines, and yuzu tobiko that were included in AYCE.  That was definitely a highlight in my book!  Loving the yuzu tobiko!* Pork Belly - Yes, everyone talks about it and it's good stuff.  We love pork belly - we have marinated cooked pork belly sitting in our freezer ready to throw into the rice cooker at a moment's notice.  We love pork belly.  Sure, the portion is a meager two pieces at a time, but it's AYCE, so order up more!* Shoyu Ramen is included in AYCE after 11 pm.  Sure, we missed this, but it got the Husband all excited with the possibility of it.  (Why someone would want to fill their belly with ramen and soup during an AYCE sushi fest is beyond me.)* Dessert included, as in ALL the desserts are included!  I've been to other AYCE sushi joints that may or may not included AYCE ice cream, but they not only have a few ice cream flavors, but four different desserts to choose from.  Uh, score a point there!  We tried them all - Green Tea Cake, Chocolate Mousse, Plum Wine Jelly, and Green Tea Creme Brulee.* Hot or Iced Green Tea is included.So, what's with all the mixed reviews?  The major problem here is service.  I read over the recent reviews and took note of the declining service and definitely can attest to what the other yelpers are complaining about.  We were lucky that Chizuru was our primary waitress because she is stellar.  And the rest of the staff, that's the problem.  From the moment we walked in and said party of four and one highchair, the hostess/waitress totally forgot to bring a highchair.  Other staff people were just not attentive, as I was often seen waving my arms around to get their attention.  Waiters who refill your beverages should really put your glass back in front of you, not at the other end of the table and watch you struggle to reach across to get it.  There are just some people who are just really good at restaurant service and others that could use some improvementNonetheless, we've been gone so long from the AYCE world that we are happy to go back.  Yeah, we'll be back this week!4.5 stars.They offer a frequent eater card, which is always nice.  Looks like they are related to Sushi Mon and Monta Ramen as well.  Good to know!They also take reservations for their party room from 10-20 people.  Last seating for AYCE is 2:00 am!After reading all the wonderful high-rated reviews, I bookmarked this spot as our final cheat meal for our stay in Vegas during the Olympia 2011 weekend. Hmph...it was not the best idea and here are the reasons why:1. When we got there around 7:45pm, Saturday night, the place was packed...and I mean packed as in it's super small and doesn't have much seating available, so when you include the AYCE option, I can tell why the wait here is always LONG. We waited for over 45 minutes before a table finally decided to get their bootays up and leave. Even though, the waitress was kind enough to offer the 3 of us seating at the bar, we opted to get a regular table and let the bar be available for the couples/singles.2. The AYCE menu is quite confusing. You can't have everything all-you-can-eat...meh?? There were certain items on there were you were only allowed one order per person. So the math did get confusing for me. I'm no bueno with numbers here people!3. FOOD: The pork belly that everyone raved about was MEH for me. The sushi rolls were also A-OK, nothing too crazy besides the nutso 9-11 roll we ordered. That habanero sauce they used on that roll had my mouth feelin like Angelina Jolie for a good 1/2 hour. OMG! The sashimi and fresh fish was very fresh indeed and those orders always came out the quickest. The chicken skewers were...what they were, just chicken skewers with Teriyaki sauce all ova em, again...nothing special there. The ONLY thing I really did enjoy was the AYCE option of DESSERTS! Mmmm, mmm bombalicous! I had 2 of the green tea creme brulees (which were sooooo decadent and perfect) and 1 red bean ice cream, how can you go wrong with anything that has beans in it? Yes, I'm Asian and I love my beany desserts! =P4. SERVICE: It got kinda confusing who our server was. There were some dudes that would come out with our order but didn't take our order and then we had about 3 waiters that did take our orders back & forth. Major minus? Food came out WAY too slow-momo. I know there are only about 3 chefs working, but the place is tiny and I've been to plenty AYCE sushi spots and never had to wait about 15 min between each order. I'm ALWAYS hungry! Especially now since I'm still in precontest season for my fitness competition, so if I'm looking forward to a cheat meal, it better be top notch and the food better come out FAST. Sushi House Goyemon did NOT do this job well.Would I come back? For the desserts? Yes. But even that's not really worth the trip there.P.S. We had to hit up Jean Philippe Patisserie at the ARIA (since it's the only thing open super late and close to our hotel) right after we left this spot cuz my ass was still HUNGRY as EFF!Lowest quality of any AYCE sushi restaurant I've ever experienced in Vegas.  I expect previously frozen, gassed fish at any AYCE place but not color added fish.   Unless I missed a new trend in genetic engineering, there is no such thing as bright fuchsia colored tuna or brilliant orange salmon.  What's worse is many items (tuna, hamachi, salmon, shrimp) have a dry, rubbery texture as if it was previously frozen and thawed using tap water.The rice is seasoned well but is so compacted, it's the densest sushi I've ever had.Decent creativity but by the end of the meal, I never wanted to hear "yum yum sauce" again.  This mayo based concoction is slathered on almost everything.  Cloying and fatty, even hot tea can't cut its mouth grip.Service was OK, I mean I did get a menu, water, food, and the check but with every additional order, I felt less like a welcome guest and more like a theif hacking away at the profit.Maybe a bad night?  I doubt it. The fundamentals are wrong.  Not worth it considering how many better AYCE restaurants dot Vegas.Take all your vega$ winnings and splurge it here, folks! The QUALITY of the sushi was SUPERME.  For $25 a pop, you are granted unlimited amounts of sushi including their specials of the day.  in other words, AYCE!I won't hit every single item I consumed but some of the key ones that I enjoyed personally were:+ Salmon Belly: If this is listed on their Special of the Day menu, do not hesitate to order this! Smooth and Yummy!+ Tempura Shrimp: I know what you're saying, how can this be good? The tempura was light and crispy.  Shrimp tasted as if it was just taken out of the water and cooked to perfection.+ Tempura Ice Cream: pretty good, light tempura shell and soft ice cream.Do not feel overwhelmed as you can spend a couple of hours digging into every single Nigiri item.  Their AYCE also included Appetizers (all), Dessert, and Special Rolls.  I recommend sitting at the counter so you can socialize with their Sushi Chef who will charm and enlighten you with his culinary life and knowledge of the sushi world.  Plus, you can place your order on the fly.  A QUICK TIP: Ramen served in the Evening.  I would most definitely make a return when I'm back in good ole' (third home) Vega$.I gave them 4 stars on my first visit for dinner AYCE.....and I was hoping that it would be as good for lunch AYCE....no such luck.  It was atrocious, revolting excuse for sushi.When I walked in, I had a bad feeling when I saw two latino looking sushi chefs at the tsukeba.  Not that I have anything against non-japanese itamae, but from my fairly vast experience....it's not a good sign in general and boy was I right.  Since I'm Japanese, I don't order any rolls.  I always go with straight nigiri, none of those yum yum sauce, fancy rolls bulshit and here are what's wrong with their "sushi".1)  It was ugly.  Cuts of fish were uneven, too small, and were just very asymmetrical and poorly balanced with rice.  When you have two pieces and they look so different, there is a significant lack in their sense of aesthetics, and more importantly, utter luck of skill.2)  Sushi rice was horrendous.  To make things worse, there were 2 sushi "chefs" and they seem to be using very inconsistent sushi rice.  One was soft and overly sticky, and the other was dry and hard.  Neither of them had proper vinegar flavor, and was too bland to be called "sushi rice".  They obviously have no idea or skill to make proper sushi rice, which is just as, if not MORE important than the fish that goes on it.  3)  Utter lack of nigiri skill.  Sushi rice was too hard.  You had to chew it.  That is what happens to amateurs and newbies who do not have the proper skills to maintain shape of nigiri while having enough air within it so that if falls apart in the mouth.4)  The wasabi issue- I was embarrassed for them.  My first order of nigiris had no wasabi.  So I asked the waitress (non-japanese) that I need to have wasabi in the sushi.  She comes back 2 minutes later that "most people" don't want wasabi so the "chefs" cannot put wasabi in the nigiri.  Let me repeat "THE CHEFS CANNOT PUT WASABI IN THE NIGIRI"Let me make this straight.  In Japan, the sushi chefs will occasionally make UPON REQUEST nigiris WITHOUT wasabi for little children, I mean like kindergarden aged kids. Never do they even consider NOT putting wasabi for adults.  So I tell this non Japanese waitress that I don't care what "most people" want.  I want wasabi in the nigiri so that I don't have to peel the fish off of rice and have to put it on there, and it is the PROPER way to make a nigiri.  So she goes back and talks with this "chefs" and they finally comply with my "request" to make a proper nigiri WITH wasabi.  It's very unfortunate that whoever the Japanese sushi chef is there allows these "sushi chefs" to let these joke of a sushi out to customers under their roof.  I asked the waitress if there are any Japanese chefs at lunch time and she says that it depends on their schedule, sometimes yes, sometimes not.  Well if a real chefs can't be there to properly supervise these jokers then they might as well close down the restaurant instead of allowing these atrocious nigiri's out to the customers who may have the palate and knowledge of what a real sushi should be like.  The management should be embarrassed with what went on today.  If people think that this kind of atrocity is sushi, then I am truly saddened.  There are better restaurants with real japanese sushi chefs in this town who serve decent AYCE sushi.  But if people have numb enough palates to keep going here then so be it.First of all, I don't like to give bad reviews, and I generally consider myself a patient person, but I came here after working a 13 hour shift and I was starving. Gave my name to the host for a table for two, waited a good 15 mins, gentleman who comes in after, gets seated before me, really? Um ok? Finally seated and drink orders placed, my iced green tea tastes like dirty water. Then we order a couple things (I generally don't do AYCE sushi because I find the fish isn't good) so I opted to do a la carte for my first visit. I don't like rolls with mayo, or dairy, or sauces like "orgasm sauce". I immediately noticed the rice to fish ratio was way off, fish was dry, rice was dry. Great. Now let me get to the service.....we couldn't get our server to come around once, the cutest little old lady sitting at the table next to us flagged a server down for her check and then told them that we needed our server as well. Again, never saw her. At this point it's when I contemplated walking out and leaving money for what I thought we owed. Service was atrocious. Never refilled my drink and couldn't order any more food, which was probably a good thing. I will never give this place a second try or recommend. Overrated.After the epic meal in the tatami room hosted by Tony T. (see my review for the event), Eric R. bugged me to return here for dinner.  We arrived on Saturday around 7 and were seated immediately at the bar.  The AYCE is an amazing deal, as it includes the specials on the daily special board, grill items, salads, rolls, nigiri, and all sorts of other things.Some of the new things I tried included the grilled tofu which was quite tasty and amaebi shrimp head miso soup.  The shrimp were a bit harder to eat since they were not fried, but the flavor of them in the broth was good.  The mackerel was cured wonderfully.Since we were at the bar, we had a nice view of the crazy action here.  We were taken care of by 4 different sushi chefs, and it took me awhile to even start a conversation with Chef Jun, a real Japanese chef yay!, in front of us.However, the biggest disappointment is the rice.  Sushi is all about the rice.  The volume of this restaurant is huge because of the crowds, and the rice is not acceptable for sushi rice.  First of all, it was HOT.  I am talking just made, no cooling/fanning and hardly any vinegar/seasoning.  HOT rice with ice cold fish tastes bizzaroooo.  It ruined the meal.  I noticed the first time we ate here that the nigiri slices were all out of whack.  Because of the volume, the slices are not cut with precision but with speed.  I watched the chefs cut awkward nigiri slices that barely covered the hot rice.  Eric R. asked Chef Jun about the rice.  He said they have such a demand that they just use hot rice, and he apologized because he knows it is just like sushi faux pas 101...most sushi restaurants I have been to make rice in advance.  As someone who learned how to make the rice from a local Japanese market recently, I know that it requires 45 minutes to an hour of fanning and cooling prior to serving, and that is for my small batches (3 cups at a time).  Though there is a lot of variety and I have no complaints about the service or quality, I could never enjoy hot rice touching cold uni or cold amaebi or cold hamachi...you get the idea.AYCE appetizers, AYCE daily specials and AYCE dessert.  That, to me, is what makes Goyemon stand out above the competition.  We're not just talking miso soup or mochi ice cream either!  Delicious pork belly, yummy grilled veggies, daily sushi specials, green tea cake, black sesame creme brulee...these are some unique offerings.Sushi here is good, and the daily specials always offer a good variety of fish to try.  All of my visits start out with me ordering one of every special, both sushi and grilled items.  The one thing that I haven't really been fond of is the rice.  I know that they get very busy, but it seems like their sushi rice is almost fresh from the rice cooker; by time the sushi gets to the table, the rice is warm and the fish feels like it's been sitting at room temperature for a while.  It's never been bad enough to ruin a meal, but it is something I notice each visit.  To be fair, other people I've dined with either don't notice it or it isn't a big deal, so it could be a personal thing.Outside of my little rice quirk, Goyemon is a solid choice for sushi.  It has a big roll selection for your casual sushi friends, as well as a good fish selection for you nigiri folk.  Add in the appetizers and desserts to help cleanse your palate, and you have a dinner spot fit for most, if not all of your friends!I've had this place bookmarked for a long time &  finally got a chance to try it out!!As with all AYCE, not everything will be the best quality, but you get good quality fish for a reasonable price.Some of our faves of the night were:yellowtail - very fresh & creamylychee sorbet - THE best sorbet, mmmmmstrawberry mochi - I love mochiunagi - good texture, not slimypork belly - great grill flavor but kinda fattysalmonscalloppoke saladcucumber saladgyozasSome of our not so faves of the night were:uni - not freshestsweet shrimp was ok tuna - not freshThe location is nice but pretty far from the strip, about 10 minutes drive.  The ambiance is really cute.  Loved the decor and bar area.  It is smaller than I would have expected, about 15 tables and a bar.The service is top notch as we were never rushed.  Even when we spent about 2.5 hours, they still made sure we got everything we wanted.  I ordered extra dessert a couple of times (hehe).Definitely recommended for being piggies in the desert!!  What's Vegas without all the munching!!  Don't forget to get a stampcard, buy 10 get 1 free!We are blessed to have the option of AYCE sushi deals at pretty much all sushi joints in Vegas. So in my search of the BEST one, I think I'm going to have to go with Sushi House Goyemon. Lunch is 21.95 and dinner is 24.95. I asked what the difference is and it's just a small change-up of the menu with the addition of some extra sushi pieces. Lunch would satisfy me just fine any day.  However, if you want to try that green tea creme brule and that nice green cake in the main photo... you'll have to join them for dinner (Reminder: come back for dinner soon). The place is small and they don't take reservations. I'd say there were about a good 10-12 tables in the main dining area, and an extra 3-4 tables in their extra room in the back. So if you're planning to throw a big birthday hoopla there, make sure you and your guests come early to reserve because they won't sit you unless you are all present. The decor is simplistic but modern with their wooded ceiling framework and their fancy light structures (i think it came from Ikea).Now finally on to the food. The appetizers aren't bad. The nigiri sushi pieces are mediocre. Too little rice, and not enough fish. If you're a salmon lover, skip the nigiri and just get a salmon handroll. It's much more worth it, I promise. If you have some rice left over on the place, order the dynamite (creamy mixture of seafood and mayo concoction) and pair it with the rice, it's actually pretty darn good and compliments each other very well! I'm not the biggest roll fan but I actually enjoy their rolls here. I love how they provide the option of getting half orders (4 pieces) of each roll so you don't have to kill yourself to finish massive amount of pieces to avoid any extra charges of anything left over. There's some good and bad traits, but overall I think you'll get the most bang out of your AYCE buck here.As this was my 1st experience of All You Can Eat sushi, there are a number of words that I want to use to describe to you how I felt at the end of this meal. Words like "disgusting", "bloated", "obese" and mainly "self loathing" were the ones I was tossing around as I wondered how I would write this review. But you know what word REALLY sums up surprisingly delicious sushi in quantities that would shock a Sumo wrestler?Glorious.Seriously one of the best AYCE dining experiences I have ever had!!!!This is being said by someone who avoids AYCE (unless it's KBBQ) like the plague!!!!The menu is very creative and tempting and there are things included with the price that you would never expect at a sushi AYCE like desserts and ramen!!!!The price is just above $25 which seems like a lot but pretty much everything is covered by that money - including your drinks!!!!Sit at the bar!!!! The sushi chef and his accomplices are pretty cool and not shy at all as they will suggest you eat what is good. This is actually a good idea since there is actually a time limit. Funny, a couple of times they gave us random items with our permission and we thoroughly enjoyed them. Needless to say I am an extremely picky eater and I hate avocado. We just told them to hold the avocado and they didn't make a mistake once! I liked everything I ate pretty much!!!! I enjoyed the J.J., Tiger, Rock n' Roll and Sexy Girl rolls the most. The Dynamite which is one of my BF's favorites is really good here! The desserts are to die for here!!!!Service is pretty good. Few mistakes if any and the servers didn't ever have to be reminded about what we ordered! Give them credit, people order a lot of food here!The interior of the restaurant is pretty nice looking! This place attracts nice people apparently. I chatted with some guys at the bar and some other guy while I was waiting to use the bathroom. This says a lot about the food and ambience!!!! Of course they started the conversation in both cases. I'm usually quiet but the people here are soooo cool I broke out of my shell a bit!This is definitely not a place for sushi snobs and I LIKE IT like that!!!! All the fish tasted fresh and was always very well complemented by the other things the chef put into the rolls. There is only one drawback here, all that being said. You will most likely have to wait at least half an hour most of the time. That's how popular this place is!!!!There is ample parking as this restaurant is in a newer good sized strip mall.Trust me! This is the AYCE experience of a lifetime!!!! I am not into buffets (ugh!) or AYCE (if it's not KBBQ) but this place makes me forget how much I hate most AYCE/buffet establishments!!!!I have to update with a star lost unfortunately. The last few times haven't been as good as before. I think they are suffering from growing pains and staff changes. I do not see my favorite sushi guys and I know one in particular does not work here anymore. While the food is still made right and the cuts were decent, it lost that personal, familiar charm and the new guys didn't make an effort to really talk. It was busy, so fair point that they may not have had the opportunity so maybe something will change again, with time.The big thing for us was the rice has been too warm on visits of late. Last time it was affecting the fish that it was not appetizing. While I get they are busy, they should have someone making and properly cooling rice throughout. It happened twice at a busy but not line out the door rush time. The second time severely changed out love for this place. We will probably come during a off time again and see what happens. I still thought the fish was fresh, I like the rotating specials and the many delicious dessert options.  As of right now, the changes has made this spot suffer a bit for me so it'll be a while until we are back. I'm hoping in that time they figure out how to deal with their popularity and adjust the way they do things to keep a standard.Hostess was totally unreasonable, our seats @ the bar was ready but she made us wait @ least 30 min before she sat us down. She kept walking around, talking to other customers & doing who knows what...WTH??!! -1AYCE Dinner Review $26.95:Sashimi salad yummy 4 starsPoke salad was just ok 5 starsWhite salmon so yummy 5 starsUnagi was just ok 3 starsGrilled mussels yummy 5 starsBlack tobiko caviar was pretty good 4 starsSea urchin uni yummy 5 starsSweet shrimp amaebi so yummy 5 starsSurf clam was soft, not chewy yummy 5 starsScallops was yummy too very fresh 5 starsGreen tea brulee, taste was kinda off 3 starsChocolate mousse was very bland 3 starsRaspberry mousse was too tart 2 starsThe freshness here beats AYCE sushi places in CA hands down.Lychee was so delicious perfect desert w bits of real lychee inside 5 starsGreen tea ice cream good 4 starsRed bean ice cream was ok im not a fan of red bean 3 starsIce creams were much better tasting than all of the mousses =)Overall, this is one of the BEST AYCE sushi places I've tried...=)Sushi House Goyemon has become my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant in town. It is very conveniently located and because of this we are able to come pretty frequently. I can't believe I have been coming here for so long and am just now writing an update to my first review. Everything here is amazing and I tend to like to stick to the nigiri and some of the cooked options here. I can never resist the salmon skin handroll, pork belly and scallop. The dessert selections are all amazing as well. My favorites are the green tea and black sesame creme brulees and my fella can't resist the tempura ice cream. We try to go during off hours so we don't have to wait too long for a table. We have never had any service issues and everyone is always friendly and helpful when we are here. If only they would expand a little into the shop next door so maybe the wait times wouldn't be as long.For a while there Goyemon was very hit or miss for me.. But lately every time I go it has been a definite and delicious HIT~ Especially after checking out most other AYCE spots in the valley.. I've come to realize Goyemon is pretty much the best.. I always give other places the benefit of the doubt but they always leave me wanting more and also feeling angry that I wasted a perfect opportunity to get another stamp on my loyalty card LOL Top Reasons Goyemon is currently #1 for AYCE:*Freshness- I think since they're so busy all of the time they go through fish fast so all of their items are fresh & of good quality.. I love their scallop, yellowtail jalapeño, tuna, salmon, squid, ikura, uni & amaebi nigiri~!!!*Size- The rice to fish ratio is perfect and their nigiri is not too huge so you can sample a little bit of everything.*Appetizers- A good variety ...I always get the tuna poke salad, miso soup with shrimp head & pork belly.   *Rolls- I've never had a roll here LOL but they look huge which some people might consider a plus *Desserts- unlimited and I am addicted to the lychee sorbet ahhhhh*Service- I find that service at the bar is waaaaaaaaaay better than at the tables so try to score a seat there if you can!  The only negatives I can think of are that it's always so busy so go at a weird time~HOT TIP: Ask for fresh wasabi at no extra chargeOne of the best sushi places I've had! Location is a little strange and out of the way but well worth it. Yelpers were spot on with their raving reviews of Goyemon. The inside was very nice and clean and didn't smell :) It was a packed house which is always a good sign of a great establishment. We sat at the sushi bar and Ivan, our sushi chef was amazing. Of course we ordered the AYCE. Loved the fact we can order 1/2 rolls so we could try lots of different items. The nigiri was the perfect bite size. We enjoyed the Hurricane, garlic tuna, masago with quail egg, and I also tried the 911...spicy habanero HELL! We made friends with nearby patrons & started sharing but none of them dared to try the 911. I couldn't feel my face after eating it, thank goodness for the nearby sugar packets to help put out the heat.To finish our meal, lychee sherbet...refreshing and light.Definitely at the top of our list for sushi.I'm afraid to even write this review... EVERYBODY seems to absolutely ADORE this place... I've heard a lot about it, everyone ranting and raving about how GOOD it is. Everytime I try to come here, there is always a wait and HB and I are not about that life. So we came for lunch. HB got a cucumber roll and loved it. I ordered Edamame, Steamed Shumai, Seaweed Salad, Tuna Poke, and yellow tail, tuna, salmoon and fresh scallop nigiri. 'I was FAR from impressed by their Tuna Poke. Amando S. can make it better at home! The Edamame was crisp and good... the Shumai was PLAIN - I think I ate like ONE piece. The Seaweed salad was good... aaaaaand the Nigiri... It was OKAY. The Tuna seemed a little fishier than I normally experience however the Scallop WAS quite good. The scallop is so hit or miss depending where you are at and they served it very well here so that was definitely a good thing! I just don't know what all the hype is about! It was GOOD don't get me wrong but my mind was not blown!This WAS my favorite AYCE place which I had been visiting for the last two years, until my last visit where I had the worst customer service experience EVER.My boyfriend and I are well aware of the policy for uni and sweet shrimp (one order per person), which was what we ordered but the chefs gave us a really hard time about it and would only serve us one order. Not only that but they were hispanic chefs and immediately started bad mouthing us in spanish..... unfortunately I speak spanish as well however I'm light skinned enough to pass off as a white girl..... so I understood everything. SO for any of you who are wondering what the chef is saying while they're staring at you while you're seated in front of them at the bar, don't think they're saying sweet things about you. After we did not receive the order, the chefs continued to ignore us while we sat there in front of them. They continued talking and giggling while taking glances at us. The servers eventually came around to fill our drinks as we had nothing left and the server (also hispanic) asked the chef what was wrong or why we looked annoyed. The chef later replied in spanish that it was because we wanted "more food" so I interrupted and in spanish spoke out to them. OF course the chefs at that point turned bright red since they were unaware that I spoke spanish and was listening to them the entire time. Needless to say I was furious. I'm still baffled that someone can talk all this messed up stuff while you sit in front of them. Thanks to this I will never return.When I first moved to Vegas, my family and I constantly went to Sushi-mon. Then when we moved away, Goyemon opened so whenever I visited Vegas, I always had to go to Goyemon. It was amazing. It was probably my favorite AYCE sushi place in Vegas. The sushi was yummy, they always have some type of specials on the board, and they have other things on the menu for non-sushi eaters. So if you were to come with a huge group of people, you can get a mix of things. One of my FAVORITE items from Goyemon has to be the salmon belly! It is delicious, fatty, and never a disappointment whenever I get it. So why, in heaven's name, did I give it 3 stars? Well ... let me tell you a story.Goyemon had their 3rd Anniversary Customer Appreciation event and it was supposed to last 2 days. They had a list of special items for those days, which included blue fin and toro. With that, they offered the ability for you to make reservations. My friends and I decided to make a reservation for the 2nd day of the event since the 1st day of the event didn't work out with our schedules. The excitement built up even more after we found out that on the first day of the event, they did AYCE toro and AYCE uni! OMG! Like, I can't even WAIT. So when we went in for our reservation, my excitement turns a little bit sour. Why? Well, we had our reservation for 7:30 pm. We get there a little bit early but we have to wait for a table. I'm sorry .. I thought I had a reservation. So what we find out is .. they are still accepting walk ins and because they're typically a walk in restaurant, they don't quite grasp the reservation concept down that well. We actually didn't get seated until maybe at 8 PM.And then they tell us that there is no AYCE toro tonight, only AYCE uni and waygu beef. Well, gee, thanks. What's the point of having a reservation then? Why would you give AYCE toro one night and not the other night? I wanted to flip multiple tables but since we waited for the table, sat down, and were ready to order, we just stayed. So my experience from that is just really really sour. So I learned to just walk in on the days they have yummy specials. That way, I won't be missing out REGARDLESS of what they say. So Goyemon gets an average from me. I still like them and will continue to go to them for AYCE sushi. Service can be slow sometimes though and the servers will look at you funny when you order 20 orders of one thing. Oh and LOVE their yuzu sorbet (:AYCE Sushi!  Let's do it! I'm probably still considered a newbie when it comes to sushi determining what is good and what is great.  From a newbie standpoint, this is great! We met up with some friends to dine on their delicious creations.  Since it was AYCE, I was going to take full advantage and try a variety off the menu. It was busy but there were open seats at the bar for immediate seating.  When you sit there, the waitress will handle sides and drinks.  All you have to do it tell the sushi chef's what you'd like. It was pretty great!  They were so quick on our orders and just fun watching them. I ordered half rolls of the Baked 428, Pete's, Sexy Girl and Frying Jason. The 428 is baked with grilled chicken spread with yum yum sauce, cream cheese, eel sauce and spicy sauce.  Love Love Love this!  I would have been happy with just ordering this.  Can't stop there! Pete's is deep fried sushi with white fish, crab, cream cheese, avocado and eel sauce.  The light texture enveloping this masterpiece from being deep fried made me fall in love with this roll.   Sexy Girl was filled with shrimp tempura, crab and cucumber.  It was then topped with tempura crumb and a spicy garlic sauce which made it totally SEXY! Frying Jason is a baked roll filled with crab, cream cheese, asparagus and avocado topped with spicy yum yum sauce.  Yum Yum indeed!!  I absolutely loved everything I ordered.  I am definitely a fan and will tell anyone who is in the mood for sushi to go here.  Fabulous friends + Fabulous food = Happiness!Yelp Challenge 2014 (150/365)Me and the wifey met up with Bethany E and her hubby Mike for lunch on a Sunday just right after they opened which was 12 pm. Already the place was packed and we were told that the wait was an hour. So we were given the option to sit at the bar. I thought it was better way for we got superb service in getting our rolls because the chefs were literally right in front of us.We opted for the AYCE ($21.95) lunch option which was from 11:45 am to 6 pm. According to the menu, you had 45 minutes to alotted time to do the AYCE which didnt make sense because we were there for at least an hour.What is good to mention is that most of the rolls you can get you have the option of getting a half (4 pieces) or full (8 pieces) roll. I strongly recommend that you get the half rolls so that you have more chances of trying more rolls. Some rolls are only available as a full (refer to menu for they clearly state which ones are not available for half orders). As for what I ordered. Man, I will only tell the names but not describe them because this review would go on forever! That's what's good about doing the ayce option because you can try just about everything!What I got for starters were the Garlic Edamame, Fried Calamari, Ahi Poke, and Shrimp Tempura. Then, we got half orders of the Taylor Roll, Sexy Girl, and Frying Jason, Then full rolls only for the Spider Roll and Pixie Roll. We also tried one order (2 pieces) of the Seared Ahi. Lastly, we finished it up with 2 pieces of Strawberry Mochi.Originally, we wanted a table so we can all hang out much more comfortably while we ate, but after sitting at the bar, I think we got our orders much faster for the chefs actually hand you your order instead of your server grabbing it and bringing it out to your table. If you are at the bar, the servers are mainly there to get your drinks, appetizers, and dessert. Overall, I think that this will be the measuring stick to other sushi places that I will be trying out. The only negative thing that might deserve a mention is the wait time. But after eating here, I can understand why it can be a long wait for they serve good stuff  and the overall size of the place is not that big. Shout outs to Bethany E and her hubby Mike for inviting us to lunch! You guys are awesome!Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #135 "Go Go Goyemon!"Came in for lunch on a hot weekday. I'm not a big fan of AYCE sushi but Sushi House Goyemon also offers lunch specials. Parking was easy to locate. I arrived after the lunch hour began and the place was near capacity for lunch.I opted for the lunch sashimi special which was reasonably priced and included miso soup, rice and salad. The quality of sashimi was unfortunately A-ok with the exception of the salmon which was the tastiest and ended my meal with a generous portion of green tea ice cream. Another con was the spotty service - I had to flag down the waitress for assistance and also request dessert! Not sure if they were having a off day here but I probably wouldn't return here again.I try to avoid doing the all-you-can-eats and buffets.  I never can eat my money's worth!  But whenever I'm in Vegas, I try to make an exception and Goyemon is definitely a place where I go all out.  Skip the skinny jeans and put on that billowy dress with the stretchy belt because we're having half the ocean's worth of fish for dinner tonight, kiddies!I'm Seafood's worst enemy and I take no prisoners at Goyemon!  Goyemon is my ultimate favorite place to go for sushi and it's crazy for me to even say that!  I've taken my brother and friends here and they all go crazy for this place.  Nothing in Arizona can compare.  With uni, sweet shrimp, salmon belly, blue fin tuna, unagi, conch, aji mackerel, garlic tuna, and black tobiko being on their menu, how can I not love this place?  There's so many more amazing bites and everything is fresh [Remember:  fresh salmon should smell like cantaloupe!]!  Even with the all-you-can-eat, they don't try to rip you off by offering more rice and less goodies like a lot of other places do.  It just proves how great their work ethics are.  Don't forgot to check out their ever-changing daily specials.Goyemon is a trendy little place and it's nicely decorated.  The wait time can be pretty crazy and they're always busy.  The wait staff is pretty on point here as long as you're nice and polite.  Loud annoying people generally are given much worse service as we've seen first hand with the annoying drunken jerks next to us.  But in the city where clubrats and lushes prevail, I can see how they're just over it.  Stay on The Strip, fiends! Let me just have Goyemon all to myself.  Give me an hour, dim the lights, and don't come in when my stretchy belt is hanging on the doorknob.  NSFW.WORST SERVICE EVER.. This one's for you IRVING (waiter of the night)!30-40 minutes to even get noticed (yes we timed him)??? Very unacceptable!!! No apologies, only a butt-hurt attitude to add the "cherry on top"..What really set me off is...It is FREEZING in the restaurant, all I asked for was miso soup.. Had to order it twice, almost a 50 min wait for MISO SOUP, and again... Even after the issue was brought up kindly-- no apologies ...Even the guy refilling the waters was more attentive than IRVING..How frustrating for something that could've easily been fixed ...Goyemon! I love you! Definitely my favorite place now for all you can eat sushi. I'm not a sushi expert or anything but I know a great deal when I see one! Every time I've come, sushi has been pretty fresh, food has come somewhat fast and I always leave satisfied! There's usually a wait but to me, they're worth it! The only I don't like is that their stamp card now has like a two month expiration on it. Okay I like sushi, but I think it's safe to say that the majority of people would have a hard time eating sushi 10 times in 2 months. Mehh, lame. But anyways...My favorite rolls-Lemon: California roll wrapped with yellowtail, salmon and sliced lemon drizzled with ponzuMoon: Fresh water eel, scallop yum and avocado served with eel sauce on bed of tempura crumbPuffy: Fresh water eel, cream cheese, cucumber and avocado topped with smelt eggs & eel sauceMoment: Shrimp tempura, scallop yum and avocado topped with smelt eggs & eel sauceHurricane: Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado topped with salmon tempura, smelt eggs & green onion drizzled with eel sauce spicy yum yum sauce & mayonnaisePixie: Deep fried soft shell crab, spicy shrimp yum, cucumber and avocado wrapped in soy paper with smelt eggs & eel sauce on topYum Yum!!! and for the desserts, I love the Lychee Sherbert, Tempura Ice Cream, and Green Tea Creme Brulee!Goyemon is largely heralded as the best AYCE sushi in Vegas. A member of the Mon restaurant group (which also includes Monta and Sushi-Mon), this spot is generally regarded as their best effort and highest quality. Unfortunately, by the time I finally made a trip here, I was underwhelmed. Maybe my familiarity with their Sushi-Mon location on Sahara is to blame- their menus are virtually identical, with Goyemon offering additional items at dinner and some more unique specials. The quality of fish was good, but having a friendly relationship with a Sushi Mon chef garnered me the same product at their sister store. I really didn't see the upside to coming here instead.Service during my recent visit was frustrating- server did not come around very often, food was came out slow and sporadic, and rice was falling apart on all rolls and nigiri. Not what I expect given the reputation that precedes this joint. They were busy, but not overwhelmed. I will say that the menu of rolls is extensive and their pricing is very fair ($22/lunch, $27/dinner). It's also nice that their last dinner seating is at 2AM. Better to visit for dinner than lunch, for increased menu options. But frankly I just found it good, not great.TLDRStandby items: superwhite tuna, garlic tuna, mackerel, and halibut nigiri; Lemon, Moon, Hurricane and Ecstasy rolls. They were out of uni my last visit, appreciate that this was on signage as you entered. Don't bother with the tuna poke, miso soup, or mochi dessert.Wow... What happened to this place?We hadn't been here for a while (since JJanga opened) so we decided to give it a go... The following things caused my dinner to be a 1 star experience:-HOT restaurant... I think the AC might be broken so they had floor fans throughout the restaurant but that didn't really help. It was quite stuffy. -SLOW service... The servers were so slow and the food from the kitchen came out at a snail pace. Miso soups and salads were ordered at the beginning of the meal and didn't come out till mid way through. Plus we had to flag down the servers for water refills.  -RUDE sushi chef... We usually love sitting at the bar but our sushi chef, Denis, was not friendly and never acknowledged us. He never answered when we would place an order... He either really didn't want to be there or he can't speak EngRish? -QUALITY went downhill... The fish was average at best. They were out of uni, quail egg and yuzu sorbet. The sweet shrimp smelled fishy and nothing was amazing. The only positive of the meal was our awesome busser, Ariel. Thank God there is someone who works there that actually wants to be there. The worst part of the meal was the fact that we felt like we were asking a favor every time we placed a sushi order... WTF?!! No thanks.I love that they give little mini rolls as compared to the full thing for ayce..and you can even order half servings!! Definitely gave the bf and I a chance to try everything...well, almost everything. Most of the items (practically all) are available for AYCE, and we very much enjoyed the jellyfish nigiri, and most of the rolls. I think the regular nigiri has too much rice, though I'm comparing to crazy joints such as Asahi sushi and AYCE sushi back in Cali. I don't have much experience with AYCE in Vegas yet, but I do think that Goyemon's quality and unique combos make it one of the top in the area. Definitely a go-to joint, at least to try once!Small note...joint gets PACKED even at midnight, so come prepared to wait at least 30 minutes.Some might say that you shouldn't compromise when looking for a great place to eat. This is one place where you should.Let me elaborate. You'll never experience top-of-the-line fish quality at Goyemon. You won't have the best uni, the most delectable tuna, or the sweetest shrimp. You might have to wait for an hour or more, especially if you bring a larger group. But you'll always be able to have as much reasonable-quality fish (and other tasty things) as you please for $26.95 (or $21.95 for lunch, but that's irrelevant - more info later). You'll always impress friends and family from out of town (disclaimer: yours may not be as cool as mine). Compared to Strip buffets, you'll get superior value, more-than-sufficient variety, and zero lining up in front of heat lamps. Yes, newbies: you place orders here like you would at a normal restaurant, and they cook and prep to order.At Goyemon, choosing dinner (starts at 4pm) is an absolute must. If you don't go for dinner, you won't get grilled pork belly, multiple types of grilled fish (cajun salmon, super white, yellowtail, even salmon kama occasionally), the crowd-pleasing spicy tuna rice cracker, or the extra desserts that often include chocolate mousse, green tea creme brulee (I actually dislike this), yuzu sorbet, and extra mochi flavors. You'll also miss the uni - generally not "good" but at least passable, unlike some other places - and amaebi. I tried lunch once a few months back and was surprised that they do offer nigiri specials, but I missed my dinner exclusive so much.The rotating nigiri specials are rarely or less reliably found at other AYCE places. Salmon belly is often available. Kanpachi (amberjack) is another nice option that I can't recall seeing elsewhere. Conch (rhymes with honk) is a surprisingly good too. Occasionally on holidays or perhaps at some manager's whim, they'll have blue fin tuna or even toro available as specials. They've had a few anniversary or special items from time to time too with special pricing and expanded menu (invariably drawing huge crowds or rapidly filling time slots). These rare treats are always nice.I'll just list some other items that I almost always order: sashimi salad, baked green mussels (it's not overly sauced), super white tuna nigiri, fresh scallop ("hotate") nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, lychee sorbet, green tea ice cream (best texture and flavor I've had at any sushi place). Also, the moon and hurricane rolls (usually half-orders).I congratulate and empathize with all the reviewers who have seemingly lucked into poor service. I may have had relatively slow service once or twice in the past, but it's been reliable the last few times and has left a good impression in long-term memory. If you're with a very small group, sit at the bar for likely improved sushi response times (the servers still cover appetizers/grilled items and drinks). And in general, don't sabotage yourself by under-ordering. I'd say 7-12 items per order is a good range.After dozens of visits over the years, Goyemon is still consistently the best AYCE sushi place that I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Others in town are close, and at least one has marginally superior fish quality, but I'll always bemoan a lack of dessert variety (if it's not one per person, which is a huge negative for those places), a lack of my favorite grilled items, a lack of a stamp card (buy 10 and get a free meal), or something else possibly nitpicky. This is the jewel of the surprisingly good AYCE sushi scene of the desert.This was such an unreal dining experience! The food kept coming and coming... and it was ALL good!  For an All You Can Eat place, I was really surprised at the quality of the sushi ...so fresh and beautifully prepared!My friend was celebrating her birthday in Vegas, and I was her chauffeur. Her aunt and uncle invited us to dinner - how can I refuse a free meal?  We used Google Maps which took us to the townhouses right after the restaurant. If you drive there, slow down and look for the sign for the restaurant! We got there at 4pm which is a great time - before the crowd gets there. The contemporary, clean, beautiful interior matched the beautiful, organized plates of sushi. I'm not sure about the service. It seemed like aunty kept asking about her order of Hamachi and our server kept replying that he would "check on it". Eventually, it did arrive. The amount of rice was the big surprise... I thought it would be a lot so that we would fill up faster. This was not the case. The fish-to-rice ratio was perfect! Also, I didn't taste any added wasabi - just add your own!  The ikura, saba, scallops (with a hint of lime), maguro, uni, unagi, & amaebi were superb! We also had some of the special rolls (Caterpillar and Dragon) for fun! We were supposed to be there for just 2 hours but they didn't chase us out. We did see the line to get in, so it was time to go and let the next set of customers have their turn!  I'll go with you if you need a ride!STANDS OUT FROM THE RESTI have been here for the A.Y.C.E. & recently I just came here to grab some lunch w/ the in-law fam bam... A.Y.C.E. is definitely awesome for dinner as they have a good variety as well as daily specials which is always a plus!! The place is pretty small & there is pretty much always a wait when it comes to dinner time... I don't know if I have ever been here & there hasn't been a wait. For LARGE parties they do have a secret dining area as well which is a bit secluded which is nice especially when you try to talk amongst everyone in your group or your group is just darn routy ahahhahaService is pretty quick & they show you a good time... I say props for when I came to eat w/ friends & they we're able to take care of all 20 of us smoothly & kept the food coming to feed 16 bois & 4 girls who were starving & came to chow down! *bravo*Besides the A.Y.C.E. they have pretty good specials as well which is nice when you are not tryna eat a whale during the day time.SUSHI DINNER $11.95 - you can choose from Cali roll or spicy tuna roll & then it comes w/ 7 pieces of sushi (2 tuna. white fish. yellowtail. salmon. eel. shrimp) The combinations also come w/ house salad & miso soup.SASHIMI DINNER $13.95 - also choose Cali roll or spicy tuna roll & then it comes w/ 12 pieces of sashimi (3 tuna. 2 yellow tail. 3 salmon. 2 albacore. 2 red snapper) This also comes w/ house sale & miso soup.NABE YAKI UDON $11.95 - I got this dish & it came w/ an order of Cali roll & house salad which was freaken awesome because I was totally only expecting to get the udon itself! Way to surprise the fat kid =] but it did say it on the menu.. I just didn't read it hahahahOCTOPUS POKI SALAD $5.95 - pretty good & simple served w/ seaweed salad & onions w/ a sesame oil dressing.ICE CREAM $2.50 - we got green tea. yuzu. & lychee which came in 2 little scoops =] green tea is green tea... yuzu was refreshing & lychee was sweet refreshingOH MY GOD!!! The best AYCE sushi i've been to. Everything was so tasty.. you can taste all the ingredients in every bite. I've been to a few AYCE and they taste so bland. Goyemon is the best AYCE sushi. Everything on their menu tasted so good. Even their green tea and mochi ice cream is yummy. I like how they make their rolls a little smaller than normal, gives you enough room in your tummy to try other items on their menu. Great friendly service. Our waitresses were so nice to us. Definitely coming back here when i'm in Vegas.
Citizen Public House=If being a good public citizen means I get to eat at a restaurant like Citizen Public House, then I vow never to roll through a stop sign again! I had the chance to check out Citizen Public House for dinner last night and was eager to take a bite into the culinary adventures of Chef Bernie and pastry delights of Tracy Dempsey. We arrived to enter a cozy atmosphere full of energy from the group of guests enjoying their meals. The setting here is simple but simple does the trick because the food and drinks are excellent. We started with cocktails and an appetizer. I was told the coconut drink (I'm blanking on the name) was like a vacation in your mouth and considering that I've got the tropical itch, I opted for that immediately. They warned me it was a stiff drunk, but I had no idea how stiff they really meant! Let me just put it this way, if you are looking for a cocktail that will do the drink for the entire meal, this is your drink. I didn't need another after just this one! Moving on to the food now! We started with a bar snack appetizer of Kilt Lifter fondue with sausage, pears and bread. It was a perfect snack to get our appetites moving and munch on the food while we waited for out entrees. The pears and fondue were an interesting combination but it grows on you after awhile. Apparently, I was feeling cheesy that night because for my entree, I went for the Grilled Halloumi Cheese which is on Serbian lepijna bread, with chickpea puree, pickles, Campari tomato, tender greens, tahini. I liked to think of it as a grown up's grilled cheese. Although it didn't have any meat in it, the sandwich was hearty and satisfying enough that it didn't need any. I had a taste of the Smart Chicken and that was excellent as well! To end the good citizen meal, we had to try a Tracy Dempsey desert because how could you pass up one of these delicacies! We were told that the Chocolate Toffee Bread Pudding is a must for chocolate lovers. They weren't kidding! The dessert was delicious and just the right amount of sweet to end the meal. I like Citizen Public House because it isn't pretentious and while it's in the heart of Old Town, it doesn't have the Old Town scene vibe. It's perfect for an evening of good good and tasty cocktails in a comfortable setting. I can't wait to visit again!Five stars for the cocktails, desserts, and service, four stars for the entrees I've sampled so far and the ambiance.Over a total of four visits to CPH, I've sampled five of their cocktails and a number of their appetizers and desserts along with two entrees, met and interacted meaningfully with all three of the owners (including the at least locally-renowned Chef Bernie Kantak, creator of Cowboy Ciao's Stetson Chop Salad [which is recreated here]), and generally thoroughly enjoyed myself on each occasion. The space is large enough to accommodate large parties or couples with equal aplomb. I've twice now toured the private upstairs space, and look forward to finding a fitting occasion to fill it with close friends. I've had fantastic service upon each of my visits - twice sitting at the bar, once at a Yelp event, and finally for a normal dinner, and feel completely confident in suggesting CPH to the most demanding diner. I'll update or edit this review to talk more about the food once I've had the short ribs and the lamb burger. The entrees I've tried thus far (the salmon and the chicken) didn't quite plumb the depths of my soul, and while the appetizers I sampled on other occasions were excellent, I don't remember any of them well enough to cover them in any detail. Hey, it was a busy month! I will say that the salads I've tasted are all amazing and that the bread pudding dessert was an absolute revelation right up there with the one delivered to John on the Isle of Patmos.I've saved what I feel to be the best feature of CPH for last: the drinks. I could attempt to describe the feeling of anticipation I felt watching Richie rinse the old fashioned glass in preparation for a sazerac, or the deep happiness the feel of the froth of the pisco sour brings me when it hits my lips, or even the wistful yet satisfied feeling I got when I drained the last drops of the bijou (pronounced bizh-OOOh) from its martini glass, but I won't bore you any further - just go and taste (and *feel*) for yourself.  The wine and beer lists will certainly offer you something you'll love, should your tastes run that way.  In sum: good food and great drinks served by lovely people in a nice setting for reasonable prices. Far and away my favorite bar in Old Town.So nice to have a new type of environment to hang out in Scottsdale.Decor - Its so clean and sophisticated sharp decor right when you walk in tn the door , you immediately want a drink when you see the beautiful bar in the center of the floor. OK OK I'm a little obsessed I know:) with good reason!!Food- I have tried several things on the menu and was impressed with every hing ! LAMB BURGER!!! a must!!!Service was friendly and professional. This place is here to stay !Have you ever heard of a salad that is so popular that it has its own Facebook page? I know I couldn't believe it either, but this isn't any ordinary salad. Think tidy rows of smoked salmon, Israeli couscous, asiago cheese, arugula, sweet dried corn, black currants and pepitas (toasted pumpkin seeds) topped with a creamy pesto dressing all tossed table-side. The Stetson Chopped Salad should not only have its own fan page but its creator, Chef Bernie Kantak, should be given a hug every time you see him at his new Citizen Public House. Located in what used to be the valleys original Trader Vic's, there isn't a tiki torch in sight. Instead you'll find a contemporary space outfitted with wood accents, leather booths and a stainless steel-topped bar. The vibe is casual and relaxed elevated by outstanding service on every one of my visits. If you're wondering what a public house is, well simply put it's a tavern that also serves food. While they do serve some great drinks and have an excellent wine list, I'd be hard pressed to call Citizen a mere tavern. How many taverns have you ever heard of serving pork studded Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn ($5)? Or how about a pot filled with creamy 'Kilt Lifter' Fondue ($9) savory hunter's sausage, sweet tangy pears and toasted country bread? If you have, please let me know right away.For dinner I couldn't recommend The Original Chopped Salad ($12) more but if you don't like smoked salmon, they can make it with chicken instead. The Mirliton Chopped Salad ($12), a composition including chayote, snow pea greens, tomatoes, popcorn, grilled halloumi cheese; cucumber-onion salad tossed with a tangy parsley-garlic dressing was a fantastic textural explosion but lives in the shadow of its older sibling.I'm not even sure where to start with the entrees; I guess it comes down to price point. Take the lower priced lusciously juicy Lamb Burger ($12) topped with a cucumber salad, zesty tzatziki and served with fries, you'd think with flavor and quality like this would be much more expensive. At the other end of the price range sit the fantastically meaty Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs ($28) complete with a side of brightly sour dried cherry bbq sauce and roasted parsnip puree. Somewhere in between is the juicy "Smart" Chicken ($18) which refers to the brand not the chicken's admission into the Mensa Society. Desserts by Tracy Dempsey were all that and a bag of cookies, literally. Cookies and Milk ($6) were delightfully chewy and come served in a sealed pouch for freshness, of course the milk was ice cold just perfect for dunking. Three words, Strawberry Pound Cake ($9). A thick slice of strawberry olive oil pound cake is lightly grilled then served with vanilla malted ice cream, chocolate sauce and malted strawberry streusel and like the Stetson salad it was Facebook worthy.5 stars. You heard me.Man, am I late on this review...My sweetie took me to dinner at CPH for my 35th birthday. I know what you're all thinking... "but Kristi...you don't look a day over 34&3/4." Stop....no, pleassssseeee enough with the flattery folks. I can't take it anymore. No seriously. Keep going..Turns out CPH is right up there with the likes of Nobuo at Teeter House and FnB when it comes to quality and experience. Excellent wine selection. Please, if you have the opportunity, try the 'Tender Belly' bacon fat heirloom popcorn. It was delicious. Though bacon fat could probably make dog poo tasty. I enjoyed the Porcini-dusted Filet Mignon, medium rare and had a couple of nibbles of my fiance's scallops (which were amazing). The Filet was cooked to perfection and though I'm somewhat of a purist and usually prefer my steak 'au-natural' I was beyond satisfied with the accoutrement. Impressed even. The service was phenomenal. The distress surrounding my age caused me to consume a gigantic Ketel martini, a shit load of wine (local by the way, I love that) and a desert drink and not once was I cut off. Truly though, our server was a doll. Engaging and genuine; something obviously lacking in the service industry in Arizona. The only thing I would change about CPH is the location and that's only due to my location, so I'll deal with it.Molten drinks please.  Grand Master Mixologist Richie Moe @CitizenPubHouse whipped up a couple shots for my wonderful wife and I that brought much of the bar to a silence on a crowded Saturday night. When he heard we were celebrating our anniversary he said he'd like to make us a special drink...and he felt like burning something.The end result was kind of like bananas foster in a shot glass.  It involved melting Mexican chocolate in a metal mixing cup, flaming 160 proof black strap rum, Richie repeatedly pouring a flaming mixture of orange liquid with blue flames from cup to cup in an arc that captured everyone's attention.Outstanding drink with an outstanding show leading up to it.We've been to CPH twice and had great food and outstanding drinks each time.  If I am in the mood for a cocktail, this is where I want to go. If you're in the mood to go out for drinks and a bite, this is your place. Enjoy.Yelp Eats Week 2011 (50% off!), Take 1:Easily a 4.5, maybe a 5-star review, but tonight's wait times for the entrees were too long, AND the restaurant was VERY noisy, and if there's one thing I really dislike, it is dining in a noisy venue!  I estimate that we waited at least 10 minutes our Sausage of the day app (chorizo, w/ a side salad that included pickled onions), which was fine, assuming by the time we sat down and ordered, it was already 8:15p (app photos* were taken at 8:28p), but I'd also placed our orders for the Pan-seared scallops (sub parsnip puree for the corn grits) and the Tender Belly strip steak at the same time as I'd ordered the app.  These did not arrive until shortly before I took photos (8:57p).  Andrew personally sat us at a table, but quickly obliged our request to move to another location that was a little less noisy- a booth had just opened up.  Nice touch, and it was greatly appreciated!  However, as the wait times extended longer and longer, the noise did get to my mother, who was very hungry and tired.  Subtract the long wait times and the excessive noise, I'm left w/ friendly and accommodating, yet VERY slow service (Andrew said I'd be able to sub something else for the corn-based sides in all of the "Yelp Eats" menu... I went w/ the dessert-sweet parsnip puree) and fantastic food!  The strip steak, cooked medium, was not overly-seasoned, and Mom was enjoying the meal, which was accompanied by a gorgonzola-corn spoon bread ("just like eating bread pudding"),  stone-fruit compote (apricot), and  crunchy pistachios.  I LOVED the compote, which really added to my enjoyment of Mom's entree choice.  I also loved the scallops entree, which consisted of three scallops that were around 1.75 inches in diameter each and sat on the parsnip puree, topped w/ sauteed snow pea greens and a gastrique made w/ Red Rock cola.  The applewood-smoked bacon lardons tasted nutty and had a nut-like mouth-feel, as well.  My first few bites of scallops and puree were lovely, but then the sweetness became too much, since the scallops were naturally sweet themselves.  Mom REALLY enjoyed the scallops (she didn't have much of the puree), much more so than the strip steak;  Hearing her hum w/ pleasure made me feel so happy!  :)  I would love to visit again, but on a less-busy time- it was, after all, first day of "Yelp Eats 2011."  Maybe for lunch?  I also put in a request to add the bread pudding fondue Yelpers enjoyed at the Yelp party held here in February on the regular menu; Andrew said that the venue still served it, but on special events.  While I was not able to enjoy the bread pudding tonight (I intend to visit again before YE' week ends), I did bump into Donjay S., who had tried it and said it was good, but not as good as the fondue version.  This menu's version includes bacon-- I cannot wait to try it!(*Lost my card adapter, and the photos uploaded using the USB seem to be corrupted... Please return back to view the photos, which will be uploaded soon!)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA?select=pfXMOtx6TQCUJlfsw6qZyAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA?select=_fOtfCw4UONRwxFaj68TXwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA?select=DfQI2P_ONdYqtNV1435YhQ"Have you ever been over to a friend's house to eat and the food just aint' no good?"You know the famous line from the Sugar Hill Gang. You won't have to feel that way at this house, because this house has the sauce that is awesome.Yeah, Citizen Public House might just be the most legit place in all of Arizona. I don't know what took me so long to get here.This is a destination for foodies, and not just because it's been featured on the Cooking Channel or the Food Network.Some Highlights:--Tender Belly Bacon Fat Popcorn! (Not for the pretentious and idiotic)--Gorgonzola-Emmental mac-n-cheese (Not for the lactose)--The Chopped Salad (This ish is famous yo)--The Squealer Burger (yeah, it has bacon in it)This place is absolutely amazing.If you appreciate food, and can afford to splurge both in the wallet and palate, then make this a destination. Absolutely worth it. Next time, I want to try the Lamb Burger.Also, the cocktail and draught list is solid. Goose Island Matilda FTW! (Yes, I know its a Budweiser product)CPH is great for groups!I admit it, (and I'm sorry, Chef Bernie), but I've only been to Citizen Public House on two occasions to date... That being said, both times I was there for events, and both times CPH did a great job.  My first visit was an event with passed appetizers and drinks shortly after they opened, and the other was for a happy hour / sit-down dinner for a group of 45 people, just last week.  Since it's more fresh in my mind, I'll go into more detail about the latter visit... We started on the patio and had drinks and some light apps including hummus and flatbread and their delicious bacon fat heirloom popcorn.  (They had vegetarian popcorn as well).  After about an hour, we moved inside to where there were three large rectangular tables set for our group with our own special menus.  We were able to choose from two mini-salads and four entrees and then we had family-style desserts.  I went with the infamous "original Chopped salad" to start and then chose the Pan Seared Scallops as my entree.  I think I cleaned both plates... and those around me likely had order envy as I definitely ordered right!  In addition, service was spectacular... somehow the Citizen staff managed to serve all 45 of us within minutes of each other!  They also kept our waters and our wine glasses full, which I'm sure added to the experience.I recently saw a preview of the new fall menu which includes some interesting items such as Chicken & Waffles, Applewood Smoked Duck Breast, and Grits + Gumbo... I will have to head back over there soon to give these things a try... that is, if I feel adventurous enough to order something other than what I know I love (the original Chopped salad and the scallops).  Whether you stick with your old stand-by favorites or try something new, enjoy!While I've never actually eaten a full meal at CPH, this is probably my favorite place for drinks and apps.  I don't even care that their happy hour discounts are not that great.First off, they make a version of a sloe gin fizz.  Based on that alone, I'm at 5 stars.  The fact that it was fantastic was just an added bonus.  Second, they ingeniously thought to put bacon fat in the popcorn.  Now we're at 10 stars.    Third, 'kilt lifter" fondue.  Need I say more?02/15/16Forgive me, oh Lord, for I have sinned... I don't know what I was thinking eating a sandwich, side salad, AND drinking an entire blackberry mojito (it was sooooo good!) at a nearby restaurant when I could have just had a couple of bites there and then gone for a second cocktail here...  Of course, instead of ordering a cocktail (the flaming cocktail expert Richie Moe wasn't in the house, yo!), I decided to go for an espresso and try that delicious-sounding black & tan pudding http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA?select=eKxPXAmYF0fu0b38M4lpsA  our server said was his favorite dessert on the menu.  By the time the sweets arrived, I'd already inhaled the espresso, so I had to get a cup of drip coffee, black.  Oh lordy, lordy, lordy- what a beautiful combo the decadent chocolate pudding and luscious and oh-so-sinfully-creamy caramel (my fave of the two flavors), topped with fresh whipped cream and a peanut brittle crumble made w/ both coffees!  Yeah, me wanna love you long time!A shout out to our super-fun server, Newman.  What a terrific guy!  ;)If I lived in Scottsdale I'd probably be broke in a short amount of time because I'd be spending all my money buying cocktails at Citizen Public House. Drinks like The Persian (Absolut Wild Tea vodka, St. Germain elderflower liqueur, housemade sweet & sour, Persian cucumber juice, lemon peel, served on the rocks) or the Citi-Zen (Absolut Pear vodka, Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur, housemade sweet & sour, rock candy, lemon twist, served up.) Or I might find myself slipping in through the back door to head to the upstairs speakeasy, buying a tableside gin and tonic and laughing my best mad scientist laugh while doing so.Or I might just have to eat the Chopped Salad every.single.day of the rest of my life.Or I might live on Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn alone.All I know is that it's a good thing I don't happen to live in Scottsdale...Would it be rude or pretentious of me to admit that I wouldn't find great food and cocktails in Scottsdale? Well, mea culpa. I honestly didn't expect much out of this city when it comes to comestibles. But Citizen Public House surprised me on all levels. The cocktails here are crazy good. They even have a little 'speakeasy'-ish mixology lab upstairs that's all secret and only accessible by... wait... can I tell? Anyway, these folks are making some interesting drinks with house-made infusions, tinctures, and various chemistry equipment. Better than the best drinks in PDX? I don't know about that, but impressive all the same. The food is a very big surprise for me. The chop chop salad is, from what I understand, legendary, and from tasting it I am not surprised. I also sampled some tasty meatloaf and delicious scallops. The fact that I can't recall the dessert doesn't mean it wasn't memorable, I think it had to do with my focus on the drinks and mains. I recall everyone at the table enjoying them. Service? Impeccable. 'Nuff said. Consider me a little humbled.I really love this part of Scottsdale.  You have a vast choice of amazing restaurants.  We decided to try Citizen Public House.  The atmosphere is an energetic one.  I can't really remember the last time I went to a restaurant at 5:30 in evening and seen such a lively place.Now for the food.  We started with the bacon popcorn.  I was only ok, but it was also only about $2 or so.  We decided to have the pork belly pastrami and the butternut squash soup.  The soup was ok, but I wouldn't order it again.  The pork belly was amazing.  I can't wait to go back and have it again. We shared the short rib.  It was a pretty healthy portion.  My husband and I were able to share one.  The bbq sauce was a tad bit on the bitter side.  I think I will try the scallops next time.The cocktails were amazing.  I'm really into cucumber right now, so the Persian was to die for.Service was great!  Our food came out quickly.How is it that I don't write reviews for places I absolutely love to go.  I think that when I truly LOVE a place, I get writer's block.  I generally don't know where to begin, so let me start with the item that drew me in.... Bacon Popcorn.  If you read my reviews, you know by now that popcorn is my favorite food.  My second favorite is bacon.  When a place takes those 2 things and puts them together in one dish, it won't take much to make me a fan, for life.When I walk in Citizen Public House and pull up a seat at the bar, I feel like I'm in a craftsman style supper club.  The interior of the building itself is beautifully appointed, yet simple with those beautiful wooden beams.  There is a lovely patio area as well.I've dined on several things from the menu.  I've gone for dinner with reservations and I've stumbled in late night for a bowl of popcorn and libations.  By far my favorite thing on the menu, save the Bacon popcorn, is the Chopped Salad.  I enjoy it every time I've gone.  I'm a creature of habit and it is hard for me to order something different at a restaurant when I've found something I enjoy a lot.  HOWEVER, I love it that I have some adventurous friends and I've managed to try several of their drinks and menu items.  I like the fact that they host a monthly cocktail tasting.  Come in and taste their crafted cocktails for about $65 with some food pairings.  Their drinks are adventurous, but to be honest, I've had better crafted cocktails around Phoenix.  I would give them 5 stars, but I did order something once that was not prepared correctly and I had to convince the server that it wasn't.  I didn't have to twist his arm but he tried to tell me that it was correct and etc, but I said no, I don't think so.   I suppose after the server took it to the back and examined the food item more, he discovered I was right.  They remade the item for me and the night kept going.  But that makes me wonder if the menu is being prepared correctly.  I wouldn't know, probably never will since I'm stuck on that salad. (SN: I think their chopped salad has a facebook page.)   And the menu doesn't change often enough.Another downer is the fact that there is no audible music.  I'm on the fence if I'd want it there or not, but when I've gone, I notice I look around thinking, we could use some atmospheric music.  I also think that place would rock with a really good Jazz band playing live music there.Please don't get me wrong, this place has excellent service.  The fact of the matter is that I will definitely be back  CPH has the chance to earn 5 stars from me.If there's a place in old town that you can rely on for quality in food and service, this is the place.  You get what you paid for.  Based on my last few visits, it seems to always be busy, which as you know is a great sign.  This is a place where you come for a date, birthday or just about any type of occasion you can think of.  These are what I consistently get and enjoy:+ Chopped Salad: BOMB.  You cannot come here and not get this.  If you don't have a big appetite, this is a must.  The corn, salmon and dressing does it for me every time.  You just can't go wrong here.+ Lamb Burger: Its very tasty and juicy.  It can be a little messy if you mishandle it.  So I suggest just slicing it in the middle.  + Kale Caesar Salad: BOMB.  Kale is a super vegetable that is packed with nutrients.  They make the Kale anti-bitter with a great balanced Ceasar dressing, served with a cheesy, toasty bread! Some things can break your wallet but if you manage to try to share your plates in your party, you will walk out okay.  Drinks aren't too pricey.  But if you want to keep the night going, I suggest heading up to their sister bar, Citizen R+D, a speakeasy that is around the building and requires a secret phone call to reserve a table.There's not much to complain about really.  For its consistency and quality, I will always have them on my go to places.I went to Gibson's in Chicago and never thought I'd find a steakhouse like that in Scottsdale... until I was introduced to Citizens. One of my best friends + her boyfriend are steak snobs and only eat steak at this restaurant. It was their birthday celebrations and they, of course, wanted dinner here before the party. The staff was so accommodating. They let me bring cakes for both of their birthdays (see photos) and checked on our group consistently the entire night. The manager is great friends with the couple so he made sure everything and everyone was well taken care of. The food was extraordinary. I ordered the short ribs the first time and the filet mignon during our second visit. The meat was very tender and full of seasoning (unlike most steakhouses). The short ribs come with this cherry BBQ sauce that is something I've never experienced before - but perfected the meal. Also, I'm kind of hooked on their house drink called The Citizen... but it is one sneaky ass drink! It takes like candy and you feel like you're just drinking juice... then after 15 minutes, you're drunk.Be mindful of the price of this establishment prior to your arrival. It's worth the amount but it is on the pricey side. If that's not an issue for you... go here and enjoy!Came in with friends for cocktails.  Marian and I tried the Pyrat Eye for $5 each on the happy hour menu. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/citizen-public-house-scottsdale?select=qP8gnrbtP8N9BMaFlGh6vA#qP8gnrbtP8N9BMaFlGh6vA  Others had a Negroni HH special, a glass of pinot noir (half-off during HH), and Boulevardier (also $5 on HH).  I did not really like the dark rum cocktail.  The scent reminded me of rum and coke, which I never cared for when I tried it many, many years ago, and when I took a sip, did not get the satisfying cola taste at all, and instead came away tasting very bitter dark rum.  It certainly wasn't as unpalatable as I make it sound, since I did finish half of it.  I just wasn't a fan.  If you're all about getting drunk fast though, then this might be a drink for you!  Next time, I'll just stick to wine.When I felt the buzz coming on after only a few sips, I decided to go with the table bread that everyone had passed on earlier.  This prompted orders of Kiltlifter fondue and bacon popcorn from everyone else-- so happy!!  The cheese fondue paired the best with the toasted cubes of bread, although I skipped on the pear that Chrissy P. was loving!  (Pear doesn't like me very much.)  We all raved about the farmer's sausage from Shannon's (sorry, forgot the whole name).  The spice level was perfect!  Wished there were more slices on the plate!  I skipped on the popcorn (corn allergy), but I did try a sliver of bacon-- it was floppy, not crispy, so I left it on my plate.  The warmed, but not toasted, table bread was good, and paired only with a tiny cup of extra-virgin olive oil.  I was hoping for butter, but the EVOO did have a great, mild flavor with slight buttery notes when consumed with the bread.Citizen Public House is an upscale, modern American restaurant where you can find plenty of unique dishes and a signature salad with its own Facebook site.My Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - We checked out Citizen Public House on a week night, but it was still busy.  Lights will be dim, noise will be loud, but everything around you is modern.  If you're looking for a quiet place, Citizen Public House is not it.  But if you're ok with the high energy and noise you'll love it.Service - Our server was better than great.  He was very accommodating.   We made reservations over the phone for a large party, and he secured a semi-private room for us and let us put in several appetizer orders ahead of time.  Throughout the meal the entire team went above & beyond, making sure we were ok, talking about our love of food, and making sure our experience would be perfect.  1 Star.Food - The appetizers rule at Citizen Public House.  I think it's ridiculous that a SALAD has its own Facebook page.  Then I ate it.  It was ridiculously good.  The presentation itself is great, and once the servers mix it together, it becomes a fresh, modern, texture packed bite.  I will admit I doubted it but now I'm a believer. Bacon fat popcorn.  Yes.  It was even great the next day.  Pork Belly Pastrami - tender, well-seasoned, and could have been my main meal.  Which is funny because looking back, I enjoyed all the appetizers a lot more than the main courses.  The scallops were good and my short rib was not as tender as I would have liked, but after our appetizer fest it really didn't matter.  Bottom line is the pre-meal is where I'll put my money in the future.  1  1/2 Star.Will I Return? - For the apps!  Not sure the main courses are worth it for a return visit, but I would come back and order the same delicious starters as I did that night.  Now, Citizen Public House is not cheap, so that's all I would be able to afford.   1/2 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.Food like this exists?! In Scottsdale?! I think Scottsdale has better tasting food than San Diego! I saw Citizen on yelp and had my eye on it but was a bit tainted because my friend and I have bad experiences with "gastropubs" or at least the ones in Cali. It always turned out to be horrible tasting food that tries tooooo cool and overpriced... we took the leap of faith and said fck it lets do it, maybe Scottsdale gastropubs will be different, and indeed it was!We couldn't get reservations (place is packed for a good reason) but the hostess said there were bar seats available, and we were cool with that. We just wanted food in and out. Also it was fight night, all the other bars were charging $20 each, why not spend that money on good food instead? I couldn't believe how good the food tasted here. I was in shocked because... well it's Scottsdale, wasn't sure if this was a foodie mecca. Citizen (and amongst other places) proved me wrong. We decided not to stuff our faces and instead get 2 apps and 1 entrees. -Chia Seared Tuna: the best seared tuna and most creative seared tuna I've tried thus far...and I eat out a lot (1130+ reviews). The chia seeds were unique and gave it an amazing crunch! Put that with the asparagus puree, black-like rice and a spicy puree...it was a burst of flavors in your mouth. We licked the plate clean.-Crabcakes: For a landlock town, they sure weren't stingy on the crab meat! Every bit had crab and the breading was at a minimal so you actually tasted the crab!The aioli was also good on it but it was flavorful itself you probably didn't need it!-Pork Osso Buco: We usually have lamb, but pork is also a good alternative. The pork by itself is dry, but if you actually mix all the flavors it was not at all dry and had sooo many flavors. The polenta that tasted like butter and cheese with the roasted tomatoes and kale... it literally made my mouth melt and fall in love with this dish. The kale was cooked perfect! I can eat this everyday. Everything we had that night was excellent. This place sure was not the hype. Service was great, good was great, company was great... I think this is as good as it gets in Scottsdale for dinner... put this in SD and it'll be the new "it" restaurant. *Hint Hint* Come on over
Nefelie's=I'll continue to stand by my one-star rating... the owner of the restaurant has sent me threatening and derogatory emails, messages with fake Yelp accounts, and now a recent comment here.  One comment said something along the lines of "You don't know what I'm capable of", which is exactly why I will continue to warn others from "dining" at this establishment.  I think the lesson to be learned in all of this is that while sanitation issues can happen from time to time, the key is recognizing the problem, apologizing and making it right.  Instead, what Nefelie's has done is harass me and told me I am wrong.  This is definitely not the right way to do things as a human being or business owner!
Leo's Island BBQ=-ALOHA!!! If you crave the creamy taste of authentic macaroni salad from Hawaii, look no further...yum, yum, yum!-Kalua pork was tender, smokey, and moist...yum! yum! yum!-Grilled BBQ chicken was tender and so good!...yum! yum! yum!-The noodle soup was so good - $5.99 and the portions are very generous!-Crispy shrimp was crispy, maybe panko breading? It was so good! Not greasy! Perfectly cooked. Must have more!-They even have SPAM on the menu too (if you've been to Hawaii, then you know that SPAM is offered everywhere - even at McD's too!)-Service - FRIENDLY, SUPER NICE, and very cordial. -Order your food at the counter and wait for your number to be called, or they bring it to your table on a tray. Fantastic service!-The PORTIONS are VERY GENEROUS!!! Two people could easily share one combo plate...unless you are a very BIG eater. Two scoops of sticky rice, a scoop of macaroni salad, and sauteed cabbage come with your meal.-They do offer a rice bowl with choice of meat for $4.99 if you want a smaller meal.-CLEAN place!!! Clean restroom!-Parking is very convenient. Leo's is located across the parking lot from Barnes & Nobles and next to Baskin Robbins.-Mahalo!I grew up in Hawaii (lived there for 20 years) and after moving to the mainland a few years ago, the only good Hawaiian/Korean style BBQ I've had was in Vegas, which the kama'aina refer to as the 9th island due to the many people from Hawaii who've moved there. Since moving to AZ a year ago, we've only had our cravings satisfied when we go to Vegas, that is, until we found out about Leo's. Granted, it's not 100% authentic, but then again, there's nothing like it out here, especially in the west valley. The bbq chicken is super tender and tasty, mac salad is superb, and the katsu curry is ono-licious! Musubi's are pretty good, though there's too much rice. The broccoli and the occasional romaine lettuce used to soak up the oils is a bit odd, but it doesn't detract from the flavors at all...most of the time the usual cabbage is still used. Our first visit there they were playing some uh..."interesting" music, but subsequent visits have yielded better results, and it finally has more of a local flavor. Add that to the friendly employees/owner and their awesome food, and they've got a regular customer in me. Until of course, when they add spicy chicken or pork to their menu, which means I'm gonna have to go more often!Leo's does a really decent plate lunch. As for the people complaining about certain dishes, it's more a matter of expectation, rather than execution.My brother in law is from the big island Hawaii... pidgin and all (which I secretly love when he breaks in to, but will deny if he asks), so I have heard all the stories about plate lunches and the time he ate three in one setting, etc. He LOVES a plate lunch and he likes the ones here. I'm trusting that he knows of what he speaks.Yes the macaroni salad is bland. That is how they make it there. It is basically a ton of mayo, macaroni, a smidge of grated onion, and usually a hint of tuna. Basically you get additional flavoring from the grilled meat or add it with a little shoyu. If that doesn't sound like what you are "used" to getting, you probably aren't going to like it. But I have to say all that mayonnaise makes my heart sing.I personally love the BBQ chicken and the lemon pepper chicken. Mostly because they are on the healthier side. If you order the lemon pepper chicken with no rice or salad and extra cabbage, it's low-carb and low calorie, in addition to being really tasty.The chicken katsu is also very good. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. And my BIL likes the spam musubi. Well he likes any musubi actually. :)Service is fast. The eating area is clean. The meals are cheap. And I actually like that there is no "corporate office" to complain to. If you want to eat at a chain, go somewhere else. This is family owned and operated.I like Leo's. If you have a family, order the family dinner and pull up a chair, because you are going to be there a while. It's a lot of good food!Good lord, the macaroni salad makes you want to give up and quit your job so you can pull up a chair to the kitchen window and eat it all day. The short ribs are my favorite meal- they are seasoned that perfect balance of sweet & savory- and all the platters are big enough for a huge dinner or two lunches...if you eat like most mainlanders eat. If you're a Samoan, eh, not so much...you better order two meals!The staff is always friendly and smiling and the dining room is very clean. The menu has catering prices on the back page, and you could get a backyard luau going for 50 people for about $200.I'll totally host the luau as long as it's BYOB and I can keep the leftovers.
Tempe Tavern=The Bar is OK..the food looks better than it taste. I just want to warn anyone who goes to the T. Tavern not to make any jokes or comments about the Adult book store located just east of the establishment. I must have struck a nerve or something. I made, what I considered an innocent comment/joke about the bar being right next door to a Porn shop. The snotty, little, freak bartender went berserk !  She really got her panties in a bunch and probably disfigured the ugly-ass tattoo on her butt. She immediately had me escorted out. If you go there..Just watch what you say..I know at least one bartender there that has absolutely no sense of humor.. what-so-ever.Never want to go back, no matter who's playing. First of all the stage is shitty and the room is so small my ears are ringing for what I can tell is gonna last for days.  Food was poor and overpriced. Our waitress was nice but I spent $10 on a double whiskey something and didn't even feel a buzz.  That's saying a lot for the huge lightweight I am, and my drink was at least 24 ounces. Lastly there's barely any parking, and we got towed for parking in an adjacent parking spot where the towing sign was almost on the ground so we didn't see it when we first parked there.Let me start by saying I go to bars to see bands.  I've seen several shows at this bar.  It even has a surprisingly nice sound system for such a small room.  It should be a perfect place to enjoy a live band.  Instead, it is a PAINFUL DUNGEON where live music is an endurance test rather than a pleasure.  The problem?  One incompetent sound man and management too apathetic to notice.  The dreadlock entangled caucasoid at the mixing board drives the house system at decibels appropriate for a large auditorium.  His first mistake is pushing bass levels hard enough to bruise internal organs.  Then to balance the lows, he cranks the mids and highs.  At those levels, any vocal microphone would feedback in such a small room.  His solution?  Turn down the vocal mics!  The result?  It is impossible to hear the music over the sound of your ear bones being ground into dust.  There are still occasionally audible vocal blips punctuated by piercing feedback squeals.  It's a real shame as I've seen some truly exceptional bands there and they get to sound like they don't know what they're doing.  Any monkey with a finger can push a slider and make it louder.  It doesn't make you look cool.  It doesn't increase the size of your genitals.  It won't win you friends.  It makes you an incompetent sound man and it drives away customers.  As a reward for enduring the whole night, my ears rang for days.Oh, and if you want to get something from the bar, be prepared to wait until the staff gets done flirting with each other and discussing  some guy's new hat, what Tiffany thinks of okra, whose turn it is to clean the ice bins next Wed and any other world shaking issues that supersede basic customer service.  Eventually you will get your drink, generously garnished with I-don't-give-a-4uck.  At the rate the bartenders serve drinks versus the rate your liver metabolizes alcohol, I don't believe it is within the realm of physiologically possibility to become intoxicated at this bar.By all rights, this should be the best bar in Tempe.  It's close to ASU, has easy access to the light rail, good food, cheap drinks, live music, excellent sound system, etc...  Even convenient porn next door if you're into that.  But the abusively loud music levels and contemptuous attitude of the staff make this a place that my friends and I will continue to avoid with gusto.  With more engaged management, this place could be as iconic as the old Long Wongs!Here is a copy of the email I sent the owner:Rob,I am taking a moment of my day to write to you to inform you of our experience last night in your bar which could be described as unethical and unimaginable.  We were in there until about 10:30 or 11:00pm last night and went home to get more money because I make it a practice not to bring my bank card to a bar.  We went home, had something to eat and walked back.  We live at the Tempe Travel Trailer Villa right down the street and have been coming to your establishment off and on since the end of last May which I am sure you could care less about.   There are reasons we are not more frequent which I may get to later.We came back in at 11:42pm (you can check your bar cameras) and we were asked by the bouncer if we were next door.  It was late, we had some drinks in your bar earlier ($30 worth to be exact and we tipped the bartender about $10, so we're not scum) and were taken by surprise by this question and I said "yes" not realizing that he had meant Modern World.  My partner had asked him "what do you mean next door?"  Even though TTTV is not exactly next door it is less than a block from your "bar" and could be considered "in the neighborhood".  We have patronized your bar to the tune of probably $500 regrettably since last May between us and friends that we had brought and while your bar could be considered a place to frequent on the way to something better we are close to it and don't have to drive.  After this question was asked and we had told him, after the confusion was eliminated, we went home and came back he had promptly said "We don't allow that."  I said you don't allow what? I can't go home and get more money and come back?  He said "NO, get out, we don't allow that.  You know what I am talking about?"  What is this guy talking about?  May I ask why patrons of Modern World are not allowed into your bar?  Let me remind you that you own or manage a bar which doesn't exactly attract Christian folks ready to preach the gospel.  You attract drunks, the homeless, broke college kids, and if your entertainment was any mark of what to expect it's no wonder why you're not busy.  Every time we have been in there it's been dead and we've been there ranging from happy hour to Friday and Saturday nights.  If someone is causing trouble in your bar, you boot them out.  The key word here is causing.  You don't assume that someone is going to start trouble ESPECIALLY when you don't know the facts and boot them out.  We were in there before and have been there before and to prove it, no one on your staff knows us by name which means we're not on their radar or they're not friendly and care not to know their customers. I was completely offended by that asshole assuming we came from Modern World which in my opinion is not a problem.  I didn't know you were in a position to be able to afford to kick folks out which happens every time we're in there.  At one time the bartender told  a guy last month he wasn't going to be served because he had already had some drinks.  She told him to come in sober and SHE would get him "fucked up" which to me means no difference.  If someone leaves your establishment and gets into trouble drunk it's not any different than someone coming in with some drinks under their belt and leaving.  People bar hop.  I have read reviews and have heard testimony from our neighbors at TTTV and they all say the same thing, you guys are quick to throw people out rather than accept the challenges that come with running a bar.  We are now going to Starters and they have better drink deals and food.I'm an average guy with no title but "customer" and I expect to be treated like one when entering an establishment.  I am 38 years old and have NEVER been kicked out of a bar because I know how to behave even intoxicated.  Legally?  You're drunk after one drink.  Are you going to boot everyone after one drink?  I later established that they were wanting to go home and were closing up shop.  I think they were worried that we would stay until 2am (which I believe is posted, could be wrong) and we had no intention of it, especially after that.  I did NOT tip the bartender after she served us last night (the last round, we tipped her before we left) as I felt that she could have told the guy to cool it off since she is the one in charge.  He was so rude and after we told him we went home to get more money and we had cash in hand, he looked at us and rolled his eyes in the manner that we were lying.  Bar closed at midnight.It would not let me cut the entire email because it was lengthy.  I don't expect to hear back.  I assume it's a prejudice bar and the staff really has a thing with who can come in and not.  They're never busy.  I wouldn't be so picky.The bar tender was rude and was refusing to serve people. Plenty of places with better ambiance and better service nearby.
Zoës Kitchen=@ZoesKitchen is a great addition to the Scottsdale Waterfront shopping area!  Now I can have a good meal over here for under $20/plate!  I had the Greek marinara chicken plate.  Marinated, grilled chicken breast on a bed of orzo with a nice marinara sauce.  A good portion of Greek salad on the side.I also tried my wife's spinach wraps - reminiscent of spanikopita.Service was outstanding.The atmosphere is casual and nice.Bigger and better than ever! Zoes sure is stepping up their game in their shiny new Waterfront location. I anticipated the opening of the new Zoes for weeks and jumped at the first chance I had to pay them a visit. Now that I am reporting on Zoes after my visit, I can say that I am a happy camper!First of all, I love the location because now that means I don't have to drive 15 minutes to get my Zoes fix. Second of all, they made sure to create plenty of seating here so I hope that means I will always have the luck I had upon my first visit every time and score a seat seamlessly. The atmosphere inside is very quirky and fun with bright colors and a quick take-out environment with the option to sit and enjoy lunch. Next I will dedicate an entire paragraph to the Coke machine. I might be in the dark ages but this is the first time I've seen a coke machine like this! Upon first glance it looks like it's retro and a copy of an old school machine, but then once you look closer, it looks like a space ship about ready to take you to a new universe of fountain drink mania. It has every option imaginable, including about 8 different Diet Coke flavors. Amazing! The food at Zoes is good and tastes healthy and fresh. It's a perfect fix for a light lunch where you don't walk away feeling too full and yet you're still satisfied. Some of my Zoes favorites include the wraps, Greek salad, Grilled Chicken pita and hummus. The pita bread that comes with the hummus is a little dry for me and would probably taste better if it came out hot. However, in general the food at Zoes is good and you get a decent amount of food for what you pay for, including a side option of fruit, salad, pasta (w/o mayo) and some other choices. They also have Mediterranean tuna which is mayo-free, tasty and easy on the waistline! So farewell Zoes until the very near future because I promise you, I will be a regular here. I even bought the reusable cup which offers me 99 cent refills upon my return!This new Zoes location has been open only a few weeks but it's already become a regular lunch destination in my rotation!I'm a huge fan of Zoes' Greek Salads, chicken salad, hummus, and fruit salad.  I love their large portions, casual atmosphere, and modest prices.  I also love their "dinners for four," which are perfect if you're bringing dinner over to someone's house, and they are always a hit!Todd, the manager of this location, is super nice, as is the rest of the staff... oh, and I know it's already been written about in some of the other reviews, but you have to order a drink and use the new Coke machine!  It's incredible how many options there are.  My latest fave drink concoction is my version of an Arnold Palmer: 1/2 unsweet tea, 1/4 raspberry lemonade, and 1/4 regular lemonade.  Delish!Don't forget to check-in on Yelp for 10% off your order!start your lunch/dinner with their yia yia's chocolate sheet cake--it is very good!i prefer their sandwiches and orzo salad!I like food that tastes fattier than it is. I find this at Zoes. I'm a huge fan of the spinach rolls with chicken and rumor has it (or a nutrition website claims) that they are lower in calories than you'd typically expect. Now by no means are these probably considered low-cal but I think (hope) they are lower in calories. And if not, I still love them so don't burst my wannabe healthy bubble! :) I also love, love, love their hummus which I know is not so low cal, but it's love and I can't say no to it.This past weekend, I squealed in delight to learn about the Simply 500 menu that Zoes recently launched. Well, they didn't actually launch it since the items have always been on their menu, but they've finally made it easy on on the calorie-conscious to figure out what to order while visiting. Sadly the hummus wasn't on the menu (probably because of the pita), but there are several delicious items, including the spinach roll-ups! I uploaded the menu and posted it to the Yelp listing. Take a look! Your waistline will thank you.Fresh, fast and affordable are two things that don't often intersect these days, but somehow Zoe's manages to bring it all together under one roof! We had pre-ordered our meals to ensure we had enough time to eat lunch and picked up our food at the counter. GREEK SALAD: A light and heart healthy alternative to my usual pizzas and heavy plate lunches. Big portion of greens so hopefully this will help to fill up the bigger sized bellies.HUMMUS : Beyond the salad I highly recommend getting the hummus with pita bread! The hummus has just the right level of lemon flavor which I often find lacking in other mediterranean joints. Bravo Zoe's!TOMATO SOUP: Whatever you do, DO NOT order the tomato soup. I could taste the straight from the can flavor and this was definitely the low-point of my meal.The decor at Zoe's is modern casual with open seating. Their soda machine from the future was very perplexing and I'm glad someone else was there to show me how to use it! Great fast casual concept and I do hope it comes to my hometown of Honolulu some day soon!(Photo machine from the future: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zo%C3%ABs-kitchen-scottsdale-2?select=wldK7GljQwSOopMmhad2_Q#wldK7GljQwSOopMmhad2_Q)31 Yelps Challenge: #19/31
BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse=Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #169 - #365We were with spending time with our family friends and decided to dine out. We decided on BJ's because my Mom was familiar with the BJ's in California and we always have a good experience. Through the huge swivel door, you're greeted into this urban style restaurant that you'll find any other BJ's franchise.The floorplan is almost the same as the one we return to in California but a little smaller. Food and service was ok and there was nothing to fault on. To sum it up, it was just average and nothing spectacular. If I were to come back, I would just hit the bar for some good craft beer and bar food.
Dragon Buffet=Fucking Gross. So I came here in 2006 and I really liked it back then it had more variety. I was very ardent to come back, knowing that this place was great. I asked, " can I go walk around to see what is available?" So I walk around and it looks clean as you can see I took some pictures.I then decided to stay. To my demise I regret. I went to get some food sat down and the first this that happend was there was a cock roach on my fucking table. I was so grossed out. At this point I then decided to leave, I picked up and asked for a refund.She was kind of hesitant to give it to me but I then explained that if I stayed I would around telling everybody about my experience. There aren't enough words to describe how disgusting this is. I wouldn't even give it 1 star.
Pho Saigon=I really like this place.  Prices are great, portions big.  I am more inclined to order rice dishes here, because they just come with so much.  Sliced pork rice dish comes with 3 shrimps (yes I pluralized it) this egg/pork cake cube which is delicious, a lot of rice, 2 eggs on top of the rice, and pickled veggies.  Meat is not fatty (which happens all too often at Vietnamese restaurants) what a great place.  I'm surprised at the number of reviews less than 4.  Yes, maybe you aren't being greeted by a hostess (or anyone at all) but the prices are so low, what do you expect.  LOL @ Misti's review on this place... "overfloweth"  That was funny.  And the rest of the review is in normal English.In every town I have ever lived in, there has always been a war going on between Pho restaurant owners.  When I lived in San Diego, some of the owners of Pho establishments figured out how to bypass the Yelp Filter by going WAY out of their way to take the proper steps. I mean, they would clear their cookies, register their accounts at the public library(for IP address reasons),  make tons of friends, invest their time into writing one detailed 4-star review per day for 30 days, and then when the filter believed that they were real people they would write a libelous review about their enemy.  These fraudulent reviews usually looked something like: "I got food poisoning here last night. The owner stole my credit card number and bought Burberry with it. The health inspector came in while I was eating and shut the place down. The cooks are Mexican! The owner isn't Vietnamese he is Filipino! There were cockroaches in my Pho, I ordered the rare steak pho without cockroaches but I got them anyway!  The srirachi sauce was actually aids blood.  I was molested by the owner when I went to the bathroom".  And when I lived in Los Angeles county, Pho restaurant workers used to vandalize competing restaurants, and they would always get into physical altercations in public when they would run into each other. There is a lot of politics and backstabbing in the Pho business. What many people don't know is that frequently one Pho restaurant will be started by a group of Vietnamese immigrants, then one member of the group will betray the others by breaking away and making his own restaurant. This is usually the root of the hostility. The moral of my story is that one of the main reasons all the Pho joints on Yelp average a 2 1/2 star rating is because of these "Pho Wars".  So don't go on Yelp to try and find a good Pho place. Just run around town and try various places. See which ones you like and decide for yourself. PHO SAIGON is one of the better Pho places I have been to in town. The broth is oily and clear. The steak is bloody and tender.  They pack your broth with sliced green onions. And the store has a good location.. it's located in the same center as Greenland and my personal favorite restaurant: Sushi on Rainbow!  The Pho at PHO SAIGON is actually really good. Pho is a simple dish to me, it doesn't have the complexities that Ramen has. I personally believe that Pho is Ramen's inbred twin brother.  PHO SAIGON does a great job at presenting a Pho which is quite typical of what you would find at popular douchebag hangouts such as Pho Kim Long and Pho So 1.  The reason I like PHO SAIGON better than Pho Kim Long and Pho So 1 is because you(the reader) sucks, and you eat there. I don't want to eat there and completely suck with you. No one wants to suck, right? So come to PHO SAIGON and be "cool" like me.I support all Asian-American businesses so this place gets 5-stars by default.In search of Banh Mi, Monkey scored two giant sandwiches in a hurry.  Cut both in half, Monkey got grub for next 3 days...  Very nice server, but even after asking me 3 times which sandwiches I wanted, "oh don't worry, already started making..."  Monkey still didn't get no Korean BBQ Beef!!!  GAH!  Monkey ordered:  #6 Combination $5.50 - great fresh bread, filled just right#8 Korean BBQ Beef  $5.99 - who knows?Monkey shall return, unless I find a better sandwich for less.
Arcadia Farms Cafe=It's no secret that I'm a huge fan of Arcadia Farms, and when I heard they were going to be opening a marketplace across the street, I was psyched.  Of course, this was many months ago... So when I woke up this morning to see an email in my inbox (thanks Lisa G) saying that they were now open for business, I was very excited and knew immediately where to go for lunch.  Needless to say, I made it a priority to get there asap (I didn't want to miss the opportunity to get the FTR).  While it's different than I expected, I was pleasantly surprised!  The menu is diverse and includes many of the AF signature items such as the Mushroom, Spinach & Goat Cheese Tart, the Strawberry Chicken Salad, and their extraordinary desserts.  In addition, they offer plenty of new options such as a Chopped Italian Salad, a Tuna Nicoise Salad, and a Roasted Artichoke & Ricotta Cheese sandwich.  There is a daily soup, and plenty of breakfast items (think everything from muesli to quiche, muffins, croissants, and granola parfaits).  Arcadia Farms' famous apricot iced tea is also on the menu, as well as a full coffee menu. I went with the  AF Breakfast Sandwich ($6.95).  It's an MJ English muffin, scrambled eggs, aged cheddar cheese, and your choice of ham or bacon.  They made it with egg whites for me, and it was delicious.  My dining companions had a sandwich and soup, respectively.  Everything is made to-go, but there is plenty of seating outside if you choose to dine there like we did today.  Marketplace offers a simpler fast/casual option for breakfast, lunch, or a comforting snack in Old Town... They use natural, organic, and local products, and it shows.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  I anticipate this being a welcome addition to my "rotation" of go-to spots in my 'hood.I'm so happy! After years of enjoying a sit-down experience at Arcadia Farms and months of anticipation for the marketplace doors to open, I can officially say that I am one very happy yelper! First of all, I want to wrap the Arcadia Farms Marketplace up and put it in my pocket; it's so cute inside and out! It's like a dream farmhouse and one I could be quite comfortable in for hours. Maybe it has something to do with the tasty sweets and treats staring me in the face too.The marketplace is stocked full of food for all and friendly staff serving it. I always loved visiting the Phoenix Art Museum Arcadia Farms because I'd have a great chat with Lisa G. So, needless to say how pleased I was when I walked into the Marketplace to see her behind the counter! We had a great chat and she told me all about the wonderful items they serve! They have everything from tea packets and flowers to scones, cookies, brownie pops and nutella. They also have their miniature cakes ready for purchase as well as their tasty iced tea and lemonade. The salads are pre-made every morning and waiting in the refrigerator to be eaten. They have tuna nicoise, turkey club, their famous strawberry chicken salad, a garden salad, pasta salad and chicken curry salad with raspberry sauce. They also have a detailed breakfast and sandwich menu that are made-to-order. Besides a couple classics, this menu is different and it's lower in price. The sandwiches range from roast beef and mozzarella and to pressed chicken. They have a lot of options on the menu. I also heard they are introducing a limited dinner menu. It's still not a "cheap" meal, but it's competitive to other lunch options out there at about $8-$9 for a sandwich and $8-$9 for a salad. So now that I've given a recap of what I saw at the marketplace, I will report on what I ate! It was tough...so tough to decide between a sandwich and salad. I wanted both! Then the more I looked at the chicken curry salad, the more appealing it looked, so I opted for that. Verdict? Very pleased!! The chicken curry has a sweetness to it and then the raspberry dressing is the perfect addition. Arcadia Farm's pesto shrimp salad is addicting and I think that this one might be up there with that level of addiction! It was the perfect size and filled me up without making me want to roll out of there. For my beverage, I went for the raspberry ice tea. And yes, today I decided my sweet tooth would win over my willpower, so I took a lemon cake muffin for the road. In summary, it was a very summeresque meal and very fulfilling! I sat outside at their tables in the front. I wish they had indoor seating but it seems like the indoor seating is only for the private event catering. But then again, this is a marketplace and the purpose is for people to get in and out. Speaking of the private catering room, it is absolutely adorable in there. Arcadia Farms is the perfect place for a bridal or baby shower or ladies lunch, but the restaurant itself can be a little cramped so it makes it hard. Therefore, this is a great alternative! If I ever need to plan a ladies-only party, hands-down this will be my first choice. In summary, I definitely see myself becoming a regular at the Arcadia Farm's Marketplace. I still love the sit-down Arcadia Farms, but when I don't have time to sit down and have a ladies lunch, I'm very happy that they've given me this alternative!!
Lawrence Restaurant=In my new-found whole-hearted embrace for brunch (after a period of thorough refusal to go out for food during brunch hours because I can be stubborn like that) I ventured to Lawrence with a group of 7 (not THE group of 7.... only in my Canadian dreams...). I was very very pleased. Been hearing the folklore about this place for a while and what they say is true! The things I adored:i) Tea cups! Really china cups!ii) Little donuts! Wee little donuts!iii) Pretty, smiley, and very friendly staff... at least our lovely waitress was.iv) The brunch itself. I had the scramble with creme fraiche on their rustic bread with a side of smoked salmon. I fell in love with those eggs. Ladies and gentlemen, this is how eggs should taste I tells ya... I tried to describe it here but I can't... you will have to try them yourself :)Location: On the main, corner Maguire. Street parking is available [metered] and the closest subway is likely Laurier. It'll be a 10-minute walk from there. The place: Not huge, but very cozy and bright. It kind of feels like walking into someone's loft apartment - if I lived close by, I'd probably want to hang out here all the time. The goods: I ordered the baked eggs with mushrooms and celeriac, along with a side of bacon. First of all, BACON. Crispy. Yum. Need more. Secondly, the celeriac/egg/mushroom combo was served piping hot with the egg yolks on top - so you get to mash that sh*t up all by yourself just like when you were five, all the while attempting not to drool in your plate. Personally, I loved this dish but be warned - it does fill you up. It was incredibly flavourful and the mushroom chunks were quite large. The home-made bread is to die for, especially with that melted butter. God help me. Side note: if you like your bacon crispy, let them know. Also, they make the bacon themselves, as well as their sausages. My two lady friends both ordered the English breakfast and I'm going to assume they enjoyed it because there was nothing left on their plates, when everything was said and done. I think I saw one of my friends licking her plate when she thought no one was looking. So busted. Service: Great! Our waitress was super friendly and patiently answered all of our questions (OK, she patiently answered one person's questions and that person wasn't me). Price point: I would say it's on par with most breakfast places. For the portion size and quality of the ingredients, I think you get your money's worth. Note: I don't think they take reservations for weekend brunch unless you're six or more. When you show up, they'll take your name and number, and call you when a table opens up. It's a very efficient system!
Taco Migo=This place will probably not make it for another year.tortillas and meats are of low-quality. we do not need another mediocore taco joint in this town. we've got filiberto's for thattwo words: overpriced meh...
Osteria 2350=Osteria 2350, how have you been hidden from me for so long?!Oh that's right, because you've sadly been hidden behind the empty store front of Right by Nature in the Strip.  But one title this place can hold is hidden gem...because it really is!  It's part restaurant part Italian deli with fresh meats, breads and desserts to pick up.  Me and a friend came in all business....which meant we were ready to eat!  And boy did we ever!  We enjoyed 3 full courses because everything sounded so incredible!August is the month to take advantage of any sort of tomato salad, so I enjoyed a tomato and moz salad with just the right amount of balsamic dressing.  It was FRESH FRESH FRESH!  But let me tell you the key to being good friends.  The key is to pick two main courses and split them.  The best of both worlds!  We choose the gnocchi and the Riccolina.  The Riccolina had this Fede pasta in it that I had never tried before.  It was really awesome!  I'm an al dente type of girl and these were cooked just right!  It also came with caramelized mushrooms, truffle oil, arugula and parm  The gnocchi was the real winner for me...it had a medium texture between a light and heavy gnocchi.  I'm usually a fan of the light kind but I think it was the combo of sauce and cheese that won me over on the whole dish.  It was perfecto!  We also enjoyed the Tiramisu for dessert.  It wasn't the best I've ever had (that's at Piccolo Forno in Lola) but it was still pretty good.  The service was fantastic as well, with our server answering all questions we had (like the very important, how big are your dishes) and she answered the questions perfectly.  I'm now a complete fan of this place and can add it to the top of my Strip District list.  You all for sure need to go there...I'm excited to try a dinner there soon....remember...true friendship means splitting two main dishes!
Yogis Grill Teriyaki & Roll=I am a Teriyaki chicken lover, so this is the spot to go to if your just simply craving some traditional teriyaki with rice bowl or plate. I almost always get the Teriyaki with the steamed Veggies and white rice!! We also truly enjoy their avocado rolls and California rolls, they are both much fuller and cleaner cut, then other places.**** Also the service was nice, overall it is good.
Subway=This location is awesome. I don't get the other negative reviews but I can honestly say I have never experienced any of that here. There has been a change in employees over time but that happens in a place like this. Too bad because the current girl working (name escapes me damn it) is effing awesome. When I walk in she greets me and asks if I am going to have a spicy italian or cold cut combo this time and it's cool she remembers. I like extra bell peppers and light lettuce on my sandwich which for some reason is hard to comprehend for some employees and other locations. This girl actually makes the sandwich how I ask for it and asks if it looks OK and if it needs more or less of anything. Sometimes this location gets super busy during lunch time and on weekends so they run out of certain types of bread at times but it is what it is. Solid location. A few times now I have been approached by people selling things or asking for donations. This isn't Subways fault. It's happening outside in the shopping center. The area is nice and newer and I hope they have security in the shopping center but if they do I haven't seen any. It would be nice if there were security making regular rounds to help with stuff.
Big Dawgs=***Chase Field's Big Dawgs sells decent though expensive foot-long hot dogs that are heavily topped and categorized by city or state (Chicago Dog, Wisconsin Dog, California Dog, Arizona Dog)***Chase Field's main concession stand is Double Headers, which is easy to find because of their many locations.  Double Headers features traditional ballpark food like hot dogs, popcorn and nachos.  Big Dawgs (which has only one location in Section 130) also serves traditional concessions like hot dogs, but they are done with a little more flair.Big Dawgs emphasizes "big" food items such as a variety of foot-long hot dogs to a very large $16 soft pretzel that comes with multiple dipping sauces.The foot-long hot dogs are named by city/state and they were offering 4 varieties on our visit (the dogs were displayed in a glass case with all their toppings).  There was the Arizona Dog, which featured melted cheese, sausage and red and black tortilla strips.  There was also a Chicago Dog, which seemed to the traditional Chicago ingredients like relish, tomato, etc.  They also had a Wisconsin Dog, which was topped with macaroni and cheese and bacon.There was even a California Dog on the menu.  If I asked Californians what they think would be in the California Dog, I imagine most would say avocado.  I don't think avocado was in it (unless the enthusiastic cashier did not explain it correctly). The California Dog was topped with melted cheese, onions, peppers, and steak (it really seemed to be a Philly Cheesesteak Dog so maybe the name was just incorrect).We went with the Arizona Dog and it was pretty good.  The bun was nice and soft while the hot dog had a good flavor.  Not too strong and not bland.  The toppings were just okay.  The tortilla strips were fine and provided a good crunch, but the cheese did not have much spice and the sausage was a little ordinary.The staff here was very enthusiastic and helpful.Pricing was high.  The foot-long dogs were elaborate creations, but they might not be worth the $9 price tag.Big Dawgs provides a different hot dog experience so it might be worth checking out if you come to this stadium and want to walk away with something a little more interesting than a regular hot dog, nachos or popcorn.
The BeerHive=How can you not be drawn in, just by the name alone!  Clever, fo sho!So once you're drawn in, what are you drawn to?  In keeping with the seasonal theme, I ordered the Southern Tier Pumpking Ale.  Delish, as always. They have about 12 or so beers on tap that's clearly written up on a big chalkboard above the bar.  I'm into bars that have a wide variety on tap.  I can't stand when you go somewhere and all they have is Miller and Coors Light.  But for a name like the BeerHive, they really should have more to offer!They also have a big refrigerator with a whole lotta specialty beers to pick from.  You can either pick up a beer and drink it there or take out for a "night cap" at home.  For "bar food" the food is pretty decent!  Sticking with the hive part of beer they have a lot of honey type concoctions.  We opted to try a couple wing flavors, as they all looked pretty yummy.  We tried the salt n' vinegar, honey bbq, ranch and buffalo.  I really enjoyed the salt n' vinegar, being a huge vinegar fan!  I also thought the honey bbq was pretty good.  We also ordered I REALLY enjoyed the honey bites, mini cinnamon pretzels with honey drizzled on top.  YUM-O! They have a lot of different specials, including $1 off beers and $3 apps.  The HH special for beers isn't too great, but I love a good deal on food too, so it balances out!  They also have a special armature comedy night.  I think that would be an interesting thing to see, laugh at them or laugh with them?  We'll see!
Wang's Delight=Ok, let's just get this out of the way: Wang's Delight ... The "Pervy 14-year-old boy" part of my personality is busting up laughing right now! *Responsible, functional adult part chimes in*"Sheesus, Meg, act your age already!"Anyway, the food here. Unimpressed! Especially since a few of my coworkers used to go here often, enjoyed it and highly recommended it. Found their menu in a drawer one night. I wasn't going to cook, Dude was working late, Chinese it is! *Ahem, swear I'm more domestic than takeout ...*Ordered the Mongolian Beef and Chicken Lo Mein. After tip I think this averaged out to be a little over $15. Both dishes were overly oily, mushy and lacking any kind of spice or character. Kind of like those microwaveable Tai Pei Asian food meals (or whatever the name is) I would scarf down in college. Not so sure I'm going to rush back and try them again.Sorry Wang's, I  just wasn't delighted with your cuisine.
Oregano's Pizza Bistro=Oh sweet Oregano's!!!! This is a place that my old co-workers and amigos gather to enjoy some Gibbilini Bellinis!!!! As well as their amazing pizza!! The patio is our favorite spot  for our retreats and we have also enjoyed the great treatment their staff has given us so far!! Great spot!!! Specifically this location!! Yay!!
Steenbock's On Orchard=I forgot who said a restaurant is only as good as its people. Perhaps nobody said that and I can claim it? Regardless, in Madison, Michael Pruett is the most unsung apron wearing, slicing, dicing, sauteing, dude in a kitchen, which makes it easy for me to say the following: Steenbock's is the most overlooked restaurant in the 608. Bold statement time: If you haven't eaten at Steenbock's you're missing out on what might be one of the strongest dining experiences you'll have in Madison. The interior is far warmer than another well known fine dining establishment in town, which sets the scene for an incredible culinary adventure. The service is spot on! SPOT FRIGGIN' ON. So much so that if a server misses a beat, a GM or AGM is quick to swap out a fork, refill a glass, or bring by a new napkin that's fallen on the floor. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not for all the pomp and circumstance. Just put good food in front of me and I'll be ok. BUT if you're going to build a reputation for solid service, deliver. And these guys do. (Something else I can't say about other fine dining experiences I've had in town). When it comes to the food. It's remarkable. Full of flavor, artfully plated and portioned in a way that you can easily savor every bite without feeling like you're over doing it. True that some entrees are pricey as compared to most places in town, but split some small plates with friends, or just simply make Steenbocks a once a quarter place as I've done and splurge after a few months of hard work. You owe it to yourself! My biggest grip about the place... nobody is ever there when I am. Why? If I'm being completely honest, it's in the worst location maybe second to Naples15 which is in a basement. Here's the deal, you can't really see it from the road, the parking situation is abysmal, and I fear that because it feels like a "destination" (even though if you read their website and map your trip it's actually easy) people just pass. DON'T PASS ON THESE GUYS! My fear is the time will come when it doesn't make sense to keep Steenbock's open and Michael will be flipping burgers and sending out cheese curds dressed up in panko or something stupid on the Capitol. Go.Eat.Tell others what you think.Go back with them. Eat again.
Asian Island=3.75 stars!  Just finished putting away leftovers from a take-out order I placed via phone six minutes before closing time.  Mom was hungry, so I asked, would you like some pizza or Chinese?  She said Chinese, and as I started to look for the Flo's menu I had in my purse, she mentioned the pamphlet we received in the mail from Asian Island.  While she pored over the menu, I checked for Yelp reviews and found only one of significance (by that, I mean those reviews written by elites-- real photos and names), that of Scott D.'s.  Mom gave up looking, disgusted at seeing the high prices.  "What do you mean the food's expensive?," I asked.  I looked at the menu, and I didn't see anything over-the-top ($9 chicken; $10 beef and pork; $11 shrimp), so I decided I'd go w/ Scott D.'s wife's selection of Shrimp Lo Mein for Mom, and the Twice-cooked Pork for me.  I'd requested that they omit carrots, celery, and, if any, corn and mushroom.  The woman on the phone repeated these veggies TWICE, so I gathered that she was taking careful notes...The food was very tasty!  Mom said the shrimp dish was "good!"  I asked "Good-good or good-because-you're-hungry-good?"  She said "good-good, but not 'out-of-body experience' good."  (To quote Scott D.)  LOL  My twice-cooked pork (bbq pork sauteed w/ CARROTS, bell pepper, water chestnuts, spring onions, CELERY, and onions, among other things, was also very tasty!  Mom liked the dish, as well, but, when asked, preferred the shrimp.  I had also requested a side of egg noodles (loved the bean sprouts!), instead of rice, and I really appreciated that they obliged!  Other restaurants would've forced me to take rice, which I cannot have, and then make me pay for a side order of noodles.  This alone deserved a star!  Easily 4, 4.5 stars, which isn't bad for my first take-out meal from here, and I'd have given 5 stars if my request for certain veggies to be omitted was followed.  I will return to try other items, and, hopefully, they'll be more mindful about my food allergy concerns!Lunch options look tantalizing, and sushi and Hawaiian dishes are also available!
Imadake=IRASSAIMASE!C'est ce que vous entendrez tout le personnel crier lorsque vous entrerez au pub japonais Imadake. Si vous n'êtes pas certain comment répondre un simple bonjour avec un hochement de tête et les mains en prière subtile suffira. Lorsqu'on vous assoit à votre table, ajouter un « arigato » qui veut simplement dire « merci ».Nous avons partagé du poulet karage qui est le meilleur que j'ai goûté de ma vie. Des bons gros morceaux de poulet juteux avec un peu d'herbes et épices pour donner une bonne saveur à ces petites bouchées. La mayo au wasabi sortait de l'ordinaire et a donné du piquant au karage. Une autre entrée partagé, ressemblait à une espèce d'omelette rectangulaire avec soit du porc, des anguilles ou de fromage à l'intérieur. C'est servi avec de la sauce soya un peu comme des sushi, mais c'est chaud.Pour le repas principal, on a pris des soupes ramen au soya avec porc et bœuf. Au début, c'était le meilleur bouillon au monde! Après quelques secondes à essayer de deviner l'ingrédient secret, on s'est dit que ça devait être du beurre. Environ 5 minutes plus tard, j'en avais assez de ma soupe et elle était devenue un peu trop lourde et grasse pour moi. J'en ai donc laissé la moitié, et même mon chum n'a pas terminé la sienne. Ça ne nous a pas empêché de partagé un gâteau au fromage et thé vert pour clôturer un bon repas très remplissant.Good food, great concept! Service needs to be a little more refined! I really liked the fact that there where other choices then sushi or fish and sea food! Since I can't eat any of it! So ya can't wait for my next visit!P.s. I'm intolerant to seafood &fish!
Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet=Rand H, and myself went here today for the grand opening lunch buffet . The food and lots of it was very good and the right temperature.Even the hard ice cream was not rock hard and easy to scoop. Most of the food here is the same as there other location.But they did not have the great cake you eat!! I had at Thomas and 75th ave.So  we have another great Chinese buffet in the valley to enjoy.updated 8-5-11I tried again, and it still has the stupid glitter, but I'll focus on the food....No good.  Average, if I'm generous.They put way too much food out at any given time for the amount of customers, meaning it sits around getting un-fresh waiting for you to come around.  As you poke and prod the item's unappetizing shiny (greasy) exterior, wondering if every goldamn thing in the building is cooked in a deep-fryer, you reluctantly find a less-grissly or fatty bit to relinquish to your plate.  By the time you get back to you horribly decorated table, the oiliness of each dish has congealed into a lukewarm film coating the thing.  Some people say bigger is not always better.I say Bigger is always not better.===========================================Sorry, but here's the thing:You can't put glitter designs on the table tops with a stencil and white glue, with tiny pieces of the metal chips flaking off from the pattern and migrating all over the entire surface of the table.  That isn't food-sanitary, in my opinion.
VBGB Beer Hall and Garden=Tucked away into this weird, completely out of the way, limited-access cop-road-block-breathilizer-worthy corner is a beer bar. It's a little metal and stone to be called a Biergarten, painted beech trees on black walls aside, especially since there's maybe two-three German ales on tap - but still, cool.Vegan's are going to have it a bit rough but there's plenty for the cheese loving set to scarf. Food prices are ridiculously low. And the pretzal....ah, the pretzal... is insane. Charred to black, sweet, yeasty, beer cheese skunky and mustardy. Fantastic with beer. Get it.Stay away from the latkes, meh, but the chips are good and crisp. And the burger, while veg and in no way healthy, was satisfying. Service was smiley and quick. There were many Affliction shirts stretched across many fake-tanned biceps on the night we went. Many crotch rockets parked in many annoying ways, all over the expansive lot. Both of those things scare me. Could've been Primus's fault, as they were playing next door. Fingers crossed.There isn't a TV in sight. I'm hoping this is deliberate, rather than "whoops, the semi stuffed with flatscreens hasn't made it to town yet".Prices are a bit high for CLT but not compared to surrounding establishments, so they'll do just fine at 6-7 average for a pint. There are many good brews to be had, but I wish for a few more exotics and high gravs. And surely, more German beers. C'mon now.I visited VBGB Beer Hall and Garden last Saturday night for a birthday party.  It's a great venue for large group gatherings.  The restaurant/bar is presumably modeled after German beer halls and gardens.Inside, there is a huge horseshoe-shaped bar with plenty of seating.  On the floor, there are several large picnic-style, communal tables (like a German beer garden would have).  Above, there are a handful of TV displays tuned to sports.Outside, there is big patio with more tables and many games.  Games include giant Jenga, giant Connect Four, giant chess, cornhole, and more.  Since it was cold outside, the patio was enclosed and heat lamps were brought out to provide a measure of warmth.Ample free parking is available in a paved parking lot directly outside the building.  I'm not sure when this place opened, but it feels relatively new.  A reservation was made for our party of 20+, so two tables were blocked off with signs for our group.You can get beer at the bar and there's a window by the kitchen where you can order food.  After placing your food order, you're given a number to place at your table and your food is brought out to you.  VBGB's food menu mainly consists of bar food such as fries, onion rings, wings, chicken tenders, and burgers.  I was told by the staff that their most popular items are their jumbo pretzels, bratwurst, and kabobs.  I like their affordable pricing -- not a single item over $10.I tried the following:Chicken bratwurst with spinach and feta ($6)Quinoa salad ($3) - black beans, corn, tomato, cilantro, lime vinaigrette, colored tortillasFried pickles ($3)Cinn-A-Yum pretzel ($5) - jumbo pretzel covered in cinnamon & sugar, w/ vanilla icing on the sideComplimentary sauerkraut and sauteed peppers and onions are available for any bratwurst or hot dog order upon request.  I had sauerkraut put on my chicken brat.  I also had it served in VBGB's housemade pretzel bun, so I ended up with a very unique brat.  It wasn't a pork brat and it wasn't served in a typical bun.It didn't take very long for the food to arrive from the kitchen.  The brat was freshly grilled and the bun was freshly toasted.  The brat was large, but I wouldn't consider it jumbo.  The meat was juicy and seasoned well.  I could taste the spinach and feta, but the flavors were subtle.  The sauerkraut wasn't bad.  As for the bun, it definitely tasted like and almost had the consistency of a pretzel.The quinoa salad was good.  It was served with a side of hard, colored tortillas.  I could have done without the tortillas and more quinoa.  The quinoa salad was healthy and refreshing.  It was served in a small paper tray.The fried pickles were served piping hot.  They came with a side of dipping sauce, which I didn't try.  The fried pickles were good enough on their own.  I recommend sharing this side as it's a bit greasy.The Cinn-A-Yum pretzel is the dessert spin on VBGB's jumbo pretzel.  The pretzel is indeed jumbo and they coat it in a thick layer of cinnamon and sugar.  It's expectedly sweet and you even have the option of having it coated with vanilla, chocolate, caramel, or raspberry icing.  I had the (vanilla) icing served on the side and used it as a dip.  Due to their sheer size, I recommend sharing these pretzels too.Jessica was our server and she seemed pretty cool.  Very friendly, as were many of the staff.Overall, I had a good time at VBGB.  It had a nice relaxed and casual atmosphere and proved to be a good meeting place for a big group of friends.Trivia: VBGB stands for Very Big German Beer.My favorite part about this place: it's the only spot at the NC Music Factory that I can count on being open every day. If you come here and can't find something you enjoy, well the problem is you my friend. VBGB has a more than impressive beer selection (including a ton of local brews), great bar food, killer patio, and #allthegames. It's the perfect spot to grab drinks and eats before or after a show at the Amphitheatre/Fillmore/FountainPlaza/Comedy Zone. Don't like beer? They have a full bar. Don't enjoy bar food? Get a salad. First time ordering food here? You have to go to the kitchen window. Don't go to the bar. Every time I'm here i see someone make that mistake. They now serve lunch on Fridays. I tend to order too much food here. I'm not sure why I feel like I need a pretzel, dog or brat of some sort, and wings.  The beer cheese is delicious.The patio is massive and loaded picnic tables. You can even reserve a table. It's tented during the cool months. There's a window to order drinks so you don't have to go inside. A ton of things to do- sand volleyball courts, cornhole, oversized games. I always want to play giant chess, but I have no idea how to play chess. Parking is free. Heads up, you may have to park pretty deep in the lot on concert nights. Also, expect an Uber surge if you try to leave when one of these events end. Plan accordingly.
Katana Sushi & Grill=#106After trying a few other spots in town with no luck, we ended up at Katana Sushi & Grill.  I am glad we did.  I love sushi and am always looking for great sushi and have no problem that our previous dinner plans fell through.We arrived at what appeared to be "closing time" but this did not seem to phase the manger/owner of the establishment, as he warmly greeted our party and welcomed us to his sushi house.We loved the atmosphere.  It was beautifully decorated, very authentic with lovely Japanese music playing softly in the background.  The place seemed spacious, even though it was small--great decorator to supply that open feeling while being in such a small space. The menu was what you would expect at a sushi place with all the usual staples.  There were a few "special" offerings wherein you could order a larger portion of items or add small sides to your sushi choices, which was nice.  We always like to color outside the lines ;)After ordering and then enjoying about 10 rolls, some sashimi and nigiri we were about full.  We were staying in a hotel in the area so I really did not want to take sushi to go, but my partner did...so, anyway... I really loved the staff, the service and the freshness of the sushi.  If I am ever in Arizona again I will definitely try Katana Sushi & Grill again.Stephani Smiles for Katana Sushi & Grill ;)
Stalzy's Deli=WHAT.THE.HELL?!People always tell me about places they think I should check out and if I'm being completely honest, that list is getting so long, it'll be months before I work my way though the awesomness from Sun Prairie to Verona... there are just so many out there. BUT I have a running list, so keep them coming folks. Now when two people in the same week rave about a fish fry at a sandwich shop... A SANDWICH SHOP... one has to wonder: How good can it be? It's good folks. It's really flippin' good. It's so good I'm willing to say it's the best fish fry I've had in Madison, and I'm a little afraid to get fish fry anywhere else now.Tonight it was baked or fried walleye, hand breaded with your choice of German style potato salad or potato pancakes, the creamiest coleslaw you'll ever eat, a selection of Stalzy's breads and baked beans if you want to add those for a buck. I debated it, but decided against it, and I'm glad I did because holy cow it's a ton of food. Half a pound of breaded fried delicious fishy goodness. I can't even describe to you how flavorful the breading is. I know a lot of people think Stalzy's isn't shy on the salt, and I'd say the same for the breading, but honestly, how much flavor does fried fish really have? I say salt that bad boy! At $16 it's steep compared to what you'll find at Avenue or Toby's. Two of my other favorites in town. But honestly, the amount of food, the quality of the fish, the flavor, did I mention the shear amount of food? If it's nearing Friday put this place on your list. So damn good.It took us many years before we encountered this little gem in Atwood neighborhood. I have little knowledge about Jewish deli so it took us a while to figure what to order. I really appreciate that the staff explained the menu to us with great patience. They make bread, corned beef, pastrami and sausages themselves and provide the meat to other restaurant in town. You can also purchase bread or meat to go. We had "Brooklyn Breakfast" (beef pastrami sandwich) and a Challah French Toast. Very delicious. Quite a refreshing taste from other more regular brunch places. The portion is a bit small, though. People in our group had Stalzy's bloody Mary. Pretty fancy. Apparently they are quite good that a friend of us ordered a second one. I hope to return sometime in the future to try out Saltzy's non-brunch food. Note: Cash only. Seat yourself before your order.Ignore everything I said in my earlier review and go get breakfast today!(Seriously!) The sandwich joint with Madison's best fish fry also serves incredible breakfast!And it really doesn't matter what you get... potato pancakes, Challah French toast, corned beef hash... it's all going to be good and it's all served ALL DAY!
NAGA - Thai Dining=It is with a heavy heart that I write this update, but when food poisoning occurs it is one strike you're out with me. Boyfriend and I ordered take out of drunken noodles with chicken and basil stir fry with chicken. The chicken tasted a bit off to me and luckily I didn't have much of an appetite that evening. Boyfriend unfortunately was not so lucky and ended up with food poisoning. He was up several hours later throwing up and doing everything you would associate with food poisoning. I felt a bit queasy with an upset stomach, but did not consume enough to really get sick. I threw out the leftovers as soon as I woke up, but the food had stunk up the entire fridge by then. I guess we will be defaulting to Penn's.This was actually not good at all, but Thai food is Thai food so I'm bumping it a star. I was really sick and wanted to eat some majorly spicy food to clear out my sinuses. I ordered my drunken noodles a 4 out of 4, and drove to pick it up. When I took a bite, it was probably a 0 spice level. It not only had no heat, it had no flavor really at all, plus the noodles were in these massive clumps. The portion was small, but it was only a $7 lunch special. Thai spice is always a gamble but I was seriously needing the spice this particular day and Naga couldn't deliver. I don't think I will waste my time trying it again.Mangoes are in season...right?!The moment they are, my boyfriend & I immediately think of Naga's mango & sticky rice dessert. If you haven't tried it, you aren't missing much. That's a lie, you'll be missing the focal point of this whole review! Don't read any more till you've tried it. Wait. Finish reading, then head over there. You need to know what to have before dessert.What have we tried? A little bit of everything...Salad RollsChicken SatayCrab Rangoons (fresh crab)Moo Ping w/ Sticky RiceTom Yum soupPapaya SaladCatfish DynamiteLemongrass ChickenPad ThaiEvil Jungle NoodlesThai Fried RiceYellow CurryBasil Stir-FryPra RamAnd of course... Mango & Sticky Rice for dessert. Yes, you say you've had it at many Thai restaurants. Naga does an AMAZING job, as they do with all their dishes. We've never sent anything back, their food presentation is gorgeous, and so tasty. A special note about their peanut sauce, try it. You won't regret it...Located in a strip mall off W Horizon Ridge Pkwy & W Horizon Dr close to the 95, there's lots of eateries close by. They offer lunch specials Tuesday-Saturday from $7.75, served with house salad and soup. You ever thought corn soup made at a Thai place would be delicious? It is, and I'm not even a soup person!We've eaten there numerous times (as you can tell by my long list of food I've tried) and called in phone orders to-go. The staff is VERY friendly! At one lunch w/ Terri R, they were willing to place an order to arrive promptly as she sat down, so we didn't have to waste her short lunch hour ordering and waiting.I have noticed is at times, the food does take a bit long to come out. Usually, I'd deduct a star for this, as I'm one to get very grouchy waiting for food when I'm hungry. However, the quality of food I taste and the good service otherwise makes me forgive the wait. Let's just say it's a 4.5 rounded up to 5 stars. I still always look forward to my next visit.P.S. Their spice level is 1-4, interestingly. I don't know why, and I always forget to ask. They're also very vegetarian-friendly!Uh.....one question.What the hell happened to Naga?It's been a late night work and personal wise for my family and I, and we had not come up with a dinner idea. Needless to say, at 845, I did not feel like starting to cook dinner.I looked on their website, and they stated that they do their last seating at 930. Perfect, we will arrive there before that.We walk in, and there are four other parties dining. It does take one girl a considerable amount of time to even notice us come through the door...which is pretty interesting to me, because when the door is opened, you hear all the traffic and noise from the yogurt place next door. We almost considered seating ourselves.The girl (that we have never seen before) hands us our menus and walks away. Doesn't offer us water.... silverware, or even a napkin. We are approached by a different girl (also one that we have never seen before) she takes our drink order. My guy ordered a beer, and I ordered a soda. She comes back with the soda (that's flat) and informs us that they are out of beer. We ask for water and extra ice. Only one water comes, so, I guess I'll just suck on these ice cubes.We order, and she asks how we want it "put in". I couldn't even understand her...she was mumbling something about food speed. My guy just said, what ever is quicker. We had asked for just one bowl of their chili sauce to go with their crunchies that they serve... I mean, the four little spaces on the combined plate is cute, but you can't accomplish scooping any up.Well, we wait over fifteen minutes for water, refills, and crunchies. No one comes by to check on us, they are in their own little world. The other party still dining actually had to walk up to their counter, with their glass, and physically ask for a refill..... I mean, seriously? My guy wanted to get up and walk out....why Pay to be ignored...? I convinced him to stay.Our food, appetizer, came out. But we still didn't have any silverware, or napkins. I guess my guy was supposed to eat his curry with his hands..We re ask for water, and our crunchies with sauce. We ask the original girl who seated us if we could have silverware and napkins. She said sure......she never brought us any.Our "waitress" did end up bringing us 2 forks, and 2 napkins. The paper ones, that is. I looked around and saw that other tables had black cloth napkins (used). So, we got one paper napkin for the two of us and our baby. Gee thanks, but I wipe my buns with more paper than this....(sorry if that's TMI).The food, was good. I've had better at Naga personally..... I've been able to clear my plate before...and this time I left about half. Something was missing. I was too tired and it was getting too late to even ask for a manager. Our daughter had been good the entire meal time, up until the check came. I just knew that it was in my family's best interest to fill out their little opinion card, and be on our way.The girl who sat us was bringing in their chalkboard sign when we were leaving.Did she say "goodbye" or "thanks" or even a "go to hell".... Nope, not a single word. This staff was so rude, clueless and they should be trained.
Mercurio's=I'm really leaning towards gelato over ice cream these days.  I just love the creamy consistency.  I also feel like that you don't have to receive a hearty helping (although I do love generous scoops!) to feel satisfied.  You really don't have to worry about not finding your fav flavor because they've got TONS of different flavors to choose from!  And it's not just vanilla and chocolate...it's creative combo's like caramel latte, dark chocolate cherry and coconut cream just to name a few.  I opted for the Amaretto because I can't seem to not choose it when it's available.  I just love that flavor....and it translated perfectly into gelato too!  The absolute only thing I could even complain about, and it's not really complaining, just something I thought was odd...was that they measure out your gelato and you pay by ounce.  I get it when you're getting self serve (like at yogurt places) but when you're not helping yourself, it's just weird.  I suppose if you came in and had only $3 dollars to your name and the total range up at $3.01 they could lop off a little. But I guess it could also work in your favor if you wanted more or less.  I'm pretty sure it's now gonna be my mission to try all the different types of flavors....because they all looked so gosh darn good!In every scoop of Mercurios Gelato there are over 13+ years of research, study, testing, obsession and love in their dozens of freshly made daily offerings.  Mrs. Mercurio and her husband took endless culinary workshops and university courses studying every aspect of ice cream and gelato production and you can experience the fruits of their labor in every taste.  They recently added pizza to their offerings.The Mercurio's son trained at an authentic Sicilian pizza shop and they had an italian pizza oven imported to give an authentic product.   While many rave about the pizza at piccolo forno in lawrenceville, I found Mercurios to be much more authentic (and delicious) compared to the pizza I had in Italy.  The pizza dough is paper thin and savory (almost like crepes) the toppings are all fresh, generously administered and the crust is perfectly crispy.The raw brick walls and black and white photos of italy complement the atmosphere and the staff were all extremely friendly and enthusiastic.  I'm not normally a huge Gelato or Pizza fan, but Mercurio's does not offer normal gelato or pizza.  They are the finest example of both I've tasted in Pittsburgh, I look forward to many more happy meals and desserts here, Mercurios has made me a believer!I tried Mercurio's gelato at the big Yelp Tech Shop event in 2013, and I was impressed.  Now that it's only a mile away, I think we're going to have a beautiful relationship.My dad loves gelato, and when I first tested this place out, I told him he had to try it.  Being the wonderful daughter I am, we hiked South Negley to get over to Walnut street.  The gelato is around $.71/ounce, and they have three different size cups.  The employees are really great about listening to how much you want too, which is nice.I love the mint chocolate chip, lime, and tiramisu!  All safe choices.  Make sure to sample flavors if you aren't sure what you want.The pizza is also delicious.  The white pizza ($11) is good, but the prosciutto pizza ($14) is my favorite.  These pizzas are personal sized, but I could split one with a friend and order gelato for a full meal.The only downside to this place is that the service is pretty eh at the tables.  Not bad but not good either.I tried Mercurio's gelato two years ago and, more recently, at the Yelp Burgh Bash this past Sept., and I finally had the chance to stop by for dinner last Sat.  Based on my experience with the gelato and what I'd heard from Yelp and elsewhere, I was eager to try Mercurio's savory offerings.My dining partner and I shared a house salad (insalata de la casa), as well as a prosciutto pizza.  (Thanks for the great recommendation, fellow Yelpers!)  The house salad consisted of spring greens, tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and parmesan dressed with balsamic vinaigrette dressing, and included two pieces of toasted Italian bread.  I found the salad to be quite fresh and flavorful, and large enough for two people to share comfortably.  In terms of flavor, I found the pizza to be quite solid, with the prosciutto being the standout, with just the right amount of smokiness and saltiness.  It also hid a few key shortcomings, such as a sparser-than-preferable amount of cheese, quite effectively.  If you've read my reviews of other pizza places around PGH, you'll know that the aspect of pizza that I tend to be persnickety about is the crispness of the crust. While the crust was light and airy, which was great, it unfortunately lacked the key crispness on the bottom that's essential to a perfect pizza, in my view.  Nevertheless, I was generally pretty satisfied with the quality of the pizza, esp. compared to other wood-fired pizza places around town.Needless to say, after finishing the savory portion of our meal, my dining partner and I had to order the gelato, since that's what Mercurio's is best known for.  I had a small, which I split between mint chocolate chunk (my favorite!) and triple chocolate, and my dining partner had a medium, split between chocolate and caramel.  The gelato was just as delectable as I remembered, with satisfying creaminess and flavors.While the ambiance was a bit minimalist, I didn't mind. My one complaint about the layout was that the dining area was quite small and could feel a bit cramped at times.  (At one point, we had to move our table over a bit so that our neighbors could squeeze through.)  I found the service to be a slower than I'd like, but this was probably due to there being only one waitress responsible for serving all of the dining tables.  Even one more waiter probably would have sped things up and reduced the stress on her significantly.  Overall, despite a couple of shortcomings, I had a pleasant experience dining at Mercurio's, and would definitely return.I first experienced Mercurio's at various yelp events and was always impressed by their gelato. Now that I work in Shadyside, I knew I had to stop by! I have been here about 3 times in the past month- yes I am a little obsessed.Let's start with dessert first... the gelato.. is amazing! It's some of the best I have ever had. After trying it the first time, I was head over heels in love. My parents and I were in Lawrenceville, craving ice cream on Mother's Day, and the one place that popped in my head was this place. We came and they LOVED it. I think the blueberry muffin is my favorite... it's incredible. I also really enjoyed the strawberry cheesecake. My parents couldn't stop raving about their choices as well.  My dad was impressed with the brick oven and went over to talk to the employees about it. They were super friendly to my dad and very welcoming. They recommended that he try the sausage pizza with extra sausage and extra cheese and my dad could not resist. Which leads me to......the food. Yummmm. The pizza that was recommended to my dad was incredible and he loved it. He could not stop raving about it and said that the leftovers were even better the next day. We recently just visited again and this time, I ordered my own pizza. I kept it simple, ordering the Bianca (white pizza with tomatoes and basil). It was awesome- light, with a perfect fluffy crust. The flavors were fresh and just delicious. My mom ordered the ensalata con portabella- wow... the portabellas were prepared perfectly! The dressing was light and full of flavor. My dad ordered the italiano panini, which was epic. Perfect amount of meat, bread, cheese and sauce... I was surprised with how much I loved it.This place is the whole package. Located right on Walnut Street, it's the perfect place for a date night or casual lunch. Service was great all three times I have visited as well. I can't wait to return.
East Side Pizza=If I could define my life in terms of food, it would be defined with "Cacio e Pepe." Minimalistic and open to interpretation.  Cacio e Pepe sounds easy enough to prepare. Black peper, Pecorino, parmesan, olive oil, butter, salt to taste and pasta. Once complete, this is a symphony of flavors that makes even an amateur chef look like Mozart.  From the look of East Side Pizza, you think "typical pizza joint." And for the majority, you are right. But when it comes to pasta, man, even Scarpetta can take lessons from this typical joint. $24 for spaghetti with tomato and basil by Scott Conant ?? How about $6 for Cacio e Pepe of equal calibre by mysterious chef at East Side Pizza. AND it comes with a house salad!! Or Tortellini with chicken cooked to perfection! Let's just say the pasta dishes are so good, I forgot this place serves pizza. I hope this is not a fluke but I will be dining here quite frequently for lunch and dinner.Great little place with inexpensive prices. They have quite a few lunch and dinner specials that were great prices. I ordered the two slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $5.99. Not bad for two very large slices of pizza and a refillable drink. The pizza is really good. Thin and simple. The slice kept well too. I only ate one for lunch and saved the other for later when I got home and it was still flavorful and tasty. Service was friendly and efficient. I was interested in some of their pastas. I will have to come by another time to check out their dinner specials or some of their lunch pasta specials.I have stopped in before for the lunch special with 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. That was good and the right price at just over $6 and change. This visit I phoned my order for pick up and wanted to try a sandwich and pizza with toppings. I ordered a "Bambino" which is their version on a meatball parm. It cost $8.99 and was terrible. The bread, sauce and cheese were good but the meatballs were very tough. I don't know if it was just an off day but I wouldn't ever order anything with meatballs here again. The sandwich did come with a side salad that I enjoyed. The pizza I ordered is called "The Fenway" and has sausage, green bell peppers and onions for toppings. The pizza was just so-so. The crust wasn't able to hold the toppings well. It was $21.99 for the large pizza. Almost $35 for a pizza and sandwich after tax is way too pricey when it doesn't even taste that great. I will stick to stopping by for the lunch special since that is a good deal and tasty. Service is good and the inside is clean. I noticed a sign that said they offer catering services. They also offer delivery.I went to this place on the recommendation of a friend. If you look at my reviews over the past, you'll see that no one enjoys a good pizza as much as myself. I found the place quite easily. It is in Boca Park along with a number of other restaurants. Parking was easy. When I went in, I was a little confused as I saw a sign that said "Order Here". So i did. They do have a dining area. I asked the girl working there if they had table service, and she told me that they did on Friday through Sunday... but if you sat at a table, they wouldn't leave you hanging. Well, I ordered right there! Needless to say, I had one of my favorite foods! PIZZA!! Now having worked my way through school working in a pizza place, I'd like to think that I'm a pretty good judge of pizza. I ordered a Pepperoni, Mushroom, Bacon, Kalamata Olive (Unusual but excellent ingredient!) and extra cheese. Now for most pizzas, this presents a problem. The problem is, too much oil, making the pizza soggy. The pizza was brought to the table, suggesting that they really will not leave you hanging! And it was prepared perfectly. The crust was solid!!! Thin crust, excellent flavor. The cheese actually tasted like mozzarella cheese, unlike some of the cheese you may get from a chain. I ordered a medium thinking it would be lots, and I might have a slice or two to take back to the hotel. (I was in Vegas on business). BUT NO... This pizza was huge for a medium. I stuffed myself on 4 slices and was only able to take 2 of the remaining 4 back with me! All of the ingredients were very tasty. It was possible to taste each one!! I watched the pizza chef as he made the pizza. I was impressed with the way he kept an eye on the oven, moving pizzas around the oven to attain the best overall consistency! And it was cooked perfectly. I talked to the girl before I left and I asked her about the ingredients they used... I can't help thinking that this has GOT to be one of the best NY Pizzas in Vegas! They actually bring their dough in from NY. (After all, how else do you get NY water into your mix?) I gave them a five! The ambience is okay. The people were great. The seating area is quite roomy... but the food was excellent! It's a bit of the drive from the strip, but well worth the trip!! I'll certainly be making it again. One of the better pizzas I have savored in my history of pizza consumption!!Had a large group of 40 kids and adults in town for a soccer tournament. Made a reservation in advance and communicated with Candace prior to our arrival. We ordered everything from pizza to salads to many different pasta entrees. Everyone was satisfied and enjoyed the food. Service was excellent. They had all the food  served within about 15 minutes of our arrival. They even, at my odd request, went and bought a full sheet cake to celebrate a few birthdays we had.  Everything was just perfect.After a very long day and not wanting to cook dinner, I walked right over here after my sons hair cut. If you show them your receipt from Sports Cuts, you get 10% off your order.I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and it was delicious. The pizza itself was bigger than the normal chain pizzas and smelled very wonderful. It was nothing but cheesy goodness drizzled in sauce. I couldn't wait to get home and dig in. It was calling my name the entire drive home. Now, I have a dog at home. She knows to stay away from the table when we're eating but was hovering over us the entire time at dinner, then she finally jumped up and snatched the pizza right out of my hand. I guess she wanted some of the deliciousness too. We didn't have any leftovers after we were done since my boys loved it that much. We will definitely be back.
Humble Pie=On January 4, twenty of my friends and I had a dinner at Humble Pie on 7th Street.Two days before the date, I spoke to someone who took my original reservation for 15 w/o any problems. I also informed her that we will want separate checksI'm sure, to which she said that it wouldn't be a problem. On 1/4 around 2 p.m.., I called again to confirm the reservation at 5 p.m. and also informed the guy on the other line that the reservation will now be for 20 not 15. He said it wouldn't be a problem, but noticed that the note on the reservation said "separate checks." He then said that Humble Pie CANNOT do separate checks for groups of 8+ because that's their policy. I wish that I was given the correct information when I first called because that would've changed my decision to have the dinner there. Some of my guests were just going to stop by and not stay long for dinner. At that point, it was too late to find a place and inform all 20 guests of the change, so I stuck with it. But for the record, I was already annoyed that a staff member did not know an important restaurant policy that should've been ingrained from the firstday of training. The reasoning I was given for the "one check policy" was: "You only have one server for the evening...". That sounded like a recipe for poor customer service.Well, that's pretty much what we got that evening.1. As a guest was finishing up his Kiltlifter, he noticed that there was a piece of "ice" at the bottom of the glass, which he thought was odd for beer. As he got the piece of "ice" in his mouth, he realized it was a piece of broken glass. Luckily, my guest is so even-keeled that when he informed our waitress that evening of the broken glass, he didn't make a big fuss and just told the waitress to inform the bartender in case there are other shards lying around. She said that earlier in the day, a glass or two did break/shatter and the piece was probably one of the remnants. My other friend then got worried and checked her Kiltlifter from the bottom and noticed that the bottom of her pint glass was cracked. The incident was clearly NOT the waitresses' fault and she quickly told us that both beers will not be charged. My guests were grateful and they each received another pint of Kiltlifter. Luckily, my guest didn't order a diet Coke first, which is his usual, because if he had, he wouldn't have even seen that piece of glass coming, and probably sucked on it like ice. But he didn't make a fuss because well, sh*t happens.2. Then the SAME guest ordered his burger with no cheese because of dairy allergies. Everyone ordered pizza or wings. People got their food served, but an HOUR AND A HALF after he placed his order, he still hadn't gotten his burger. Again, the waitress was apologetic but at that point he didn't want the burger. You would think that they'd give him extra attention after the glass incident, but no. He didn't say anything because that isn't his personality and he knew that I would be upset. And since it was my birthday dinner he didn't make a fuss to ruin the evening. Some of my guests asked for water and that was a little difficult to get, too. 3. After all this inconvenience, we were hoping that they could honor our request for separate checks. But there were inconsistencies--some were granted that request and then some were not. Frustrating! To be honest, she was good for the most part doing her job solo. She probably would've gotten a 20+% gratuity anyway from each of the guestNow imagine this concept, if there were maybe  2 servers or maybe 1 1/2 servers for our party, the poor service wouldn't have happened. One of them would've noticed that while everyone else was eating, one guest wasn't. Our waitress was not only waiting on our tables but other tables as well.Humble Pie, look at it from our perspective: my guest, who sucked on a piece of broken glass and was not served his burger (but instead a consolation pepperoni pizza, which, according to the waitress, was ordered but she can't figure out who ordered it, but it didn't matter anyway because my guest is allergic to dairy) was forced to pay part of the gratuity that was included in the bill. For bad service.And we're not faulting the waitress, who was working her a** off that evening, we fault poor management. I think you've done her a disservice because she seems awesome, but physically, you can only do so much. I've supported this establishment when it was The Living Room and I wanted to support  Humble Pie because I support local. Sometimes good food is not enough.  Anyone can get "good food" anywhere and they are plentiful out there, but selling an experience is an art. I'm not complaining because I'm asking for compensation or a freebie. But I am asking you to consider how you manage the restaurant.Good Pizza and great service!!The date dinner for two special is great for its value, available on Thursdays after 6:00 pm!!! It included an entree, two salads and one pizza of your choice!!! Enough food for two!!! :) The garlic french fries were bomb!!!! Deliciously seasoned. As for our friend, the birthday boy, he had pepperoni pizza and that by itself was great, better than our BBQ Chicken pizza I would say!! Fun place, great service, AWESOME YOUNG MAN SERVING!!! :) We came here with a group of 12 and were seated urgently and smoothly!! :) Oh and the Pomegranate Martini was Oh soo Great!!! A must try, a bit strong, but that's how I like them!! :)Everyone in this town, including me has become a self proclaimed  pizza critic.  Humble Pie, Pizza Bianco, Cibo, and the Parlor are eveolving Phoenix into a serious Pizza city.  Those who enjoy brick oven pizza this is a must.  And those who just eat delivery pizza must come to grips that Pizza Hut's HQ is not in Italy.  Food:The heart of the house is right in the dinning area, a wood fire brick oven. And ladies, were talking real wood here.   They make the pizzas right in front of you, how fun see.Quick note, they do a great job with non pizza items, and a fun kids menu. Service:this is a pizza joint right,  rule number one for amateurs, don't get antsy pansy because things take time on the weekends, this place gets crowded. Why well probably because Humble Pie has created a popular brand.   I like personal service, most the time your server takes care of you from start to finish and i like that.  I think restaurants like Humble Pie have given new life to the 7th St. Phoenix restaurant district.  Im glad to see the 85006 zip code continuously attracting more restaurant owners.  The Phoenix area is building up and keeping growing businesses a shot at success.  Happy Pizza,Kevin U.The good: Amazing daily happy hours with pepperoni (or cheeese) pizzas for $7, and quite a few appetizers for even less. Beers like Four Peaks Raj run for $3, with some cocktails for $5. Seating is stylish and comfortable, and service is good.The bad: The fries looked good on paper, looked good in person, but were way too salty. The equally salty aioli didn't help. The pizza was alright...I'm a huge fan of the sauce they use, and the cheese was totally legit. The crust left much to be desired...it was a bit too thick and crunchy toward the edges...not the texture you want from a wood-fired pie. The ugly: During normal hours, they charge as much for their specialty pizzas ($15) as some of the valley's most coveted pizza parlors, but are clearly not in the same league. This is a strip mall chain that wants to compete your favorite gourmet/Neapolitan locale, but at least needs better dough to come close. It's great for a quick lunch, or some day drinking with your pals, but if you want a sit down pizza place for dinner, you can do better. Much better.
Taquitos Jalisco=Some of the BEST Mexican Food in the Valley and close to work. Reminds me of what I get when I am in San Diego. Been eating here at least twice a week for the last year and it is always tasty. They have take out, drive through, indoor and outdoor seating if you want. Always very clean inside and out. Family owned and run. They take great pride in delivering fantastic fresh favors with large portions for an affordable price. They have several combo plates with rice and beans on the menu or you can just order a la cart which I prefer. Tacos, Burritos, Tortas, Cheese Crisp, Nachos, Fish and Shrimp dishes, Authentic Soups, Soda Pops, and Deserts. Too many items to list them all here. Some of my favorites would be the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, chile rellenos, carnitas, carne asada, fajitas, al pastor, breakfast burritos of all sorts. They are very friendly and will make what ever you want pretty much. Great Salsa Bar also with fresh hot carrots and jalapenos, cucumbers, limes / lemons, and 4 different salsas. Simplemente fantástico!Taquitos Jalisco serves up Mexican street food common to the state of Jalisco.  You might be more familiar with the state capital city, Guadalajara.  This particular restaurant has a "sister" property on Gilbert Road that I've heard has better tasting food than this location.  Hmmm... I may have to find out!  as this was very good Mexican street food!  There's a bandwagon forming for Taquitos Jalisco and it's making stops in Mesa!Let me jump on the bandwagon for a ride too!  I missed the Yelper Lunch UYE here in April, but I scheduled my lunch group to go here this month.  I'd heard from Robyn N and Rand H that the place was small, but had no idea that by small they meant TINY!  The international lunch group that I organize was about 14 deep for lunch!  We were smart enough to arrive early.  Every table was taken once we got in the door.  Thankfully, it was not terribly hot outside and the tables outside were still open.  We gladly occupied those tables under the shade with the roar of the traffic on Broadway whizzing by.I sat next to my buddy Dawn K and we split our food!  I ordered 3 carne asada Tacos and 2 Tamales.  I will say that I was disappointed with the Tacos.  The carne asada was a little dry for me.  But still tasty enough to enjoy.  The tamales were fantastic!  I split one of my tamales with the entire group so that everyone could get a taste.  But I saved the other for myself for lunch the next day!  Dawn K ordered a platter with 3 things on it.  Enchilada, Taco and a Chile Relleno.  I tried some of her Chile Relleno!  The chile relleno was extremely good.  It was my favorite thing that I tasted.  I did not try it, but one lunch'er raved about the fish tacos and Robyn N also said their fish tacos were very good.  A slip of the brain as I would have ordered that instead of the carne asada taco.Everyone in the group was happy, even the vegetarian lunch'er was happy with his veggie burrito!  Score!  This place is worth stopping in and trying.   Remember, this is definitely a DIVE!  The parking lot is also very small.  It is on the north side of the street.  Pay attention.  The building is so small, you will likely drive past it and miss the turn.Fellow Yelpers - Thank You!I followed your recommendations and stopped here to eat.  It was good!We ordered 1 quesadilla. #3 (3 red enchiladas) and #17 (red enchilada, chili Relleno and taco).  All were good.Rice and beans... Also good.I recommend eating here!Hoooooooo shitttttt.This place. Lemme tell you a bit about this place. You walk in. At first you think that you look like you don't belong here. But you do. 'Cause this place sells love. And I don't mean sex. I mean taco love. Taco love is a sacred kind of love. If you don't know about taco love, take a knee; I'm gonna tell you allllll about it. You start off with the carnitas. The deliciously grilled, perfectly seasoned, slightly smokey goodness of pork that just wants to be wrapped up in a tortilla and put in your mouth. While you're at it, throw in some camarones (that's shrimp for all you non-españoles). They have the tastiest saucy glaze of goodness all up in there. Cooked just right. If it were pasta, I'd have to say al dente. Then check out a little grilled steak or maybe a little al pastor. Throw a cucumber on your grilled steak if you're into that kinda thing... This is taco lovin'; everyone is different... Go ahead, get a little freaky with it. Oh and did I mention that they give you sweet, caramelized, big ole onions to do whatever with? I didn't. But now I just did. I say put them on your carne asada taco, but hey that is just the way I like to experience some down south taco love. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say these are better than the street tacos in Rocky Point. Yes. I said it. The horchata is choice. Primo. ¡Excellente!They have menudo and other stews that are served all day.They grill the meat out back.The salsa bar is fresh. The girls at the counter like to dance and have a good time, of course after they give you great service and what not. I could scrounge enough change (~$1.30) (!!!!!!!) to buy a taco in about two min outside of safeway - not my thing, but it could be! Huevos rancheros served all day too. Imagine that. Breakfast whenever. The cherry on top: you get the nice mexican jazz party music playing in the background too. None of that mexican country crap. The real stuff. The jams.And that there is taco love. You finish up and leave. With a belly full of love. You should go here. Get some taco lovin'. Write a little yelp review about it and let the world know how good you feel.  This is the kinda love that people go to war for.Oh and those spicy carrots from the salsa bar were not very flavorful. I dunno what it was, but they were missing something major. Ok, now I'm done. See ya!Simply Great! Diverse menu. Salsa bar. Seating indoors and out. Gum ball machines. Friendly staff. Low prices. Quick. Tasty food. Kids meals. Everything you could possibly need, assuming you don't need white table cloths.Taquitos Jalisco does look a bit sketchy from the outside, but the interior is actually quite nice. Come on in! The restroom could use a remodel, but that's my only criticism. No big thing. They do charge 50 cents for the use of credit and debit cards, but that's a small price to pay for keeping the menu prices so low.A "go to" Mexican spot if you're in the area of Broadway & Alma School or Extension.
Frenchys Caribbean Dogs=O Frenchy's; Love that spicy sauce!At the behest of a trusted source of hot dog deliciousness, I was convinced to give Frenchy's a shot at the title of 'worlds best dog'.I really enjoyed the spicy sauce that makes his Caribbean Dogs worthy of competition for a top billed dog. Frenchy is a great guy and was a pleasure to chat with, he'll brighten up your day with just a few short minutes at his cart! If you're bold and don't mind a kick to your taste buds every once in a while, tell him you want it spicy and he'll kick it up with that awesomely hot, peppery concoction.While I can't say I loved this hot dog, it definitely is one of my top picks, just behind number one. Over all, my lunch was spicilly delicious and I ended up with the hiccups to prove it.That caribbean sauce, IMO, is good enough to bottle and sell - I'd definitely buy a bottle or two. Lunch behind the AZ republic building on 2nd street and taylor is all the better because of Frenchy and his fine caribbean flavors.Happy Yelping Phoenix!
Black Bean Cuban Cuisine=I came by for lunch with a guest speaker yesterday.  Upon being seated, we were given some menus predominantly in Chinese, with English glosses.  My guest asked if there was a lunch menu, and our waitress explained that usually, there is, but because it was a holiday, they weren't offering it.  We weren't thrilled about this, but okay, fine.  I asked for the Cuban menu, and the waitress handed me a menu still predominantly Chinese, but with an insert containing Cuban fare.I ordered the cuban sandwich, and my guest ordered the lamb hot pot.  The dishes came out about 10 min. after ordering them, which seemed about right.  Since I've never had a Cuban sandwich before, I have to offer the disclaimer that I don't have a standard of judgment.  Having said that, I found it quite pleasant in flavor, texture, and crispness, and a decent portion for $6.99 (this seems to be about the going rate for sandwiches these days).  Given the dearth of Cuban restaurants in PGH, if you have a craving for this type of cuisine and live in Oakland, this is one of the few convenient places you can satisfy it.  (The only other one I know of is in Lawrenceville.)  I can't comment on the quality of my guest's hot pot, since it's rather impolite to ask to share at professional lunches.  He commented that it was kind of salty, and that the lamb tasted like beef, but that it was otherwise pretty decent.Based on the decor, menus, and ethnicity of the employees, this seems to be predominantly a Chinese restaurant, and that the Cuban portion seems to be somewhat of a side business.  In the hour or so that my guest and I spent here having lunch, all of the other customers I saw were East Asian.  Given that there are several other Asian restaurants on Oakland St. north of Forbes, I take this as a sign that the Chinese cuisine here is fairly genuine, and it certainly seemed so from my guest's meal.  I'll have to return at some point to try the Chinese cuisine served here--when I do, I'll write a review under the Chinese name of this restaurant (Hunan Bar).Other than the primary focus on Chinese food, my other major criticism concerns the service.  Especially towards the end of the meal, my guest and I had trouble attracting our waitress's attention to get the check and pay.  Indeed, once we'd paid, my guest opted to just leave the check on the table, rather than wait for the waitress to pick it up.  Even before that, however, our waitress wasn't very helpful or sociable.  If the service improved, this rating would be a solid 3.5, if not a 4, but as it were, I'm going with an even 3 stars.EDIT: My labmate claims that this place used to be a Cuban restaurant before the current owners took it over, hence the Chinese/Cuban combination.
The Italian Pie=I gotta admit...I had mediocre expectations for Italian Pie...but they were completely put to rest after last night's meal! Hooray for good 'za. Give me a thin, crispy, garlic dusted crust and a tasty pie and I'm hooked. We met some friends here early on a Monday evening and not only had some great food, but really solid and friendly service too. The beer and wine list is decent - although I be they could add a few more local beers on tap in time. The interior hasn't changed too much since Sole - similar layout, yet cozy. Here are a few things I snacked on last night with a table of friends...Fried cheese sticks: 2/5: A bit unremarkable overall. The cheese was *fine* and marinara dipping sauce had a nice flavor to it but it was very thin. And two out the six cheese sticks were without cheese. Yep, just fried fakers. Garlic cheese bread: 5/5: Um, hello lover. This little app came out as a tiny cheese pizza pie drizzled with (what I assume to be) garlic oil. It was hot and cheesy and garlicky and damn delicious. Margherita pizza: 4.5/5: Our server recommended this pie and I ordered it with trepidation...I say it that way because margherita pies tend to be pretty bland. But oh no, not this pie. It was packed full of flavor - plenty of pepper, garlic, two types of cheese, fresh tomato and that really perfect crust. My only tiny ish? It was fairly greasy underneath - but no worries, I'll blot that right off. Go go flavor explosion. Get ye some pizza and try out Italian Pie...delizioso!
Chicken D'Lish=Yes, upgraded to Five Stars because I went in yesterday for lunch and ordered a wrap with a side of hummus. They came out to check on me.  They meaning the cashier, the cook and the owner and when I said I try to stick to low carb they brought out carrots for my hummus! How tight is this? Insane. Yes, I fell deeper in love with you yesterday D'Lish and sent three people there last night for dinner. Until we meet again....xo
Taste of Italy Pizza=I expected to find great pizza when we visited New York, but Arizona? Ironically, we had better pizza in Arizona than in New York, thanks in large part to Taste of Italy Numero Dos. Our friends live two blocks away and are enthusiastic about this place. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?userid=fDny65qdxn3EJH0PZbCxIwWe got takeout:* Half Caprese Pizza (Fresh Homemade Mozarella, Tomato Sauce, Fresh Garlic, Fresh Basil, Pecorino Romano & Freshly Sliced Tomatoes) - I didin't see tomatoes, but I didn't hold it against them. I think we may have gotten the Margherita instead. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=k6KdshrFJ1aX3_c36fHtpw* Half Cheese Pizza* Meat Lovers (Pepperoni, Meatball, Sausage, Ham, Bacon, Extra Cheese) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=ZS6DxijAx51SqPI-4ZY7qg* Salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=-zSvKvsXY6-Ih7KYhuGDNwThe fresh homemade mozzarella on the caprese (or margherita) was fantastic. That, the tangy sauce, and the fresh basil elevated the pizza to the elusive 5 star status. The crust was a little chewier than I prefer, but this is truly one of the best pizzas I've had (and yes, I've been to Italy).The cheese pizza was delicious and well-balanced, adult and kid-friendly. Mr. L and our friends enjoyed the meat lovers special. The meat toppings were very generous. Our salad was fresh and tasty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=JLSU9y1uIHG-2QHJp-SbOQThis is a family-run business and our friends say the chefs are from Italy. I didn't confirm if they are from Italy, but the pizza sure tastes the way I think it should. On our next visit to Goodyear, I will be happy to return.
Pamela's Upstreet Diner=What a disappointment.  Pittsburgh, explain your obsession with Pamela's to me now.  It makes no sense.  Pamela's is decent, though slightly pricey, for just diner food.You know how you can tell a place isn't worth your time?  When you and your friend are eating at Pamela's and can only discuss how good Murray Ave Grille's breakfast is.  Finally, you both admit you would rather be at the Grille.Lets start with the big issue:  The service SUCKS.  Apparently, the servers split their tips at the end of the shift.  So no one bothers to serve you.  One guy took our orders and brought drinks, and another girl dropped the food on the table.  No one asked if we needed anything, and no one bothered to check that the food was OK.  So...servers working a buffet do more work than the servers at Pamela's.I got the ham and cheese omelette, with the potatoes, and rye toast.  The actual breakfast was good diner breakfast.  There was a nice amount of cheese, this potato hater thought the potatoes were good, and the rye toast was fantastic.There is outdoor and indoor seating, which is nice.  The place is rather packed, though.Cash only.
Teriyaki Madness=Let's start with my first impression...this is one clean TMAD.  Probably the cleanest one that I've been to so far.  Now about their service.  Pretty good service too, not complaining at all.  Plus, I came in close to closing time.  Usually this is when you feel that you aren't welcome.  Not here, they still served with a smile. I only had their chicken breast and that's it.  No veggies, no rice, and no sides.  Just your simple plain 8 oz of white chicken breast.  Hit the spot, plain so wasn't as tasty, and needed something that will hold me for at least the next 3 hours. My meal with a drink was less than $8. I sometimes go Teriyaki Boy.  Usually when I have this exact meal, they automatically know to put my sauce on the side.  I got use to this and forgot to tell them here.  My chicken breast was drenched in Teriyaki sauce when I got it.  Really my fault and I will be sure to put in this request on my next visit to TMAD to put the sauce on the side.  Overall, my experience is pretty good.  In regards to the rest of their menu, there's a wide selection all centered around chicken (i.e. Katsu, T-Bowls, Dark Meat, White Meat, etc).  Their meals are tasty and in my opinion have the best Teriyaki sauce.I feel that a review update is needed on this specific Teriyaki Madness. I was recently here and had good food with bad service. I waited a long time for my food and dropped my rating to a 3 because of this.  Since that review, I've been contacted multiple times from the owner of Teriyaki Madness, Dean.  We spent a good 20 minutes talking about the business, but most importantly, what T-MAD was going to do to fix some of the issues.  Let me stress that the owner never asked me to change my review, was never defensive, and never attempted to bribe me.  This is all a good sign from a owner that cares about his customers.  Dean basically explained the cooking process to me, why the katsu taste the way it taste, and why my meal took longer than most.I actually learned some things from our conversation.  1.  The Katsu here is made out of real chicken breast, not minced pieces of chicken.  Because they're using chicken breast, the batter that's found at Hawaiian restaurants will not stick.  So, T-MAD uses one that's healtier and can stick to chicken breast. In other words, they didn't want to sacrifice health over taste.  2.  I usually order chicken breast with no sauce.  I had no idea that my order would take longer than everyone else because their chicken is marinated. When I order, they assume I didn't want marinade.  So, they would cook a new batch without marinade just for me.  Thus, why my meal took longer than everyone. 3.  I commented that the other T-MAD's tasted better.  He explained some of the possible reasons with one being the new equipment at this location. 4.  I learned that all gym-goers get a discount here.  I never seen this advertised and the employees never mentioned it.  Dean mentioned it though and I will make sure that I'm getting that discount moving forward.Dean felt that my review was fair and deserving.  He reviewed video of my last visit, addressed the issues with his employees, and even apologized for my recent experience. Bottom line, he recognized me as a regular at most of his locations and wanted to know to know that he valued my opinion about his business. Great job Teriyaki Madness!  You just brought a fan back.
Tacos Sahuaro=Bienvenidos a Tacos Sahuaro - enjoy authentic Mexican street tacos without leaving Phoenix!The restaurant is nothing fancy, but it has plenty of seating inside and most importantly serves up delicious tacos for only $2 each. The tacos are made with with two freshly cooked tortillas, your choice of meat, chopped onions and cilantro. The tacos are also served with a selection of fresh veggies to cleanse the palate - sliced cucumber, picked carrots, onions, and jalapeños if you want to kick it up a notch. The green chile and red salsa were good, but not the best I've ever had. At the suggestion of other Yelpers, I tried the Al Pastor, Carne Asada, and the Carnitas Tacos. The three tacos were quite filling because they come double wrapped in two tortillas. The Carne Asada Taco didn't have a lot of flavor on its own - probably would've been good with some fresh guacamole - but the Al Pastor Taco was delicious! Also, if you order a Coca Cola be prepared for "un medio litro - that's half a liter! They didn't have Horchata when we visited, but they have a wide selection of Jarritos drinks (mango, tamarindo, lime).If you like street tacos, these are some of the best in town.  This is a hole in the wall taco joint with a limited menu with a major emphasize on the street taco.  I recommend the asada and al pastor tacos, they are both very flavorful.  I ordered 3 tacos at $2.00 ea. and was completely filled up.  Give them a try if you are in the area (Thomas / 32nd St.)
Gus's New York Pizza & Bar=Flies everywhere up front. Seriously, at the bar, there must have been 20-30 buzzing around. Put up some damned flypaper, or get an air screen. Something.Horrible waitress. She poured my beer till it overflowed, then just let the foam settle, then handed it to me, without topping it off, or wiping the glass.We moved to a table, because we didn't want the flies to get in the wings we ordered.On the way to our table, the waitress dropped plate, which shattered, causing broken shards of plate to hit me in the face. Seriously. She didn't say a word.After we ate the wings, which were good enough to make me not hate having to give the one star, she came and asked if I wanted more water. I said no, I'm ok. She took my water! It wasn't empty, and I didn't ask her to remove it! WTF?!Also, the men's bathroom was in disrepair, and smelled awful. The toilet appeared to be non-functional, there were tools and parts all over the floor, no sign on the door indicating a problem, nothing.What a disaster that whole experience turned out to be! This place is definitely going on my "Never Return" list!
Zeke's Coffee=Zeke's is East Liberty's only commercial coffee roaster. I feel pretty comfortable saying that, but please correct me if I am wrong.First of all, the coffee is excellent. It is small batched roasted, I'm pretty sure right now he can only do 1 or 2 pounds at a time! I don't have the most discerning coffee palate, but this stuff is good... nothing like what your friend roasts in their air popper.They have brewed coffee (I can't remember for the life of me if he does espresso) in addition to 6-8 by-the-pound offerings that were extremely freshly roasted... my pound was still warm! Averages around $13/lb.The storefront is pretty no-nonsense bare bones, don't worry about tromping a little snow inside or bringing in your bike with you to grab your coffee.The proprietor (I forget his name) is extremely friendly and welcomes a chat. He'll also do custom roasts for you, no minimum I'm pretty sure, especially handy if you want a half decaf blend or the like. I recommend calling ahead if you have a large order, as well.Hours are hard to find online, but I posted a photo of what was on the door as of today.
BK Whopper Bar=So we were going inside the Rio from the parking garage and the first thing we see when we come in is the Burger King.... BAR? What.Is this real life?Only in Vegas- not even. Only in Rio Las Vegas!They have a couple beers, which I didn't get, but if you ask them, they'll totally tell you what it is.The Burger King is VERY limited- they make Whoppers. And double Whoppers. And breakfast.... and to my eye, that was about all they made. O_O So you don't get hamburgers, cheeseburgers, etc, unfortunately. Or whatever else BK has, because I haven't been to a BK in  so long. They DO have smoothies though!Ordered a whopper, tasted alright, cheaply made, of course :-/ They didn't put enough sauce, and so it felt a little plain. It's totally fast food, and lines show up and that's when production begins to slow down, as there is a cashier, a man working on making burgers, and the people in the back making everything else. (Hash browns, fries...). It took a couple minutes to get our order in, but even longer for them to make the hash browns. I mean- it's breakfast.... shouldn't you have some already ready?They do have nice service and they do accept LA coupons (whose food they make), so they do have that working out for them.2.5 stars here. Located across from Chippingdales in the Rio. Which is the half naked hot men picture, if you look at pictures instead :P
T-Bird Lounge & Restaurant=This place is so great. Always very chill and relaxing to come to with the nicest bartenders, especially Lisa! I don't even have to worry about creepers creeping either ;) They have a 24 hour menu so you can get your fat on anytime of the day. Plus a dining room area so Hunnie Bunnie can come and chill too :)Super convenient that it's right across the street from the crib too so it's a short walk away! And TV's to catch your favorite sports.A great local bar location with cheap food and nice servers. We arrived around 10 and they were empty in the dining area. The server was so friendly and greeted each patron like she new them, most of the rig upsets she most likely did. My mom and I ordered some breakfast and prices were beyond reasonable. My omelet was made to order and was good. Service with a smile and great prices while watching the games, we'll likely be back soon to partake in more of the bar area as well.
Mike's Bistro=What a diamond in the rough! I swear this is one of the best blocks for food I haven't tried on the west side. Well after trying to find somewhere quick to eat on the one hour break from a nearby hospital I saw a nice review for Mike's Bistro and decided to check it out. I read the specials posted out front, and Mike is right... "Life is too short to eat bad food"I am very happy with my venture into this small business and I hope more people make it in because this was absolutely great food. The wife had an eggplant parmigiana sub, and I had a pulled pork chipotle Torta, and they were both in the 6 dollar range but oh so fantastico! Mike was very polite and the restaurant was clean and tidy. The experience was authentic as was the food, and honestly this is one of the best places I have ever eaten that wasn't high priced.Check out Mikes, and support local business with some great eats!
Wine 5 Cafe=I'm so full! And yes, it's the following day.Coming in to last night's dinner, I was looking forward to trying their curry. I pretty much love curry of all kinds and with a name like "The Taste of Nairobi," how could you not be intrigued? But Jieun wanted to try the curry, so I let her order that and I looked for something else that sounded interesting. I had settled on the "Traditional Nayama and Ugali" since it was something I had never even heard of before. But then Sun ended up ordering that. Long story short, the waiter recommended the "Nairobi Pork Chops" and that's what I went with.Holy crap did we end up with a ton of food on the table. Absolutely everything was delicious. The curry was curry--nothing too amazing--but it was delicious all the same. Being a complete fatty, I love how it comes with bone-in dark chicken meat. Sun's Nayama and Ugali had an interesting flavor and I would have been very satisfied if that was the dish in front of me. But I think I might have to go with the pork chops as being my favorite of the three. The pork was tender and juicy and everything that surrounded it (veggies, mashed potatoes, gravy, greens, and garlic mini bread thingy) just combined to deliver an extremely satisfying and comforting experience. Best of all, my dish was the cheapest of the trio.Next time, in the interest of preventing me from getting even fatter, I think we will split an entrée and perhaps try an appetizer. Seriously, the portions are humongous. I suppose the entrées at Wine 5 are perfect for taking home leftovers. The thing is, I'm never good at portion control when the food is this outstanding.p.s. Check in on Yelp and get a complimentary glass of house wine (or a fountain beverage).If you want Kenyan/American fusion in Vegas, this is your best choice. Well, your only choice anyway.A couple of my friends have been urging me to go to Wine 5 Cafe for a while now, and they finally took me there themselves today at lunchtime. Located in the Target plaza at Cheyenne and Tenaya, just off I-15 - yep, the same plaza as The Sandwich Spot - it's no small drive for us Henderson / Eastern LV residents. However, it's definitely worth it.They're open for all three meals, and even though their web site states that their breakfast menu is only available until noon, they were more than happy to take breakfast orders when we ate at 1pm. They also have an early bird breakfast daily from 7-9am and a weekday happy hour from 3-5pm, both of which feature $5.55 foods and drinks, and both of which we sadly missed. Maybe next time...They has a Yelp check-in offer for one free drink per person w/ purchase, which I used for their house white wine, a Moscato. It wasn't the best Moscato that I've had - just sweetness without much to fall back on. But then again, I wasn't here for the wine, and I didn't care enough to order a more complex wine, so I'm pretty much ignoring it for rating purposes.Owing to a glowing review by the Vegas Burger Blog, I decided to order the River Road Jetpack Burger ($9.99), which contains avocado, grilled sweet onions, house pickles, lettuce, and tomatoes. The bun was nice and the meat was seasoned fine, charred, and cooked properly to my request of medium-rare. The sweet onions were very prominent, but the pickle wasn't so noticeable, and I could've forgotten that there was avocado in the ingredient list. Still, the construction of it reminded me somewhat of Bachi Burger (which I love), and the addition of their milder hot sauce (ask the server for this or their very hot sauce) gave it enough depth of flavor. I wasn't completely blown away, but I'd consider having this burger or another of their burgers in the future.I tried a bit of the Nairobi Farmer's Splendid ($8.99), which one friend was raving about and ended up ordering. It was better than my burger. It's a mixture of ground beef, roasted corn (one of my favorite things), black beans, fried eggs, and cheese that can be eaten with mandazi, a fried bread that seems light and not greasy. The same sweet onion is provided on the side, and this along with the aforementioned milder hot sauce were welcome but not necessary for enjoying this dish. I'll probably have to order this on my own in the future.We were considering going elsewhere for something creamy and frozen, but we ended up getting desserts here. The Churro Split ($9.99) was the more interesting of our two choices at first glance, with churros, bananas, pineapple, pecans, vanilla bean ice cream, chocolate, and creme Chantilly. The flavors and textures were all there, and the pineapple was especially sweet and juicy, but I don't think it came together cohesively as a dish.On the other hand, the simpler sounding Sweet Goblet ($7.99 - with creamy cheesecake, Oreo cookie crumbles, strawberries, and reportedly a fresh berry coulis (but definitely some whipped cream and chocolate syrup) - exceeded expectations. It had figurative and literal layers that blended together harmoniously in a faux waffle cone serving cup. It tastes richer than the mundane sundae that it sounds and looks like, and it's simply satisfying as a dessert, especially if you like cheesecake or cookies & cream.Overall, my impression of Wine 5 Cafe is that it's simple food done right, whether it draws inspiration more from its Kenyan roots or its American home. And like a lot of places, I wish it were closer, but at least it's not far off the highway. My Northwest and Summerlin friends should definitely take notice and give this place a try.
The Potato Patch=I stopped by the Potato Patch while visiting Kennywood last Sat.  Given that the Potato Patch is the most famed food stand in the park, I had to pay it a visit.  Since I had a picnic lunch at the park, I waited until dinnertime, when I was sufficiently hungry to justify getting an order of the famed potato patch fries.At the time of my visit, there was hardly any line, which was likely due to the weather, which had been threatening to rain all day.  Even if there is a crowd, there are ten lines to order from, though, so I imagine it moves pretty fast.  The way it works is that you put in your order and pay first, and then you step forward to the window to receive your fries.  AFAIK, only fries are sold at this stand, so if you want something else, like a drink, you'll have to get it from a nearby stand.  (I hit up the nearby fresh squeezed lemonade stand.)At the Potato Patch, a regular order of fries comes with one or more toppings, except for bacon, which is an upcharge.  In keeping with tradition, I ordered my fries with cheese and bacon ($8.20).  If you order cheese sauce, it will be poured over the fries unless you specify that you want it on the side--for my part, I wanted to enjoy the fries in their ooey, gooey glory, so this was fine with me.  As for the fries themselves, they are of the boardwalk variety--thick cut and with skin left on--and come in a medium sized portion (there's only one size), which was more than filling enough for me.  I am something of a fry connoisseur, so I can say with some authority that while they weren't the best fries I've ever had, they were quite good, and are definitely a cut above the usual theme park fare.If it's your first time visiting Kennywood, as it was for me, be sure not to miss the Potato Patch!  Just make sure to go when your stomach's settled, so you can enjoy the fries in all of their crispy, topping-laden glory!Note: I took a photo of the fries, as I usually do, but lost my phone before I could upload it.  :-(
E-Jo Korean Restaurant=I've driven by this place many times and saw the decent reviews on Yelp. The area is pretty sketchy so I parked on the side street since there was additional lighting.Being it was a Tuesday evening there were only a couple of other patrons. I was greeted by the friendly Korean woman who immediately brought me ice tea which was refreshing. Being that E Jo is popular for their soups, I went with their combo soup which had 6 varieties of meat in a yummy broth and noodles. The soup included fresh tasty ban chan and rice.I'm so glad I tried E-Jo Korean Restaurant - good food and friendly service will have me returning again.I don't live or work in this part of town, so when I do travel this way it is usually to go to one of the restaurants in the nearby Commercial Center or simply passing through.  So over the years I have driven past this unassuming restaurant that practically blends in with the other random businesses on this stretch of E Sahara, and never really given it a second thought.  So I am glad that we the typical question about where to get dinner ultimately lead us to E-Jo Korean Restaurant.Their menu is pleasantly simple. Just 2 pages worth, and almost all of it is dedicated to the various traditional Korean soups not found at other Korean restaurants. These soups are the final product of hours of slow simmering to extract the flavors from the beef bones used in its preparation.  You can order the soup according to the meats and other ingredients that you want served in it.  If you are a beginner, then go with item #1 (Brisket Beef Soup for $9.99). If you are adventurous, then order item #8 (Their Combination Beef Soup with all the ingredients listed in items 1-7).The soups themselves are what many would considered bland, but that is completely intentional. And sea salt is available on the table for diners to adjust their soup to their individual taste (very good for individuals with high blood pressure or are on a low sodium diet, since it is easy to add salt but impossible to get it out).  Besides that, there are Korean spicy chili paste and another soybean paste and garlic mixture for flavoring the soup or as a dip for the cucumber chili (most were not spicy, but there were a few that did packed some heat, so be careful if you don't like it too spicy).In the end I opted for item #3 (Beef Knee Bone Soup with Tendon, $13.99).  If you like soft tendons, there are a lot of it in here, but no other pieces of beef.  Overall, this alone was just okay for me even with all of the tinkering that went into fine tuning my soup.The surprised highlight of the meal for me and probably everyone I ate with (Michael K and Roger T) is the restaurant's house made kimchi (2 varieties: radish and cabbage).  As far as banchans are concerned relative to other Korean restaurants, the selection is minimal.  However, what the E-Jo lack in kimchi selections is more than make up by the quality and flavors that they packed.  I will be happy with a few servings of rice and their kimchi, and maybe just a small bowl of soup or side order of Stir Fried Ribeye or Spicy Pork.  The kimchis are that mind blowningly good!  Forget the other K-Restaurant's commercially sourced industrial kimchis.  I want E-Jo's artisanal kimchi goodness!Service was friendly and efficient. The food came out with nominal wait time.  You can help yourself to as much kimchi as you want.  However, be polite and considerate and get the kimchi out of the jar with the provided tongs and put it on the serving plate first (no ones wants your cootie crossed contaminated double dipped leftover kimchi, not even your GF or BF).In the mood to drink responsibly?  They offer, you guessed it, Soju!  Plus Korean beers and rice wines and soda for me.For entertainment, besides staring at your iPhone or Android devices and neglecting your dining companions (okay if you are Yelping, but only because I am Yelping too), catch up on Korean programming of the variety show category on their TV (at least that was what was on at the time of my visit).  Afraid of ordering wrong because you are not Korean, can't speak Korean, but you still want to madly impressed your Korean GF or just being  culinaryly (I am making up words because of their kimchi) adventurous minus the requisite language skill, have no fear! pictures of menu items are on the wall for easy visual reference.  Or just ask the restaurant staff taking your order, silly.(Getting the frantic hand signals to wrap it up)E-Jo, a good Korean soup restaurant to visit, especially as the thermometer starts dipping towards your feet.  Lastly, awesome kimchi!4 stars! **** out of *****Trivial observation: Their soups all look the same to me here.  But I can assure you I am not a soup racist. I have had soups from many culinary traditions in the past. Just the other day I thoroughly enjoyed a miso soup, and before that an Italian Wedding Soup, and a very invigorating cold Borscht from Russia (or was it or Ukrainian origin) just over the summer. My point is I am not a soup racist.Shout out to my Yelp friend Michael K for doing a last second UYE for this place.With that said, I have never been here. The Korean restaurants im used to are the cook it yourself all you can eat table top grill kinds. So I was curious as to how this place works.From looking at the menu it looks simple enough. Everything has a number and is in Korean and English. Since I didn't really want to be that adventurous, I chose the #1 Beef Brisket Soup. It's your basic soup with Beef Brisket and Noodles. Now this is where I learned something new. You season the soup yourself meaning they don't put any spices whatsoever in it. On every table there are containers of salt with a mini spoon. For those that are looking for a low to no sodium meal, this is your soup to get! What I ended up doing was grabbing the meat from my soup and eating it with the steamed rice they give you. I would also mix in a little bit of the hot sauce and curry sauce that was provided as well as mild green peppers. What actually stole the show was the Kimchi. I have had it before but when I had some of theirs, it tasted really fresh. What I find out was that they make it themselves from scratch. That explains why it was so good. Definitely not from a jar you would be able to buy at Seafood City or Ranch Market.Service was good. We had a sweet old lady that looked like she would not be able to understand us or speak English well. I was pleasantly surprised when she spoke perfectly good English to us. She was very helpful in answering any questions we threw at her.As for the place and overall location, I gotta admit, I drive by this place all the time and never really noticed it. Shame on me. But then again, it is in a weird part of the east side of Sahara when most of the food places are on the west side. When you go inside, there are plenty of tables and chairs I would say for about 20 people.So next time, based on the pics, the Spicy Pork and Spicy Chicken looks really promising.A true diamond in the rough when it comes to Korean food options in Las Vegas.  Korean barbeque and tofu stew joints are aplenty in Spring Mountain, but E-Jo is one of those niche restaurants that specializes in slow cooked beef soups which  one rarely comes across unless you're in a city with a full-fledged Koreatown.  Don't be fooled by their limited menu offerings and the simplicity of their banchan since the old saying goes that it is far better to do a few things well than to do many things poorly.  They offer a variety of beef-based broths containing a variety of cuts ranging from brisket, oxtail, and tongue to a variety of other tender bits such as tripe, tendon, and intestine.  The broth has a milky white complexion that can only be achieved from boiling down beef bones for several hours under a low simmer achieving a rich and nourishing soup perfect for a cold winter day or when one is under the weather or post-hangover.   Sea salt and pepper are provided at the table to adjust the broth to optimum taste and along with the choice of meat, some silky threads of somyeon (wheat flour) noodles and fresh green onion complete the dish.  Accompaniments include a refreshing glass of barley tea, a few raw green peppers (not spicy, although they look like banana peppers, presumably as a palate cleanser?), and two artisan jars containing perhaps the best made-in-house kimchi in town in the form of radish and napa cabbage cut down table side to bite-size portions by one of the staff.  For the final fine-tuning of flavors, some ground red chili paste and additional green onion are provided for the broth and a spicy soybean paste and horseradish/wasabi based soy sauce for dipping the meats.  Other options include a few choices of grilled meats, nyangmyeon, and a soup with homemade dumplings/rice cakes which have also been well-received in other reviews.A true mom/pop joint devoid of pretense that delivers homecooked Korean goodness to nourish the body and soul."Oh come on.  When I said I wanted soup, I thought you'd pick ramen.  Tripe, tendons, beef knee bone, tongue, oxtail.  Seriously?" whines my Midwest poker bud."Be adventurous"  I say, choking back giggles."Adventurous?  It's not fair.  The worst my people got is Rocky Mountain Oysters, and you like those."E-Jo is all about authentic Korean beef bone soup.  Heavily extracted, boiled for hours until gelatinous and milky.  Incredible beef flavor with garlicky undertones.Simply select from a flavorful list of brisket (well braised, stringy), tongue (braised and tender), knee (clean, gelatinous tendons), oxtail (fall off the bone with melting cartilage), tripe (well cleaned, no off smell, tender), or all of the above then adjust the seasoning with the provided salt, fermented chili paste, chili powder and scallions.  Done.Only three banchan.  In-house made, incredible Napa cabbage and radish kim chee.  Deep flavor, good heat and just the right tingle of fermentation on the tongue.  A plate of fresh shishito peppers adds a vibrant, mild spice, green pepper foil made even better when dipped in a light but flavor enhancing soy garlic sauce.There are a few other non soup items (spicy pork, chicken, etc).  Have not tried them.  Prices for the soups are very reasonable ranging between $10 - $15.A short list of shoju and Korean beer rounds out the meal.Mom and pop Asian service.An incredible bowl of deliciousness.  Oh yeah, "Mikey liked it".korean bone broth soups....sulluntang, breakfast korean style...to soothe stomachs after a sinful night in vegas...order of korean pancakes to start...crispy golden deliciousness...well made pancakes...majority taking the brisket sullungtang...self taking the doganee sullungtang (knee cartilage soup), but basically given a tendon soup...instructions are simple for sullungtang...season it yourself, customize it yourself...add some sea salt, but remember sea salt is extra salty...add some green onions if desired...black pepper for little kick...some will go as far as to add kimchi juice straight up in their soup...there are no rules to personal preference!..kimchi jars and plates given...radish and napa cabbage...sissor to cut it  yourself...any size you want...careful not to splatter on yourself or neighbors...korean green peppers are milder...before they ripen to a red firey fiery...dip the green peppers in the brownish/reddish paste...mixture of fermented beans (korean miso) and things...overall, the kimchi is decent...korean soup restaurants are suppose to have the best kimchi, but e-jo is just decent....the soup is light and not as rich as wanted, but it does the job....Came here tonight bc it had such high ratings and I needed a Korean restaurant for my Korean mom and Korean Aunt, who need to always eat Korean food. :) Anyway, we grabbed a taxi from the Wynn (where we were staying for the weekend) and went over. In hindsight, I should've just driven but I was too lazy to get my car out of the parking structure. It cost $11 cab fare to get there. Then I paid $5 tip. I know. Dumb. It was actually worse on the way back. The owner of the restaurant called us a Korean cab to get back to the hotel. He charged us $20!!! What a ripoff!! Anyway, I digress. So, the moral of the story is if you decide to check out this place, and you have a car, just drive there. So, I got the oxtail soup, my mom got the Kalgooksoo, and my Aunt got the soup with the greens in it. I thought my oxtail soup was  good! Broth was flavorful. My meat was a little tough...I mean I was fighting with it to get off the bone. But still pretty good. The cabbage Kimchee and the radish Kimchee both were really good! They also gave us peppers with daenjang. The peppers with fresh and crunchy! Really good! My mom and aunt said their food was just ok. They said it was bland. Lol. But they live in LA, so they always compare Korean food to the restaurants in Ktown.Overall, I thought the service was great and the food was pretty good. If I have a craving for Korean food in Vegas again, I will be back.A lot of people ask me what my favorite non-bbq Korean restaurant here is in town. But, if I wanted a certain dish, then it would change for every restaurant. For example, in Korea, a local restaurant might have only a handful of dishes on their menu... but they are able master those dishes over time, and they become specialized in those dishes. So that is the reason why when I go to one restaurant, they might make only a few things that I really like, but at a different restaurant, which has many of the same menu items, I might choose other dishes. It's hard to find a Korean restaurant that does everything, very well.Which brings me to E-Jo. This is ONE of my favorite Korean restaurants in town, because what they do very well is their seolleongtang. What is this you ask? Basically, you can call it a beef noodle soup. But their are certain things one must consider before generalizing this dish. The broth for example. Normally when one makes a beef broth, you must brown the bones in the oven in order to get that brown color to shine. This soup is unique because you take raw ox leg bones, and boil the hell out of them. This makes for a very milky colored broth. But the flavor is definetely beef.Traditionally, this soup is only served with either oxtail bones, or with some brisket. At E-Jo, they have expanded themselves by offering a myriad of beef parts, including tongue, tendons, and tripe. I like this because I like offal, and it's definetely something different that I am not used to in this soup, but appreciate eitherway. Another great aspect of this dish are the clear sweet-potato noodles that are located near the bottom of the bowl, they give the soup a great texture. Also, there is salt and chili pepper located on the tables if you feel as if the soup is lacking a bit of seasoning. I tend to like this soup kinda bland, but thats just me.On another visit, I was able to try their hangover soup, or haejangguk. I thought that the korean hangover soup was well made as well. It is a bean paste soup  that is loaded with bean sprouts, cabbage, and beef brisket. I thought that the seasoning was on point, and it definetely cured my hangover, as was its intention. But, I thought that one thing was missing that really could have taken it over the top. It is usually served with pieces of coagulated ox blood. The one at E-Jo does not have any. I think that if they had added that in, it would have completed the dish.Ban chan (or side dishes) are usually kept to a minimum at a seolleongtang restaurant. This is the case because they want to preserve the simplicity of flavor that is in that bowl of soup. So, you will typically get kimchi, and some raw chili peppers, which are not that spicy. But let me go on record by saying... E-Jo makes the best kimchi in town. And I just don't mean really good, or awesome... I'm talking the BEST! I know you're going "Yea, right Mike, sure, uh huh, I believe you, get outta town, pssshhh, hold the phone" and other stuff. Trust me on this one. Just do it. Or else. Or else nothing.The prices are OK, not out of this world great, but just OK. The service is also pretty good as well. This place is usually never crazy busy.. even though it should be.. so more than likely the service will be pretty good. I enjoy getting my kimchi fix here, and this place will cure any hangover, no matter how large or small. And even if you aren't hungover, the food here will make you a believer. Just like how much I believe in you.Hearty, hot Korean soup is perfection during this chilly December weather! I've heard about E-Jo through friends and fellow yelpers and decided to go last night with a coworker. We both got sizzling hot soups (Gomtang - brisket for me, oxtail for my coworker) and we split spicy buckwheat noodles (Bibimnaengmyun - cold noodles topped with spicy sauce, veggies, and boiled egg)When I first got the soup, it looked fantastic and I had to dig in. I tasted it and my reaction showed how bland it was. My coworker pointed out the small bowl of salt crystals right in front of us (silly me for missing) that is supposed to be used to add salt to taste. That made a lot more sense to me and I added a small spoonful along with a sprinkle of pepper... My soup was DELISH!The Kimchi and Kkakdugi (radish) were both very tasty and servers were quick to replenish. A large portion came in small ceramic bowls and you serve and cut them yourself - just like how they do it in soup restaurants in South Korea. We also had spicy Korean peppers to dip in Doenjang (miso paste) which is one of my favorite simple Korean sides.The Bibimnaengmyun wasn't my favorite. The sauce tasted sweet to me which is extremely strange as this cold noodle dish is supposed to be spicy, not sweet (?) My coworker added more spicy paste to it and finished it off as I only cared for one bite.For the price, quality, and portions of food, I would absolutely recommend E-Jo. Maybe not for their Bibimnaengmyun... But it's definitely a great place for authentic Korean soup!
Feast Buffet=I went to this location for a work lunch the restaurant was able to accommodate our large group of 40 people. The wait staff would have to be the highlight of the experience. The lay out was great for large groups and the decor was fairly modern. I would say the set up of the actual buffet was rather confusing and the food served didn't seem to be the healthiest options. Most of the food was of brown or white color, not green, orange, yellow, red-- you know-- fruits and veggie options. A wide selection of desserts to tickle your after meal fancy..I came here for breakfast after an early morning couponing trip at a nearby store. First off, make sure you bring your players card! I had to wait in line to get one, although the members area is located right near the buffet. Also, come early. The food was super fresh & actually really tasty. The price: 5.99 per person for unlimited food/drink. Nice!! Will I go back? Sure, If I am ever on that side of town around egg time!! :) Diet friendly: Depends. My friend is a vegetarian and most items had some sort of meat in them already. They did have a fresh egg bar where they make them for you. There were not many low-cal options I noticed. Lots of egg/bread dishes... But not a ton of variety of fruit.Look, I love me the cheap eats!  So yes I am a fan of buffets!  I don't live on the Hender-tucky side of town so rarely do we ever go to the Green Valley Ranch for a visit.  But with getting that Station Casinos coupon buy one buffet get one FREE just about every month (a wonder what $20 a month gambling with their members card can do) we finally gave in and took the trek down there.  I know, I know the coupon is good for the Red Rock Casino too but with over 25 check ins there (yep and I'm still only 5th place for a regular) I thought it was time to change it up a bit.  Glad we took the journey!We went on the most expensive nights, Saturday for dinner.  Since it includes prime rib & shrimp for the buffet on this night the price goes up to $17 a person + tax & tip.  But with our BOGO coupon 1 is FREE!  Oh yeah!  That is a deal to me!  Don't care if people say buffets are 'whack' or 'the stuff no one wants to eat'.  Save it all for me then!  Eating on a budget is hard enough as it is, but doing it with a buffet?  Yeah, sign me up.  Let's see...$10 each after coupon for all I can eat of just about anything, or $10 each trying to pick out food to cook from my local supermarket?  I like to cook but nope, that BOGO coupon is tough to beat.  Plus, no clean up!For us, the Feast Buffet at Green Valley Ranch didn't disappoint.  Yes, there are lines, yes, there are crowds for high ticket items (like prime rib), and yes, some of the food is downright mediocre.  But tell me where you gonna get as much meat as your fatty mcfatfat self wants, when you want it?  Don't get me wrong, quality is just as important as quantity...but that's why you only eat the things at a buffet that entices you!  Don't be wasting your calories on those rolls of bread!  Skip the cottage cheese please!  And believe me, we ate like kings!  Prime rib, which was actually pretty good by the way!  Rare!  With au jus!  And a side of roasted mushrooms!  Pad Thai that was actually edible!  Orange Chicken that whaddaya know?  Tasted like there was real orange in there!  Roasted Brussel Sprouts!  Sauteed Broccoli Rabe!  Carne Asada Tacos!  Hell I could have got Mongolian BBQ made for myself too!  The list goes on & on.Had a rarity in the buffet, made to order Gyros!  They honestly weren't that great (or that pretty) but it was offered!  Choices!  I like me some choices when it comes to food because half the time I don't know what I want to eat.  Buffets fill that perfect medium.This Feast Buffet even offers shakes & malts!  Really!  Not a bad way to end the evening after your feast.  Overall the food was more than decent, some really good stuff in there.  Why go to a buffet expecting Michelin star food?  This my friends is not the place.  Go here to enjoy the food, enjoy your company!  Do what they want you to do.....FEAST!Then go home & take a nap.
Genghis Grill - The Mongolian Stir Fry=I eat at boofays all the time, so believe it or not my problem isn't with allowing patrons to handle their own serving utensils and potentially cross-contaminate food allergens or bacteria. My problem at Ghenghish Ghrihll (where the heck do you put the "H" again?!?) is with the way the staff handles their meat.Sounds pretty yucky, and it is.After going through a useless ordering procedure instruction by the server, the complications of which are rivaled only by the ridiculous ChinoBandido http://www.yelp.com/biz/chino-bandido-phoenix-3#hrid:Rc5orUUva9KTB4kMp7EgMw , I winced as i grabbed a serving tong laying on top of a pile of raw meat, dished out my portion, and went on touching other serving utensils on the veggies and spices and sauces. GROSS.Guessed about what to put on the dang thing, and was scared, really, since the server warned to be sure to know you like what you put on by tasting it with a tiny spoon ( from a bowl where it was touched by all those other peoples' grubby germ-laden meat-tongs-hands) .  GROSS. Thinking that "well, at least it's going to be cooked now," I hand my dish of e-coli-laden vegetables and warm grey meat chunks to the ''chef'' and scurry into the restroom to wash my hands with soap. When the food finally comes (long wait) to our table in the overly cramped dining room, the portion is onderwhelming and the thing is ugly.  The veggies are overcooked, and when i try the meat chunks, they are undercooked to the point of being rubbery instead of flaking apart as i chew. GROSS.I will admit i got lucky and concocted a decent flavor, but it was a total fluke.  Unimportant.  I was counting on that warm, grey, pile of exposed-to-the-public meat being cooked through and through to eliminate any food borne bacteria sure to be lingering around after its recent history of unhealthy handling.The server was more than happy to allow me to fill another bowl, and the guys said i could have them start cooking the meat first and add veggies later , but why should i have to ask for that?  Well, it didn't matter, because i never got the chance to even have them cook up that second bowl.As i stared down at the sloppy serving station, trying to decide if thinly sliced meat meant more or less chance of bacteria, I watch a staff member fill up the raw chicken tray with more rubbery chunks.  He does not place the new container in the server and pour the old meat on top of it, but instead simply pours new, frozen meat on top of the old thawed meat already in the bin.  This is not only against common sense, but against food handling procedure.  Who knows how many times he refilled this way that day, or how long the meat down in the bottom of that container had been sitting there?!? GROSS.If asked whether I prefer to allow all of that sort of thing to just go on behind the closed doors of a kitchen where i can't see it - YES, that's exactly what I prefer.Just okay for my taste, the one thing I do like is that you can go crazy with what you decide you want to have them cook up for ya!! You simply, pick your choice of meat, choice of seasoning, veggies, sauce and starch and you hand it over to the cook, that then they heat it up for you in their gigantic grill and TA DA, it is all ready for you to enjoy!!The one thing that I honestly don't really like is the price, it could definitely be adjusted, it is a bit over-priced for the portioned you get and that is without a drink, if they included your drink of choice then I would then be content!!
43 North=43 North's special Valentine's Day four-course prix fixe was, hands down, one of the BEST meals I've had in Madison, ever.Each of the four courses offered three supremely adventurous and deliciously executed choices, imaginatively (de)constructed or served in novel - yet hearty - ways.  Standouts included the lobster bisque, poured at the table over succulent and generous pieces of meaty lobster, a take on fried chicken with spaetzle that was more like a fall-off-the-bone-tender confit, a seared salmon in microgreens with shaved shallot and lemon dressing, _huge_ sea scallops with jamón ibérico over pear and the beef loin over puréed root veg.  Each course offering was served with an unexpected yet exciting twist, and a variety of amuses-bouches were offered throughout the meal - including a starter of a strawberry purée and cava cocktail, and ending with a take-home portion of 43 North's coffee cake (presumably served at their new Sunday brunch).  Desserts were playful deconstructed takes on classics; the concentrated form enhanced flavor and offered a visually stimulating presentation that was matched with the intense flavors (of chocolate-caramel flan, in one case, and panna cotta with mango, in the other).  Cocktails were also splendid, particularly the Hendricks and St. Germain "Rainie."In addition, the service from "Birgit" was excellent - she was attentive, informative and enthusiastic about the special meal and it made dining a pleasure.  The maítre d' was equally warm and welcomed us in as special guests for the evening - it's a feeling that makes this restaurant just a cut above other high-end options in town.For $50 per person, this was one of the most reasonably priced yet fantastic dining experiences I've ever had.  I can't rave enough.  Awesome!Bobb doesn't eat at restaurants that put pictures of their food in the window and I don't eat at restaurants that put pictures of their chef on the menu. (Yet we both wound up here.)Let's chalk this experience up to me expanding my horizons and giving places another shot after they let me down once. Service is ok. Food is plated nicely. The menu offers something for everyone. It's nice that you can go small plate or large plate when it comes to their entrees. But it's not special. It ok. It's nice. It's fine. Now I feel like jerk... was that harsh? In my opinion harsh is spending $14 on two seared scallops. That's a lot of money. $7 per scallop if you're not good at math. Scallops aren't cheap, I get that, but I can throw a scallop into a screaming hot pan and sear on each side for a minute and a half. Who wants to give me $14? Tonight the scallops were in this weird pea puree that lacked flavor though admittedly was a beautiful color. Scallops themselves are already a bit bland, I wish there was something stronger than the pea painting my plate. Add to this the fact that my fork couldn't cut the touch sea life. You shouldn't need a knife to cut through scallops. These were over-done. The rest of the menu is a bit more complex taking less than common proteins and pairing them with starches in interesting ways. But at the end of the day, there is better food on the capital square. Good company helps. Both times I've been, I've thoroughly enjoyed the intimate bistro atmosphere and the people I was with. I just wish the food stood out more and resonated better with me, especially if you're going to put a picture of the guy that prepares it on your menu.
Mika's Greek=This place is so put together, organized and delicious that I had always thought they were part of a national chain, but they are actually locally- and family-owned!Big props to the Mikha family!  They have plenty of vegetarian options, and I always make sure to get a side of their lentil soup - it's amazingly delish and fresh tasting!  It's sort of the opposite of George's... :)Highly recommended and I will always come back!
Toci Pizza=This former New Yorker is so glad that this pizza place is here. The slices are big and the taste is just like that of the pizzas I have enjoyed for years in the boroughs of the Big Apple. And no wonder: the pizzas are made by friendly guys from Brooklyn who really know their stuff.  This place also offers  a  great lunch special of 2 slices and a drink for just $3.75  - one of the best lunch deals in the city.
Devil's Greens=Brought to you by the contractors that run the dining hall and Starbucks on the ASU downtown campus, Aramark.  Apparently they are also open until 1am 6 days a week too....hummm.....Stopping in on my way home from work hoping to find some veggies.  On first glance through the place I was excited, thinking, "cool my own salad bar near home." Then as I  took a closer look...the quality of said veggies, well that was another story.The employees probably never eat salad or veggies by the look of the dry wilted zucchini, cucumbers, celery, carrots, bok choy...To their credit the main piles of spinach, romaine and mixed greens were fresh.  The side salads looked like they had been sitting out all day as did the dressings.  Either cover the items, take the time to stir the salads/dressings, or put out less and replenish frequently.  All of this could be resolved with a swift kick to the ass of some obviously lazy employees. I wanted to take my salad to go and they charge by weight but I was not given a to go container.   I was told to use a plate, put it all together and then I had to dump it in to a container after it was weighed.  HUH?!  These plates are huge and plastic, and I doubt that they tare out the weight of the plate.  I didn't get a whole lot of salad considering the quality of the toppings and it came to $9.  WTF?! I can get the whole kit and caboodle at Souper Salad or even Sweet Tomato for that price (or less).  I rarely even pay that price at Whole Foods when carrying out a salad there.  No wonder this place was empty....I wish this place was better....
Garden Cafe=This was my first visit to Garden Cafe, despite working in the area. We were looking for a new restaurant to give a whirl for lunch so I pulled out my trusty Yelp app and we decided on Garden Cafe. We arrived around 12:15 and the place was pretty empty. More people trickled in after we ordered but it wasn't too crowded. My coworkers ordered the gyro lunch special. I set my sites on the lamb schwarma sandwich but at last minute I decided to try the soujouk sandwich with fries and diet soda. The guy taking my order (I presume he was the owner) promised I would like the soujouk and highly recommended it.Our food came out quickly and everyone was pretty pleased with their meals. I felt the portion size was a little slim for the price, but I definitely didn't feel cheated. The sandwich was tasty, but not the best I've ever had. I'll had to try them again to see if I like any of their other food better. I'd definitely skip the fries next time and opt for a salad or some rice instead. They were definitely lackluster. Overall, we had a good meal and I am still looking forward to trying some of their menu items and giving them another chance.
Daphne Cafe=One chick working the whole restaurant.  That sucks, right?  But it wasn't busy at all.  At.  All. So the fact that my water wasn't refilled ever... Our hummus came out after 20 minutes.... The extra pita bread we asked for never came... She wouldn't even give us another menu willingly... was very irritating.  I'm a big fan of good service (gee... who isn't!?) but I tend to give A LOT of leeway to people because I was a server.  Today, it was hard for me to do so.  The hummus was actually really good and the pita bread was awesome.  Came out warm and moist.  The gyro salad was not bad.  I liked the meat, but it was a pretty simple salad.  I've had much more creative/better ones.  I think I'd give it another try because I did like the hummus, but I pray the service gets better because I may start throwing around some pita bread... if I ever got some extra slices!Despite going to the chiropractor practically across the street from Daphne Cafe, I have never even noticed this place.  So when a friend recommended coming here, I was surprised to discover this cute little cafe.  They have outdoor and indoor seating, but the outdoor seating was really cute!  On a lovely summer day, this was such a great atmosphere to have a business lunch.I enjoyed the Baba Ganoush and falafel very much for lunch.  They provide you with plenty of pita to enjoy with your meal.  The Baba Ganoush was a very generous portion, and I actually took quite a bit home with me.  The falafel was probably the best falafel I have had in Pittsburgh.   While I didn't pay for the meal so I don't remember the exact prices, they seemed fairly reasonable at the time.We had pretty good service throughout the meal so I think that issue has been resolved!
Taqueria El Buen Pastor=HOLY CRAP!After my volunteer shift at The Neon Museum I was heading back home when I noticed their trailer opening, I decided to check them out after hearing good things about their tacos, let's say they did not disappoint.My first plate was 2 El Pastor, 1 Asada, and 1 Chorizo taco.  The chef cooked them up in a hurry and before long I was standing over a plate of awesome. The Chrosizo was good, a nice little kick but not too much spice. The Asada was probably my least favorite, it was good, but out done by the other tacos. The El Pastor Tacos were INSANE, seriously I asked how much for me to take the entire roast off the spit.The fixings/toppings bar was nice, I went with only a splash of lime, but the salsas and other options were all fresh and everyone trying them seemed to like the offerings.After Plate one I knew there needed to be Plate 2, so I ordered up 3 more El Pastor and 1 Lingua. The Lingua was really good (probably my 2nd favorite to the El pastor).  So in the end I had 8 tacos, I probably could have had another plate, but I needed to get going. I can say I will be eating there again, it'll be a great place to grab lunch after my shifts at the Neon Museum.Oh I also forgot the tacos are $1.50 each, they come on top of 2 tortillas, and are served with only meat and tortilla, there is a bar you can add salsa/veggies if you want, but I kept mine simpleMy hairdresser is from Guadalajara, and about a week ago she and I started bitching about how bad LV Mexican food is. We even bitched about how the Tex-Mex sucks ever since Margarita's Cantina got blown up in 06. Well, she told me that the only good Al Pastor in Las Vegas is located on Bonanza road near the "shitty part of town". I drove down Bonanza from Rancho all the way to Hollywood, and this was the only street taco stand I could find. I just assumed this had to be the place. She was right, it was really good. Just out of personal preference, I still like Taco Taco on Trop better because of the unique seasoning. But, I enjoyed the slices of pineapples that TACOS EL PASTORCITO put in my al pastor taco, and they had this special salsa that was bright orange and tasted like Mexican Tan Tan Men. 3 Al Pastor tacos only ended up being $4.50, and they were pretty big compared to other street tacos. The service was extremely friendly and one of the cooks was really good at setting boundaries for the large homeless population in the area. TACOS EL PASTORCITO is located in the parking lot of a Llantera place, right across the street from a Siegel Suites and what I believe was possibly the wreckage of a UFO(you will see what I mean when you get there). When you wait in line, you will be confronted by multiple druggies and homeless who will either ask you: "You got a cigarette I can borrow?", or "Got 50 cents so I can catch the bus?".  Well, the cook does a great job screaming aggressive things in Spanish to these people and getting them to run back into the alley for a while. Usually a couple of minutes later they come creeping back out and then the angry cooks starts yelling again... this cycle continues all night long.  I also  liked the regular customers. Most of them are older Mexican men who like to talk about professional boxing. I had a fun conversation while waiting for my tacos.Well well well Nelson, so you've done it again. You have found one of the most amazing hole in the wall joints in Las Vegas!! Big kudos to you. This is now my favorite place to get tacos anywhere in town, especially my favorite, the al pastor taco.Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the UYE treks that Nelson put together due to work obligations. But after having these tacos, I probably should have used up all my sick days hehe. The only thing I regretted was taking such a long period of time to try these delectable morsels of flava'.For parking, try to find a spot at the gas station or on the nearby streets. It can get kinda sketchy late at night so keep a lookout!So I ordered three al pastor tacos with pineapple. First off, you know they are going to do things right when they use fresh pineapple. When the tacos came out, they were a great sized portion. Heading over to the sides station, I decided to try a different sauce on each taco. Added on cilantro and limes, and I was good to go.That first bite... Forget about it. Forget about every al pastor taco you've had in your life. Because these guys? Yea, they know what's up. The smoky richness of the pork layered by the perfect blend of seasonings and spices. Trust me, you need to go here. The sauces? Amazing! Try some and find out which one you like!In Nelson we trust! Great find!!If there's any al pastor in Vegas that's better, please tell me right away. I need to know.I've avoided coming back to this taco stand since last year for one reason or another, but since I'm working nearby for a little while, it was so easy to stop by Taqueria El Buen Pastor. Having learned about the standing buy one get one free offer for tacos al pastor on Wednesdays, I've been back on that specific day of the week twice now. At $1 a pop when discounted, those babies were all that I ordered, and they were all that I needed.I'm not sure how they encase their other tacos, but the tortillas on these get crisped slightly but with minimal use of oil, if any. They're a great base for the excellent fillings. Speaking of which, you have to get the pineapples with the tacos al pastor. Luckily, the cashier has asked me both times whether I wanted it served with pineapple. I'm pretty sure they grill the pineapple up to add that extra flavor to what's already a great sweet and crunchy element. The meat itself is a fantasy savory, sweet, and somewhat smoky experience that works even without additional salsa. If and when you do go for salsa, skip the tomatillo salsa because it just doesn't complement the al pastor meat. Get either the spicy avocado salsa, the orange colored salsa, or perhaps both (note to self: try that next time). Just don't forget to add the onions, cilantro, and even lime to your liking. Those are essential for adding even more flavor and texture, so don't forget to stop at that metal-covered condiment station.I told myself before that I would try their other tacos, but the al pastor tacos alone are enough to make Taqueria El Buen Pastor a must-visit. That's even before considering the BOGO offer on Wednesdays, which makes it all the better. Maybe I'll be able to justify trying the other meats if I have an interesting night in Downtown Las Vegas, but I'd be perfectly content without them.
Riviera Pizza & Pasta=This place has changed our lives. Seriously! My wife and I live in Observatory Hill and I adore this neighborhood. Right on Riverview Park, quiet, beautiful historic homes, and close to everything. The only thing this neighborhood is lacking, in my opinion, is more restaurants. Sure, there are acceptable dining options 5-10 minutes away in every direction. But some times you just want fast, delicious and convenient. And to not leave the house. Until recently there was only one pizza place that would deliver to our house. One. And it's downright nasty. Right next door to the high school so that's the crowd they cater too. I'm guessing you can set your standards pretty darn low when your only competition is the school cafeteria pizza. Then, one glorious day, a menu appeared on our doorstep. Riviera Pizza and Pasta. And they deliver to our home. Worth a try! They have all of the typical offerings, breadsticks, pizza, calzones, hoagies. You know what a pizza place has. What they have that I've never encountered before is a relationship with eat24, an app that allows me to order on my iPad and magically have pizza show up at my house. Whaaaaatt?!?! I can order pizza and never have to speak to another human, and the food will come to me while I'm in my pajamas?!? Finally!! All of my dreams are coming true! It's finally a civilized neighborhood thanks to Riviera!The food is a solid 3.5 stars. The pizza is pretty good. It's tasty, cheesy, and just the right amount of greasy. The breadsticks are super yummy and we get them every time we order. We like the calzones a lot, the small one is enough for 3 servings at least. The delivery has always been faster than the quoted time and the drivers are kind and courteous. We've been desperate for a neighborhood pizza place that we actually like. Finally, the storm clouds have parted and Riviera Pizza has emerged. And we are certainly some grateful fans!
Grimaldi's - Coal Brick-Oven Pizzeria=How Lucky Can One Guy Be....I Kissed Her and She Kissed Me...Like the Fella Once Said...Ain't That a Kick in the Head...2,500 miles away from the original location under the Brooklyn Bridge and I walk in to Dean Martin singing with the smells of pizza cooking.  That's Vegas baby.  Truth is, nothing can replicate the smell of walking into the original Grimaldi's.  There it almost knocks you down, and I'm not kidding.  Perhaps it's that you have to wait outside in line to get a seat, weather be damned.  You earn your pizza there.  But here on a Saturday night at 7 pm we walked right in.  More proof that people have to get away from the strip to enjoy some great food.I love that they kept the pizza prep area the same as the original Grimaldi's - a square work area with a coal brick oven taking up the back wall.  Open to the restaurant so you can sit there and watch them put on a little show and fantasize if that that's your pizza they are working on or not.  They start with hand tossing the dough here, which is becoming a lost art, because I'm seeing more and more press machines being used for dough.  Then some of their signature tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella.  The fresh mozzarella is the key here.  It's slices rather than shredded.  I noted in my review at the original Grimaldi's that they deal the mozzarella like playing cards all over the pizza.  Well even though it's Vegas and that analogy works better here, they were a lot slower and each slice was more carefully placed on the pie.  I guess in New York they've made so many pizza's that those guys can make 'em in their sleep.  This location is fairly new, so you can't expect them to be working at that speed yet.We ordered a pie with a whole lot of toppings and each was excellent except the shredded fresh basil.  Unfortunately they put the basil on when they are cooking the pie and the result was burnt leaves on the pizza.  So if you are going to order basil, make sure you ask for it to be added after the pie is cooked.  The pepperoni had a nice spice to it.  The meatballs were sliced real thin and had so much flavor.  The sausage was crumbled, and while I prefer sliced sausage on my NY pie, this is good stuff and you won't be disappointed.  The onions and mushrooms were sliced thin enough to totally cook on the pie.  The roasted red peppers were a little different than the original Grimaldi's, they were chopped up into smaller pieces, which I think was a good thing.  That way you got a little taste of the marinated red peppers in each bite.Now the problem with getting a lot of toppings here is you really pay for it.  Toppings are $2 each with a few being $4.  We had $18 in toppings!!!.  Oh well, we're on vacation, but if you eat here regularly you might have to make choices of what you want on your pie.  I remember the same thing happened in New York, I got the bill for 2 and it was like $50.  For pizza.  LOL But so good!  The only thing I didn't think was quite as good as the Original Grimaldi's was the dough.  I don't know what it is, but once you stop using that New York drinking water for your dough, it's never the same.  But we ain't in New York, and this is still a 5 star pie.Ok I have to apologize to Julie T if you're reading this, I'm sorry! Don't be mad at me! I lied to you, I said I liked it.  I was probably one of the last in Vegas to try their pizza but I had heard such negative reviews from people I had no desire. But the opportunity came up when my friend and her bf (this is his fav place) invited me, so of course I accepted. Anyways...immediate 1 star for patio seating (and I love love love the white Xmas type lights hanging from the lattice) and for it being Tuesday tasting (half of glasses of wine) I did enjoy my wine. No stars for food.The pizza looked decent when it came out. Nice big bubbly pieces of cheese, fresh basil on top, looks good?! Well my friend had told me that the ricotta was sweet, I wasn't quite prepared for the taste of it. I wasn't down with sweet ricotta on my pizza. The sauce had no flavor, at least the pepperoni gave it some. I asked the server for a side of ranch "we don't serve ranch, our pizza doesn't need it" uh huh, I beg to differ. This is for corporate pizza lovers who don't know any better.  Once again, to each their own, but I will never return.I cannot believe I have lived my life this long without a Grimaldi's Pizza!  Have driven walked and stumbled by many times in various locations in this city but never gotten to try it.  My loss...Until now!  The service is nice from start to finish with pretty quick service.  They have a bar for cocktails while you dine (and have the coolest wine bottle chandeliers I am going to recreate in my bar at home) lots of wine to choose from.  The greeter is nice and the staff was great.  Night before Christmas Eve it was busy from the nearby stores but the food came quickly not a worry.Because it was my first and I am kind of a Pizza fanatic I had to start slow and continue slow to truly enjoy the flavors.  When you take your time this Za has so many underlying flavors that you will miss if you dig right in.  The "Coal Brick-Oven" is true and it is AMAZING!  A soft Smokey flavor with every delicious bite of all the other flavors of you're choosing.  It is an ala cart pizza style so it can add up but with flavors like this it is worth the price.The ambiance is awesome, decor beautiful as I mentioned I am totally going to have the wine bottle chandelier in the near future.  Service is nice fast and efficient and the food is great!  Well worth the slightly increased price but when I make my Gourmet pizza at home WITHOUT the coal brick oven, it cost about this to make so yeah, worth it.Where should I start!?! This place is pretty simple...Drinks...Salads...PIZZAS...Desserts! The pizza here is just amazing! The crust is delicious...thin with a great crunchy crisp texture to it. A regular pie is enough for two people to share but delicious enough for a little Asian to force down happily. Their salads are pretty great as well. Portions are very generous and the presentation is pleasing. Price wise...a bit pricey for pizza, (especially if you are a person who likes to add a lot of toppings onto your pizza) but you'll be getting a quality pie. Save room for dessert! Tiramisu get's a thumbs up.I have herd great things about Grimaldi's and finally got a chance to try it. The server and staff were very friendly and polite they did a wonderful job. The white pizza was delicious, the pepperoni and mushroom pizza was not so great. The crust ended up all mushy from the grease on the pepperoni pizza which i cant stand. On the other hand the white pizza was perfect!    Grimaldi's has a nice dining room with a large opening in the building for fresh air and sunlight. The only down side to having this large opening, it lets in the flys. I had to swat away flys from our food several times during our meal which put a bit of a damper on the whole meal. Aside from the mushy crust on one pizza and the flys, it was pretty good.
Marché Soupson=Open till 10pm every day of the week serving homemade and mostly vegetarian and even vegan soups, so already, I love Soupson. The creamy soups are made with an in house cashew milk which is beyond tasty and super filling. They also offer sandwiches with meats roasted in house so nitrate and preservative free. This is also a regular dep so you can grab grab beers, smokes, organic vegetable chips: you know regular stuff. But you can also pick up organic fruits and veggies, and if you buy a big soup in a Mason Jar you can bring it back for refills, eliminating a little bit of the great wash of packaging in your life.
Park Bruges=Another highly talked about restaurant in the bag!  I know just a few days ago I raved about the cute little neighborhood of Highland Park, but I must say again, it's adorable!  I'm just surprised that most of the storefronts on this road were shuttered or closed down.  It's a shame with Park Bruge being so popular... You'd think more people would come out here seeking other businesses.  But I digress...A late afternoon lunch offered a chance to slip right in.  Still being on a diet, I resisted the urge to order the poutine (soon, my friends, there will be some cheat days!).  I saw the Spinach Salad and thought, perfect!  The salad comes with strawberries, pears, dried cranberries, candied walnuts and multigrain crostini.  I also added in portobello mushrooms for an extra $2.  Good choice on my part!  The bello's were nice, big and juicy and a perfect addition to a flavorful salad.  I really enjoyed the creamy chevre walnut dressing too, especially because they don't scrimp on it (if you like light dressing you might want to get it on the side).  I also really loved the candied walnuts (dah!).  There was a ton of spinach, so you really don't have to worry about it being a dinky salad!  The crostini, meh, I took a couple nibbles but left most aside.  The service was extremely friendly but laid back.  To the point where if you had somewhere to be, you may want to keep an eye on time, it can get a little slow.  I definitely want to come back off diet so I can indulge in some of the delicious looking items ie POUTINE!As we walked to the car and began to get in, my H held the door open as I rolled in.  He closes the door and gets in the driver side, when I state "better hurry to the hospital the baby is coming.  Let's call her Mussels."  I had done it again.  Ate until I was so stuffed it was unpleasant, but if you asked me if I regret it I will say "nope!"  I do get overzealous when it comes a new place that I haven't been to, all I want to do is try everything that looks good without regard to my personal wellbeing. So the food, we ordered a classic poutine, the Bruges Burger prepared medium, a LB of mussels spicy prepped, and a few drinks.  I explained to the H that the Poutine was his but I wanted to try it thus making him the main consumer so I wouldn't eat too many.  Well that didn't work as planned.  Upon delivery I fork dived in and got a huge amount of fries, curds, and gravy.  Simply divine!   He got the burger to which I had to try.  Really very good, and I ate his side salad, lovely dressing.  My mussels were very creamy and brothy I simply loved them but felt something was left off.  The bartender offered extra bread to sop up extra juices that I gladly accepted.   Now this is a shame to say about what should be a 5 star place.  The restaurant was just confusing.  You walk in and there is no hostess there.  No sign saying please wait to be seated, no just people loitering around I was like what are we supposed to do???  So there is a small bar real close to the door so with the fear of waiting forever we seized the two open seats and decided to just eat there.  Bar has no TV, and the Bartender was as slow as molasses. Absolutely no sense of urgency.  She was nice, and knowledgeable if you could get her attention.   The food was EXCELLENT!  But I am upset that I ordered the spicy mussels and thought the whole time these are not spicy... Very good but not spicy.  My H kept saying it was probably b/c I always like stuff extra spicy and have a high tolerance.  I kept saying no my mom who can't eat anything with spice would eat this no problem.  But having never been there I thought it was just how they served it.  That was until the check came.  Another episode of a bartender not writing down an order and rang me in for the classic and not the spicy.  A little too late to complain and they were really good still but, I really wanted the spicy ones!  So the service was meh.  It took her 10 minutes to even wait on us because she had one speed, the I don't give a sh*t speed.  Still would totally come back!  Those mussels were to die for and next time I will know what to expect if I get the wrong ones.I hate to be the voice of dissent, but based on the glowing reviews and price, I was a bit underwhelmed by the brunch here.  I was actually planning to go to E2 for brunch on Sun., but my dining partner and I ended up here because the wait at E2 was running an hour at noon.  Here, we were seated within half an hour, which I appreciated, given the hectic nature of the PGH brunch scene.I ordered the prix fixe brunch with the special of the day (pulled pork, cheddar, and onion omelette), potatoes au gratin, and a mimosa ($20).  I chose the special because I'm a BBQ aficionado, and I love me some pulled pork.  Between the pulled pork and cheddar, I expected the omelette to be bursting with flavor, but I found it rather bland.  I was also disappointed with the amount of pork in the omelette, which seemed rather stingy.  While I liked the flakiness of the potatoes (they were more akin to a casserole), I also found them bland, flavor-wise.  The part of the meal I enjoyed most was the mimosa, but to be honest, I don't have a standard of comparison, since this was my first time drinking one.  My dining partner enjoyed his grilled cheese, although it wasn't quite what he was expecting (he was expecting your standard grilled cheese).While this wasn't a bad brunch, I doubt that I'd come out of my way to have it again, given that there are so many awesome brunch places in PGH.  For a similar quality brunch, I could have gone to Pamela's or DeLuca's, or gotten something more unique at at E2 or Coca (and paid less, to boot!).  If I were to come back here or to try Point Brugge, I think I'd stick to dinner so I could try the mussels and frites, since that's what everyone seems to rave about.  3.5 stars.We headed out to Park Bruges for my bff's birthday last night....her and her husband have been here several times and invited us along, our first time at Park Bruges. And I have to say, it definitely lived up to the reviews! We got the Poutine - fries with cheese curd and stock gravy - and the Tarte Flambée - a kind of flatbread (I think?) with marinated tomatoes, olive oil, and cheese -  to share as our apps. Very good! I have to say I've heard nothing but good things about the Poutine, which was delicious. But I actually preferred the tarte. It was light and tasty - a nice appetizer. For our entrees, my husband got the mussels with the green curry sauce and I had the cafe chicken sandwich with a salad and champagne vinegarette (a suggest from my friend). Everything was very delicious.It's hard to complain about this place, because honestly, there's so much to love. If given the opportunity, I'd give Park Bruges 4.5 stars. Just not quite 5. I'm just going to be a little picky, since all of the reviews are so good and there's little to complain about. My chicken sandwich was very good...chicken was flavorful and the mozzarella and dried tomatoes made the sandwich. But, the bun was just a little too crunchy for my liking, so I ate half the sandwich then took the other half of my chicken and mixed it in with my salad. The only really negative thing I can say about our first experience was our service. Now don't get me wrong, the waitress was nice, she just really didn't have any sense of urgency. Drinks and refills took several minutes and we had to ask for an extra set of silverware, since there were only 3 on the table. Overall, like I said, she was friendly, just not very efficient.The restaurant itself is cute. The place is small, but that doesn't bother me. We sat inside, and the restaurant is very comfortable, although it did get quite loud the busier it got. There is minimal seating outside, which is a bummer because I love to sit outside and eat. The problem with sitting outside, if you choose to do so, is this. They don't take reservations. So, if you end up going at prime time, people are sort of just hanging around at the bar or outside, which means, if the latter, people waiting for tables are sort of just hanging around in front of your table while you eat. Could be a little awkward. My suggestion would be to go a early like we did (6pm) or a little later, say after 8 or 8:30.
Angels with Bagpipes=I went here based off a suggestion from a girl I worked with.  I am so glad I did.  While in Scotland, we ate here a few times.  Great food. Great atmosphere.  Great service.  It is located on the Royal Mile.  I have to say it was some of the best food we had in the UK.  Please note you may want to make reservations, they fill up fast and turn many people away.  They do have a bit of room on their street side seating, but don't count on it.It is a bit pricey, but really worth it.Samuel the hipster manager (very easy on the eyes)  kind of made the experience great as well.  HUGE FAN!Angels with bagpipes? If angels really did play bagpipes...infer what you will.As a modern Scottish eatery, this is a gem.  Hidden in plain sight, right on the Royal Mile.  Traditional Scottish food elevated using the freshest obtainable ingredients served in a contemporary, multi story building overlooking centuries old courtyard.The menu is seasonal. Autumn 2015, for starters, the potato and leek soup with a poached egg and croutons is outstanding. Creamy, the vibrant flavor of the leaks mellowed ever so slightly when you break the egg open. The scallop with black pudding, and unexpected joy to eat. Tart green apple puree provides the base for beautifully seared, incredibly sweet scallop. The accompanying black pudding has been deep fried in bacon fat rendering it crispy.  Barely a hint that it's a blood sausage. Crisp streaky bacon adds even more Porky goodness. Some bitter greens rounds out the extremely well balanced, textually satisfying dish.For mains, it's hard to pass on the selection of fish. All combine intriguing flavors of produce that miraculously heightens the flavor of the fish. The salmon cooked mid rare is extremely rich. The crispy skin adds a brilliant foil. The use of a red pepper puree heightens the natural sweetness, bitter greens accentuate the fatty flavor.  The natural flavors of a simply pan roasted, perfectly cooked, moist and fatty, black cod are greatly heightened by the earthiness of grilled onions sautéed wild mushrooms and a root vegetable purée.For something vegetarian, try the mushroom mouse served with grilled mushrooms and sautéed root veg, sauced with beet root purée is wonderful.  Solidified mushroom soup!  Extremely silky, velvety, intense flavor of mushroom from the mouse combines perfectly with the bitterness of the grilled mushrooms. The sweetness of the beet purée ties the entire dish together.Very well chosen wine list at reasonable prices.  Average bottle £20.Very friendly and efficient service. One month advance booking required. Them angels can play bagpipes all they want if I can eat like this.
Mama Gina's Pizzeria=1st: They tweeted a special 2-for-1 sandwich special. Two from our group ordered, and were then told the special was only during a specific time. Fine, except that the tweet came AFTER that time, and it said COME ON IN.2nd: The AC uniti or something came one EVERY TIME one of the servers, busboy, manager, etc came out through the door...and it stays on if the door is not closed completely...they on many of the occasion left it just slightly open so the LOUD UNIT stayed on. WE had to close the door.#3: I was charged EXTRA for the EXTRA SMALL DISH of marinara sauce. No mention that there was a cost. #4: NO SPECIALS, in fact even though there were 2 kids and 6 adults, three of which were separate, there was an automatic gratuity. 17%+. AND they leave a spot for another gratuity in case you don't catch it. Good thing someone in the group pointed that out.#5. The garlic knots were ok.#6. My server seemed to not care about much, sorry I didn't order a BIG meal, but there was seemed little reason to do so.#7. We meet once a week on Fridays and are looking for 4 specific place to hang on a regular basis..usually there are 8-12 people that come out...I am not sure I am voting for this place...#8. Why a I doing this??? You ASKED ME TO.. Yelp it you said.. oh wait. this isn't YELP.. ok then.. guess I will now copy and paste....I'll keep this simple. We were sat at 5pm and told the server we were ordering by the slice because we were in a hurry. He forgot to put in our order until 5:20, and slices came out at 5:35. The quality was on par with Sbarro. I could understand if the place was packed, but there were 6 employees along with the owner working, and only 4 tables sat the entire time we were there. The only reason this isn't 1 star is that the decor & bar area was pretty awesome.I also wasn't a huge fan of both TVs being tuned to BlackHawk Down- not really something I want my toddlers watching.I'll start with the positives.  .... oh wait, there weren't any.  I can't even do a good analysis of the food because the wrong pizza was brought out and to boot it was a pizza we didn't particularly care for.  (Had an ingredient on it that my dining partner had a slight allergy to.)In short, completely horrible service, rude attitudes when trying to get our order straightened out, and owner/manager was unwilling to give a decent conciliation for our trouble.  Will never return.  Being treated like we were is unacceptable, especially when we acted civil and to the point.   Here is a list of follies that occured during our "experience" at Mama Gina's.  1.  Ordered an appetizer.  Was convinced by our waitress to try the garlic knots instead, only to find out when our food arrived 35 minutes later that they didn't even have any to bring out.  Sidenote:  After about 20 minutes we inquired on the whereabouts of this item to our waitress (20 minutes for some garlic bread is a little much) and she said she would go check...apparently that didn't happen.2.  Wrong Pizza delivered to the table.  After inquiring about the order since it was taking quite awhile to arrive and we had a movie to catch.  The wrong pizza was brought out.  We had ordered a 16 inch BBQ Chicken pizza and a 20 inch Supreme was delivered to our table.  Honestly, it wasn't till 15 seconds after it was dropped off that we went... uh.. wait a minute... this isn't what we ordered.  Immediately went to find our waitress to let her know.  She went to her manager and they said they could make us the right one but we'd have to wait.  Pending our time issue with the movie, this wasn't an option.  Since we couldn't wait for another pizza to come out the manager said we could either take a 20% discount on the pizza or just leave and not pay.  At this point, we were starving and the movie was starting in 10 minutes.  Didn't really have a choice at this point.  I agreed to the 20% discount so we could at least have something to eat before we sat for another 2 hours without food.  (Side note:  couldn't eat much considering one of the items on the supreme includes an item that my date has a slight allergy to.)3.  Wrong discount.  Once the bill came, we were charged for the pizza that came to our table.  Which was $9 more than what we originally ordered.  Making even the 20% discount they were offering a total more than what we were expecting to pay in the first place.  Waitress ended up paying for our beverages to help offset the cost.  Also, when speaking to the manager, he said we should have let him know sooner that there was an issue.  How were we to know???  The only thing we knew prior to the food coming out was that it was taking FOREVER to get to the table.  ... and that we did bring to their attention.  I truly dislike writing reviews that are this scathing but I just couldn't believe how we were treated by the management.  If you are in the service industry, and the mistakes are with your establishment, then do not make the customers feel as if they are the ones at fault.  I just don't believe they tried to make this better for us.I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately I won't be returning.The customer service is STELLAR. I can't stress this enough. They went above and beyond to accommodate and did so with a smile. Fat tip for them!The outside patio is great, especially during this time of the year. It's spacious and a delight for people who like to look at something other than a wall, as you can see all of Westgate from their patio.Food and drinks... this is where they lost me. Pizza has absolutely NO flavor. Mozzarella sticks had no cheese on the inside. Wings were decent but nothing special. They don't serve margaritas because there's no blender... I thought that was interesting. The bill came out to $75 for one pizza, wings and a sampler. It just wasn't worth it.This pizza here is way overpriced and even worse is that the flavor is just average.  The pizza has okay sauce but is just average in terms of toppings.  However, it's so expensive relative to what you normally pay any place else so it's really just because of the location that you have to pay more for this pizza - not worth it.
Sunset Pizzeria=MY PREFERRED CHOICEThis pizzeria may not have all the bells and whistles nor sing happy birthday, but this family operated business serves tasty pizzas. Seating capacity is just below eighty with TV screens anchoring each corner of the restaurant.. Whenever I want to watch a Bay Area sports team, Terry the co-owner and his crew will accommodate without hesitation. Terry's family happens to be originally from the Bay Area.While munching on my Mikey's (named after Terry's brother) Special slice of pizza, Greek salad and sipping on one of my favorite soda drinks Dr. Pepper, I watched the "Dubs" take on Jeremy Lin's Houston Rockets.... unfortunately GSW didn't have enough gas in their tank to drive it home for the victory. BTW speaking of drive... don't forget on Wednesday nights starting at 7 PM, come and join in on Terry's "Cruise Night". Check out all those hot rods and funny cars.Update:  Sorry to mention... No more NFL package since they dropped Direct-TV and switched to Comcast.
Thai'd Up=In the last couple of months this summer we had 2 new thai restraurants pop up in Downtown Phoenix, both no more than 2 blocks or less from long time Thai establishment Thai Elephant.  I guess we shall see how great the demand is for Thai in centeral PHX with at least 5 Thai restaurants within a 2ish mile radius.  After seeing they had openend on my walk into work and not having packed my lunch that day.  I decided to see if they have a website and check out the menu.  Humm....not bad. So I called in my order just before noon.  Panang curry lunch special, chicken, medium..."that will be ready in 10 min", she replied and hung up the phone.  She didn't take my name, I guess she was confident or they didn't get many carry out calls.  I walked over and it was ready and waiting for me.  The little restaurant was bright, clean and teaming with an active lunch crowd. I took my order and walked back to my office where I opened my bag to discover a covered bowl of creamy well seasoned Panang curry (next time I will order it hotter) sliced chicken breast, bell peppers and a side of steamed broccoli and white rice.  I quickly tossed the broccoli into the curry and began sipping on this delightful curry sauce.  Now I am a bit picky since red curry is of my my favorites and I can make it at home (live in the boonies and you learn to make the dishes you love and can't get without a 2+hr drive).  This was quite tasty, but the Duck Pineapple red curry at Siam Thai is still my favorite red curry in the valley. Thai'd up...you've caught my attention!It's humorous to read other reviewers issues with the service at Thai'd Up, as when we went this evening, and we thought the service was fabulous. My friend John G. and I shared the Crispy Tofu appetizer, Panang Curry and Spicy Drunken noodles. All were superb! I love the hot chili paste which I added to my dishes. The Drunken Noodles was fierce! I have never had anything so peppery, but yet so clean tasting. Delicious! Our bill came to $40 which I thought was a good value considering we had two entrees, 2 bowls of rice, an appetizer, Thai tea and 2 coconut ice cream. To top it all of, we received a 10% Yelp discount! So be sure to check-in if you have a smart phone. What makes this eatery particularly special is its proximity to the light rail. Great location, great value and great service. Highly recommended.
Mellow Mushroom=Last week, a group of us went into the Mellow Mushroom restaurant in Tempe to have a "quick" lunch before a 1pm meeting. We got there at Noon, ordered and then waited, and waited, and waited. At 12:50pm I told my waitress that I had a 1pm meeting and please run my card now so I can take my food and run to my meeting. Well, I get my food at 1pm and it is the wrong order. Argghhh!! So I have the waitress send it back to the kitchen and have one of my coworkers bring it to me, but I am still waiting for my card which I gave to her 10 minutes ago and I have to go this meeting that I am already late for. My co-worker signs my card and I get my cold food later and again it's the wrong order. I eat it anyways and can't lie, it tasted really good.Fast forward to today, where a co-worker and I had another 1pm meeting. We decide to work through lunch and order take out from them and give them another chance. I make our orders at 12:05pm and the girl says that it will take 20 minutes. So I go to pick them up at 12:30pm and they aren't ready. So again, I wait, and wait, and wait. While I am waiting I hear the kitchen manager and a server talking about a table where the customer was not so happy about having to wait so long for their food and was trying to get a discount. At that moment I hear the kitchen manager refer to the customer that is arguing this as a "douchebag". My jaw just dropped at what I have just heard. I have to go outside because I don't wanna hear more. So I continue to wait until I get our food at 12:55pm, 30 minutes after it was promised to me, we end up having to eat our food during our meeting. Uggh. Now the food is great here, they do an great job at this but the customer service is absolutely dreadful and that is being nice. Surprising because there is usually 25 people working in there at one time. I do not recommend Mellow Mushroom unless you have a lot of time and patience, and don't mind the kitchen staff calling you "douchebag" and other names behind your back. I'll passFirst restaurant in Arizona! Great spot for a late night snack while walking through Mills. Since it was happy hour, we ordered a couple drinks, which came out to be too artificial and sweet for our table. We decided to order the chicken wings, the stuffed portebello mushroom, and the five guys pizza with five types of mushrooms.The chicken wings were pretty standard, but a good starter snack. The portebello mushroom came out cold, and we could not enjoy it at all, so we sent it back. What a bummer. The pizza, on the other hand, made up for the appetizers. The thin crust was nice and crisp, and the toppings were fantastic. We really enjoyed the pizza and finished it within minutes. I would recommend sticking to the pizza and maybe skipping the appetizers if you're not that hungry. Our total came out to be around $45 which was pretty reasonable as we also got drinks.
Red Label=Going here the other night may have very possibly one of the most fun nights that I have ever had.Okay, so it's a little dive bar, nothing too unique about that in Vegas.  But it was the sign out front that made me stop my car, throw it in reverse, and drive back to see if I read the banner correctly:Porn star karaoke.It's true!  Monday nights at 10:00, porn stars call it a day from their jobs and come to this rather cheery bar with a good vibe to belt out some tunes.  And everybody is super nice.  From the great bartenders to the hostess who has apparently been in over 26,000 films.  At this point, all boasting rights I've ever had as an actor are laid silent, because I am never going to beat that.So the initial call to new wacky situations was strong enough to summon out the missus, my good friend and I to sit, drink cheap, tasty drinks, and belt out tunes alongside a whole cadre of adult film actors.  And they can sing.  And they also flash more than a few boobs while singing, so if that's also your thing, then there you go.  They even play some crazy games, of which my friend won a prize.There may be too many highlights to list, but I think one of my personal favorites was being able to stun a group of porn stars into open mouthed wonder with my rendition of Michael Jackson's "Rock With You".  I thought about singing "How Deep Is Your Love" from the Bee Gees, but that's perhaps too tacky and obvious.  But they have a sense of humor, so who knows?I've done a lot of karaoke, and I've been to a lot of bars, but nothing like this.    I would completely have to recommend the Red Label on a Monday night as a "must do" Vegas experience.  It's hilarious, quirky, and way too much fun.I can't wait to do this again.....I think it is about time I create a Yelp review since I have been here many times over. I feel that each time it has gotten worse by far with more complaints with each visit. My first complaint is the bar and bar staff as they are always understaffed on busy nights.We only attend on special bbw nights which is usually on a Saturday night. The fourth Saturday of every month to be exact. You would think for a special group function that they would have extra staff on hand to handle the crowd.The staff is not friendly and they NEVER have drink specials which is a let down since they have one beer special. I recently found out that they do not honor their advertised Yelp check in which is not cool. There is no excuse for having a Yelp check in offer and not honoring it, that is unacceptable.  The ventilation sucks and there is zero air conditioning, it is hotter than hell in there and when busy it is BAD! Especially considering they are hosting BBW dance parties. I mean come on us big girls get HOT!I am done with this review, I am over it. This place sucks! I will not visit again due to the rude bar staff as it is a complete turn off!
Cafe Rio=This was the first time I had a bad experience at this location, but it was so frustrating! I informed Associate #1 that I was ordering a salad. Before I could say anything else, he proceeded to throw a tortilla on the flattop with cheese. When he walked back, I had to inform him that I didn't want cheese. He just looks at me, then turns around, throws a container on the tortilla, and turns back around. Trying to be helpful, I asked my fiancé what he was ordering and it was also a salad, so I told Associate #1 that he would take that tortilla. No response. Oookay. So I quickly tell him, "I'm having a vegetarian salad" before he could assume anything else. Also, since it was Thursday, there was a tamale meal special that I hadn't tried. I wanted to give them a whirl, so I asked Associate #1 if I could order one as a side item, since I didn't want the meal. He seemed confused and I asked a couple different ways, but he eventually answers, "Yes." Then, it's on to Associate #2. She seems nice enough, until I ask her a question, then she appears obviously annoyed. I say yes to all the vegetables, but no cheese. She asks me what type of dressing I want and as I'm attempting to formulate a sentence to indicate the dressing that is Vegan-friendly (I couldn't remember the name of either of them and she didn't tell me what they were, but just kept asking me which one I wanted), she starts scooping the creamy one into a cup. I'm like, "Um, ah, uh, I meant the other one...the Vegan one???" While trying to point through the glass. "It's vinaigrette." Right. Then she just tosses it haphazardly to Associate #3, but it lands in the tortilla strips compartment. Nice. While she's finishing up, I began to wonder where was my tamale? Me: Um, I ordered a tamale in the side....Associate #2: Did you tell him? (pointing at Associate #1)Me: Yes.Associate #2 to Associate #1: Did you get the tamale ready for her?Associate #1 has the look of "Oh crap, I forgot" on his face and gets it together. Associate #3 was great and asked if I wanted sides with the tamale (rice, beans, pico, and lettuce). Sure, why not. I also asked for no cheese.Now, we are at the cashier.Cashier: Sure you don't want two tamales? It's the same price for one.Me: Uhh, what??? I asked the guy if I could order a tamale on the side and he said I could.Cashier: Oh. Weird. So you want the other one?Me: Um, okay...well, yeah. If I'm paying for it, I might as well.We sit down and I'm pretty annoyed. I've barely started eating when the cashier walks over to bring us the tamale.Cashier: (as she is handing us the tray) Oh, did you want cheese on that?Me: (staring at the obvious, melted cheese on the tamale): Uhhhh...Cashier: If you don't want it, that's fine. We can make another one.Seriously, why would you bring it over with cheese on it and THEN ask me? Or better, why didn't anyone bother to ask Associate #1 or Associate #2 about how I had ordered the first tamale just a couple minutes prior?So $25 and one (disgusting) tamale later, I didn't finish my food and Ieft feeling disappointed and dissatisfied (really, two tamales and two salads for $25 with bad service, no thank you). Additionally, for a salad I typically love, I had absolutely no desire to eat it tonight nor will I want to again in the future. For an establishment that has the appearance of promoting Vegetarian and Vegan options, it seems to be a bother to every associate to request NO cheese melted on the tortilla and NO cojita cheese (and cilantro, which Associate #2 also didn't bother to ask me if I wanted or not) topping my salad. If I hadn't received such amazing service in the past where associates have asked me whether or not I wanted certain items or concerned themselves with what I want on my meal, then this experience wouldn't have stood out so much.Ok Cafe Rio, I'm very disappointed with you. I eat or at least used to eat at Cafe Rio about 1-3 times per week. I can agree with some of the other reviews regarding customer service, but I always ignored it because they generally make my food correctly. Plus the food is good and portions are huge. Well, I recently took a break from dairy, which makes me very sad, but it is what it is. Considering I usually order the grilled chicken tostada with creamy Ranch type dressing I was pretty nervous that it wouldn't taste the same without dairy. My friend recommended I get avocado instead of sour cream. Great idea, right? So I order my salad, no rice, no cheese, no sour cream, no dressing. Oh wait can I sub avocado for the sour cream? Counter guy: doesn't answer, just puts it in my bowl. Ok. Great. I get to the checkout and the cashier tells me it will be $. 95 to add guacamole. So I ask her, even though I didn't get cheese, sour cream or dressing? She doesn't reply and just adds the extra to my total. Normally, I may have said something, but I'm so tired of having to argue or complain to receive appropriate customer service. I think I'll give my normal Cafe Rio another try (on Eastern) but if I get the same treatment I may just be over this place. Obviously they don't care about my business. It's frustrating because the amount of guacamole that you receive is paltry. I mean for a dollar I should at least get a full scoop. I used to rave about this place to anyone that would listen, but now I'll take my business to a place that can accommodate my dietary restrictions.I've never been a big fan of Café Rio, but given it's convenient location and online ordering, we decided to pick some up for a quick dinner last week. We placed our order and left to pick it up in the time scheduled. We arrived at the restaurant and the food wasn't ready yet. We weren't in a huge hurry, but they seem a little disorganized at this location. It took several people to handle our checkout and when they said my mom's bowl wasn't ready because the chicken was still cooking and would take another 15 minutes, they offered us a different protein. Since we didn't want the rest of the food to be sitting out while we waited for the grilled chicken she changed to shredded chicken. It was only after we decided that did we realize they hadn't even made the rest of the food yet, so there was really no need to change the order. The food was ok, but I don't see myself going out of my way to return to this location with better non-chain restaurants in the area I'd rather give my money to.
Midwood Smokehouse=Well, color me impressed. Midwood Smokehouse was really, really good! It's sitting at a 4.5 stars for me right now, but I imagine it will jump to 5 in no time. Not that I'm surprised, frankly...because Frank Scibelli seems to have the magical touch when it comes to delicious and well-formulated restos in Charlotte. It's a great location (parking can be tricky) with wonderful, friendly service and tons of tasty items on the menu. Here are just a few things I tasted...1) Pork platter: 4.5/5: Succulent, tender and delightful. This pork platter rivals Mac's, in my opinion. The meat is very smokey - due to the fabulous smoker they purchased for this establishment. But it's a good kind of smoke, no Liquid Smoke here. 2) Hush puppies: 4/5: Crispy outside, soft inside and damn good. 3) Sweet potato fries: 3/5: Good fries but paled in comparison to the other decadence on the table. 4) Bacon wrapped jalapenos: 4/5: Not nearly as hot as you'd think but a really flavorful starter. Make sure you eat one that has the bacon all crisped up. No one wants sad, soggy bacon.5) Queso with barbecue: 4/5: Um, I love queso. I also love pork barbecue. Put them both together and voila! Instant amazing app. 6) Banana pudding: 5/5: Hell to the yeah. Homemade deliciousness. With vanilla wafers. This is the real deal and you must order it. I don't care how full you are. I have a big ole smokey crush on Midwood Smokehouse. Looking forward to going back and checking out the patio!Can't believe I'm just now reviewing Midwood Smokehouse. Having BBQ aplenty in Crown Town, you've got competing businesses who want that coveted, smoky place on your palate. I'm happy to say that Scibelli has done it yet again!The locale on Central Ave is a bit tricky for parking. Pulling into the compact lot amongst other cars whizzing by on their way to Uptown can be a bit of a hassle, but it's all worth the struggle. Parking on the street is available, too. Be mindful of your space. Be sure you don't inhabit private spaces or any of the adjacent businesses lots as it my result in towing. Venture in to the cozy dining room, patio or rooftop and treat yourself to the bacon-wrapped jalapenos. I can barely muster enough words to describe their culinary beauty. Smokey, cheesy, spicy, bacon-y glory. If you're sitting at a table amongst bacon lovers, more than one order will be required. They go fast. If you're in the mood for a sandwich, the Superbird is wonderful. Smoked turkey, ham, bacon, avocado mayo, tomato on a texas toast. I'd get it again in a heartbeat. The brisket is great. You can order a lean plate, if you're not wanting the fattier, yet more tasy, cut. The sides are where it hits home. Creamed corn that is out of this world. Spot on mac n' cheese, greens like mama used to make and smoked veggies. You can even order 4 as a meal for $9!Do yourself a favor and order hush puppies, too. Fantastic flavor and crunchy texture paired with their tangy BBQ sauce. The service is splendid. Friendly, fast, and very knowledgeable of the menu. Great job to our server Ben!Look forward to each visit. These guys are making a name for BBQ in Plaza! Cheers!Midwood is still the go to place for bringing your out-of-town guests to show them the great Queen City barbecue. And so I met my Minneapolis buddy here! Great service from our waitress, who kept the conversation going and kept the beers filled.We split a plate of the pimento cheese fries. Plenty here for three, but we put a good dent in it. Lots of great cheese, good grilling that toasted the fries and melted the cheese all the way down.For barbecue, my friend had the four meat sampler and enjoyed it. He said that the sausage was particularly tasty. I had the pulled pork, with mac & cheese. It did not need any extra sauce. The pork was chopped fine, which made it a little mushy. Next time, I'll go for the sliced brisket perhaps.Overall, still great to visit and still great to bring your visitors.
Inka Fest=Yum yum... after having a fun afternoon at the Desert Botanical Gardens and walking thru the Yucca and Aloe exhibits, my mind had locked onto the idea of getting some yucca for dinner. hahaSo what did I do?  Well, I came home and Yelped 'yucca'... quicker than a snap, up popped a variety of restaurants and bars in my area.  Well, after skimming reviews on each of them, I picked the restaurant that was the newest and more reasonably priced, Inka Fest.  An hour later, my roommate, my guy and I were sitting at one of their tables, trying to decided between the many delicious-looking options.  We appetized with empanadas and fried yucca and ended with Bistec a la pobre, saltado camarones and saltado pollo.  It was all delicious!  Seriously, I'd reorder any of the 3 dishes.  The only note was that the restaurant was a lil quiet... could've used some musica in the background.  It was interesting to see the Peruvian channel but it would have been better to have captions on the TV and music playing in the restaurant... for the non-Spanish speaking patrons. I'll definitely be back.  I'm still thinking about my shrimp saltado!See ya there. :)
Skunk Creek Flats=I was so excited to right this review for a new place up north on the east side of i-17 just north of Jomax.  It just opened and it didn't seem like they could handle all of the business on a Saturday night but north Phoenix has needed a place like this so bad that I would be lying if I didn't tell you I love it.  The food is nothing special really but it served its purpose, we ordered chili which was pretty good, chicken fingers the kids loved, quesadilla, chicken wings, and 2 beef tacos all decent.  The fact that I can go there and have a beer with my family while my kids play on a playground and my friends play horseshoes all while a live band is playing and a big grass area for kids to play also makes this place awesome.  There is no waitress service so you have to get in line to order food, and it kind of reminds me of Salty Senoritas over in Arrowhead but without the servers.  The whole place must be on over 5 acres or so, it looks so big and they also do weddings and stuff like that.  I am sure there is much more to tell but I only came here once after our soccer game Friday night and I think it will be a regular stop for us now.
Sundance Pizza and Tastee Freeze=If you 'n yer partner ever pass along about Wickenburg way, you can rustle up some purdy fair vittles and frozen custard right here.This here Tastee Freeze ain't one of them there Weinershizzle ones neither.  It's got it's own thing a goin' on with pizza which I ain't never tried but I have set down with one of them there cheeseburgers.  I had them folks throw some grilled onions and bacon on that critter too.  It weren't one of them high falutin Fezburgers like them fancy city folk eat off of Central down there in Phoenix but it was purdy tasty.  I reckon out here in dusty ole' Wickenburg it stands just fine on it's own.  Yup.God's honest truth here as well, when I sauntered up out of this waterin' hole a long tall cowpoke tipped his big ole' hat in my direction and offered up a polite "How-do."
NOLA=Yay for new restaurants!  Yay for fun new restuarants!  And a final yay for a good exerpeince at a fun, new restaurant!I always love walking into a restaurant which looks super duper tiny from the front and then surprises you by being large on the inside.  The colorful pictures and art make it a bright and fun atmosphere.  Just like you'd expect from a 24/7 Mardi Gras party, minus maybe the flashing!First time's a charm with this place!  Service was fantastic!  The server came up and explained everything to us in terms of drinks, apps and main courses.  Since it was for lunch I went on the light side with the Crawfish and Sherry soup and the Nola salad.  The soup was delicious with just the right amount of kick for me.  Sometimes if things are too spicey for me I become a watery mess, and not in the emotional way!  I think the soup was just creamy amazingness!  The salad was also very fresh with some great toppings such as candied pecans and my personal fav, little mini potato chips.  Of course the later mentioned doesn't end up making a salad healthy, but whatever, it was tasty!  For a final send off we ordered the fried artichoke's as our "dessert."  They were incredible!  Nice, crispy and huge with a spicy mayo type sauce.  I'm all about the sauces, so it was just the right touch.I really can't wait to try out this place for dinner and/or a happy hour!  I will definitely be back.  I hope they have some idea's for events, because I think the place will be a great host for special parties.  Great addition to Market Square!!
Tutti Santi=Seriously?   $23.99 for linguine and clams?  I really wanted to have a closer go-to for well done simple Italian since Baci moved to QC, but this was just awful.   The menu is not extensive; so you'd expect that what is on there to be reasonably priced, and very well done.    My husband and I were turned off by the bizarre scented candle / restroom smell in the dining room, so we ate on the patio... with the bugs.   The restaurant is very recent, so you'd think they'd have the lights outside all in working order.   They're not.    The service was outstanding; Marcie was clearly a pro - but no level of service can make up for gamey canned clam bits on boxed linguine. We'll drive to Baci next time.
P.J. Clarke's New York Chophouse=After a little winning in the poker room, the husband and I did some shopping at the Forum Shops and ended up deciding on lunching here and are both thrilled we did.Both the service and the food way exceeded our expectations and we wished we had a little more time to have eaten here again before we left.We shared tomato soup that came with a small sliver of a delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We also had the warm goat cheese salad with a wonderful green goddess dressing and finally, we shared a french dip sandwich with a side of yukon gold mashed potatoes instead of french fries. Our waitress was great, refilling our drinks and even splitting our sandwich so Kevin could have cheese on his half and I could have mine without it. It was a great French dip and a great meal overall!*Happy Hour Review Only*As if Vegas visitors weren't SEXED up enough, here comes $1 oysters for your aphrodisiacstic pleasure (so good it deserves a new word)! Every day happy hour from 2:45-6pm features a different oyster on rotation. Been here a few times and every bite has always been deliciously fresh. It comes with creamy horseradish, vinegar-shallot or cocktail sauces for your choosing.PJ Clarke's also offers $3 beers and 2 for 1 drink specials for their cocktail of the day, but neither is as good of a deal as the oysters. The beer comes in a mug the size of your hand.Bottom line. When you're done shopping, take a seat at the bar (oyster or regular) and order a dozen happy hour oysters. Then turn around and say hi to me, because I'm likely camped out there. Added as a MUST VISIT for my Vegas trips!I stumbled upon another Happy Hour spot on the Las Vegas Strip over at P.J. Clarke's which is daily from 3pm to 6pm.  Their headliners are their $1 freshly shucked oysters and their $1.50 burger "sliders."  You'll see why I put quotations there on sliders.I ordered a half dozen of their $1 oysters. http://bit.ly/WYjLmuIt really doesn't get any better than $1 oysters at Happy Hour.  Who cares what oyster farm they came from because they're $1 each!!   Nicely sized and pretty good!Now check out PJ's Famous Slidershttp://bit.ly/XADMzKNow you know why I put quotations.  Sliders?  Are you kidding me?  To me, sliders are little burgers that you can stuff in your mouth with one or two bites.  These suckers were huuuuge!!  Very tasty and also complimented the oysters very well.  It's almost a steal at $1.50 each.Washed it all down with a $3 Blue Moon which is another great Happy Hour deal.  So all together, half dozen oysters, two sliders, and a Blue Moon came to a whopping $12 before tax and tip.  Awesome!!!I'd say next to the Prime-time Bites at Palm Restaurant, this is probably one of the best Happy Hour deals on the Strip.  I'll definitely be back for this deal again!I came for Dana's Happy Hour UYE. Happy Hour is normally served at the raw bar or the alcohol bar from 3-6 daily. The main draw is the $1 fresh shucked oysters, but there are other treats as well. They have their other bites that are on their happy hour menu (which you can see online on their site, all various prices $6-9), 2 for 1 cocktail of the day, $3 draft beer, $6 prosecco. While I knew from signs it was at the bar, we were able to sit at a table. The BF and I chose Lagunitas IPA and Tenaya Creek Hefeweizen to drink since they were included in the $3 choices, which is nice as we only drink craft beers. We started off with a dozen oysters which were Crystal Pointe and they were delicious. Lovely, fresh and creamy. We got another 8 and those ones were a different breed, I cannot remember the name but it was double the size and a bit more briny. I know it was a Ca one. Also very fresh and good, but I preferred the first kind. They give you migionette, cocktail and horseradish. They pick the oyster for the HH, but depending on availability I guess it changes. We also got the cod bites which were really delicious. It was 3 small fish filets, but very fresh and fried to a crisp with a solid sauce. Also got a slider each which were good, but standard. They are a decent deal at $1.50 each though so I would get some to fill up if you're making a meal out of the happy hour. Service was pretty good. We got a waiter who was all worried since he found out we were Yelpers and he was the new guy who just started, but he was good and attentive so nothing to worry there. What he didn't know, he went to go find out for us.While it was happy hour and a good deal considering the quality, it racked up fast! For top notch oysters this is on the shortlist.(Yelp 100 Challenge 47/100)I organized my UYE here and got to hang out with fellow Yelpers Jade, her boyfriend Scott, Kevin, Molly, Julia, and briefly Anthony. The company was definitely great.We were here for their HH which offered $1 Oysters from 3pm-6pm, reduced prices on appetizers and beer, and buy one - get one cocktail of the day. Since it was an organized event we were able to take advantage of the HH items at a table instead of the bar. I started off with half a dozen Crystal Pointe oysters. They tasted incredibly fresh and I knew six would not be enough. Next dozen of oysters were California oysters but I don't remember the variety name. These were large, meaty and filling. Very delicious and fresh. We were provided with Tabasco  sauce in addition to mignonette, cocktail and horseradish sauces. I also had their Cod Bites (picture provided) which were $9.50 for two decently sized pieces of battered cod. It was perfectly cooked with great flavor. They also offered $1.50 sliders as well. The food and the oysters were fantastic. This is such an amazing deal for FRESH, high quality oysters. The server was friendly and accommodating. The only bummer was their cocktail of the day...it was just  vodka cranberry.REVIEW 365 OF 2013!!!YELP 365 CHALLENGE (LA Style) - Crushed and DeMELished!!!Met up with a few close friends to celebrate the GF's birthday. I've heard of the place, seen it, but never had the opportunity until now. Let's start with the restaurant itself.  I thought that the actual restaurant is clean and loved the ambiance because it wasn't packed for a Holiday weekend.  The menu is just a basic one pager with food on one side and wines on the other.  The first thing to catch my eye with PJ Clarke's menu is the sticker price.  Here, you get your choices of different steaks, lobster, fish, burgers, and a few different appetizers.  The prices are a bit high, but expected since it's on the strip and in the Forum.  This is a chophouse and their steak and seafood entrees are about what you expect to pay for on the strip.  The portions looked just about right too.  My gripe about the prices is on their other food outisde of steaks.  Everything outside of their steaks were a bit over-priced.  I wasn't in the mood for steak on this visit, so I ended up with their Cadillac Burger (Over $20).  No frills, above average taste, but not worth the price tag in my opinion.  We had tater tots, calamari, and onion strings for appetizers and felt that all three were little on the salty side.  Terri R had the Lobster Mac and I thought it was pretty good, but a touch on the salty side too.  Service here wasn't the best. From where we were at, you can hear the chef yelling at that the staff and our server wasn't the most attentive.  First, he took forever to take our order.  When our orders finally came in, he just dropped off the food without even asking if we needed anything else.  Yes sir, ketchup would be nice with our fries. Please, some dipping sauce for our onion strings would be great.  A knife would be perfect with my meal, but I guess a butter knife is all I get.  I also got an allergic reaction from my dessert (my fault).  All I needed to hinder my nauseousness was some crackers.  Our server was too busy chatting with his buds that I had to wave for another server to take care of us.  The sad part...our group was big and the tip was automatically added.  That means that our server got close to $100 for doing almost nothing. Overall, not the biggest fan of PJ's.All is not lost though.  I still had a great time with friends and the birthday girl, Terri R.  Happy Birthday to my GP!!!  If I could rate the restaurant based on the great time we all had during dinner, it would be 5+ Stars for sure.  PS:  Read the reviews...seems like Happy Hour is the way to go here.  Maybe, I will be back.  But for now, 3 stars is all you get, PJ Clarke.
Pizza Re=Wandered in the other day after leaving Echo Coffee... They haven't officially had their grand opening, but they were indeed open. Still in the process of getting menus printed and figuring it all out, but that doesn't mean they don't have the pizza down. First off - I can't tell you how glad I am that this corner is getting good tenants. I worked across the street a million years ago when it was Scottsdale Video, and I used to frequent TT Roadhouse. The corner always seemed to have so much potential other than a spot to bottom out your car crossing the intersection. I'm just happy to see some nice stuff pop up. Hopefully it'll turn the ill parts of the neighborhood around.Anyway, I only had a slice, but it was flavorful and delicious. I'm looking forward to having another. Pepperoni was spicy and the cheese and sauce were as well. It's a little on the greasy side, but that's what napkins are for. I like the decor and the owner is a nice guy. It's a little small, but it's nice and new and clean - and it's in a new building. The more pizza options in the Valley, the better.This place has good pizza, very nice comfortable atmosphere and great customer service. I went to lunch with some co-workers and had a large pepperoni and hot wings. The wings weren't anything to write home about, but what can you do? The pie had good ingredients and tasted great. I will be back.
é by José Andrés=Amazing!  A wonderful tasting menu of Chef Andrés' avant garde Spanish cuisine.  We were served 20 small bites and 5 wines over approximately 2.5 hours.  My favorites were the Apple "Brazo de Gitano", José Taco, Bocata de "Calamares" and my slice of the "Whole Lobe of Foie Gras Baked in Sea Salt"It's not cheap - $250 plus tax/person - but this price includes food, wine AND gratuity.  They have two seating per night at 5:30 and 8:30, and only 8 diners per seating so the experience/service is unmatched.  And while I don't make enough money to call anything 250 bucks an absolute steal, compared to many other high-end restaurants in Vegas I wouldn't hesitate to call é a bargain.If all you care about is getting as full as possible for as little cash as possible, the Cosmopolitan Hotel has a wonderful buffet one floor down which I'm sure you'll enjoy more.  If you love interesting, innovative, delicious food, and are willing to pay for some superior ingredients and service, é is an experience that shouldn't be missed.One more thing... reservations are only available by e-mailing a not-so-secret anymore address - reserve@ebyjoseandres.comI'm very torn about our experience at the E Bar, as its called.  On one hand, the experience was ridiculously amazing; it is nice being diners #140 and 141(since the place has opened).  But on the other hand, the food was not. It's challenging to come up with an appropriate star rating to balance out the two.  It's also hard since the price was $250 plus tax/per person.  As the previous reviewer mentioned, that price does include food, wine, gratuity, and an awesome experience.  I keep asking myself if it was worth it...I'm not sure that it is.The evening was a special one though.  We arrived, checked in at the reservation desk and were waiting to be seated for the 8:30 seating.  One of our 'hosts' came to us, letting us know that we would need to wait for a bit, as the previous seating was wrapping up and they were preparing for our seating.  She would like to know if I would like a glass of cava while I'm waiting.  But of course!  So we're chilling in the Cosmopolitan's fun little sitting area (with billiards, checkers, funky chairs, etc.) enjoying some cava while we wait.  As we're finally seated, much of the busy Jaleo watches the 8 of us as we walk into the private E room.  There are 8 of us seated, with 5 people making sure our evening went smoothly.Anthony, our specific server, was funny, helpful, and hooked up the wine.  Frankly, I didn't care for most of the wine as it was incredibly sweet.  In fact, most of the dishes had more of a sweet element to them rather than salty or savory, which was what I was looking for.  All dishes were served at one time by the two chefs, so we needed to coordinate bathroom breaks over the 2.5 hour meal.  When it was an appropriate time to go, Anthony walked me all the way to the restroom; what a gentleman!Some of the highlights of the evening food wise were the Beet Jewelry (salty, crispy, gold-dusted--yum!), caramelized pork rinds (there's nothing like making chicharrones high class!! haha), the smoky oysters in escabeche, secreto of iberico, and, the star of the night really, the Jose Taco and artichoke with caviar.  The Jose Taco was a lovely slice of Jamon Iberico de Bellota with a dollop of caviar on top, to be rolled like a taco (really a taquito, i think).  YUMYUM!!!  And the roasted baby artichoke with caviar and quail egg inside. Divine!  I would like ten more of those please, rather than some of the flowery, fruity dishes we were given.The most disheartening thing of the night (other than the bill, haha) was the Whole Lobe of Foie Gras baked in Salt.  I love Foie Gras, seriously.  They showed us this beautiful lobe that has been crusted in tantalizing sea salt and baked.  I was very excited.  We were all given our own slices; they were sitting there, glistening in the plate, waiting to be devoured.  Then they poured an orange juice type sauce on them.  Travesty!!! It ruined the Foie Gras.  The texture was mushy and all I tasted was juice.  Why, Jose?! Why?!I know this review reads a bit like a schizophrenic's journal, but this is how I feel about E by Jose.  The experience was once in a lifetime and the staff could not have been more accommodating.  But the food was, overall, a disappointment, especially for the price.  Bottom line: I guess it's both a yay and a nay.José Andrés has brought umami back. But, he's not only brought it back, he's redefined it. Think of it as umami 2.0. With 20 mouthwatering courses, his avant garde brand of sweet and savory cuisine will slap your taste buds around like a night with Ike Turner and Chris Brown. This is dinner theater at it's best. It's a 2.5+ hour interactive show in a private room located within Jaleo. After checking in at the hostess stand we were seated at a table in Jaleo and brought complimentary glasses of cava while the previous seating finished (There are two seatings of 8 per night at é at 5:30 and 8:30). When ready, we were escorted to the back and entered a space beautifully designed by the Rockwell Group and Spanish designer Juli Capella. Two of the walls are lined with card catalogs with several drawers open and holding artifacts that tie into memories from José's past. It's an intriguing space that's equal parts Dali, Pan's Labyrinth, and Alice In Wonderland.In the center of the room is an 8 seat bar where the chefs create and plate the evening's meal. Much of the actual "cooking" is performed out of site in the Jaleo kitchen but the plating is done in front of the diners at the bar. Throughout the evening there was plenty of interaction with the chef's and we were encouraged to ask questions and learn more about the chefs and dishes. It was cool to see them at work. Who knew tweezers and pipettes were such important kitchen tools? Each dish was a work of art... a really delicious work of art.I'm not articulate enough to describe how creative or tasty each dish was. So if you want a complete breakdown of every course you're better off reading this guy's review: http://www.kevineats.com/2011/01/e-by-jose-andres-las-vegas-nv.htmlBut, here are a few notable dishes that I loved:- Beet jewelry. Playful, crunchy and delicious. I never thought beets could be so amazing.- Membrillo and la serena cone. A flaky cone filled with a creamy, tangy sheep's milk cheese.- Bocata de Calamares. An homage to the calamari sandwiches Andrés used to eat on the beach, this sammie had uni in place of calamari and it was delicate, briny masterpiece.- Cigala with Roses. Typically, I hate foams because they add little to dishes. But here, it added a noticable texture and flavor to the lobster.- Secreto of Ibérico Pork. The best dish of the night. The best piece of pork I've ever tasted. This was the pig equivalent of A5 kobe beef. Amazing!- Frozen Apricot Coulant. Similar to a chocolate lava cake in that you cut it open and liquid oozes out. It's a delicious and unique fruity dessert.- 25 Second Bizcocho. The best microwaved food ever. It had the texture of a sponge cake and had a creamy filling.Honestly, I could probably list a few more dishes that I loved. There wasn't a *bad* dish all night, but the weakest were the two they had to supplement because of my apple allergy. I can't fault them for that.The service was exceptional. Truly the best service I've ever experienced. There were two hosts (and I say hosts because dining at é is like dining in their home), Anthony and Stephanie, who were able to accommodate dietary/allergic restrictions, serve and clear dishes throughout the night and answer any question we had. It was professional but not stuffy. They're also not shy about keeping your glasses full. Wine was included in the price and Anthony and Stephanie were generous with the pours all night. It was like dining with an open bar.The price for the meal, as others have mentioned, is $250 per person. That includes wine, gratuity, and tax. In order to get reservations you have to email them. It's best to plan ahead and email them at least a month before you'd like to dine there. If you're a local, the more flexible you are with your dates (a weeknight instead of dining on a weekend) might make it easier for you to get in. For out of towners, make sure you tell them the dates you'll be in town and they'll try to fit you in. For me, after I initially emailed them I got an automated response right away followed by a dining reservation a couple weeks later.In the end, é was the most entertaining and amazing dining experience, although not necessarily the *best* meal ever. But, I'd put it in the top 3 that I've had. It's pricey but worth it for a once in a lifetime experience and a peek inside the mind and food memories of José Andrés.Everything about my experience at E by Jose Andres was Five Star.  From the Golden Ticket I received in the mail the day before my trip, to the last bite of Saffron scented Chocolate at the end of the evening made this one of the best Food Evenings of my life.My Golden Ticket promised, "Culinary delights that you have not imagined."  E delivered on that promise and  more!  On arrival, I was given a glass of Cava while I waited to be escorted to the private dining area that is E.  I don't usually comment much on decor, but I was struck by the intimacy and personal nature of the space.  I can imagine Chef Andres has a study designed in the same manner.  I also appreciate the fact that the communal seating has wheelchair accessible seats cut into the bar.  It allowed me to have the  same experience as the other diners. Now onto the food itself:1) Frozen Sangria with Grilled Strawberries. Made table side with Liquid Nitrogen, the Sangria had all the flavor of its liquid cousin, but provided an interesting temperature contrast to the Caramelized Strawberries.2) Spanish Clavel. Hardest item to describe. An  amazingly light bite with a thin wafer made from yogurt and flavored with a Spanish Flower. Vague enough?3)Beet Jewelry. Rings of dehydrated beet, dusted with Gold.  So much flavor in such a small bite.4)Caramelized Pork Rinds. Best. Pork Rinds. Ever.  Salty, Sweet, Spicy, Crunchy goodness!5) Apple "Brazo de Gitano". An Apple flavored Sponge Cylinder filled with a bleu cheese espuma.  Another great combination of flavors and textures.6)Jose Taco. A thin rectangle of Iberico Ham with a dollop of sustainable Caviar. I expected this to be salty beyond belief, but there was a sweetness to the caviar that made this one of my favorite bites of the night.7)Artichoke with Caviar and Quails Egg. Again, the interplay of tastes and textures was amazing. Earthiness from the Artichoke. Richness from the Egg. Sweet and Salty from the Caviar. Another great bite and I am not a big fan of caviar.8)Membrillo with La Serena Cone.  My least favorite item of the night. Goat Cheese and Quince Paste.9)Bocata De Calamares.  A tiny tiny version of a Lobster Roll using Uni as the protein.  This was so good they could start a sandwich shop with a larger version!10)Ajo Blanco. Modern version of a Spanish soup made from Almonds and Garlic. The Almond Soup was poured over a bowl with several different components including Sliced Almonds, Ground Almonds, Microgreens, Grapes and a Granita ( I can't remember what it was).  This was much mellower than the preceding dishes.  That is not a bad thing! In a multi Course event like this I find that sometimes my taste buds need a rest!11)Cigala with Roses.  Perfectly cooked Langoustine with a floral note from a Rose flavored foam.12)Smoky Oysters in Escabeche. The Oysters were smoked in a little globe in front of us.  What actually made these wonderful was the accompanying Onion Confit and Toasted Honey Air.13)Roasted Turbot with Black Garlic. The fish was the star but The Black Garlic added its intense sweetness and pungent undertones.14)Foie Gras Baked in Salt.  Best Foie Ever. The salt dome it was baked under gave  it an amazing texture.  A wonderfully tart Citrus Sauce cut the richness of the dish.15)Secreto of Iberico Pork.  A rarely used cut from behind a Pig's Shoulder Blade was served with Chanterelle Mushrooms and Black Truffle.  This was full of Earthy, Rich, Meaty, Porky Flavor.   It had a texture that was far from soft, But  worked with the rustic nature of the dish.16)Orange Pith Puree with La Serena. That wonderful Goat cheese reappeared in the first Dessert Course.17)Frozen Apricot Coulant.  Sort of a fruit version of a molten chocolate cake. This time the outside is an Apricot Ice and the center is an Apricot liquid.  Very light and refreshing!18)Apples and Red Wine "Freddy Giradet".  Vanilla Bean Ice Cream with Red Wine Glazed Apple and Apple Spherifications. Another fun and inventive course that also tasted great.19)25 Second Bizcocho. A light, airy Citrusy Angel Food cake actually made in a Microwave. 20)Chocolates.  Saffron Scented and Chocolate "Air" brought the evening to a sweet end.We had several spirits that enhanced our experience.  With the first few items we had a Pastrana Manzanilla Sherry. It was clean, delicate and slightly yeasty.  It went very well with our first few courses.Next up was actually a beer. Estrella Damme Inedit. I am not a beer drinker but  It actually went very well with our fried oilier items.Third was 2008 Mengoba Godello y Dona Blanca Bierzo. Another very light wine that kind of got lost with all the flavors of the food.Next was a 2009 Guimero Mencia Ribiero Sacra. This went great with the Foie and Pork.We finished with a classic 1982 Don Pedro Ximenes Sherry. Dessert in a glass.Service was outstanding and as I mentioned before, they are extremely wheelchair friendly.Yo! To all you legit foodies in the house.  This place is da bomb!Ok, now that I have your attention with my lame ass hook, seriously, you people need to check this out.  $250/person.  Not stuffy at all.  A ton of fun.  If you really do truly love inventive food (picky eaters opt out) then you will LOVE this. And at $250 per person including tax, alcohol, and gratuity (although you will want to tip more when you are done) it is such a bargain!  Plus, for people who don't drink, the chefs and servers say that the non-alcoholic offerings are extremely inventive.  They seem quite eager to serve them.  I think they just need advance notice.The process: First, send an email to reserve@ebyjoseandres.com with a variety of dates and times that you would like to go.  Give a bunch of choices.  There are only 8 seats, so keep that in mind.Next, wait for confirmation.  If you are lucky, you will get a reservation and they will ask for more details including any allergies and if there are any non-drinkers.  Eventually, you will get golden tickets in the mail and a very nice note. (Yes, snail mail.)  Yay!  Very Willy Wonka.Next, show up at Jaleo at the Cosmopolitan promptly.  Anthony (one of your servers) will be waiting at the hostess stand and will psychically know who you are.  Especially if you are the dope with the golden ticket in your hand and a stupid grin on your face.Next, enjoy some cava (a variety of sparkling wine) at the bar and meet your foodie companions.  At your respective reservation time (5:30pm and 8:30pm are the choices), you will be escorted to an exquisitely designed room separate from the rest of the restaurant where three chefs and two servers will prepare and serve the best food in the world right in front of your eyes.  It's essentially a 3-hour conversation about food, while you pig out.  And, yes, there is stripper dust involved.  http://eat.c-bas.com/2011/03/14/e-by-jose-andres/  But it's all good. :)The other reviews and all the blogs go through all the courses in better detail than I ever could.  For example, see http://www.kevineats.com/2011/01/e-by-jose-andres-las-vegas-nv.html and the link above. Just let me say that this is a best meal I have ever had and I've been to Guy Savoy, Joel Robuchon/L'Atelier, Masa (NYC), French Laundry, Per Se, Le Bernardin... need I go on.  I'm a food and service snob (when I expect quality), and this is the best.  I actually closed my eyes in bliss during many of the courses.  The servers, Anthony and Stephanie, are fabulous. The chefs, Edwin, Brett, and Johannes, are also terrific.  Very knowledgeable and so willing to share that knowledge.  It's so much fun and we made some new foodie friends.  What's better than that?WOW!  One of the top three restaurant meals I have ever had.  Food: At E, I had the best dish I have ever eaten, crispy chicken skin in escabeche(chicken skin and chicken oyster).  My other favorite dishes of the night were the mini brioche street food sandwich that contained uni and the secreto of Iberico pork.  At most tasting menus, there are a number of dishes that stand out negatively.   At E, I enjoyed every single dish!       Service: Two servers provide unpretentious, friendly, professional, and flawless service to the eight diners per seating at E.  In addition, the chefs prepare food in front of the diner seating and explain the dishes as they are served.Reservations: email reserve@ebyjoseandres.com with some dates you are available and they will get back to you.  I was lucky enough to email at the beginning of the week and got a reservation for 2 later in the week!Cost: They recently changed their menu so food is 160/person.   Drink pairings are around 100, and non-alcoholic drink pairing are around 50.  My dinner for two with drinks was around 650 after tax and gratuity.Pictures: They let you take camera photos as long as you don't use a flash.Pros: Excellent service, interesting presentations, great foodCons: Expensive ($160 (food) + $120 (drinks pairings) per person)If you're down for foodie adventures and you're willing to spend some money for great food and service, you should check this place out.First of all, you have to make a reservation via email (i.e. reserver@ebyjoseandres.com) up to a month in advance.  When it gets close to your reservation date, you get mailed golden tickets (a la Willy Wonka style).On the day of your reservation, you actually dine in a small room with 8 seats.  All dishes are prepared in front of you.Here are some notable dishes:Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche - Perfectly seasoned chicken skin and chicken oysterUni slider - I love uni. You should too.Secreto of Iberico pork - It's like the filet mignon of pork. Moist fatty deliciousnessOverall, great experience.  Our servers and the chefs were super nice and willing to answer any questions that diners might have.  The only issue is the food is a little pricey for my tastes.However, if you're looking to celebrate a special occasion and want to witness molecular gastronomy in person, give this place a try.This was one of the best food evenings I have ever spent.  I made my reservation through their process about a month ago.  While I originally requested the 5:30 seating, there was a singleton space for the 8:30 so I went for it.I showed up about 8:05 and handed my gold ticket to them.  I was then escorted to the bar where I had some ice water and started to meet my dining mates for the evening - Greg and Lindsey from Glasgow, Scotland.At about 8:40, we were escorted into the separate dining area that has a horseshoe shaped table with 8 seats.  Behind the table was the staff ready to greet us, tell us a few rules, and encourage us to ask questions about anything.  Then the dinner started.Over the next three hours, the staff made some of the most creative, tasty, and beautifully plated dishes I have experienced.  Since the room seats 8 people only, generally four servers each took 2 plates so all 8 of us were served in unison.  I had the non-alcohol drink paring which gave me a chance to have spirit-like drinks along with the other diners.  And in two instances, my food or drink was not laced with alcohol but with lemonade or some other substitute.Each of the 20+ courses was explained.  We often had questions about technique, ingredients, or other matters.  One of the chefs came out of the kitchen to explain the red mushroom we enjoyed and explained why it was red and whence it came.The staff is amazing.  They are friendly, always smiling, and always enjoying what they do.  I really felt that I was a valued visitor.The room - oh it's quite different.  Two walls are lined with card catalog boxes to represent the knowledge Andrés has built up in his mind over the years.  There's a bustier which know one explained on the wall and a ladder with high heels on the rungs.  Very creative and innovative!Midnight was almost upon us as we finished the dessert courses.  We then signed the guest book - I was diner #1693.  I then passed the book to Lindsey to sign and so we went around the table.I recommend this to anyone who wants to try something very different and wants to find out about molecular gastronomy.  It was truly a very delicious and memorable evening.  All the staff at é made it outstanding with food and service!Dammit, e', you suck. Besides the fact that I still don't know how to pronounce you, you've ruined me. You've ruined any five star rating I could possibly give because none of them will really be able to compete. Yes, this includes the five stars I gave to Popeye's whose chicken is dabombandyoucanallsuckitifyoudisagreebecauseIvebeenknowntoeatanentire10pieceboxinasinglesittingbitches.Even then, five stars to Popeye'e and five stars to e'? That doesn't seem quite right. Six stars to e'? Wait a sec. Ten piece box of spicy chicken for $8.99? 20 course meal at e' for....a mortgage payment?OK, I guess things equal out in the end.Yeah, this isn't an everyday kind of meal place. It's a special occasion, once-in-blue-moon-and-if-that-moon-were-rich-and-crapped-gold-in-your-lap kind of place. We didn't care though. It was my birthday and my wife wanted to see me happy. She sure enough saw me grin through the foodiest douchebaggiest experience of both of our lives and my wife rules.I won't go into too many details since most Yelpers have repeated them ad nauseum. My dishes were pretty similar to most others with the exception of the ever-changing "Catch of the Day." (Ours was turbot for the record.)The chicken skin was memorable. The secreto of iberico ham rave-worthy. But it was the "chickpea" stew that made me actually swear a series of expletives into my bowl. I believe I was quoting the celebrated poet Lord Byron when I muttered into my bowl, "You've got to be fucking kidding me" and "I'd eat this shit off of Bin Laden's bloated, decaying corpse."There are only eight seats, sidled up to a high-top bar. I think that a diner's experience would depend heavily on their surrounding companions. Fortunately, after a few courses (and some flowing wine), we all warmed up to one another. Jose Andres is famous for encouraging diners to play with their food and play we did. Observations were made and notes were shared. "What did you think of this?" and "Could you taste the jasmine in the foam? So did I!" One of us had the vegetarian option and she described in detail her obviously different experience. My glutarded wife requested the gluten-free option and she did the same for the others. I and one other had sprung for the full alcohol pairing, but after the ninth pairing, what seemed to us a cogent and eloquent discourse in which we deconstructed every layer, aroma, and lovingly created component for our dining companions was most likely, when I think back on it, a couple of guys who sounded like the Hulk and Cookie Monster trying to read a restaurant review out of Parade magazine. None of us cared though because we had a ball. Yes, your individual experiences may vary, so I hope for your sake, you get a fun group.The service was professional and precise. The staff introduced each meal and fielded questions. They were upfront when needed, stayed in the background when not.A few final notes: 1) You get to take home a menu, which answers the question, "How do all these Yelpers remember what they ate to put in their reviews?" 2) You also get to keep your golden ticket. We actually never received ours in the mail, but they made sure we walked away with a couple. 3) the coffee is not part of the meal. You'll be charged for it. Nothing in Vegas is free, yo. Stupid coffee. 4) If you're on an iPhone, good luck checking in. Or doing anything on that phone for that matter. This restaurant exists in an AT&T blackhole. If you're meeting friends afterwards, make sure your plans are well-defined beforehand. 5) We never got to sign the guest book. In fact, this last note is my only gripe in an otherwise perfect night. Guestbook, man, guestbook! How can I prove I was there?! I mean, other than the pictures. And receipt. Oh and the menus and golden ticket.All right, just forget I said anything.We had reservations for Friday Feb 10th. We had followed all the rules for getting the reservation (emailed at midnight on Jan. 10th). When we were told we had the reservation a few days later we immediately sent in the confirmation form with credit card info.  All was set. Then on January 21st we received an email saying that our dinner reservation happens to fall on "Valentine's Weekend" so they are going to charge an additional $100 per person. And were we okay with that? So to recap: we followed their rules, made the reservation and then they decided to just change the rules. We're not naive--they will of course easily fill the spot at the new price ($250 per person before the $155 per person wine service.) so essentially they don't have to care whether we say yes or no. There's a line long of folks eager to take our place.But that doesn't make it okay.  It is unconscionable to treat people like this.  I realize this is Vegas and money is all that talks. But on some level doesn't this scream about the lack of professionalism? Jose Andres is a great chef, but he should be ashamed of the business culture he has given his name to. We canceled. No meal, no matter how delicious can make up for being treated with such indifference.A tour de force of Spanish cuisine.  A meal at E is a dining experience capturing the excitement and joy of discovery through food and conversation.  This exclusive restaurant within a restaurant is a tapas bar on steroids.  Modernist cuisine at its finest as molecular gastronomy collides with traditional techniques.  This is one of the greatest foodie adventures bar none.There is no menu.  The offerings change with the seasons.  Unfortunately, the incredible salt crusted foie from the fall of 2011 is not a part of the current winter 2012 offering.  All good.  The ingredients are incredible.  From selections of sublime, umame packed cured ham to the sweet earthiness of roasted Iberico pork to the salty brininess of quality caviar everything works to create flavor explosions.Sure, every course may not be to your liking but with the huge number of courses, you are sure to find something you can't live without.  The progression of dishes is very bold.  Courses compete with one another, with each making a bolder statement than the last.  Utterly incredible.  Desert lovers rejoice, the meal ends with multiple deserts.  The only way to describe them is WOW!Opt for the wine pairing.  The selections tie the meal together perfectly.  The entire evening is engaging.  You watch the chefs prepare and plate the majority of dishes right in front of you.  Conversation between the chefs and your fellow guest is encouraged.  It is an extremely social meal.  Just wait until you start sharing wine from the porron.  Unintentionally missing your mouth and pouring wine on your face and down your neck is a real ice breaker.There is only one way to make a reservation at E, through email.  Don't bother calling the Cosmo.  They can't help you.  Send an email request to reserve@ebyjoseandres.com with the number of your party (not to exceed eight), and a range of dates and times.  A restaurant manager will respond and ask about any food allergies and dietary restrictions.  If your restrictions can be met and if there are openings, your invitation will be confirmed.  You will receive your golden tickets via SNAIL MAIL.  Bring them with you.Probably the best $250 you will spend at a top restaurant anywhere.An open mind and open heart?  You will have the time of your life.  Highly recommended!WALLAH saved the best review for last as I catch up on writing reviews tonight!I'm Customer #3339! Yes, each guest that dines at this restaurant gets their own number.  Makes you feel kinda special I guess.We got lucky with getting reservations here exactly a month in advance so it must've been meant to be :-)  Each seating only seats 8 guests; 2 seatings a night. I've been to Alinea in Chicago few years ago so I knew what to expect.  I think I may have actually enjoyed e by Jose Andres a slight more maybe because it was more interactive and intimate experience because you sit in a curved table watching the chefs semi-prepare your meals. The amount of prep work the chefs had to do to orchestrate the 20+ courses was quite remarkable.  The details and intricacy of each dish was impressive. (astericks tagged next to dishes I really enjoyed)        1. Rebujito - alcoholic drink they stirred up and topped with foam reminded me of this drink I had at the Lobby Lounge at the Modern (formerly called Edition) hotel in Hawaii.         2. Spanish "Clavel" - beautifully shaped into a flower and served in the palm of Jose Andre's hand. Tasted like candy        3. Beet Jewelry - they said to eat it off your pinky finger like a ring. Dusted with gold. Tasted like beet chips with a savory sweet taste. *        4. Caramelized Pork Rinds - ehhh wasn't too into this        5. Apple "Brazo de Gitano" - light airy texture and sweet. we were confused why it seemed like it was starting out with "dessert" like courses.       6. Nitro Almond Cup - wow, this was genius. It looked like half an egg shell with caviar and cream in it. The chef said to eat it quick because it will melt so I put the whole thing in my mouth. Quite a surprise. **       7. Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche - not a chicken skin fan but this was quite delicious. tender chicken on crispy skin topped with foam.       8.  Jose Taco - caviar wrapped in proscuitto - nothing special, it was as you could imagine.       9. Olivia Sferica Ferran Adria - olive juice in a bubble so it pops in your mouth and tastes like an olive. they process to make this sounded quite intricate.       10.  Bocata de Calamares - similar to the sandwich but of course with a twist. It had a huge piece of sweet uni from Santa Barbara. **      11. Cava Sangria - a SHOT of alcohol in the same bubble like thing as the olive.  whew, woke me up!      12. Artichoke "puree" with Vanilla - it looked like sato imo (small japanese mountain potatoes) but it was little artichokes. never had anything like that. It was in a nice dark sauce with lemon foam dressed on the side.        13.  Lobster with citrus and jasmine foam - MY FAVORITE! I love lobster and jasmine so pairing the two was heaven. The dish was beautifully plated with citrus segments.**      14.   Chickpea stew with Iberico Ham - this was a pretty dish you just wanted to just stare at and not eat. This was a favorite amongst the entire table. It was like a delicate cream stew with garbanzo dumpling like things.       15. Turbot with bone marrow - the moist white fish had a crispy skin and was complimented well with grounded coffee grinds on the side. The chef was raving about the bone marrow filled pockets but it was nothing special for me.      16. Rosemary wild mushrooms in Papillote - wrapped in a cellophane bag, this was like a mushroom soup with scents of rosemary, then topped with foam again.  One of the guest had a substitute of veal cheeks since he doesn't like mushrooms so we were all quite envious of that dish.       17.  Secreto of Iberico pork with squid - loved the pork and sauce. This dish once again topped with some green vegetable foam. *      Still not over yet....can't forget about the desserts!!!     18.  Orange Pith Puree La Serena - spooned goat cheese plated with sauces and thin piece of bread.      19. Flan - beautifully plated with four small pieces of flan and flowers and mint with shaved ice in the middle drizzled with caramel. I enjoyed watching them making this one.*     20. Pan Con Chocolate - was the least attractive dish but what a treat, my favorite dessert course. top looked like it was sprinkled with dirt but it was chocolate cake that melts in your mouth. Layers underneath had crunch which gave it texture to the creaminess of the dessert.**     21. "Arroz Con Leche" - arroz con leche in a cone made with melted sugar, kicks of citrus.*     22. 25 second Bizcocho - they said it took only 25 seconds to make this cake like volcano in the microwave. similar to a chiffon cake, very light. Dusted with gold.    23. Fizzy paper - crispy paper like candy but wakes you up with the strong citrus flavors.    24. "Air" Chocolate - just like the name, airy chocolate, one that was bitter dark and the other yogurt flavored.Yes we felt like we ate enough food that could last a week in our tummies but the memories would last for a long time.This is a very very expensive piece of culinary performance art. Dinner for 4 with two alcohol pairings and two non-alcohol pairings came to $2,000. Be prepared for that because the prices were very vague before actually getting the bill.The food was more unique and interesting than delicious. The drinks piled up on each other so instead of being paired they became muddled together over 3-4 of the courses. Yes, the courses! 24 of them actually. Many just a single bite.This should have been a 3-4 hour experience but was crammed into 2 hours and 15 minutes because they have to fit a second seating in. Seatings are at 5:30 and 8:30.We have had the tasting menus with paired wines for each diner at Picasso at the Bellagio and Joel Robuchon at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The food, the taste, the time given to enjoy and savor, the opportunity to compete the course and accompanying drink really were perfect. Dinner at each was all of four hours. You were not rushed and each distinct presentation were really outstanding. When the course and drink were completely finished, we had time to appreciate what we just enjoyed before the next course and pairing came. Dinner for 2 at Picasso was $600. and $800. at Joel Robuchon. We walked out without any doubt that it was worth the money. An obscene amount in today's world but extremely memorable.To be honest, I was disappointed in é by José Andrés. The presentation was really great but not as engaging as it could've been. The chefs could barely be heard and the courses were not really explained in a manner that you felt you could grasp. We had to ask over and over what it was that was being presented. We felt rushed and the courses came too quickly. If we had 4 hours, maybe the experience would have been savored more. Instead it was a jumble and a muddle of tastes and drinks. I really did not feel that the meal was worth half of what we paid mostly because of the timing.If you've had some of the chef's tasting menus at the other stellar places in Las Vegas, then try this. If not, it would not be at the top of my short list due to the excessive cost and the rushed feeling.On making reservations:It can be ambiguous and quite a challenge. It took 2 trips to Vegas for the stars to finally align for me to finally be able to get in. They have 2 seating a night and they seat about 10 people inside a separate room in Jaleo at the Cosmopolitan. You must email them exactly one month in advance at midnight Vegas time, which means if you are traveling from the east coast set up an email rule to send your email at 3:01AM. Also have several dates and times that you are available to increase your chances of getting in.On the dining experience:I dined here on a Sunday evening after a monster weekend in Vegas. This is definitely a social experience with the other diners sitting around the bar style seating. I felt just as comfortable dining here solo as I would with a date. About half the group were actually solo diners. Our group was young, funny, and very social. Don't feel pressured to do the wine pairing, although I heard it was excellent only 2 or 3 of the diners in our group did it. Plus we were greeted with a glass of champagne when we sat regardless of whether you ordered the wine pairing and one of the dishes was, as I would describe it, a large sangria caviar. So there is enough alcohol served if you wanted to drink light.On the show:The show here is the two chefs in action. Most of the dishes have been prepared somewhat in advance, but they are assembled and discussed right in front of your eyes. Some of the dishes came off like alchemy. Feel free to ask any questions you want, they are happy to discuss the dishes in detail. The 2 chefs/wizards said it takes 36 man hours to prepare for each service.Normally I would go into detail about each dish but there were just too many and you don't have a choice in what you eat. You just get to try everything. The dishes ranged from good to amazing. I've been to a handful of places that I would say had better food, but the presentation and creativity at work here is unmatched. On my visit it cost $199 + tax, I was told there was no tipping even after insisting. If you are interested or curious about molecular gastronomy then it is worth the visit. If like me the high price is tough to swallow, do what I did, look at it as a great Vegas show instead of a dinner you won't regret it.*Posted are a picture of the golden ticket you get when you make a reservation, their menu you get to take home, and a few of the dishes.OMFG!This was by far the most expensive and memorable meal of my life. My wife and I dined here about two months ago. We shared the drink pairing. Two meals and one drink pairing came to $666. Though dare I say it, it was TOTALLY worth it.I love cooking and trying new foods. If you do, too, this is totally the place for you. You will love it. If you're not a foodie and not into unique cooking techniques, you'll probably find it overpriced and won't fully appreciate it. That being said, it was the perfect place for me.There were four couples in our sitting. None of us knew each other, but we all seemed to be the same basic type. Foodies who make pretty good money but aren't exactly rich who are willing to pay for a one-of-a-kind once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.We all LOVED our food. In fact, at one point the chefs left to get something from the kitchen and one of the guys said, "Good, they're gone. Now we can lick our plates." We all chuckled but all highly considered it. No one wanted to waste one single drop of deliciousness.I would say my favorite course was the chickpea soup with iberico pork. The "chickpeas" were filled with iberico pork and chickpea broth. It was amazing. I had never had iberico pork and instantly fell in love.I am not a fan of desserts and there were quite a few served. However, I have to admit that I liked every single one of them. My favorite involved olive oil, cocoa powder and mascarpone or something similar. We were instructed to drag our spoons through the olive oil and into the cocoa powder. Sounded weird but WOW!My wife is a connoisseur of flan and said that hands down e's was the best she had ever had. I don't care for flan, but I had to agree this flan was delish! I could go on and on about every single course. But lots of people have already done that, and it would be very hard to truly do any of the courses justice.Aside from the food itself, the other awesome aspect was being able to watch the creation and plating of many of the courses. Everything was done with such care and perfection. The chefs used droppers and tweezers to carefully add the most delicate items. I was in awe throughout the whole dinner and was envious of the chefs who get to work with such great ingredients every day.About midway through the dinner, the chefs told us to look behind us. When we did, we saw none other than Jose' Andres. He was in town for Uncork'd and stopped in for a moment to see how we were all doing. We all expressed our amazement at everything we had tried thus far.When we finished our meal, I saw Jose' sitting at one of the tables in Jaleo. I asked one of the waiters if it would be okay for me to go up to him and ask for his autograph. He said that Jose' was being interviewed by a food magazine but should be done shortly and I could wait at the bar and approach him once he was done. I did so, and once his interview was over I was able to catch him before he went back into the kitchen. He autographed my menu and my wife took a picture of us. The people from the food magazine were still around and their photographer snapped a few pics too. It was a perfect ending to a perfect night.I mentioned earlier that this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. However, I can't imagine never going back. Maybe I should change that to a once every 5 years event. Or if I get a big raise, maybe once a year. Even my wife who usually gets upset when we go to higher-priced places as she thinks it's not worth it (and that's with a bill about 1/6 of e'), said that the meal was totally worth it.The tragedy of e' is that after my meal here, my body will turn the food that I ate into poop. This is a shame and it is insulting to the brilliance of the food that any part of it would wind up in a toilet(albeit in a severely altered form). I like to think that the food served at e' is not excreted like a typical sandwich, but it is instead ascended to a higher plane of existence somewhere in my soul. Yeah. That makes me feel better.e' is an incomparable dining experience that trumps anything I've had in Las Vegas. The experience is part meal and part show, where the chef will explain and answer questions regarding the preparation of each bite. Highlights include the turbot, chickpea soup, and assorted insane desserts. Some bites didn't blow me away(reduced olive) but I don't care because when something at e' shines, it makes you question everything you've been eating so far in your previously wretched culinary existence.The room is intimate without being claustrophobic and is decorated in an interesting way, with random oddities placed upon walls set to look like library drawers.So save up some money at your job, start a pyramid scheme, kill a hooker, cook meth, or win the lottery. Do whatever it takes to afford a nice meal at e'. Don't think of it as a super expensive meal - Think of it as a trip to a super expensive theme park where you get to eat some rare and delicious foods.One of the most intimate and unique dining experiences you will ever experience in Sin City!Having tried most of the fine dining restaurants in Vegas, I thought i'd seen it all til i was pleasantly surprised with a shiny golden ticket in the mail!When that fateful evening arrived on Saturday October 13th, I was like Charlie waiting in eager anticipation to finally visit Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.  Truth be told, I wasn't quite sure what was in store for me but i had a feeling it would be something good! In fact, as soon as we stepped into Jaleo, we were cordially seated at the bar and kindly given the drink menu for the evening on a handy iPad! Since I was feeling celebratory, i decided on the wine pairing with my meal and  as soon as our server found out it was my birthday, he gave us a glass of cava on the house! Now that's service IMO! After that, we were escorted to a dimly lit and intimate private room with a semicircular bar surrounded by wooden card catalogs housing Jose Andre's eclectic tchotchkes, which he apparently collected from his travels around the world.  At this time, the chef introduced himself and proceeded with a brief explanation of the evening's events.  Without a moment to spare, the chef and his skilled staff worked feverishly on the first dish. Liquid nitrogen began to billow over the counter and within moments, we were presented with beautiful bite size pieces of food art. About 20 or more dishes followed in succession, each skillfully crafted to engage and amaze!I must admit, I arrived with high expectations, but the chef and staff at é definitely did not disappoint. It was a truly unforgettable experience that was filled with intrigue and spectacle. An intimate showcase inspired by traditional Spanish dishes, masterfully executed by the talented chef and staff. é is bar none one of the most interesting and enjoyable dining experiences I've ever had in Vegas! With that said, it's an experience you should make when visiting the city because like magic, it could soon disappear!Happy Eats!I count my lucky stars that I am so fortunate to be able to finally eat at é by José Andrés.  It was a special occasion and we (surprisingly my husband included because he usually prefers cheap Chinese food over frou frou stuff) both thoroughly enjoyed the EXPERIENCE.  It was a precisely choreographed dance to put together these pieces of food, a play on textures, temperatures and flavors.  It was an experience with the art of food, and I'm not saying it with any disdain for snobbiness this time.  There were 24 morsels of delicious food - all incredibly creative.The short and sweet version: Precision.  Perfectly choreographed and executed.  Juxtaposition of Flavors and Textures.  Adjectives that come to mind:  Fragrant.  Whimsical.  Airy.  Crunchy.  Ice Cold.  Salty and Sweet.  Warm.  Fluffy.  Umami.  Crumbly.1.  Rebujito - our starting cocktail smelled like fragrant roses.  2.  Truffle Cotton Candy - whimsical, fluffy with the aroma of truffle.  3.  Idiazabal "Macaron" - delightfully crunchy with a cheesy filling4.  Apple "Brazo De Gitano" - Airy on the outside, creamy blue cheese "espuma" on the inside5.  Seta Suprise - Creamy 'shrooms6.  Nitro Almond Cup - NITROGEN cold (not just ice cold) and smooth on the outside, creamy/briny/salty caviar on the inside.7.  Barquillo - crunchy shell, aromatic Truffle and anchovy foam8.  Almejas Al Natural - spherical globules encased with the essence of oyster 9.  Bocatade Bacalao - warm, buttery brioche, savory cod, umami-licious?10. Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche - extra crispy chicken skin + foam11. Cava Sangria - Pop!  globule of sangria 12. Artichoke "Puree" with vanilla - creamy, mild, smooth13. Lobster with Citrus & Jasmine - tender lobster with jasmine flavored air14. Chickpea Stew with Iberico Ham - globules of essence of chickpea and accents of ham15.

Secreto of Iberico Pork with Squid + Parsley Foam - tender, squid was a touch burnt I thought18. Santa Gadea with Cotton Candy - "goat in sheep's clothing," goats milk with sweet cotton candy19. Flan - creamy, light and airy20. Pan con Chocolate - MY FAVORITE DESSERT OF THE NIGHT.  Crumbled frozen chocolate sorbet with cream, hints of saffron, crunchy sweet crystallized bread, and olive oil.  21. "Arroz con Leche" - Another well played piece on texture, temperature and flavor22. 25 second Bizcocho - fluffy cake with lemon cream23. Air Chocolates - wow.  bitter chocolate and I usually really like dark chocolate 24. Cocoa Paper with Dried Strawberry - airy light chocolate with tangy freeze dried strawberry bit$ to Value Ratio:  4.75/5 Stars... This is definitely debatable (my mom may think it's a complete waste of money), but I rated it high because my experience was impeccable (service was top notch, ingredients were top notch)Yummy Factor: 5/5 StarsTexture Satisfaction: 5/5 StarsAverage stars: 4.92 StarsWe were guest 4999 and 5000!  =)I was pretty impressed with E by Jose Andres.I would say the experience as a whole was near a five star experience, but the food and timing overall, along with the huge price tag set it back a few for me.The food overall was good though. The foie gras dish and Secreto of pork were definitely my two favorites along with the bocata de bacalao. The service was definitely top-notch and everyone was very attentive the whole meal. I loved the idea of the chef's cooking everything in front of you and it was interesting seeing the different techniques being used.I think my problem was that I was expecting too much from the meal. I expected that my mind would be blown by all of the food, but I only had that experience from one or two dishes from a meal with 23 different plates. I also think the two hour time slot was a little quick to fully appreciate everything. About an hour after the meal I forgot about every dish I had, due to the quick eating.Overall I was pleased with my experience at E. It is a little overpriced in my opinion for what you are eating and how much you are getting, but I guess its the overall experience that warrants the high price tag. The food was good, but I do not think you should go into this experience expecting the tastiest meal of your life, but rather a unique and exclusive dining experience that only few get to enjoy...This was an amazing experience for me.  People have described much of the food already, but I wanted to address some of the lower rated reviews.  I think what makes this a different type of meal than your average expensive restaurant is that it is actually an experience that requires some participation.  The seating is small (max of 8 people, my dinner had 6 total) and intimate.  Including myself and my SO, there were 2 other couples, and none of the pairings knew the other.  Our chef (Cody) started pretty even-keeled, and we didn't engage right off the bat.  So if you are quiet and don't feel like engaging, your shyness will reverberate through the room.I think the type of person who would enjoy this experience the most, or the proper way to enjoy it, is for someone to spark up conversation with your neighbors, the chefs, and the servers.  That energy will carry through the room, get everyone going, and make the night a very different experience than you would get at say Robuchon or Guy Savoy.So if you don't really like talking to strangers (and can be honest with yourself about it), maybe you're better off spending your money at some of the other blowout restaurants in Vegas.Ate here on Saturday night, March 2, 2013, 8:30 seating.  You won't be disappointed if you go here.  After reading all the reviews, my expectations were quite high...and they were met.   If you can, my only recommendation would be to be closest to the person that leads you into the dining room so that you're furthest away from the door.  Jaleo is quite a loud open seated restaurant and some of the noise from Jaleo drifts into e'.Other than that...have a good time and be ready for a $650+ bill.  $195 per person for food, $50 corkage, $92 auto gratuity, two cups of coffee, and tax.Once was definitely not enough for é by José Andrés.  I dined here in September of 2011 and I felt the need to go back and try some of the newer things being described by newer reviews.Last night's experience was just as good or better than my first time.  There were some dishes that were the same, but many were different.  Sitting in the private room with your fellow diners, watching the chefs put together the courses and watching their meticulous plating work is an incredible experience.  We had only 4 diners last night because the others couldn't keep their reservation due to airline delay.One of the dishes that I especially like is the dehydrated meringue filled with bleu cheese and topped with praline cream.  This was served both times I was here and it is superb!  One thing new last night was the foie gras baked in salt.  Exceptional when it was served with the citrus juice.Another dish of note was the crispy chicken skin with two chicken oysters.  Wow, such thin, crisp chicken skin and the wonderful oysters on the skin.  It was a delicate pick up to eat.One final dish of note, although they almost all are, was the ham and bean soup.  The ham flavor is in the broth and the beans are three large beans created from three kinds of deconstructed beans and reformed into these luscious, soft gems.  Wow!For anyone who wants to have an exceptional meal, make your reservations via email and do go.  It is pricey, but remember, it is both a show and a great meal all in one.  I'll wager some lose more in a couple hands of blackjack than they'll spend here.I am pleased to be guest #1693 and #6212.  In another year or so when they rotate some new dishes in, I'll go back and get my third gold ticket--one of the few things I save.I'll start with a cliche..."words cannot describe how good this place was"....but I'll try anyway. You have to get a reservation ahead of time. e does not have a website--more like a landing page with an email address. We were fortunate enough to get the 5:30 time slot during the busy memorial day weekend. It made me nervous thinking that we would somehow miss the reservation--since there is a hefty cancellation fee--so make sure you can go!We got our golden tickets in the mail--that made us feel very special. e is a private room in Jaleo--a Jose Andres restaurant in the Cosmopolitan. When you check in, they ask you to wait near the bar of Jaleo where you get an iPad menu to select cocktails. Then they direct you into the back room--which is big enough for an 8-person bar seating area. Everyone has an intimate view of the chefs assembling the dishes. Yes, it's expensive at $200 per person without drinks, gratuity included. But this shouldn't be compared to a regular dinner. It's a dinner and a show with exceptional service. There are two waiters for the 8 diners--that's impeccable service. Despite the price tag, it's not a snooty atmosphere by any means. The chefs talk about the dishes as the assemble them--and we asked lots of questions. It was so refreshing to be around fellow food nerds. Not to mention the food is phenomenal and utterly indescribable. This is what i would think of as advanced molecular gastronomy (although they don't really like that label). They play with your senses--and whatever your seeing in front of you doesn't taste like what you'd expect. Everything is inspired from Spanish cuisine. Every time I ate one of the 20+ courses, I said "oh my god!" My favorites were the courses that incorporated cheese--dessert was a bit of a let-down after all the wonderful courses before it. But still very good. You do get full towards the end, but you can take your time. Just prepared to be surprised. I highly recommend it --think of it as once-in-a-lifetime experience.To call é a restaurant is a huge oversimplification.   é is a mix of high-end restaurant, stage show, cooking school, and private dinner party that's completely different from anything I've ever experienced before.Reservations were hard to get.  Phone calls are a no-go -- and you have to email at least a month in advance.  Even then, a signed form and credit card guarantee are required before the spot is officially yours.  The work is worth it once that beautiful golden ticket arrives in the mail 2 weeks later.  (There are only two seatings per night, 8 people each.  If you *really* want a seat, it helps to be flexible with dates.)I went to é on a Sunday night, my last in Vegas.  I showed my ticket to the hostess at Jaleo, and she sat me at a table with the other guests waiting to be escorted into é's secret dining room in the back (which is awesomely decorated like a surrealist's library).  What struck me is how the people visiting é are *not* typical Vegas tourists and gamblers.  Apparently, é is a magnet for critics, bloggers, food photographers, (Yelpers?), and general gastrophiles -- in short, people who adore good food and adore talking about it even more.  It's very easy to make new friends at é!Once inside, we were introduced to Chef Cody Jeffs and his team of sous chefs and servers.  A server took our drink orders -- a glass of Sauvignon blanc for me -- from Jaleo's drink menu.  (FYI, é offers a very elaborate and expensive wine pairing.  Don't feel peer-pressured to order it.  Nobody in our group of 8 did, and everything about the experience was still fantastic.)Then the show began!  And what a show it was.  Twenty courses of world-class molecular gastronomy assembled before my very eyes.  Throughout the experience, there was lots of banter, laughter, clinking of glasses, and questions and interactions with Chef Jeffs.  é may be upscale, but it's completely unpretentious.  It's lots of fun, actually!  (The word I heard most often was "whoa!!!".)There were too many dishes to detail, but here's the basic rundown of what I tasted:1. Rebujito cocktail2. Brazo de gitano3. Nitro almond cup4. Barquillo5. Olives "el vermut"6. Merienda7. Crispy chicken skin en escabeche8. Cava sangria9. Fabes con jamon10. Lobster with citrus and jasmine11. Kokotxas al pil-pil (cod jowls)12. Lobe of foie gras baked in salt13. Secreto of iberico pork with crispy squid14. Torta pascualete with cotton candy15. Flan with shaved ice16. Pan con chocolate17. Arroz con leche18. Cocoa paper with dried strawberries19. 25-second bizcocho20. Chocolate assortmentMy favorites?  The merienda (a ham-and-cheese pancake-type creation) and the torta pascualete (a sweet-and-savory cheese dish).  The kava sangia was definitely the most unusual -- a sphere of booze that seems to evaporate milliseconds after I put it in my mouth.  A close second was the 25-second bizcocho (a cone-shaped cake "baked" for 25 seconds in the microwave).  Oh?  And the flan?  I've never had a flan as smooth and luxurious as the flan at é.  But really, there isn't a single dish at é that was less than sublime.  Chef Jeffs and his staff deserved their standing ovation.  :-)All the individual portions are tiny, so 20 courses of them left me feeling comfortably full but not overstuffed.  The staff at é even let me take home the menu (and a bookmark with my own personal guest number on it) as mementos.  The menu changes seasonally, so a new menu awaits those who wait 3 months before visiting again.Thanks for the amazing evening, é.  It's one I'll never forget!  -- David (guest #7279)This was supposed to be my Holy Grail of food experiences. I had heard nothing but great things about é, I just had to find someone to go with that would be just as excited as I was to try it. Luckily, I found two people! We made our reservations 2 months in advance, knowing that there was 3 in our party, and they only seat 8 at a time, we thought it would be difficult since we had an odd number in our party. Finallly, the night came, I really couldn't contain my excitement for what was about to happen. We were led passed the bar area into another room. It was very quaint, dark and had a Spanish vibe to it. We were introduced to the culinary team. Cody, the sous chef was really good at explaining what dishes they were plating, and what we could expect when tasting the food. Out of the 20 tastings, a couple really stood out for me, #1 Lobster with Citrus & Jasmin, #2 Secreto Iberico Pork with Squid. My favorite dessert was the Pan con Chocolate. Two of my least favorites were the Foie Gras and the Fabes con Jamón, both were so salty I didn't finish either one. We all chose to do the wine pairing, which actually had beer and cocktails in the pairing. The alcohol was fantastic, although they were a little skimpy on the pours. Towards the end of the evening, we all felt they were rushing us a bit. There was a couple that showed up 20+ minutes late for dinner, so we thought maybe they were trying to make up for that time, but not cool to punish the rest of us. Reason for my 4 star rating? Everything was good, but it definitely wasn't mind blowing. Dinner, wine pairing and tax and service charge came to $416 a person. It just didn't match up. I didn't think what I had was worth it. Like I said, I didn't leave mind blown. I def wouldn't recommend someone trying this as their first tasting.Dinning at e is one of the greatest experience in my life. It was more like a cooking show to me. Every dish was very elegant and interesting. There were full of surprises during this 2 hours show. I can't wait to come back to try their winter truffle menu!!!I do not say this lightly, however this was THE BEST dining experience I've ever had in my entire life! Quality: 5 starsRidiculously amazing.  Every dish tasted better than the last.  Jose Andres is known for his unique dishes and cooking style.  Every dish was unique, complex and deliciousService: 5 starsonly two seatings per night.  The reservations must be made via email and then about a week prior to your reservation you recieve willa wonka style golden tickets.  It's fun, unique.  They correspond with you via email before your visit to find out about your allergies ahead of time so that they can custom make your multi course meal for you.   During the dining experience itself, the head chef would plate the dishes in front of us and explain alittle bit about how the dish is made, what inspired the dish, etc.  So much interaction with other guests and the chef.  This is part of the reason why then entire experience was amazing.  Quantity: 4 starsfor about $500 for two people post tax and gratuity, I felt "comfortably full".  Considering it is a 8+ course meal, the meals were tapas style.  I do have an incredibly large appetite though.  My tablemates were full, however I am a gluttonous pig :(.  Would I return?YES!!! Everyday if my wallet was big enough!Other places similar places i've tried in order of preference:1. e by jose andres2. Joel Rubicon - best bread and dessert cart 3. Bottero (las vegas) - alright.  great foie however the rest of the food felt very standard4. providence (california) - i was very underwhelmed5.  Picasso (las vegas) - I did not like this restaurant at all.  I could not finish my entree bc it was so overcooked.  I had a better dinner at Todd english's olives for a fraction of the costWe ate here earlier this month (May) and I wanted to wait for a few weeks to see if my initial reaction would change in time but it hasn't and I still feel the same. To be fair, here are a few positive adjectives that describe the overall time we spent at e: creative, friendly, intimate, knowledgeable, team work, and dedication. At the end of the day though, shouldn't all restaurants have the attributes I just listed? At the end of the day, OVER RATED! OMG! I read all the Yelp reviews below that gave this place 5 stars and thought "WOW, this is going to be amazing, I can't wait", and instead, we walked away with, "WOAH! We paid almost $600 for THAT?! What a joke!" Later that night, we went to Aria where we were staying and ordered a plate of nachos and fries that was 5% of the cost and much more fulfilling. You may ask, "What about the experience"? Well, if you've never been to a "classy" restaurant, paid for $75 for a nice steak, had a nice glass of wine or seen the Food Network, then I will say it again, over rated. Yes, the staff is amazingly coordinated, top notch and its a fun place to watch the staff at work, but I'd rather go to a Cirque show.  There are hundreds of restaurants in Las Vegas and on the Strip and this place would not even hit my top 20 list. Of the ~18 dished we had, I remember having one bite of a really nice piece of steak. The funny thing is, they actually showed us the entire cut grilled and we thought, shoot, what is that 10 oz, we can eat that whole thing, but instead, we got one slice each. The freeze dried sangria (1st dish) was a bit weird but interesting.  The beet pita with brie cheese was different but not something I'd prefer and would rather go to a cheese bar.We made reservations a week prior to date we wanted and were lucky to get in. They made it so hard to give the credit card to reserve the time because they don't take phone calls and don't respond to emails on Mon and Tues. Maybe they think this process adds to their mystery and exclusivity. It's more inconvenient and annoying than anything and who really cares about a golden ticket and piece of paper that says you ate at e, not me. They asked us to arrive 15-30 minutes in advance to our seating and in the end sat us 15 minutes AFTER our seating time.  When you arrive to the Cosmo hotel, no signs or anything to tell you where this dungeon is- we had to ask about 4 people who worked at the hotel and then finally found it at the top level in the main Jose restaurant.And be prepared to sit in a dark room with random strangers who may get drunk during dinner with their pairing and start having unwanted conversations with you.Throwback to 5 years ago - I was at Chipotle one the way to Vegas and as I was eating my salad bowl I started to chew on a piece of plastic. I brought the item to the managers attention and they profusely apologized and gave me 10 coupons for free meals. Ok cool. At least they tried. Just had dinner at é tonight. Before I rant - the chefs, the service was attentive and friendly. The ambiance was interesting. However during one of the courses - which was a cheese and ham mini sandwich - I bitInto this scrumptious piece and pulled a piece of plastic from my teeth. Must be my luck in Vegas. The staff apologized and told me that they would take care of me in some way. Fast forward - I spent over $800 on dinner plus wine pairings for 2 and I did not see any service to reflect any apologetic gesture. Not a smack on the staff but if we're supposed to be treated to a magical meal - this was definitely not it. Most of the latter courses were salty and not refined - i wouldn't have minded the saltiness but to spend that much without any gesture to apologize for a basic mistake by a high end restaurant is rediculous.I hope E can raise their game and take care of their customers some day - but I won't be there to experience it-A reservation by e-mail only. A golden ticket mailed to your house. A website whose script is probably shorter than the URL that took you to it. It's when you have no idea what to expect that your expectations run wild.é by José Andrés is nestled inside the less exclusive Jaleo restaurant at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Two seatings a night, nine people per seating. Arrive at your predestined time and through a curtain you go into a dimly-lit room lined with cabinets filled with fanciful items of your imagination.Two chefs, a couple cooks, and servers all work around an open counter to serve a small semi-circle of guests in what seems like a nearly even staff to diner ratio. The atmosphere is quaint yet unexpectedly casual as the wine unwinds, and you become fast friends with your neighbors. The chef will also answer questions as she assembles your dish.The food carries an artistic and experimental element. Some have been deconstructed then constructed, liquefied then emulsified. Familiar flavors will take on a new textures that play with your perception.As with all art, not everyone will have the same taste; as with all experiments, not every trial will be successful. One of the dishes, squid stuffed with chicken confit, was the single saltiest piece of food I've ever tasted. The main course, ribeye with asparagus, was disappointingly safe and had a piece of sinew I could have lived without.The dinner totaled at over $800 for 2 with wine pairing and gratuity, but it's hard to place a price on an experience this unique. A globe of sangria that jiggles on your spoon then bursts into liquid as it hits the roof of your mouth imprints on the memory in novel ways.The overall experience is five stars, however I'd only give 3 stars to most of the courses...still averages out to 4 yelp stars.Service is unparalleled: from the promptly-returned emails to make this reservation a reality to double-checking that no food preference was overlooked, I was wowed by Kathleen's efficiency & attention to detail. Presentation: Nine coveted spots. A secret back room in another one of José Andrés' restaurants. It all serves to give the illusion of exclusivity, when in fact $195+/per person and a fairly flexible schedule gets you a Golden Ticket...literally. Chefs plate & create in front of your eyes, & a few dishes are served in boxes that need to be opened -- who doesn't like to be surprised? Food:* Timing was more fast paced than I anticipated, but no complaints, I can throw down 20+ courses in just under 2.5 hours! * There was no shortage of appetizers/small bites & desserts, but I felt there weren't enough main courses to be able to compare their handywork to other prix fixe menus I've tasted. However, from what I sampled, many of é's courses were only in the 3-star range (i.e. the "merienda" ham & cheese on brioche, lobster course, chicken oysters on crispy chicken skin, etc,.) * Relied heavily on foam to flavor, & airy things like cotton candy for texture, which didn't particularly impress me, however, I understand that keeping bites light is a must in a multi-course to-do. * Stand-out courses were: the cheese course, which mixed pungent sheep's milk cheese with brown sugar elements; any dish which involved piqueo pepper as a sauce or emulsion; the "mushrooms en papillote," which was simple, but uniquely presented; and the last dessert course called "more things," which were four sweet bites that popped, crunched, or fizzed. Also, really loved the non-alcoholic pineapple upside-down signature drink.The room, which is said to represent the mind of Chef José Andrés, is exciting, intense, & romantic.Wow. Just wow. My friend decided to treat me out to E for my 21st birthday (I'm a lucky girl) as Jose Andres is my favorite chef. After being mailed our golden tickets in the mail, we eagerly went at 5:00pm for the first seating (5:30pm). They only have two seatings each night of 8 people- so a total of 16 people per night. Reservations must be made months in advance to get the seats you want as it is difficult to score the perfect ones. They first sat us outside at a communal bar/ table with the other 6 people, and give a brief introduction of whats to come (20 concept dishes that Chef Jose Andres has created) and what kind of pairing you want. Having been to Jaleo before, I was extremely confused as to where and how E could be so well hidden. But alas, it was right next to the bar on the left back corner, and the hostess had the door open for us as we walked through. Upon being seated, we were immediately given a warm towelette wrapped in lavendar that was placed in a mold of Jose Andres' hand. The chef of the day, Alex, explained to us that everything in the room had a story to tell- such as the uneven ladder with shoes which symbolized the girl who got away, to the doll trapped in the cage- the one who didn't get away. On the sides, there were ingredients that have inspired Chef Jose Andres throughout the years. We got the regular alcohol pairing which came with wines, moscato, vermouth, gin and tonic, sangria, and more. The La Tomatila (i think thats what its called) is an amazing tomato water infused drink- must order! I dont even like tomatos that much but damn was this good. All of the dishes are plated in front of you, you are free to ask as many questions as you want, an explanation is given for all the dishes, and everything is served at the same time- service at its best.I would go into a detailed description of everything I ate, but that would only ruin the surprise for future guests. I will however, give a gist of what I ate and let imagination do the rest~ Edible Sangria that came in a Styrofoam box 5/5Cotton Candy 2.0- Cotton Candy Dumpling with Foie Gras Mousse and Hazelnuts 6/5 (best thing all night)Beet-kini- dehydrated beet manchego cheese sandwich (Chef Jose's version of a grilled cheese, the perfect bikini for summer) 5/5Coca De Recapte- sausage and foie gras? crisp 5/5Merienda- after school snack that kids in Spain got- basically a bun stuffed with goat cheese (I hate goat cheese and this surpassed my expectations) 5/5Smoked Oyster and Chicken Oyster- Definitely unique and extremely different. 4/5 Pescado en Adobo- Codfish stick- the fish is much thicker than regular deep fried fish, not enough sauce for me. 3/5El Vermut- Mussels- 4/5Cava Sangria- sangria jelly in a spoon that bursts in your mouth. 5/5Fabes con Jamon- Jellied Fava beans in a thick rich broth- not a big fan of beans, but wow. 5/5Kokotxas al Pil Pil- Codfish Jowls- first time trying these, pretty chewy but delicious. 4/5 Mar y Montana- sea cucumber stuffed with pork. really interesting take on this dish. 4/5 The lady next to me asked the chef if the sea cucumber was a fish or a plant....Mushrooms en Papillote- Chanterelle Mushrooms- smoked in a plastic bag and when cooked, the bag is cut for you to eat. wow. This presentation... 5/5Chuleta- bomb but small piece of steak. I was so full at this point but still amazing 5/5Dessert- Pressed Cotton Candy with flowers and creme underneath- best dessert I have ever had. I wanted like 10 of these. 6/5Jellied egg yolk- with some cream. again, super impressed. 5/5Rum and coffee- this one takes 20 min to prepare, so you see a lady stirring the drink while it is on fire at the side for awhile. 5/5Chocolate cylinder that cracks open with liquid inside and crumble.. most delicious chocolate dessert ever. 5/5Ring Box with Hazelnut Ferrero Roche type chocolate- 5/5 The last dessert- it was okay. Dont remember it much. 3/5Mignardises- the four treats on the dish were so good- I couldnt choose what to finish first. Anyways, I felt so repetitive talking about how amazing all the dishes are, but thats the truth. Everything blew my mind away.The intimacy of the room and the environment made this experience unparalleled to any other dining experience I've had. Not only was the food and drinks on point, the service and decor only added the cherry to the icing. The only complaint I have was one of the guests, who made a huge deal of everything she couldnt eat, not finishing, and requesting substitions. At the end, you receive a book where you write a message to Jose Andres, and a bookmark saying what number visitor you are (11,788). You also receive a menu to take home, but it doesnt say much- just the title of the concept. Total came out to be around $900 for two (including tip), as the alcohol pairing was pretty expensive as well. Although this will definitely empty out your wallet, the experience is one you cannot receive anywhere else.As others have reported, you email for reservations.  Email, provide credit card to hold reservation, then receive your golden tickets in snail mail.  Willy Wonka-ish golden ticket not needed when checking in as they have your contact info...20 courses of Spanish cuisine.They asked us to check in 30 minutes prior to your reservation to explain beverage options.  This would have been fine except they seated us 22 minutes late.  Minus points--ask us to be early yet seat us late.Plating only.  Meticulous and detail oriented, yet including preparation would've been true theatre as other yelpers have griped.  Chef and his staff lacked charisma--need personality.  They need to build up our anticipation, add/increase fervor!  Anticlimactic delivery...The all-important taste test... Underwhelming.  20 courses but not many wowed me.  Their centerpiece for this evening--their ribeye--did shine but not brightly.  Is this what Jose Andres is all about?  Bring in your fancy ingredients, impress my eyes, tease my nose, but let my tongue down... =(Tip included (quick glance looked like 20%).  Service was worth the 20% automatic gratuity.Would I come back here again?  Not on my short list of Vegas restaurants to revisit....Truly a tour de force of Spanish Cuisine.Four visits, the most recent in the fall of 2014, e continues it's reign atop Vegas' culinary scene.Seated in the bar of Jose Andres, glasses of Cava in hand, getting to know your fellow diners.  The hostess for the evening (and the sommelier) discretely interrupt each party to discuss water preferences and drink pairings.  As is Spanish tradition, always a little beyond the appointed hour, you're whisked away past the roaring fire and pans of cooking paella and into a secluded private, whimsical dining room.  Seated at a semicircular stainless steel counter, surrounded by hard woods and trinkets; representing the mind of the chef.   A hard knock on the solid kitchen door, the music of Spain fills the room, the chefs and servers enter and take their positions.  The experience begins.E is about molecular gastronomy and modernist cuisine.  Perhaps a solid, foam sangria that magically dissipates on the tongue leaving the distinct flavor of wine and fruits, a thimble of soup with the pure essence of Spanish Jamon, liquefied olives that burst with the salty, briny taste of the real thing.  Artistry, flavor and pride are showcased in each dish as the head chef works in front of guest and describes each dish.  Tip:  Wine pairings are essential.  They tie courses together and greatly enhance the experience.  Standard pairing $130, select pairing $300.  Opt for the select.  Incredibly well though out, running the gamut from sherry to 20 year cellared brooding reds, impossible to find whites and dessert wines.20 courses grouped in three "flights".  Flavors of each small "starter" build on one another, as flavors of each and their accompanying wine pairing flow and compliment.  The progression makes the diner appreciate temperature and texture.  "Mains" provide contrast.  Flavors held together by the wine pairings that span more than one dish.  Finally desserts, with the boldest contrast between each to keep the palate yearning for more.As always, with meals of so many selections, not everything will be to your taste.  All good, the next bite awaits.Service is beyond reproach.  Unpretentious, friendly, very informative, perfect.The experience for three diners with select wine pairing, incidental drinks, water, service and gratuity, $2,100.Michelin three star worthy and a must in Vegas.Notes:1.  Reservations by emailing reserve@ebyjoseandres.com  beginning 90 day in advance.  No reservations or replies on Monday and Tuesday.  No phone in reservations accepted.  2.  Credit card required to warranty reservation.3.  Base price; $195 plus 20% service.Entertaining, fanciful, imaginative, and quite delicious, é by José Andrés is one of the best experiences at this price range! We had the pleasure of enjoying this 16 course tasting menu with a wine pairing. Some of the courses were outstanding while others were just okay...most were quite enjoyable though. This was not necessarily the best tasting meal I've had in this price point this year, but it was certainly one of the most memorable and all around enjoyable meals I've ever had.Some of my favorite tastes of the evening included:Cotton Candy Empanada with Foie Manchego DaisySherry Marinated Clams and Liquid OlivesWagyu RibeyeLa Marianda Grilled CheeseMushrooms in a BagBeet KiniCrema CatalanaCoca De RapateAfter Dinner Mintand GemetaAs many who frequent this website know, é is moderately difficult reservation to make based only on the small intimate dining experience that seat 8 or 9 people at a time. They have two seating a night--doubling your opportunity to get in!!!...but obviously still very limited. I took my wife here for her birthday and first reached out to them several months in advance. They weren't able to take my reservation at that time, but shared the reservation process with me. A couple months later when the date was now within the three-month range that they use to take reservations I emailed them and found the method practical and easy to use.I was thoroughly impressed with é by José Andrés. I have talked to several people about the experience here and through those conversations I've come to the conclusion that if you're only going to experience one meal at this price every year or two, é may not be the best option. The food is playful and whimsical at é. Other places take the food slightly more serious and put out a better product, but é is much more than 16 courses or tastes. It is an affair uniquely encountered...an event unto itself. I don't know if there is a Vegas food experience I would rather participate in annually more than é.This is my first experience with molecular gastronomy, and it was completely mindblowing. The creativity and execution of each of the dishes was perfect, and I really enjoyed myself watching the chefs prepare each of the plates and make the dishes come to life. There were many favorites that night. I enjoyed the foie gras chocolate tart, the squid with rosemary foam, the edible sangria, the scallop with black truffle cream and black truffle shavings, the cotton candy with foie gras filling, the wagyu beef, etc. In fact every dish deserves 5 star on its own.I was particularly impressed by the potato sheet that was served as a side along with the black truffle gnocchi along with the beef. I thought it was a sugar glaze initially, but was completely mind blown to learn that it was made with potato.Definitely coming back again in a year to try out their new menu.PS. We were guests #12129 and #12130. PPS. Love that they actually sent out golden tickets in the mail!If you would like to make a reservation for this restaurant email them 3 months in advance.

This place allowed me to cross some items off my list AND provided me with an extraordinary dining experience.So with that being said, I told my boyfriend about this place ages ago. The good guy that he is, he made reservations 3 months in advance to take me here for my birthday! When the reservations were made, we did not know that it was going to fall on the weekend of Mayweather fight. So, the place was crazy and the other 7 people we dined with were actually there for the fight and were from out of town. When we arrived, we were seated at a table to go over our beverage options. As far as the alcohol pairing, we opted out of it. I honestly did not want my taste buds to be under the influence in any way. As the meal progressed,  I saw that the other people at the table seemed overwhelmed with alcohol at times; sitting with 3 glasses and needing to catch up. So I was very happy that we just stuck with water, because I went to eat, not to drink.  Here is what my courses were comprised of since they can change:*Drunken Truffles - presented in a box, these fluffy balls with a dusty exterior were interesting. But honestly, thought the flavors were too much. *Branch of the Desert- edible rice cracker centerpieces in cacao nibs. That was so cool and quite tasty.*Foie Doughnut - this made me think of those fancy dog bakeries were the treats look delectable but actually do not have any sugar because they are for dogs. It was like that because it has sprinkles and you think it is going to be sweet but instead it is savory. It was an interesting dish. *Cheese Cracker- I have made these at home before. Nothing too extraordinary but still delicious. *Vidrio (potato Glass with anchovy butter) - I really dug the salty anchovy butter and smearing it on the potato glass as the glass itself did not have much of a distinctive flavor. *Beet Gazpacho - sort of like an ice cream sandwich. Very unique concept but the beets were too overpowering, so I gave up on this earthy dish. *Merienda- a touch of gooey ham and cheese on the inside. My favorite of the first grouping. *Clams in Escabeche- foamy clams that I really enjoyed.*Cheese and Nuts - this was another cheese course, the hazelnut "caviar" was delicious and the cheese had a hard sugary exterior. The cheese was deliciously stinky and the scent stayed on my fingers the rest of the night. *Cava Sangria - sort of like a jello shot in a ball form. Super fun!*Ibèrico Chickpeas - very home-style/hearty with the warmth of the soup and little pieces of Iberico. *Live scallop with Black Truffles-my favorite of the night! The scallop melted in my mouth and the paired so wonderfully with the earthiness of the black truffles. I could eat this every day if I could. *Squid with rosemary foam- beautifully plated. Not always a huge fan of squid personally, but out of the squid I have tasted, this was the best. *Fluke with squid ink flakes-the fluke was cooked perfectly, and it was interesting to hear that the squid ink is made into a flakes to create a crust for this fish. *Wagyu Beef - delicious and I loved that they had two pieces on the plate, as one of the smaller pieces was more marbled and I died eating that buttery piece. The potato gnocchi was also a perfect accompaniment. *Cotton Candy Empanada- such a fun concept and neat to see them come out with a pile of cotton candy. Crunchy surprise in the middle of it made it fun. *Santa Gradea-a dish with soft cheese and I believe frozen pomegranate seeds. So much work went into this dish for plating and was then scrambled all together. *Créma Catalana Egg - a dish with soft cheese that looked like a fried. I dipped my spoon into all of the individual parts to test separately and realized that you really needed to scramble it all together to get the piece to taste delicious. *After Eight Timbal- my favorite of the desserts, as when you cracked the barrel of chocolate, a minty liquid flooded out and mixed with the bed of granola-ish stuff. Once it was all mixed together, I dug it. *Ferrero Rocher- a delicate little piece of chocolate with amazing presentation in a box. The chef said that it is one of the most difficult dishes to make of the night. *Burnt rum drink- it was awesome watching them still and set this drink aflame from the start of the night. Warm and served in a delightful little teacup!*Yemita- cute little lemon drop*More things- collection of little things with a small piece of chocolate, a wafer type thing. I was so full at this point that I just took little bites of these desserts. Overall, it was a brilliant dining experience. All of the staff were efficient and professional. Even if I did not particularly enjoy some of the dishes, I still loved watching them plate the dishes and talking to the chefs about the dishes. I was also pleased to discover some things that I want to get my hands on again such as more live seafood and more Wagyu beef!Dine-in Date: 10/10/2015. Actual rating 4.5. The No1DP and I ate here for our 2nd-year anniversary.Think of é as both a dinner and show that looks into the creative mind of chef José Andrés. The interior of the restaurant reflect this as the walls are adorned with small drawers filled with assorted items. Like most shows in Vegas they have a twice nightly "showing" Weds-Sun at 5pm and 8:30pm. $195/person with three wine tiers.Pre-Show: Reservations are by E-MAIL ONLY. Through a long e-mail chain started late July I was able to book two slots. Remember that your reservation is not complete until the submission and receipt of a form that requires notification of any food restrictions and credit card information. I never received my Golden Tickets before the dine-in date but as the restaurant inquired if I received the tickets that day I was able to receive those tickets along with the menu as souvenirs when the bill was presented.Our restaurant experience began when the No1DP and I approached the host at Jaleo about our reservation. We were led to one of the side tables outside the restaurant proper as we waited for everyone to arrive. We had a glass of Cuba Libres and this was the best cuba libre I had without Cuban rum. The cinnamon garnish does the trick. Once everyone arrived we were led to the back of Jaleo, where our dinner/show began.We had about 21 courses presented in four rounds. We also opted for $100/person truffle supplement in 2 dishes, the Spanish Pizza and the Iberico Chickpeas. As the menu changes I'll present my thoughts as a summary of the four rounds as opposed to commenting on each individual course.Act 1: The amuses.- Sangria 2015.- Branch of the Desert - "Vidrio": "glass".- Filipino: the foie gras donut.- Pillow- Dado: "dice".This was the most experimental, aesthetically pleasing yet least tasty of the four acts. A lot of effort was put into the aesthetics - the black sesame branches looked like something out of the dessert and the pillows on the sofa just looked plain adorable. The No1DP asked for no foie on his donut and while his donut was served along with everyone else, the No1DP could not taste foie - must be one sprinkle different from the other donuts. There was a lot of salty bites to pick up the appetite - overall too much salt in these sets of courses to my liking.Act 2: Bigger appetizers.- Beet Gazpacho- Spanish Pizza- Vermut- Cheese and Nuts- "Chupito": the little shot of cava sangria.These courses have bigger food portions and are less experimental than the previous act but still not a traditional presentation of plates. The Spanish Pizza with the cured meat serving as the "pizza" was the cutest presentation - I asked to take the little pizza box with me. Truffle shavings were skimpy as the No1DP and another dinner guest noted. Gazpacho is typically served as a soup but molecular gastronomy techniques were used to make it as a sandwich - certainly did not detract from the taste but I had to be careful that the sandwich didn't go into my clothes. My favorite course is the cheese and nuts - eating it one after the other really helps combine the hazelnut and creamy cheese tastes together. The cava sangria is mean to be another palate cleanser.Act 3: The mains.- Brandada Bacalao- Iberico Chickpeas- Txipirones: squid- Platija: flounder- Chuleta: cutlet of Australian wagyu beef.- "Empanada": the famous foie gras empenada.My favorite act, which is weird because these are considered the main courses presented most traditionally. No1DP opted for chicken instead of squid in his txipirones dishes - ended up liking his chicken to my squid. Aside from that I loved each dish in this round as it was perfectly presented and tasted delicious. It was a tease presenting the wagyu as a whole steak during the squid course - giving us a tease as to the final meat. The famous foie gras empenadas are served in this round and it tastes like peanut brittle on steroids. Hint: These can be found in Bazaar Meats as an appetizer. Act 4: Sweet endings.- Santa Gadea: cheese course - named after high-quality cheese in Spain.- Menjar Blanc: the Catalan almond milk sweet. - After Eight Timbal- Ferrero Rocher- Yemita: little custard candy.- More ThingsSecond favorite act. Cheese course was okay due to the freeze-dried fruits but I liked everything else. Panna cotta served as a frozen brick was quite interesting. I loved breaking the after eight timbal and taking the Ferrero out of its red box. The hostess was also serving this rum drink to go towards the end, which is made to pair with the chocolate. The petit four served in a fan was cute. Jose's Gin and Tonic is served at the end but this just goes to show how much I hate gin and tonic.For 21 courses one dish would look and taste better than the others but overall the No1DP and I had a delicious meal and awesome dining experience - certainly ranking in the top 10 restaurants I've eaten.I spent so much time with my eyes closed throughout the 21 courses in an attempt to fully savor the amazing range of flavors bestowed upon my taste buds that I probably came off looking like Stevie Wonder's mentally challenged 3rd cousin as I swayed side to side to the other diners.  Overjoooooooooyed!  Sangria 2015: Frozen red wine accompanied by little bursts of fruit presented in a half bottle to be scooped with two little spoons.  This must be how Willy Wonka gets bombed while watching reruns of "Friends".  It was a terrific "beverage" to start the meal.    Spanish Pizza: I love burnt cheese like nobody's business.  These geniuses of food made it the crust for heavenly bites topped with Andres' fantastic "Jamon" and ricotta cheese.  How much would a full on large pizza like this be?  $1000?  More?  Unreal.  What is it like to be the duke/duchess here?Beet Gazpacho:  Appearing like a fancy French pastry sold at Jean Philippe, the intense flavor was pretty eye opening, not easy for an Asian guy :D  That they even pulled this kind of richness out of a beet, one of the most non-offensive, unassuming vegetables ever (the Greg Kinnear of veggies?) is beyond me.  The sorbet-like quality was surely a big reason. Iberico Chickpeas:  This gave me the satisfaction and entertainment of every Vegas show I've seen in the last year all in one bowl and in less than 5 minutes.  Through the spherification cooking technique, the garbanzo beans had an ikura quality to it where they would pop in your mouth with only slight pressure.  Mixed in with the rest of the ingredients (I may have blacked out due to culinary ecstasy when the chef explained everything), the explosion of tastes in each spoonful was otherworldly.  I was the last one to finish as I wanted to savor every bean to its maximum potential.  "Empanada": Foie Gras cotton candy gyoza.  Formed, pressed right before our very eyes and eaten by hand, the combination of the fatty duck liver, light candy sweetness and Corn Nuts (?!), was an incredible mix that floored me.  Sign me up for 100 of these.      Brandida Bacalao: Salt fish chicharron topped with truffle.  The fish air foam the chef delicately placed on top of each our pieces was like a fairy godmother granting wishes.  Light, airy and amazing, this could have probably been finished in two bites.  I ate it like a rat and managed six.  Are the employee dinners anywhere close to the magnificence of this stuff?  I would wash dishes for free.Fun, creative, and extremely delicious, I'd gladly go back in a heartbeat.  If forced to choose, I'd go with é over Joel Robuchon considering the similar price point and for overall entertainment factor, but you couldn't go wrong with either for a dinner and show all rolled up into one.  This was a fantastic meal for our 8th wedding anniversary.  We were lucky to get the reservation and our golden tickets less than 3 weeks out.

Tucked behind a secret curtain in the back of Jaleo, a restaurant in the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas, is an intimate 8 seat only restaurant that will transport you to one of the most unbelievable culinary experiences you might ever have. It starts with the reservation. You don't call to make a reservation. In fact, they don't even have a phone. You have to email them, usually months in advance to secure  a spot in one of the 8 coveted seats. When you finally get a response, you pre reserve your seats, by filling out the reservation request, and prepaying with your credit card at the time of reservation. I don't think they actually charge the card, but the reservation policy is if you cancel within two weeks, there is a 50% charge, and no shows are billed at 100% so be sure you are aware of that. About a week before, you will receive your Golden Tickets, a la Willy Wonka style and you bring those as your admittance to the restaurant. I'm sure you don't really don't need to bring the tickets, but it's a fun touch and goes to show that they really don't take themselves too seriously.When you arrive, you are seated in Jaleo, and the host comes over to give a quick explanation and to take drink orders. You may choose the wine pairing ($125) or choose from individual glasses of wine (about $25 each) for the dinner.You are then escorted in and sit around the 8 person table. The venue is quite unique and sort of a speakeasy in the back of Jaleo, tucked behind a curtain. The venue has interesting items like an apothecary wall and items that were hand picked by Jose Andres. You then sit around the kidney shaped table to start your experience.About 20 courses comprise the 3 hr evening and come in rapid succession. We started with a sangria cava that was an encapsulated ball that when placed in the mouth, exploded with flavor. Throughout the night, course after course was served , each on its own unique plate and masterfully prepared. The evening was as much a show as a meal. You got to ask questions, interact, and come away from the meal fully satisfied, wanting more more. The meal is pricey, about $500 for two, so not an everyday experience, but if you are looking for something unique, special, and out of the ordinary, keep this in mind.
Ciao Ciao Cafe & Bar=***Ciao Ciao's gelato is pretty good but also very overpriced (even for Las Vegas)***Ciao Ciao is a gelato bar inside The Forum Shops at Caesars.  They have a good number of flavors and many of them appeared to be creative concoctions with lots of ingredients mixed in.  I went with the pistachio and the mascarpone with caramel and both flavors were good.  The gelato was creamy too.Service was quick and pleasant.Pricing was very high.  I ordered a medium size and it was $8 before taxes.  While I did not get the gelato at the more famous Jean Philippe in Aria, I think the gelato there was about the same price (maybe even less at Jean Philippe).Ciao Ciao's gelato was a satisfying frozen dessert.  Pricing was too high though.  Pricing is high for a lot of stuff in Vegas, but I think for the prices you will pay here, you should be able to find more interesting and more well known sweets elsewhere.The Forum Shops and Caesars offer complimentary parking (via valet or self parking structure).
Upper Crust Pizza Patio & Wine Bar=Great place for a good pizza and a drink. Indoor on the family side or next door in the bar. They have a great patio as well. Basic pizza and Italian food menu, including salads. I had the personal sized pizza and it was excellent. VERY VERY Grimaldis type. Thin, nice sauce, great crust and ample Mozz cheese. I ate the entire thing. $ 8 for the cheese add $1 for the Pep. $9 lunch meh.. a little expensive.  Share a large with 4 people. LOLStaff was great, nice and friendly. I wish the owner would have been a little more proactive at meeting his customers. :(Prices on the drinks seem steep. I doubt I would go just to have a few drinks.Next to the Coffee place in the Costco shopping center. North west side of the complex facing Cave Creek.This place was very similar to Grimaldi's in Phoenix.They have a family restaurant environment with TV's everywhere. It is awesome I did not have to crane my neck to watch the Coyote's playoff game at all. The service was really good, attentive, the also have a party room with an absolutely MASSIVE TV in it, as well as a nice indoor and outdoor lounge. The outdoor lounge has nice plush furniture to sit on and relax, it would be a fantastic place to take a date!Their wine list is nice, I was sad they didn't have a moscato on it however the Reisling was really good so I couldn't complain. My husband and I always have the Pepperoni and Mushroom Pizza wherever we go. It was really good, Just the right amount of sauce and toppings and I have to save the left overs were really good cold. (Breakfast of champions right there)We also ordered Hot Wings and Teriyaki wings. Its a good thing I love my husband or I may have bit him for the Teriyaki wings, there were fantastic and I could have made a meal out of them by themselves.Certainly give this place a gander, I don't want them going anywhere soon, except for expanding locations!I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event.  Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant.  My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day.  I can't remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a Shiraz and it was good.  We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil.  It was all so delicious!  I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil.  Again, it was very tasty!   Everyone was very friendly and prompt.  I will be back to Upper Crust!When I was a kid, I used to look forward to Friday night pizza parties at the local pizza parlor. Since moving to Arizona, I haven't found many pizza parlors here that mirror my childhood experience. That is, until I found Upper Crust. Upper Crust sneaks up on you. Literally. It's located in a small strip mall just off of the 101 and Cave Creek Road but the second you walk inside, it's a whole little sports bar/pizza parlor experience. To the right of the restaurant sits a dining room complete with red checkered tablecloths and family style tables. To the left sits a bar with at least a dozen flat screen TVs, several high top tables and a large bar top. It's the perfect spot to watch a game. The pizza is outstanding. It's large and in charge! One slice is probably the size of 2-3 regular size pizzas. It's thin crust with soft bread, gooey cheese and any toppings you want. This is the ideal Friday night pizza. If you're ever in the area, visit this hidden gem for some delectable pizza!Loved the pizza here. I first tried their food at the Yelp pleY date event and it was delishious! Their meatball, ravioli, mozzerella cheese sampler at the event was awesome. I just had to come and check them out.The pizza is not quite what I would call a thin crust, but the dough is not too thick either. I may just be trying to convince myself that pizza is good for you here, but does thinner crust = less carbs? I think so, and thats what I'm going with at least. All their pizza's come topped with their home made mozzerella, and I finished mine off with meatballs, which seemed like a good idea at the time. I was right! The meatball pizza is nothing less than super. They seem to have different daily specials. Swing by on a Tuesday for buy one get one free pizzas and bring home some 'za for tha family.Great pizza!! This place was a great last minute pick!! We decided to bring in the big 2013 with a small get together celebration at this pizza joint!! The service was great!! We had a friendly and patient server with our undecided group. Also we loved the surprisingly good tasting white sauce on our pizzas!! Everything was amazing!! The Mozzarella appetizers and the Extreme Hot wings!! Oh so good, fatty food!! We look forward to coming back!!
Three Villages Restaurant=Three Village Restaurant is one of the newest Chinese restaurants to be opened in Las Vegas greater Chinatown area (Official grand opening was on Dec 8, 2010).  It is located at the former Champion Gourmet site, which is on the second floor of the old SF Supermarket and in the same plaza as other restaurants such as Shuseki, Swish, and Ah Chung Noodles.  The food it features on the menu is mostly Northern Chinese cuisine, and includes house specials such as Pork Dumpling with Supreme Soup (aka Xiao Long Bao), Pan Fried Soup Bun, Sliced Beef Roll, Jung Dong Meat Pie, Onion Pancakes and Noodle with Pork Bean Sauce.Prices of the menu items range from $3.95 to $19.95, with most items with the price range between $7.95 and $9.95.  The restaurant also features an All Day Special Combo that costs either $6.50 or $7.95.  For this special combo you get to select one of three soup or soup noodles (Fried Tofu Thin Noodle Soup, Curry Beef Thin Noodle Soup or Hot & Sour Soup) plus another select menu items, such as Pork Dumpling with Supreme Soup, Sliced Beef Roll, Pan Fried Pork Bun.  The portions are generous and you will definitely be full and satisfy selecting one of the All Day Special Combo.Review of the food:Fried Tofu Thin Noodle Soup - The broth is pleasant and mild, didn't cared much for the fried tofu pieces as garnish.Curry Beef Thin Noodle Soup - Nice flavor with subtle curry taste.Pork Dumpling with Supreme Soup - Not the greatest I have had, but perhaps one of the best available in Las Vegas, it is however definitely the best for the price.Sliced Beef Roll - tastes good and fairly comparable to those offered at China Mama's, but I think the portion is more generous here.Décor - almost none, except the lucky Buddha statue at the entrance.  1/5Capacity - seats roughly 80 people, with 5 large round tables and 7 small 4-tops.Service - Friendly, but you can tell they are barely keeping up with the demand of the busy restaurant. 3.5/5Value - Fair to good. 3.5/5Taste - Good.  4/5
Rí Rá=Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm Sheperds pie!Absolutely delicious, with minced lamb, carrots, peas, onions, fresh herbs, savory gravy, mashed potato crust ($14.95) - pricey but worth every bite!The interior is pretty cool and our server Andy mentioned they have items and wood carvings and panels brought in from Ireland for the decor and ambience. Great atmosphere, good place to chill out with your mates or have a cozy dinner with your significant other.I also tried the shot of CHOCOLATE CAKE (Absolut Vanilia, Frangelico) - pretty darn good and tasted just like warm chocolate cake!Service was fast, friendly and with a smile.Ri Ra (translated means celebration and good fun) is located in Mandalay Bay -  this places is a total Irish Pub! They have live music on weekends (that's what the sign said outside...)This pub is right next to the Guiness Merchandise Store.I'd definitely come and eat here again, they had a ton of stuff on their menu that I would like to try!Super high energy and a friendly party atmosphere fueled by live music, good food, and alcohol make this the best Irish themed pub in Vegas.For pub grub, it has to be the burgers. the dubliner (ground lamb seasoned with rosemary and topped with onions, goat cheese and curry mayo) is incredible. So juicy and flavorful.  The Guinness BBQ burger is also excellent.  Topped with a house made Guinness BBQ sauce, Irish cheddar cheese and onion rings; what's not to love.The short list for entrees include the Moors & Bay (bacon wrapped fillet with Guinness glazed prawns), Shepherd's Pie (made with lamb), and the Guinness & Beef Stew (deeply flavored fork tender beef cooked in beer; how can you go wrong).Service is very friendly (remember, its a pub).  Great selection of Irish whiskey and single malt scotches. Decent selection of Irish beers.  Prices are slightly lower than most Strip restaurants.Highly recommended.WHERE: It is located inside the Mandalay Place Shops.WHEN: Monday through Thursday, 11am-3am. Friday, 11am-4am. Saturday, 9am-4am. Sunday, 9am-3am. (There is definitely plenty of time for you to stop on by, whether it be a drink or something to snack on! =D)WHY: If you are looking to experience a jolly, good old time! & some BEER! Beer's always good! =)WHAT: I haven't been to an Irish Pub in a while, and thank goodness my friend and I decided to walk into this one! There were many times I would come to shop at the Mandalay Place and noticed the pub -but this time I finally kicked myself in the butt and walked in.After we were directed to our table, I noticed such an amazing atmosphere! It was perfectly dim and a place where you can come in to socialize with friends. It was then time to make our order!-Pub Wings: We started off with this delightful appetizer! It was covered with Guinness BBQ sauce and Jameson honey glaze alongside bleu cheese dip. The flavors mingled so well (Probably a little too well because I ate about 75 percent of the wings, and left my friend the remaining 25 percent, haha). So... Hoorah!-Turkey, Bacon & Bleu Melt: Me! This was my pick. It was really good, but a little dry. I had to dip it in my bleu cheese, but overall it was still a great sandwich.-Publicans Reuben: This was my friend's pick (Oh, I forgot to mention that we traded half of our sandwiches with each other so we got to taste the best of both worlds!) I cannot explain how great this sandwich was! It was ultimately the best reuben sandwich I've ever gotten to taste! I RECOMMEND THIS SANDWICH UNDOUBTEDLY!During and after our meal, our server and busser came several times to check on us! (I believe their names were D and Fred, if I can recall). They were happy to grab us some more water, dressing, whatever the case was. This definitely made it such a positive experience! I loved all of the workers! They were all so kind and had plenty of beautiful smiles on their faces whenever they walked by.Overall, the space was very cozy, the people were awesome, the food was yummy in my tummers, and I will most likely be returning for some bomb dot com reuben sandwiches and probably some BEER! Watch out for me! hahaWith another couple, Diane and I ventured out to sample the offerings of Ri Ra for the first time, and departed full and happy, with three large, unfinished hunks of haddock packaged to go.  After pondering whether to be adventurous and try Traditional Bacon & Cabbage, I decided instead to stick with a dish I knew I liked, and thus opted for Emigrant's Corned Beef & Cabbage, preceded by a bowl of Seafood Chowder.  The soup contained good scallops and other morsels of the sea, but I found the broth itself to be fairly bland.As for my entree, the corned beef covered with Irish Parsley Sauce was of good quality, along with excellent-tasting softened cabbage and nice mashed potatoes.  I didn't enjoy it quite as much as my all-time favorite Corned Beef & Cabbage served at Three Angry Wives, but it was a close second.  The fish in Diane's Fish & Chips consisted of a huge single battered specimen the ends of which almost lapped over both sides of the plate on which it was delivered.  Its flesh was moist and good, with no undesired fishy flavor.  The chips, too, tasted good but were non-crisp fries.  Complimentary soda bread was good for what it was when slathered in butter.  And, although Irish Potato Cakes were very salty, they tasted almost like Crab Cakes, and I would order them again.  For dessert I had a Blueberry Whiskey Crumble a la mode.  I liked it but it surprised me, for I thought it would be a cobbler.  Not so!  There was no discernible dough amid the warm and saucy blueberries.  But this was still a tasty dish, and I learned that a cobbler and a crumble are not in the least synonymous.  All was washed down with refreshing Sweet Iced Tea. Service by Vanessa, who hails from Ireland, and, alas, will soon be returning there, was impeccable, and a friendly manager visited us once at our comfortable booth in the cavernous dining room to see whether we were pleased with our meals, which all of us were.  By the time we left, the place was completely packed with happy pub crawlers, and live Irish music was just beginning to be played as the football playoff games on the several large flat-screen TVs were winding down.  The large dining room in the back is a welcome bastion of serenity for those like me who are long past the age of active imbibing and carousing, and would rather savor a fine meal than chat with friendly strangers and toss a few.  But, as we worked our way through the crowded front of the house, it was clear that the young twenty-something revelers who were seated on stools or standing were enjoying their lagers and stouts.I will definitely be back!I actually made it out of The Tropicana by 8am for my morning walk this past Sunday. Impressed? You should be, as it was a tough go the 1st 100 yards or so, and it was already in the mid 90's. After a mile or 2 I doubled back to Mandalay Bay in search of a Bloody Mary. Whaaaat? Its Vegas damn it. Walked around the casino to discover the bars were not yet open at nearly 9am. Hey! I thought this was Vegas not Des Moines.I decided to take the air conditioned route through the mall thing that stretches through a couple of hotels and drops one directly across from "The Trop." Panic started to creep in as I passed a few more shuttered restaurants. Wait, someone up ahead opening their doors for business. Is it a clothing store or..?? OMG, its an Irish Pub. I thought the heat was affecting me and I was dreaming a desperate dream.Sure enough, 9am sharp and these Angels of Mercy were beckoning me towards the flashy bar. Some slick looking kat with (presumably) an Irish accent welcomed me like a long lost mate. Feeling better already.My new mate Tom made me a killer Stoli Mary, and soon some fellow dehydrated patrons showed up and it turned into your typical neighborhood Irish bar kinda place. Yeah, right here in Fauxville Vegas. Especially unexpected in this mall tunnel thingy. My intention was a one n done, but my other new mates seated next to me ordered some delicious looking breakfasts, and I was soon requesting that menu that I previously returned to Tom. He recommended the Irish Eggs Benedict, which listed Rashers as an ingredient, and he informed it was the Irish version of Canadian bacon. I just looked it up and found this definition: "Rashers (n): pieces of bacon; female genitalia."  Ahem, think I will move on without further comment. I also looked up Ri-Ra (n): Irish expression for fun and excitement.Great breakfast, great service, great vibe. If ever on this boring end of the strip, this is a must do.Let me preface this review by saying that I KNOW MY IRISH BARS AND FOOD. I was born and raised in that magical country and I frequently return for lengthy visits. Ireland is my favorite place in the world. And now, Ri Ra is my favorite Irish pub in the world that exists outside of Ireland. It is authentic and decorated perfectly. The rich, dark wood and the paintings and the lighting and even the Irish accents of some of the servers could not be more perfect. Walking into Ri Ra is like walking into one of the local Temple Bar watering holes in Dublin. Ri Ra has an absolutely astounding selection of beer and cider - the best of what Ireland and England have to offer and in my opinion, more of a selection than any other Irish pub in town. (HELLO! MAGNERS/BULMERS ON DRAFT!!!) Also, they've got a great whiskey list and flight samples that rival even the Freakin Frog's attic! We ordered the fish and chips to share and the sausage rolls as an appetizer. Sausage rolls are one of my favorite comfort foods, so I was really hoping Ri Ra came through with this one. And, THEY DID. The sausage rolls were perfect and tasty and crunchy yet soft - probably the best I have ever had. When our fish and chips came out, I knew I was in love before I even took the first bite because I could tell that these were freshly cut potatoes and a really great cut of fish - HUGE too. Without a doubt in my mind, Ri Ra has the best fish and chips in Vegas - definitely the best I have had outside of Ireland. They've also got a pretty awesome "late night chipper" menu that I can't wait to check out. If you visit the bar for a drink, they've got all the bar snacks you'd find in Ireland - Tayto or King crisps, chocolate, etc. You name it! This place is amazing. Although it might be a bit pricey, you get what you pay for in terms of quality and service! If this bar was closer to my house and not located on the strip, I'd probably never leave.Maybe it was the cider talking, or the fact that I have been on an Irish kick lately, but I truly enjoyed my meal at Ri Ra.  The waitress was very helpful with a killer accent.  The soda bread was excellent and I could have eaten more but didn't want to fill up. I had the potato cakes appetizer which was two large cakes with a vinaigrette sauce.  It was very tasty, it could have been a little crisper, but it did have a light fluffy texture.  For my main course I had the fish and chips.  The fish was light and flaky and the coating was crisp.  You only get one piece of fish but it was a decent size and after the ceasar salad, soda bread and  potato cakes, it was more than enough.  The fries were about the only negative about the meal, limp and soggy.  Ri Ra was a nice surprise and was a good place to watch the hockey games.LOVE Ri Ra! From the food to the service you really cant say a bad thing about this Irish Pub.With the majority of the employees being from Ireland they certainly know their whiskey... and how to pour the perfect Guinness. Theres always loud music, it really makes the place feel alive. A little on the expensive side, but its worth checking out.This is my favorite spot to visit after work. Especially on Fridays.. its 40% off food for locals! Ive tried the fish n chips, potato cakes, shrimp cocktail, salmon cakes, and the Guinness Burger and omg. i cant choose a favorite because theyre all amazing!We stop here every time we're at THEhotel or Mandalay it always exceeds expectations. If you want good pub food, good beer, a pleasant wait staff or an obscure Irish whiskey, you will get that, but just a little bit better because it's actually reasonably priced. The best value I've found in Vegas. Certainly the best value anywhere on Mandalay property.Having spent some time in Dublin, and in several "traditional" Irish pubs;  This place is probably about 60-70% close in authenticity.  The realism, of the bar and overall look and feel almost makes you feel like you really are in Ireland.  It's just the simple fact that you know you're in Vegas, and the newness of it simply out-weighs hanging out at an old bar that generations of people have relaxed in.  Anyways, here's what I ordered, and why I loved this pub:~ Deviled Scotch Eggs:  These were 4 pieces of breaded deviled eggs that were creamy and crunchy.  The yolk mix was slightly different than your mustard tasting center.  They call their center a creamy yolk mousse.  Truly a different starter choice.~ Dubliner Burger:  A ground lamb patty with a rosemary aroma.  Now this was a super juicy burger, combined with goat cheese, grilled red onion, and a curry aioli... Man I'm gettin' hungry just thinking about it.  The burger was nice and beefy, and the bun nice and soft.~ Fish 'n' Chips (small):  Now, the cod was cooked just right, soft and steamy.  The chips were also nice and meaty for fries.  The only thing is, this was not a Dublin sized cod in my opinion.  I regretfully wish I ordered the large.  I should've known better.  All about service:~ I'm so glad we sat a the bar.  Amanda, our server-bartender did a great job in keeping us company.  She shared some of her favorites from the menu, and made sure our water glasses were filled.  I asked for a Guinness, and she poured it pretty fast.  A "no no" in the process, so minus one star.  Yes, I was critiquing, haha!Atmosphere:~ As I had mentioned above, the set up was nice only you won't get that Irish feel.  The feeling of knowing you're in a pub that's 150+ years old.  You'll have an American watery Guinness, which was what I expected.  As nothing beats a Guinness made from the waters of Ireland.  A mix of people/tourist.  I mean, for the first time, I had wished there were more drunks singing along and mingling.  Oh well, no biggie, but I definitely a good time hanging out here!  Overall:I'd come back!  The food is good, and the prices are above average.  Worth checking out!
Thrive!=Ok, so I finally tried their acai bowls and they're AMAZING as well!  I especially love the Strawberry Passion, Go Green, and Raspberry Pecan!Come here to get an amazing ACAI BOWL. So many different flavors of delicious smoothies and shakes. My favorite is the original. It's a blend of strawberry blueberries banana ACAI Sorbet, and apple juice. It's topped with granola, strawberries banana, blueberries, and honey. Can't go wrong. I love their punch card system. Every 10 bowls bought you get a free medium and they're so filling. ENJOY
Cave & Ives=UMMMMMMMM...can I just say that this place needs to get more action!  The pizzas here are FANTASTIC!!  I discovered this place because it opened above SACKS.  It is around the corner from my house and I am so thankful it is.  The whole restaurant is open...I wish it had a little more space, but that is ok.  First, the Tuscan Pie is to die for!!  It has prosciutto, Gorgonzola, apple, arugula, a fig marmalade and balsalmic vingerette reduction sauce drizzled on top...at least I think that is what it is...I need to check the menu...but anyways its FABULOUS!!!  I wish I could eat it everyday!  I tried their Moroccan Pizza before they took it off the menu and it was awesome too!  Every single salad is great and the wine and beer selection is great too!  The staff is so nice and friendly.  I get this to go all the time and bring it home...and I have shared this with my friends too.  I love good Italian pizza and its great!
Poutineville=Super service et excellentes poutines ! Lors du passage à Montréal d'un couple d'amis américains, je me décide à leur fait goûter une spécialité bien québecoise. Quel succès ! Chez Poutineville, on customize sont plat: on choisit le type de pommes de terres (les maisons sont délicieuses), la sauce, les fromages, les viandes et les légumes. On peut l'avoir gratinée...En tout cas, mieux vaut arriver avec une grosse faim car les portions sont généreuses. Le restaurant propose aussi des poutines-spécialités avec des recettes déjà bien établies pour les moins imaginatifs ou aventureux, ainsi que plusieurs recettes classiques type burgers ou salade ceasar.Le staff était également aux petits soins et nous a très bien conseillé ! Bref, un super endroit que je vous recommande vivement lorsque vous en quête d'une soirée bien québécoise :)It would be sacreligious to visit Montreal without getting some poutine. I've had a few poutine experiences throughout Canada and even visited some wannabe places in the States. They are typically hole in the walls, but what would you expect when ordering fries topped with gravy and cheese?I was pleasantly surprised to find that Poutineville was a pretty nice restaurant. And even more pleasantly surprised to discover that they let you make your own poutine. You get to pick the fries, type of sauce, toppings, etc. This place should be renamed Poutine Heaven! Speaking of heaven they also serve fried pickles here, which is every pregnant woman's dream. I was happy that our waiter spoke English so he could help me navigate this new poutine world. I chose sweet potato fries, red wine sauce, a variety of vegetable toppings and even some bacon.  It was absolutely delicious! The red wine sauce was a bit gravyish for my taste, but guess that's to be expected since poutine is typically topped with gravy sauce.One of my dining companions mentioned she was never able to finish the massive "small" order of poutine, but have to admit I did a good job finishing mine thanks to the future linebacker currently living my stomach.
The Herb Box=Sophie you were right!OH! MY! GOD!  That doesn't even begin to cover it! Very cute place, I sat in the center patio corridor with the market to the left and the dining room to the right.Everything sounded so delicious! I decided on the Artichoke and White Bean Hummus and the Butternut Squash and Corn Enchiladas which came with a wonderful salad (see pictures)Every bite was delectable, I couldn't bear the thought of wasting so of course I finished every last bite of it all!I know I must sound like a cow but unfortunately I'm lacking the 3 extra stomachs to take advantage of the rest of the menu.......those would have come in really handy because I didn't want to leave, I Was in Food Heaven!Deliciously Fresh and Gourmet!My 5 stars are for the food experienceThe service was actually awful, as I had to get up to retrieve my own silverware and even help my self to the Ice tea pitcher because some one never refilled my glass!They say Love is Blind right ,and I LOVED the Food so I'll over look the lazy service.Hate to say it, but I just didn't love it.   There, I've said it.  After tasting the mushroom risotto appetizers at Yelp's Birthday event, I couldn't wait to come to Herb Box for lunch.The restaurant has a nice layout with a dine-in area, a little market, and a patio in between.  We sat inside and started with the market cheese board.  There was only one cheese selection, I expected there to be at least two for some reason, but it was delicious--brie with a caramel-like sauce (fig, I think).  I also had the grilled chicken and sage pesto sandwich with goat cheese and bacon.  It was good, but it wasn't an "OMG, this is the best sandwich I've ever had moment."  I really think serving it warm would bring out the flavors.  Worth $12?  I think not.  Sweet potato chips were a plus!Where they really lose points with me was service.  Not terrible, but definitely left a lot to be desired.  I had to ask for utensils and napkins.  Also, she offered a box for half my sandwich and left the room, but came back empty-handed.  Empty hand, empty head.Just okay for me.  But I might have to have a party for one catered just to get those appetizers again!There's a hair in my arugula. A long, straight hair. I know what you're thinking ... 'well, that's better than a short and curly hair.' Although true, I'm just not in need of the extra protein. Plenty of that provided by the grilled tenderloin sitting atop of said arugula and beside aforementioned hair.I chose not to make a scene as the place - early afternoon on a Tuesday - was fairly full of fine female patrons. I removed the hair with surgical precision and proceeded to enjoy my lunch. And enjoy, I did.I saw many many savory items on the menu, but I can only speak to the Arugula-Gorgonzola Steak. Tasty. Oh ... and the sweet potato chips were the truth as well. The place is kinda' unique in that it shares two different suites - a "market" on one side and an "eatery" on the other - joined by a breezeway in the middle. One could enjoy their meal, or a glass of wine outside if one so desired. Four stars. I'm not deducting anything for the hair, but the 'Box is awfully proud of their prices and the service leaves much to be desired. I mean, the gal that occasionally tended to me was friendly ... just not necessarily well-versed in the art of prompt, accommodation of customer requests. Like the one I made for silverware and a napkin. Twice. That said, the Herb Box was a cute little joint and I'm sure I'll be stopping in again for lunch when I find myself hocking fenestrations mid-day in north Scottsdale. Next time I'll try a twelve-dollar sandwich. Brown Sugar Pork Ciabatta. Sans follicle, if I may.Time for an Herb Box update... this one is specifically for the catering side of the business.  Read on if you want details on the pre-pre-Wedding celebration we had at our house last Thursday night.I always knew that when the time was right, I'd have the Herb Box cater a party for me... and the time finally came.  We had about 40 people over at our house on the Thursday night before our wedding.  It was primarily our friends that flew in from out of town early and we really wanted to entertain.  So I reached out to Robert, Director of Catering, and explained what we were thinking about.  He responded in no time at all and he was extremely professional as we went back and forth a few times on pricing, menu, etc... the outcome was perfect.  We had a buffet style dinner including a chef and two buffet attendants.  Robert and Mary came over to the house a few days before to do a walk-through, and go over details.  On the day of our event, the team came early and went above and beyond, even running to the store for us to pick up lemons and limes.  I know you're dying to know what our menu was, aren't you?  Okay - I'll share!  Here you go:-Urban Market Salad with watercress, red pepper, dried corn, sugared pecans, avocado, and blue cheese vinaigrette (dressing on the side)-Citrus & Rum Free-Range Chicken with watercress, pear-gorgonzola salsa-Alaskan Salmon with maple-ginger glaze-Asparagus couscous with feta and mint-Grilled vegetable feast with farmers goat cheese and herbs-and of course my favorite, the Signature Sweet Potato Chips dusted with mild curryWe arrived at the above menu after looking through around eight pages worth of gourmet menu items that are all appealing possibilities if you choose to use the Herb Box to cater your event.  They worked within our budget and made it quite an evening to remember.  I highly recommend using The Herb Box whether you're catering a party for 12 or 100+.  Just trust me on one thing - make sure you get those sweet potato chips!I'm a fan of The Herb Box. I realize I'd been there once before and really enjoyed it then as well.Today the family came by to meet for lunch and I happened to have an email in my inbox with the new lunch menu at Shea. Talk about good timing. I'm trying to be a bit better at eating healthy and looking at the menu, there seemed to be a number of selections that would let me do that & still enjoy the food.From looking at the menu, it was nice to see that they buy local where possible and are part of the Slow Food movement.We started with the housemade sweet potato chips with sea salt and curry. These are ridiculously addictive. My 2  year old kept telling us "don't eat them all" and putting her hand over the basket. We all couldn't stop. While they might not really be, they even seemed healthy-ish (for chips anyway). I'd love to see if they had an extra curry version.For lunch, we ordered the market sunflower salad (with chicken, bacon, goat cheese, dried berries, sunflower seeds & balsamic vinaigrette), the blackened chicken caesar salad (with crisp romaine, cotija cheese, tortilla strips and a chipotle-parmesan caesar dressing), and the kids split the brown sugar pork sandwich (with watercress-jicama slaw).As our little ones have dairy and egg allergies, they were great about working around that and giving us suggestions. They were super nice with the kids too.The food was excellent all the way around. I'm not by nature a big salad guy but I went that way as I'm trying to lay off the carbs a bit. I really liked both and will be eager to order either of them again. I'm also eager to try some of the more carb-y items on the menu when I can. They had a couple of soups that sounded wonderful. The service was great. Our server was quite knowledgeable, super personable and very engaging. He also put up with our 2 girls flirting with him non-stop.As far as drinks, we did green tea and blackberry jasimine tea. Both were quite nice.As I'm committed to staying on this healthy train, I think there will be many, many more visits to The Herb Box in my future. At present, I'm hard pressed to think a better healthy/tasty lunch option.This was just...  OK.  After hearing and reading so many great things about The Herb Box I was sure I would really enjoy it.  Well, no.  Not so much.  Especially disappointing because my Mom was with me during an all-too-brief visit to AZ, and I really wanted to take her somewhere great.  We arrived around 1:30, purposefully avoiding the 'lunch rush'.  I thought this would be a good thing.  What we found was a disorganized and distracted staff and a lot of uncleared tables.  Once we were seated and given menus, we were pretty much abandoned for a good 10 minutes.  At last a couple of glasses of water arrived, but the waitress disappeared again before we could place our order.  She came in and out of the dining area, seating others and even taking their orders, but didn't acknowledge us until I was ready to A) fold the menu into a paper airplane and aim it at her head and B) leave.  Helloooooooooo????At last we were able to order.  Hooray!  Wait, don't get excited yet, she didn't enter the orders into the terminal.  Oops.  When we finally received our food it was not exactly worth waiting that long for, either.  I had the Market Sunflower Salad and my mom had the Blackened Chicken Caesar Wrap.  While good, I don't think either dish warranted the $12 price tags.  It is lettuce and chicken, people.  Really.Yes, the location is 'cute' and 'quaint'.  Yes the ingredients are fresh.  Perhaps if we had a different waitress I would have been happier.Amazing !! Amazing!! Amazing !!  -- Herb Box is becoming my new found meet for lunch / dinner spot.  Local food made fresh and delicious with savory spot -on flavors..you must try it! It's been awhile since I have wanted to write a review for anything, but tonight my tastebuds and I want to sing to the world! Hallelujah and Rejoice!  I have always loved the far north Herb Box which is a lovely place and a great place. But now Herb Box is more centrally located in Scottsdale at the  larger Southbridge venue. This promises to be a great place to meet friends for breakfast, lunch or dinner  when anywhere near the  area. The brand new look and feel says we have thought this out and we want you to be comfortable but feel impressed. Great spacing , lighting and seating make the place very inviting ...it just screams bring your friends over, meet me for a drink or appetizer,  stop in for breakfast after farmers market. Don't miss the girls bathroom .Regal feel with some sweet surprise...yes that is a sink...the mirror felt like I was Alice in Wonderland....Tonight  for dinner we enjoyed the lovely cilantro and crab dip with fried plantains ,that make me smile and plot how I can steal more...shall I say it accidentally feel on the floor and demand more ? I just might.  Shh don't tell.Mike and I split the flatbread/ pizza with pear and Gorgonzola that just excites the tongue...It is savory comfort food for sure. We also split the Thai Ribs..Oh my Gravy !!..wow!! ..ribs with BBQ sauce that is completely thai and spicy and burn  you but   in  a good way ..loved it! We also had the Gouda mac and cheese,  creamy , rich and make you fell like someone whipped the up just for you..Mom had a large piece of salmon roasted in honey with guess what?  super tasty parsnips ..yup I said parsnips...I thought they were a joke food but no longer, parsnips are now on my to do list. We finished off the meal with more mind grabbing tastes. biting into  a chocolate tart that had the right mix of sweet and decadence without feeling like you ate a spoonful of  chocolate frosting ,very cravable and a must for every diner. We also shared a sweet little Crostina with berries ...tasted great, without an over sweetness so common to many restaurants.I  must also mention the great blackberry jasmine green tea , so refreshing. The Herb Box is full of great tastes , and if that is not enough ,...there is an adjacent market  chocked full of great tastes to go with an emphasis on local fare. ( think CROWS DAIRY and QUEEN CREEK OLIVE MILL ) They have foods to go , cheeses , dairy and great out of this world baked goods.  My plan, next time I need a bite before heading to the mall, is to grab a delicious treat , a small wedge of chees and a piece of fruit , no more mall food for me. Yes I loved it .Yelpers keep your eyes open for the UYE soon to be announced   by me    ...You are in for a delightful treat.If eating at a place two days in a row says anything about the way I feel, then I might as well call Herb Box my new Old Town cuisine love. It's been with much anticipation that I've waited for the Herb Box to open in this prime real estate at the Waterfront. Was it everything I hoped for? Yes and it's finally given the area the jolt it needs.Upstairs Dining:I first dined here yesterday for a work lunch. During the midst of the BCS bowl madness, I noticed and nodded in approval for how calm, cool and collected the staff remained no matter the amount of chaos surrounding them. While deciding between sitting inside and outside, I did a quick walk-through of the restaurant and noticed that both atmospheres seemed appealing and comfortable for dining. So, after opting for outdoor seating, the dining experience began. First off, I was happy to see how fast they refill drinks. It probably wasn't good for my diet coke addiction, but it made me happy anyway! I went for the Mediterranean wrap with turkey and the sweet potato chips. Every ingredient was filling and fresh all at the same time. I could tell that I was giving my body the solid nutrients it needed while satisfying my hunger and typical love for fatty food. The sweet potato chips are temptation on a plate. They are salty, crispy and sweet all fried into one glorious chip. The meal was hearty but not too hearty and therefore perfect for an afternoon lunch that will get you through the rest of the day. The patio was enjoyable and although it was a little chilly out, they had heaters around to warm it up. I've definitely found a new lunchtime favorite in the Herb Box and will be suggesting a visit here whenever I have a lunch appointment!The Market I almost feel like the Herb Box dining room and market deserve two separate reviews, so I'm breaking it up. I have been waiting and hoping for more markets like this to open in Old Town! I am always on the go and sometimes I just want to run in and out and get a decent meal while avoiding the sit down service. Welcome Herb Box Market! For my second visit (for the second day in a row mind you), I visited the Market to place my order and I was pleasantly surprised to see that many of the options were pre-made and ready to go! I debated between another wrap or a salad but I went the salad route this time. The tuna salad looked tasty but I normally avoid tuna because of the mayo...that is until they told me that this tuna is actually relatively low in fat and doesn't have any mayo! Amen Herb Box! Now I know where I can go for my tuna fix without requiring an additional 30 minutes at the gym! I love hummus and they sell individual hummus there, so I made that purchase as well. Just like my dining experience, my meal left me satisfied and full but not feeling like a fattie. I noticed some delectable looking pastries as well as olive oils and other natural goodies too. The girl at the counter told me that they focus on making their meals in the healthiest way possible. That makes me and the inner fat kid inside me feel much better! I plan on staying away from the Herb Box for at least two days (hopefully) but I can't wait to visit again and again!And before I go, I have to mention the bathrooms...the bathrooms are as cool as I remembered from a visit to shop that lived in this location before Herb became the word. Each stall has its own setup including a sink behind closed doors...so be sure to check them out!I have a confession to make. When I found out that I'd be visiting Scottsdale for work, I secretly thought that the places where we'd be eating and drinking for the week wouldn't hold a candle to my favorite spots in other cities I've visited, like San Francisco, LA, Chicago or NYC. Well, I was wrong and I will happily eat my slice of humble pie, especially if it's from The Herb Box. The first thing I noticed about the spot was how open and stylish the space was. I loved the old timey bicycle decorating the back wall, I loved the funky upholstery, I loved the classy bathrooms even. My preconceived notions continued to break down as I perused the menu. For lunch, the offered row after row of amazing options, from fresh made sweet potato chips to a lunch plat du fromage to a whole array of salads and sandwiches. I went with the coconut shrimp salad and when it came out I practically dove head first into the bowl, devouring the ridiculously fresh veiggies and freshly fried shrimp. I think at one point I cried out, "It feels like a garden is blooming in my mouth!!" The meal was complete with a nibble of some of those famous sweet potato chips and a gulp of their mango lemonade. Then why not five stars, you ask? Well, the service was slow. Very slow. They warned us that it might be as we had a large party, but 40 minutes for your dishes to come out just doesn't cut it, I'm sorry. When we asked about the progress our waiter said that it was due to all of our special requests, "like asking for steak on your salad." This confused me, as getting steak on your salad was an option listed on the menu, so it didn't seem so special to me. Nevertheless, our waiter was a nice guy and I didn't begrudge him too much, or the ktichen staff, especially when the chef/owner checked in on us a couple of times to see how we were doing. Unfortunately for the first time we didn't have much to tell her as we had yet to receive any food. I think they may have felt bad because they sent out an amazing array of desserts. Everyone loved the cream cheese frosting on the red velvet cupcake but I found the cake very dry and tough. People also loved their dessert which was basically a giant Reese's peanut butter cup. We took their orange cream cupcake to our next destination as a gift and the recipient was one happy lady. So, while in good conscience I can't give a place five stars when it takes forever for lunch, everyone else had received their food, and we were late to our next appointment because of it, but everything else was on par so I'm going to hope that it was a one-time fluke and give them the props that they deserve!First of all, many thanks to the awesome Deb L. and her fun-loving hubby Michael, for hosting tonight's UYE at this elegant restaurant!  (It's definitely "date night" material-- and not only for romantic couples; I spotted a father and daughter, dressed to the nines, and they looked like they were having a great time!)  Nine of us were in attendance, and I'd say that the dinner was a huge success!  This was my first visit, and while I had to leave shortly after the food came out, I felt sad leaving this very lively group-- it was great to have caught up w/ Deb, Mike, and Heather C., and so nice to have made new acquaintances!  I hadn't even left the building yet, and I already knew I was coming back!  (Heather, we're definitely doing breakfast SOON!)While waiting for other Yelpers to arrive, I'd inquired about whether HB only served wines, since that was the only drink menu that was presented to us, but no, our friendly and very helpful server Chelsea said that HB had a full bar, and that she would return to let us know what specialty cocktails they had to serve that evening.  Besides their house red sangria ($9?), HB was also offering a Blackberry mojito ($9) and a St. Germain elderflower margarita ($11).  While both sounded delicious, I decided to go w/ the mojito since I have a large bottle of the elderflower liquor ($32!) sitting in my fridge back home (I was inspired to buy after having some elderflower champagne flutes at Chandler's Cork!)  Oh. My. God!  If you like berries, you MUST try this mojito!  It was so full of muddled whole blackberries, you'd think it was puree, and it wasn't overly sweet-- I felt like I was having quite a nutritious beverage!  I hardly tasted the alcohol...  I very much wanted to order another one, but I knew I had to leave early.  I cannot wait to come back for happy hour!  :DBy the time everyone showed up and had a chance to make introductions and make really interesting chit-chat (again, Deb and Mike were great hosts!), we were ready to order and eat!  I kid you not, everyone's selections looked amazing!  I'm sure we'll be reading about their selections soon enough, so let me tell you about mine...I was curious about the gouda mac 'n cheese from the very moment I read about it on Deb's prior review, so I knew to order these.  How fortunate to see that the Thai BBQ baby back ribs came w/ a side of it, as well as a green apple slaw.  I concede that the mac 'n cheese was good, but I think it would've been better w/ more cheese and slightly more crunchy breadcrumbs.  The sour apple slaw provided a nice crunch and just enough sweet-sour to counteract the spiciness of the baby back ribs.  Ohhh... those tender ribs!  The BBQ sauce was thick, sticky, sweet, yet had a great kick!  (I didn't find it too spicy, but others might... you've been warned!)  It was very fortunate for Mom that I had to leave the party so soon, or else she would not have had the chance to try the leftovers; there wouldn't have been any to take home!  (And yes, she's already eaten the rest of the meal!)Afterwards, I stopped at the adjoining market to take home a slice of Chocolate-peanut butter banana bread cake ($5), a Strawberry-blackberry handpie ($5), and a goat cheese-chive potato cake ($3).  (So many of the others had a potato cake as a side to their entree, and I was so envious-- they looked great on the plates, and everyone said they were delicious, and I completely agree w/ them!)  Loved the potato cake's great textures- the caramelized outer crust had enough crunch, but quickly yielded to reveal the buttery potato delight, w/ goat cheese crumbles all-throughout inside-- not at all greasy, and I loved the rich and creamy consistency that the goat cheese gave to the potato cake!  I will have to buy some of these to take home on every visit from now on!  FYI, the desserts were perfect, as well!  The crust on the handpie tasted almost like shortbread, the sugared top of the crust was exquisitely crisped, and the fresh berry filling also incorporated a citrus-y element-- my guess is orange peel/bergarmot oil essence.  The banana bread cake was so moist, had beautiful texture (see pics),  not too sweet, and packed full of banana goodness... Loved the peanut butter layer under the chocolate ganache "icing" (no powdered sugar used in their icings here!).  The cake also had peanut butter drizzle all over the top.  It's a pretty cake, and I wouldn't hesitate to order a whole one to-go...  Hey, Heather-- you free this weekend??Every single thing that I put in my mouth was sublime.No, seriously. Every single thing.Is that not all you need to know? I'd stop reading here and just *go* already.Still reading? Fine, it's my duty to back up such proclamations, isn't it.Specifics:First we have an *exquisite* lunch special. You won't hear me saying such things too often, as lunchtime for others is usually my breakfast time. When y'all are scarfing down soup and sandwiches, I'm on my second cup of coffee and a biscotti. But since the day I visited Herb Box it was, in fact, lunchtime, you can trust.The special I chose (there are several) was the soup/salad/sandwich special, which varies from day to day I believe. On this day it was a potato leek soup, a grilled sandwich with gorgonzola and vegetables and a salad of fresh greens, candied pecans and gorgonzola.My mouth dropped when it came out, for I expected a small offering of each, but received a large sandwich, a cup of soup and a generous salad.Vegetarian options? You bet. Several. I wanted to sample things, so I opted for the triple threat plate. Otherwise, if you're looking for something on the lighter side, you cannot go wrong with one of the bountiful salads.Speaking of healthy and light options, they have deep fried olives stuffed with bleu cheese. And amazing sweet potato chips (I'm not even a fan of sweet potatoes) Heh. Seriously, need I go on about the virtues of such things? Order a salad, splurge on an app. I do it all the time...But I didn't do it on the day I lunched at Herb Box. Come on, I couldn't! Remember, I don't lunch very often. I tend to treat my work trips as mini vacations, so all intentions of eating light are out the window. And, and...fried olives! I don't even think Rachel Zoe is going to pass up a fried olive.Herb Box boasts a glorious environs. You feel like you're sitting outside even when you're not. It made me forget, for a few moments, that it was January (perhaps I forgot until my plane landed in snow-ridden Kansas City). They've got the sophisticated, yet relaxed vibe going on, which I noticed is common in Scottsdale. I really love this.So, I think Herb Box wins as one of the best lunches I've had. Ever! If all places were like this, I'd so be on my way to becoming a Lady Who Lunches instead of a lady who coffees.Will Yelp ever bring us the 1/2 star? I know everyone would use it. I had a 3.5 star experience.We (Jim W, our daughter Abby and I) joined fellow Yelpers Scott W, Heather and Ryan C and organizer Aileen B for a brunch UYE this morning. So the company was five star.I would give the atmosphere and service five stars as well. The place has a really open feel and the patio looked very inviting. The service was unobtrusive yet attentive. My water glass never ran empty.The place they lost me was the food. I ordered steak and eggs. The steak was delicious, albeit petite. The fingerling potatoes were fine, nothing to write home about. But the eggs were not cooked right. If you can't get my scrambled eggs right (I order them scrambled lightly) you're not going to wow me. Especially if you charge me $15 for a diminutive steak and smattering of overdone eggs. I thought all the offerings a tad pricey, which my family attributed to Scottsdale Waterfront real estate prices, but this was the first time I have ever been hungry between brunch and dinner.Would I go there again? Possibly. I doubt I'd go for brunch. But the raves over dinner make me curious. Maybe they could wow me the second time around.Ok, so I rarely get to Old Town to eat.  RARELY.  I'm a CenPho grrrl.  But, when Chef Bec invites you out to try stuff, you go.  Pronto!!!!Sat at the bar, since it was a Friday and I guess that's where people sit.  Went with Kirti for happy hour & just to chill.  Not only was the service great (I rarely had to ask for a refill), but the chef even came out to introduce herself.  The place wasn't too crowded yet, which was good, because that's another reason for all the attention.  Had to keep the worker bees busy!  First thing we tried was the ribs appetizer.  They were falling off the bone and had an amazingly sticky-spicy-sweet sauce on them.  Also had the crab dip, which came with plantain chips.  I loooooooooove plantain chips.  Love.  The pork tacos?  OMG.  O. M. G.  I took a couple home as leftovers and my mouth watered all night, thinking about those tacos.For dessert, we had "crack pie."  I don't even know what was in it, but the crust was nutty, there was whipped cream, and it stuck to my teeth when I ate it.  And it was made from crack.  It HAD to be!!!!!!  The red velvet cupcake was also divine, but that crack pie...*sigh*Parking is a bitch in Old Town, but there is a garage right near The Herb Box.I'm going 3.75 stars here.  I really like the decor.  It struck me as somewhere between Cape Cod beach house and something you might pick up in Arcadia for 1.5 million.The service was great.  I went with buckwheat pancakes for my brunch meal although I did get to sample several other meals as well.My buckwheat pancakes were hearty and delicious.  The red velvet pancakes I tried were great as well.  I also tried the salmon hash (good but not my thing..)I found the prices top be slightly high but I'm sure that any restaurant in this vicinity has to tack on a bit to cover the real estate.Thanks to Aileen B for setting this brunch up!We went to the Herb Box to eat lunch over the weekend after doing some par-oozing through old town.  This has been on our list of "must try places to dine" after reading so many fellow Yelper reviews.  It was an awesome start with a few drinks listening some fantastic live music on the patio!Restaurant ~ the patio is the place to eat if available, especially when they have entertainment.  It's a wrap around patio so there are different options to choose from.  The inside is very nice, somewhat of a north eastern coastal design with comfy chairs unless your stuck with one of the plain wooden chairs. (I know these plain chairs provide more balance to the decor but they are they are not comfy!)  Service ~ was very good, not exceptional but good.  They are very attentive to your drinks however they are not as attentive to your meal after it arrives.  Food ~ 5 stars for freshness!  Everything we ordered was extremely fresh from the salads to the veggies.   We order their Flat-bread with smoked BBQ chicken, bacon, Gouda cheese, organic greens, slice cherry tomato and onions.  It was very good.  The greens on top of the flat bread were tossed lightly in oil and were delish!  Everything on the flat bread was very good however it had too many cherry tomato halves, which were picked off half way through.  We also order the gilled Kobe Feta Burger with lots, and I mean lots! of arugula, grilled onion, with a little bit of red pepper aioli with a side of sweet potato chips.  After pulling off some of the arugula so I could see my succulent kobe beef patty we dug in!  This is a very tasty burger but the feta cheese and aioli were very sparse, almost non existent.  We had to ask for more aioli sauce twice.  The sweet potato chips were very delish and became very addictive to everyone at the table.  We should have ordered more...   We also ordered the smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese with bread crumbs.  This was a miss for us since it lacked the creamy cheesy goodness it should of had but rather it was all pasta with some light shavings of gouda cheese and bread crumbs.  It was very bland and we think there was more bread crumbs than cheese... The Herb Box seems like a very nice place to dine with friends and family, especially on their patio when they have some entertainment.  We plan to come back for more sweet potato chips and to try something else on their menu.  It is A-OK.Herb Box tops my list for one of my favorite locations for lunchtime or dinnertime dining, but just recently I experienced Sunday brunch here for the first time. This is definitely a reasonably priced Sunday brunch option. In fact, it's the same price as it is any other time during the week, but on Sunday, in addition to several lunch items, they also offer breakfast options such as Cinnamon pancakes, Market BLTs, breakfast flat breads, goat cheese omelets. While sitting out on the patio and enjoying the breezy late morning environment (they open at 11 on Sundays), I enjoyed the Market BLT which was a fried egg topped with pancetta, ricotta and served on brioche. I only ate about half of the bread it was served on because it was such a large portion, but the meal was pretty good. I would have liked it to come with some fruit but I'll know to ask for that next time. I noticed a dog sitting on the patio, which made me wonder if they have a dog friendly patio. I will look into this and report back because I know a certain cockapoo in my life named Harley who would have enjoyed this morning meal as well!expectations - reality = disappointmentwhile i still think the service here is awful 85% of the time, the food and atmosphere are too good to keep us away. i have to update my review to be fair because in all honesty i eat here at least 1 or twice a week for lunch. food= 5 starspatio= 5 starsservice= 0just lower your expectations on the service so that when you do get someone great you are pleasantly surprised! things i recommend in the order of how often i order them:sunflower salad- my fav salad on the planetwhite bean chili- oh gosh!!!! they need to do like a soup+salad/sandwich combo asappesto chicken sandwich w sweet potato chipsthat's pretty much all i order but i can say that their enchiladas are the bomb and so is the quesdilla. as for the desserts down in the market, we have yet to try something that wasn't amazing. crack pie, chocolate mousse thing in a mini pie crust, cake slices...seriously whenever we go for dessert it's amazing. the service in the market is alwas good, too!july 8, 2012For my birthday brunch, I ordered four menu items to share amongst everyone, which included the red velvet pancakes (but of course!), the Herb Tomato, goat cheese, and chive omelet, the Market BLT (I've tried it before, and it was fantastic!), and a new addition to the menu, one I'd wanted to try for two years now, but I keep missing the opportunity-- the Bourbon-ginger peach brioche French toast!  I also ordered two mango mimosas for my cousin and me (Mom and aunt did not want any)...What more can I say about the red velvet pancakes that I haven't said before? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=25P_k0Ot6qR9aV5IYzGTVQ#25P_k0Ot6qR9aV5IYzGTVQ  Just order them when you go, and thank me later.  I skipped on the omelet this time http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=YO8Ft30ml8XwNW4K2Drq3Q#YO8Ft30ml8XwNW4K2Drq3Q, since I had only one thing on my mind, and it was the French toast... OMG! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=pC5n1Ejy5dpyvZQlY1uTBQ#pC5n1Ejy5dpyvZQlY1uTBQ  This is how French toast should be prepared-- crispy, yet not greasy, on the outside and tender, not fluffy, on the inside.  The ratio of custard batter to bread was spot-on.  Nothin'  soggy 'bout it.  Oh, and the bourbon-ginger peach compote that was the crux of the entree?  Superb!  Yeah, I had to ask for another pot of this.  Hey, I'll take a couple of jars home, if you got some to sell!  I seriously hope I never have to choose between the red velvet pancakes and the French toast, because I wouldn't, COULDN'T begin to contemplate.  The only disappointment during the whole meal was the Street Market BLT. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=L03fNbFT9uWaiI69ELoUFw#L03fNbFT9uWaiI69ELoUFw  While the ingredients- pancetta, wild arugula, tomato, ricotta, and a fried egg (mmm... there's something about arugula and fried egg together...) tasted fantastic, the bread was over-charred, and it just almost ruined the dish.  I just peeled the bread back and ate the goodness in between.  Hmm... yeah.  'Tis best not to go there.Mango mimosas for $5 a pop?  I see many more Sundays off from work in my future!p.s.  Thank you Shad, and THB, for my glorious red velvet birthday cupcake! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=dk-G0E6bgC4JoZOQBPaqfQ#dk-G0E6bgC4JoZOQBPaqfQ  Three of us kept going back to the plate for more, and there were still leftovers... You were so right-- the cream cheese frosting was spectacular!
Twisted Italian=The GoodThe Hostess and Waitress seemed nice and the place is cute modern neat and clean .The BadBread basket contained squishy bread (Italians don't eat this kind of bread) but they do get a point for adding an herb and salting the top . pizzetta (margarita) I don't know how to describe but the crust had that very similar taste to frozen pizzas not even like a bad pizza out and unripe roma tomatoes were placed on top , the addition of some fresh basil topped the pie but didn't save it from tasting sort of cardboard like this was not tasty and after a bite or two we didn't feel like eating more .Herb roasted salmon tasted farm raised and was cooked to approx well done not sure about herbs but it tasted like salt pepper and garlic just a notch better than salmon off an Asian Buffet . This salmon ($15.75) dinner only came with what I think was the frozen broccoli cauliflower carrot mix you can always taste frozen especially in the broccoli . If I had this same meal in a food court at the mall  I'd say it was OK for a food court meal but even fresh vegetables are served at Panda Express and I don't intentionally go out to eat and pay for meals that are far lower quality than what I'd eat at home .My husband had the penne pepperonata and he thought his peppers were raw and said the sauce tasted like crushed tomatoes out of a can without seasoning also the pasta was gooey and over done .I do feel sick and sad for who ever owns this place and I hope they aren't like this all the time .I hope they get help from someone on how to prepare better food .Last Night was our first visit here but even Wild Horses would not be able to drag us back for a second visit .as a slight update the owner contacted me and said I was a "mudslinger" and he said I HAD A GOAL in saying something awful about his place...Gosh I don't know what I set wrong in my Yelp for not getting his message posted.I am NOT endorsing not to visit his place.....he didn't say anything about what I said about the food. maybe I was there when they weren't at their best?maybe we've ordered what they do least well?and maybe? they've improved since...I hope sogive them a try......I don't know what to say to the owner other than that.also I will mention now...that I left out we took our unfinished pizza home and it was packed sent to us all stuck together so I had to throw it out...I wanted to retry in case I was too harsh but as I said before they had unripe tomatoes that day so it didn't taste good and the dough I think might be frozen or a mix?I've given this place more than a few attempts to redeem itself. I personally feel that just because I had a bad experience at first doesn't necessarily mean it'll be bad the second or third time. Could've been a hiccup of sorts or poor staff.That being said, my latest "adventure" was nothing short of a dissaster. Sounds a bit dramatic I know but let me explain. I walk in, look around, place is empty and there's no hostess or a sign that says seat yourself...nothing. My boyfriend and I look at eachother and shrug so we find a cozy spot in a booth/table. It was a chilly evening and some italian comfort food sounded pretty good to me. Funny thing is my boyfriend warned me we should have gone to Olive Garden or something but I didn't want to drive far. About 8-10 minutes go by and a waitress who looked like she was not enjoying her day looks at us and sighs heavily. I looked at my watch to check if perhaps we came in right before closing time. (I know I would hate it as a server therefore I try to never do that) ...it was 8:30. I shrug it off thinking she's just having a bad day so I'm super nice to her and ask her how her day was..."fine" OK I get it cool. I ask for some cheesy bread for starter and a diet coke. (I know it's bad for you and I don't drink it often but I was in the mood for one and so was my bf) She asked us if we were ready to order our dinner, I said no, and she says, "Well just holler at me when you're ready" K...Cheesy bread comes and it's cold, diet cokes are flat and I'm biting my tongue. If there's one thing I hate it's complaining when the server is already upset. I didn't want anyone spitting in my food. My bf looks at me and pretty much reads my mind. We agreed to stay and see how the main course goes. At this point, we're ready to order...I decide with the baked ziti and the bf orders just a cheese pizza. Thinking sure that should be manageable right? No...food was cold and the pizza contained onions? Never asked for them and they aren't even standard on a cheese pizza. I'm thinking at this point that someone is totally messing with us. Needless to say, I would not be giving this place a fifth chance. I'M DONE!
Castle Terrace=Roe deer, rabbit, partridge, grouse.  Yes, we ate Disney's Bambi and it was delicious!All joking aside, Castle Terrace, a Michelin one star and part of the Paul Kitchin family of restaurants, delivers.  Where the Kitchin focused on the sea, Castle Terrace is about the land.  Outstanding sourcing of ingredients prepared with great respect to elevate their natural flavors.  A charming ambiance and friendly, proper service round out a near perfect dining experience.The menu is seasonal.  Two prestarters whet the palette.  A trio of amuse deceptions (they look nothing like they are supposed to be).  The best being a liquefied Caesar salad.  Like the liquefied olive, this one filled with the essence of romaine, egg, anchovies, sitting atop a crouton of parmesan.  Popped in the mouth the flavor of a true Caesar salad burst forth.   The second prestarter, an intense, acidic roasted tomato soup with a crisp olive stick.  A refreshing start to the meal to come.The starters; a stunning ravioli of partridge atop seared foie, caramelized pear, braised celery in a partridge consume.  Mind blowing..  The distinct rich, mineral flavor of the foie brings out the game flavor of the partridge and harmonizes it perfectly with the sweetness of the tender pear.  Balance beyond belief in a simple dish.Not to be out shown, a simple broccoli volute with goat cheese ravioli.  The clean vegetal flavor punched up by tangy, creamy goat cheese pillows and walnuts.  Perfect.For mains, the grouse with chanterelles, bread sauce and watercress puree, simply outstanding.  Very gamy, lean, and fork tender grouse pairs perfectly with all accompaniments.  The watercress puree adds a green vibrancy that brightens the palate between bites.  The legs are plated separately.  Cooked in the bird with the innards, it has a pronounced game flavor.  Outstanding.The roasted north sea cod presented topped with finely diced mushrooms and basil atop root veg, mushrooms and a "pasta sheet" of broccoli stems a harmonious blend of texture and flavor.  Perfectly cooked, the essence of cod elevated by the use of root veg once again.Finally, a barbecued and braised shoulder of Ayrshire pork.  Barbecue equals Asian flavors.  A crispy piece of belly, a playful interpretation of a pulled pork sandwich in a chickpea bun.  All told, the deep, sweet porky flavor explodes in this dish.Dessert is not to be missed.  The caramel soufflé with popcorn ice cream, decadently rich.  Distinct caramel aroma.  Caramel coated popcorn adds a good textural foil, the distinct popcorn flavored ice cream, the perfect foil to reduce the sweetness of the caramel.Great selection of cheeses with an emphasis on Scottish producers from the cart.  Quince jelly a nice touch.Very good wine list although lacking vintage depth.  Heavy focus on old world producers.  Fair pricing with average bottle £100.Service is unhurried, friendly, knowledgeable, and very professional.  Somewhat of a splurge, dinner for three £650.Three month advance booking required.  Credit card to warranty reservation.  Well worth the effort.
Good Fellas Grill=This new place is not your average fast-food chicago/greek style gyro joint, at all.  It's so much better....This is a fast casual semi-fine dining version of one of those restaurants.  The place is an oasis of clean and cozy considering the strip mall location.  They offer several authentic and freshly prepared choices for lunch and dinner, and use beautiful pictures of the dishes as part of the menu.  This not only helps a person less familiar with the food to select an item, but also ensures that you see SEVERAL dishes that look splenderific, causing you to plan your next visit before you've even finished ordering today's meal !I've had their delicious gyro and falafel sandwiches for lunch, but also the unexpectedly exciting marinated chicken breast sandwich, and sampled a few other dishes.Every time Daren C and I have been in for lunch, they've offered a bowl of soup as an appetizer -- several flavors have all been tasty.The food is really good, 4 - 4.5 stars.  The service is what really takes this place over the top into solid 5 star rating territory.  The husband and wife team running the show are friendly and will chat with all the new customers and 'new regulars' (the place isn't that old, but there are regulars already).  Watch for the little boy, though -- maybe 4 or 5 years old.   This little charmer who hangs out in the dining area is not only super polite, but he is likely to give you a shy "Are you enjoying your soup?", with no prompting from either parent.   While Daren and I ate last week, we heard his dad telll the story of how this little guy suggested they get one of those sign spinners, since it would be a good way to tell people about their new restaurant.  That little dude will be running this place someday.  It's certainly good enough to stay in busniess long enough.Whahht. No review from me yet? Sorry GFG I failed you. Knee Nose and his family are the best. I am glad they decided to park at 19th ave and Greenway. The kids are amazing lil business partners too. Get the lentel soup, 2 meat combo, w/ 1/2 salad 1/2 rice. that is 2 meals for the price of one! Go once a week for at least 10 weeks and try everything. it is all sooo good!PS. Check in here and tell em Daren sent ya!What a breath of fresh fresh air. The owner of this restaurant actually took my constructive criticism and made some very positive changes based on them. How awesome is that?Regarding the rice, apparently the staff who previously told me that they used chicken stock was misinformed. The owner showed me the seasoning they use and it is all veggie!They're also now carrying a vegan lentil soup daily and it's delicious!The pitas contain no dairy, which is awesome.This place makes some great veggie food and the owner is very friendly and responsive to customer needs.Definitely recommend that you check this place out!Brought my family in for dinner on a Saturday, and we were literally treated like guests in their home.This great, family-run, independant, unique eatery is just what everyone hopes for in their neigborhood.  If you're not in the neigborhood, don't worry, you'll be welcomed whole-heartedly. Drive past as many local fast food gyro joints as you need to on the way, and you'll be glad you did.Sometimes I forget that NOT EVERYONE is a super freak and loves the GFG food. I wonder how this is possible? The realize because I forget to tell you all. Close your eyes and imagine this....well shoot that didn't work...um...ok... err.The gyro bread is a soft, chewy, perfectly flavored, life vest for a quartet of ingredients. Spread lightly, yet enough to know it is there, is a hummus base used to tingle the taste buds in the back of your mouth as the flavor mixes with the fresh and crisp salad/lettuce/veggies mixture that is seasoned and intertwined with the lemon juice and tahini sauce. The charred and seasoned hunks of moist chicken fresh off the skewer are places on top the bed of mouth watering delight happening below. The flavors are meant to satisfy your buds and you will gladly lick the drippings off your wrist as they drizzle down at a constant pace because you never let the sandwich get more then 4 inches from your face the entire time...Damn just drooled on my shirt.  As a freaking devoured the entire thing last night all i could think about was two things. 1. Imagine how good this would be with a bunch of other Yelpers, chatting it up about the quality of the meat, veggies etc. The passion of Ninos and his amazing people skills. The impeccable cleanliness interior, furniture, kitchen, and my gosh the Restrooms...Mom would be proud. 2. How everyone of the Sheeple passing up GFG to go to CHINO BANDITO....and the cheap quality, messy atmosphere, disgusting bathrooms...don't get me wrong I go there but...Eat at Good Fellas and have a cookie at Chino's. Best of both worlds!I finally had the opportunity to take the whole family to enjoyed homey greek/mediterranean food.  It was a success.  The twins tried everything and those are some picky eaters.  I love the lentil soup, and I have told before in other reviews, I am not a soup person but this one is so delicious.  I guess I must have become a soup person, but I digress.  My chicken was so tender and marinated to perfection.  My little girl ate all her portion plus some of her brother's chicken.  THey both enjoyed the rice.  I was supposed to be off of carbs this week, but I couldn't pass up this one.  It is perfectly cooked rice.  The garlic sauce that comes with the chicken goes so well with it.  My hubby had a salad with some gyro meat on it.  He really enjoyed it.  The only bad thing is that this place is so far from us.  I could see having take out at least a couple of times a week, if I live closer.I'll be honest, if it wasn't for Yelp (and Daren C), I would have probably never known that Good Fellas Grill existed and I would have never known the deliciousness I was missing! I've eaten here several times now and I am officially a fan! I love Mediterranean food and Good Fellas Grill lives up to my love. Everything here is juicy, fresh and delicious.My favorite meal is the Mediterranean salad with either chicken or lamb. The meat is juicy with the perfect about of marination that makes it tasty with every bite. The salad is hefty and could easily be two meals. The salad dressing is salty and yummy! However, I will say that I'm a sucker for carbs and I love their buttery rice as well. I like to order a side of the rice. Other go-to items are the lentil soup and one of the meat dishes. Good Fellas is a no-frills, homey food style place. It's perfect for lunch on the go, for a casual lunch or dinner with kids or just if you want to grab some takeout! PS - it's right by Turf Paradise, so if you're there for the races, stop by on your way home!Wow! Lentil soup was amazing potato chicken soup was stellar. Real Gyro Meat! Can't wait to come back and my kiddo's loved  it to.I love  a family local restaurant.I read all the good reviews for this place so I thought I would give it a try.My friend lives close, so I said I will meet you there.To see it, you would never think ,oh this place will be great.It is in a strange shopping center. Right next to Chino Bandito,or something like that. Though I must try that place one day as well.When you walk in it smells divine!My friend was already there and had ordered an Ice Tea.She ended up getting the Chicken lettuce wraps, and I the Gryo dish,which is on a bed of fantastic rice.We each got the chicken Potato soup. Oh my gosh, everything was fantastic! Plus we even got pita bread and they were nice enough to give me hot tea,even though it is not on the menu.I even got 2 Baklava's to go. Which we had for dessert that night.So glad I read the reviews or I never would of known about this place.It is very clean as well, with nice clean rest rooms and lots of parking.
Monstah Lobstah=All. You. Can. Eat. Crab. Legs.(We'll come back to that part... are you hungry yet?)I have had the lobster enchiladas and was a bit "meh" over them. Not bad, necessarily, but I expected more. The sandwhiches have all gotten rave reviews from my tablemates. A simple order of crab or lobster has always been good.The salad has always been fresh except, admittedly, one night I wanted a little coleslaw to go... and I got a very little sample-pack size and it was not fresh and way heavy on the mayo. That made me a bit wary. But each time since then, it has been crisp, fresh, and tangy without being doused in mayo. I love their bisque and clam chowder and, as I said opening this post, I love the AYCE crab on Tuesday nights.It's always hot, fresh, and tasty. You get a ton of crab and all the tools you need to dig into it. They offer all the extras if you want them: butter, coleslaw, fries, etc. Not for me, though... I am a purist. Give me the crab, and no one gets hurt. Legs, claws, and bodies; freshly steamed and brought to the table steaming hot and with a lot of lemon. A bit messy, and totally worth every paper towel and wet towlette on the table.There are no limits, as I have witnessed in a group setting... As long as you keep ordering it, they will bring it to you. A table for two? No problem. A table for 8? No problem. And always with a smile.Service has been slow on occasion, but it's always friendly, personable, and dedicated to making sure you have what you want and enough of it to make you happy.Oh.... Do not miss some of the pastas... the crab mac n' cheese my friend had a few weeks ago made me miss mac n' cheese something FIERCE! It was amazing! A great go-to-spot for eating in or taking out. Doc Holliday's being connected, there is also full bar service. It's handy to have, let me tell ya...... and I will; maybe I'll see you on a Tuesday!
Chick & Benny's=I had a groupon for this place so I went there around 9 AM to check it out. I really wanted to like the place since I live close by and absolutely love chicken tenders.I went ahead and placed my order just fine, but once I showed her my groupon things went downhill quick. The guy in the back started saying something along the lines of "oh great our first groupon of the day" in a sarcastic tone like my friend and I were just wasting their time. He appeared to be one of the owners. So that made me feel pretty awesome. The lady then started writing down the numbers of the groupon and handed me back my phone. I was putting it into my pocket when she became very direct and in my opinion rude, accusing me of not hitting the redeemed button. I told her that I had hit redeemed and she then gave me the death stare and asked me to place my phone down on the counter. To say the least it was an extremely awkward situation. I was tempted just to leave but for some reason I truly thought the food would make up for the service.The food was ok. Chicken tenders were very juicy but to me they lacked any kind of real kick in flavor or crunch from the breading. The G-fries were pretty good though all the way around. Beignets were ok as well. I guess if you've never had the real thing then you would probably like them quite a bit. To be honest the service was horrible. I still can't believe how the owner who probably placed the ad would say something like that whether or not he thought I could hear him. As for the lady who actually took my order, I have no idea if it was just an off day or if she truly believes it's ok to talk to people and treat them like that. Maybe she's not a morning person but if that's the case they either should keep her off the morning schedule or just open later.Save yourself money and time and avoid this place. I'm being serious... run far far away.
Umami Ramen & Dumpling Bar=Points for being a rehabbed home, but that's where most of the excitement stops. Staff has never been all to welcoming/friendly/warm/suggestion-oriented and honestly up and down Willy I can get some pretty mean dumplings at a number of places. Their buns are tasty though, I'll give them that, but I just don't think it's worth the trip for one specialty item.I think the best way to do Umami is family-style with a group of friends. Order everything, share it all, and split the bill evenly. That's what I did on a cool fall night. We sat out on the deck and ordered the following: pork buns, spicy pulled pork buns (the special), beef buns, pork dumplings, the ramen special (served cold with raw veggies), and the pork ramen.Out waiter, Spike, was incredibly helpful in guiding us along. He suggested that if we wanted to split ramen, they could separate the order into two bowls and add a bit more meat and noodles for a slight up charge. It was the perfect amount this way! He also was nice about informing us about he intriguing things on the menu that we weren't familiar with, such as the "garlic bomb" (puréed fresh garlic blended with butter... Add a touch to your pork ramen! Soooooo good!)My favorites were definitely the spicy pulled pork buns and the pork ramen, but everything was delicious. I loved the fluffy buns and the tender meat, with just the right amount of heat to everything. The warm, flavorful ramen was just what I needed outside on a night with a bit of a chill.I definitely was feeling the high salt content later, but it was so worth it. Just be sure to wash it down with some water and/or a pint!I'll definitely be returning with my crew for a no-fuss feast!Dropped by for a drink on 3/31; ended-up staying for dinner.+ Sat at the bar, which was empty at 6:15pm on Monday night+ Happy hour runs from 5-7pm; 2-for-1 taps, rails, and sake+ Bartender was prompt and eager to help- Bartender stayed *extremely* eager/anxious/persistent through entire visit, until it came time to pay the check; then she was M.I.A.- Bartender never exchanged any pleasantries - it was *all* business and only about getting more things for us; no "how are things?" or "you're welcome" - it was, "you ready for another round?" or "ready to order entrees?" - with as dead as it was, she seemed to be in a hurry to get us out of there+ Saketini was excellent+ Tuna Poke (essentially tuna tartare) was good; a bit over-dressed, but decent- Ramen was mediocre; despite being pork, it tasted more like seafood- Sorbet was ok- Overpriced. $12 for a bowl of ramen, plus $1.50 to split it into two bowls, plus $1 for "flavor bombs"? I'm sorry... a bowl of soup with some noodles and a smattering of super-shaved pork should not cost $16. Our light meal (one appetizer, splitting an order of dumplings and splitting an order of ramen, sorbet, plus a few drinks (all during happy hour)) cost $81 with tip. That's a tad outrageous in my opinion. I'm still not sure how it all added-up to be so expensive - I hate being nickle-and-dimed by places. For comparison, my last dinner at Forequarter was $74 with tip, and we had a much better meal and experience.
Los Jarochos Restaurant=It's been quite a while since my first review and I feel the need to upgrade them a bit. They are still not my favorite place in town. The flavors just aren't dynamic enough and sometimes the food is a tad bit bland, but they are solid and have relatively reasonable prices for the portions they serve.The meats are well-cooked but a little under seasoned. I like the pastor and lamb. They are a little heavy handed with the onion, so if that's not your thing ask for it on the side.
Banh Xeo Minh=being vietnamese and not looking to eat pho as i can just ask my mom for it, when i heard about an authentic vietnamese restaurant that doesn't offer pho, i had to try.banh xeo is a savory crepe with pork, shrimp, bean sprout and green onion eaten wrapped in lettuce and herbs dipped in nuoc mam or if you are like me and don't feel like making a mess, all mixed in a bowl eaten with a fork.can't be more authentic than that. it brought me back to my childhood days when i used to eat it the lettuce wrapped way.banh cuon is another safe dish to get. it's a sticky flour roll dish with shiitake mushroom and ground pork. eating as is or with nuoc mam. definitely better and fresher than what you'd get at the grocery storeif you are feeling a bit more adventurous, you could try the durian milkshake. the infamous stinky fruit. personally, i can't stand the smell of the fruit. it smells foul especially when ripped and humid outside. it's a combination of rotten eggs, #2 diapers sitting in the sun but apparently praised for it's custard like feeling and sweet onion vanilla taste. well, i tried the milkshake and it's not bad at all. made with frozen durian, ice, milk and condensed milk (and maybe some vanilla ice cream), you get a frozen concoction that has a french onion soup taste but without the foul smell (of the durian) associate with it. you do have the bad breath thoughif you are looking for traditional authentic vietnamese dishes and are tired of the usual pho, it's a must try place.me being vietnamese, i can just make it at home and according to my mom, for what you'd be spending there, better to make it at home but if you're lazy (i know i can be), it's a good placeps. like all vietnamese restaurants, closed on tuesday
Chick-fil-A=Throughout history we have been plagued by deep philosophical questions: Why do you always want what you can't have? Why did the chicken cross the road? And why does the craving for Chick-fil-A hit on Sunday? No matter. Chick-fil-A is good any day of the week! Making it through to Monday for the deep-fried in peanut oil cravings to subside is well worth it just to indulge in those waffle fries once again. And the sauces: Buttermilk Ranch, Honey Mustard, Chick-fil-A Sauce, Honey Roasted BBQ, Polynesian. What is in those sauces that makes them taste so good? No, seriously, what is in them? Does anyone have a recipe that even comes close? 'Cause today is Sunday.
M Cafe=I asked a local where to hit up brunch in this hood and he directed me here. A little French bistro with a great menu filled with salads, sandwiches, egg and crepe options, this little place was packed on a Monday afternoon.I went with the sandwich and soup combo for $12. The chicken club and a cup of creamy tomato (though as the waiter mentioned, the soup was not too creamy, just a hint). The sandwich was large with delicious crunchy bread and what tasted to be a homemade garlic aioli. I loved it. The chicken was sliced thinly so you could actually get your mouth around the sammy (we are clearly not in Jersey anymore). The soup was perfect with chunks of vegetables; I couldn't have asked for a better lunch. It was large but not too big where I felt like death after. Service was amicable if not a wee but unprofessional, food was more than agreeable. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the neighborhood and need a nice little lunch spot.
Ravella at Lake Las Vegas=I'm writing this to warn potential visitors to avoid the Ravella and actually Lake Las Vegas in general. The entire area is depressing with very little activity (it picks up on weekends). Many of the shops in the village have gone out of business (or soon will). The Ravella is not a 4-star property-- more like 3.  We had horrible service here from almost every department. We booked a package and both the photos/description they provided as well as those on the Ravella web site make the area and resort look wonderful. We assumed since the hotel used to be the Ritz that it would be nice and offer excellent service, hence the reason we booked it. Having stayed on the strip most every other visit, we were ready for a change. I only wish I had done some research on the area first. Search the web for "Lake Las Vegas Foreclosure" and you'll get more information than you probably want. Here's a history of the opening of the Ravella. It used to be the Ritz Lake Las Vegas for at least 5 years. In 2009, the property got foreclosed upon (actually so did the entire Lake Las Vegas development). It is now owned by Deutsche Bank Group. Interesting note, this is the same group that owns the Cosmopolitan Hotel on the strip (which was also foreclosed on prior to opening). From what I've read online, the bank has no interest in running hotels but has been forced into it (no one will buy the hotels from them). After the Ritz left, the hotel was empty for almost a year before opening up under the Ravella name in February of this year ('11). It is now being managed by the Dolce Hotel Group.As for the specific issues we encountered, I've posted a detailed review on TripAdvisor should you want to learn more about our experience. Yelp limits the amount of characters for its reviews.In short, I recommend that you avoid this hotel as well as Lake Las Vegas in general. Don't make the same mistake we did.
Coco's Family Restaurant=We called ahead for faster seating and it definitely helped. The wait was considerably less than Egg Works up the street. The food and service were both pretty good. I wouldn't recommend the bloody Mary's though. They were horrible, basically bad tomato juice and a lime.  They are really cheap, but still not really worth it.  Orange Juice wasn't really anything to cheer about either. My Pacific Scramble was good, and I also enjoyed the Gluten free pancakes. The Bf liked his corned beef hash.  Our server was Mark, and he was very attentive. All in all it was a pretty good breakfast. I'll be back. Fair warning: It's not easy to ignore the desserts cleverly displayed in the front.
Viet Bistro=I did something different today. Whenever I try a Vietnamese place for the first time, I usually get the combination pho. It's my baseline dish for comparing Vietnamese restaurants.But thanks to My T's review, I just had to try their Bun Bo Hue. It's something I've never ordered before, so I have nothing with which to compare. That's really not a problem, of course. In the end, I enjoyed the soup. My friend, Lisa Y, says it's not her fave BBH in town. As for me, it was pretty darn good. I loved the tenderness of the beef. It wasn't very spicy--from what I understand, BBH is supposed to be spicy--but it had a nice hint of heat that enhanced the flavor without the usual runny nose effect.I should point out that the bowls did not come out with pig feet. I asked about them and they brought a couple right out. I guess they figure that pig feet probably don't appeal to non-Vietnamese people, but it's listed as part of the dish on the menu! Anyway, that's a minor complaint.The one weird thing about this place is the lighting. It's fluorescent, but many of the panels are blue, while a couple of them are orange. They just give the place a strange hue. Obviously, it's not a reason to avoid the place. But as a photographer, it's something that caught my attention.I was way out in the northwest today and decided to try a Pho place up in this area.  So based on YELP, I tried out Viet Bistro and walked away very happy.1.  If you haven't read My T. or Paolo D review of this place yet, do so.  I used it for my analysis and visit and I was happy!2.  Parking - strip mall, very easy.  Odd that it is near a cigar bar, which has a very distinct cigar aroma, however, once inside the restaurant, you cannot smell the cigars.3.  Ambiance - Small narrow place, with purple walls. Nice overall.  Small and cozy. Nothing fancy.4.  Drinks - I always prefer fountain drinks and they do have this over the canned sodas, so definitely a plus.5.  Food - Ahhh,  I tried the Bun Bo Hue based on MyT an Paolo D review an it was great. It was not too spicy at all, and in fact, was very subtle.  This is great as it is not too overpowering and you can always add more spices or the jalepenos.  The noodles were just right in terms of texture and firmness.  The serving size was just right and this is the first time that I drank so much of the broth. It was very, very tasty.  My son had P11 and he enjoyed it as well as with an Iced Coffee.I also ordered to sandwiches to take home and they taste great and better yet, the aroma is even better.There is a ton of stuff on this menu. I will come back again, although it is about 35 minutes from where I live in Henderson!!!6.  Service - As good as it gets.GK says, check it out.I've lived in Las Vegas almost 5 years and somehow have avoided the Pho craze until now. I always hear amazing things about it but somehow I never felt compelled enough to drive to a Vietnamese restaurant until a few days ago when I was getting a massage.The waitress/owner was great. She understood that I was a Pho virgin and wanted me to have the best experience possible. I ended up with a combination Pho and was very happy with my choice. I can't truly judge my overall Pho experience because I have nothing to base it on. However, I do know that the Pho broth was incredible and the friendly and attentive service was for sure worth 4 stars. I also added a 3 bean dessert that was as incredible as it was strange in both taste and consistency. I have NO CLUE what I ate.Half of my week is spent working in Summerlin, and the Vietnamese options are slim pickings, but this is my go to spot when the craving arises during my work lunch hour.  For quality of the pho, I would rate them around 3.5 stars since the stock is a bit on the sweeter side and not as complex but a step above msg stock from a packet of powder, and there does appear to be a markup of $1-2 from similar entrees in Chinatown.  I completely agree with other reviews regarding their Bun Bo Hue since it's a bit toned down for less adventurous palates (not inherently spicy, but using their housemade chili sauce really elevates the dish) and there is a lack of the blood-cake and random pork parts (pork hock included only by request) that make this dish unique. I know that some folks may make a general rating based on traditional items such as pho and banh mi, but I think the true gems on this menu lie a little off the beaten path.  The shrimp paste spring rolls are tightly wrapped like cuban cigars and have a nice ratio of meat and vermicelli/vegetables with the rice skin having a nice toothsome texture.  They also have some other intriguing items in the appetizer section such as a deep fried savory vietnamese crepe, carpaccio salad, and other items that I am excited to try.  One dish in particular was recommended by the manager on my most recent visit : the shrimp and crab udon soup (banh canh cua).   I was a bit skeptical since I expected some half Vietnamese/Japanese concoction with imitation crab and overcooked shrimp in a bland clear broth, but what arrived was an unexpected deluge of flavor that blew me away!    The broth is thick and  starchy like a good hot and sour soup with bits of real crab meat bathing unctuous udon noodles made with tapioca flour (not to be confused with the Japanese variety) that had a hybrid texture between italian bucatini and Korean dukbokki.  The manager strongly recommended adding a generous sprinkle of black pepper and I wanted to increase the heat with a dollop of the chili paste so I applied both.  I'm usually a fairly adventurous eater that likes to constantly try new things on a menu, but this was one of those dishes where I seriously contemplated never ordering anything else again because I didn't want to deal with the regret of ordering an inferior dish.  The noodles/broth ratio was great since I still had noodles down to my last bite and the thick broth is perfect to coat the udon with layers of umami since the noodle isn't capable of absorbing much flavor.  The only weak spot was the shrimp since they were indeed a tad overcooked and lacked the sweetness and snap of the recently caught variety.  Definitely earns a spot amongst my top 10 vietnamese soups in Las Vegas.More like 3.5 but I will round down due to the cigar stench from the smoke shop next door.  I understand it is not the restaurant's fault, but it doesn't change the fact that it is unpleasant. It is fairly spacious inside with a very standard, devoid of personality type decor. The service can be hit or miss, but even on the "hit" day it's the bare minimum consisting of a water refill. The pho is actually good. The broth is flavorful and they do not skimp on the meat. The prices are very reasonable for the quantity of food that you get. On my last few visits I had their vermicelli with grilled pork and pork paste. The taste is ok and they do skimp on the meat. I ordered an extra side of grilled pork for my husband and I to share just because the few pieces that come standard get lost in the mix quickly. I still prefer the pho and vermicelli at Pho Saigon 8 on Eastern and 215, but this one is considerably closer to my house.Location is clean, service is polite and prompt. I like how they use blue film covers over the fluorescent overhead lighting to keep it from being too harsh, gives the dining room almost a lounge atmosphere.But the food.Salt and pepper calamari order was $7 for 14 grease-soaked pieces, without any salt or pepper. Very bland, only tasted like grease, served with cups of sweet and sour sauce? Best part was the random pieces of fried carrot used as garnish.The "special combination" bahn mi, with a smiley-face next to it on the menu, was a huge disappointment. Meat was all stacked on one end of the sandwich. I opened it up to distribute it evenly, only to find several blackened pieces of meat- the type of coloration that looks like food that has gone bad, not blackened from cooking. Picked out several pieces, then bit in, only to encounter some crazy spicy sauce or seasoning that was so strong it made my eyes water. All I could see were jalapenos (one piece on the entire sandwich?), and I don't mind those. This place may be right next to my gym, and the pho may be delicious, but I will not be coming back. If you can't reliably serve unspoiled cooked meat on your sandwiches, I am not going to trust the meat cooked in your soups.
Jimmy John's=As many of my friends know, I love Sandwiches.....especially Jimmy Johns.  I stopped by this location and ordered a #9 Italian Club (Genoa Salami, Italian Capicola, Smoked Ham, Provolone Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Mayo, Italian Vinaigrette, $5.25) and added Hot Peppers, Vinegar Potato Chips ($1.39), and Soda ($.99).http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IRpZS7EmmBeSM7oBnDd5iw?select=8nTOvKrKJYePvqOUklYa0Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IRpZS7EmmBeSM7oBnDd5iw?select=1BQbD18J_MjO5NVKs53BuQOf course the Sandwich was made within 2 minutes of ordering....I don't know how they can make a Sandwich so fast, but they do!The Sandwich was excellent.....the Bread rocked of course and the Hot Peppers makes it so much better.While I was there, I looked at the menu and the JJ Gargantuan Sandwich piqued my interest....I will try that next time.Return Factor - 100%Decided to come here for lunch after work. My man picked me up and we were in the mood for a sandwich. I was so glad we found a JJ's nearby! The store was clean and employees very helpful and friendly.I ordered a "Beach Club". It had Fresh baked turkey breast, provolone cheese, avocado spread, sliced cucumber, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I asked them to leave the sprouts off and they said they didn't offer them anymore so I don't know if that is just this location no longer offering them or all of them. This sandwich was delicious! I could eat one everyday! The cost for this sandwich was $5.75My man had the "Italian Night Club". He actually ordered 2 of these because he has a big appetite and the sandwiches are just 8 inches so not quite the footling you would get at Subway. This sandwich had genoa salami, Italian capicola, smoked ham, and provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, and Italian vinaigrette. This sandwich also cost $5.75JJ's delivers an caters. You can place orders online.I love JJ's! The prices are very affordable for what you get. This will make a great lunch stop while working on this side of town. I'm a fan and will be back!
Savoy=Never in my life have I been treated so rudely. I visited the upstairs club section of Savoy on a Saturday night with a large group of friends. Upon going downstairs to use the restroom, I was prohibited from going back upstairs with no reason or justification. Upon calmly questioning several members of the management team, I was treated EXTREMELY rudely and virtually dismissed by the owner, who cited he did not need my business. Savoy has a nice atmosphere, but the customer service is seriously lacking. I'd prefer to spend my money at a place where my business is appreciated.This is another one of those: "where to start?" reviews...From the beginning.My husband and I had reservations for a Friday evening.  The restaurant was kind enough to call the day before and remind us of our reservation as well as let us know that there is a dress code.  Friday comes along and we are both VERY excited for our date night and to try a new place -- especially one that looks as nice as Savoy.  We got dressed -- me in a casual dress, him in slacks and a sweater, and we headed down to the Strip.  Now I understand that this is the Strip, but the parking situation was horrendous.  To make matters worse, where there could have been 5 or 6 parking spots in front of the restaurant, they were setting up valet parking so those were automatically out.  After driving around for a few minutes we found a spot about 2 blocks away and hoofed it to the restaurant.  I'm not deducting "points" because of the parking situation, but just want other people to know that it was a bit inconvenient.As we approached the front of the restaurant I noticed that there was a large group of people standing outside, a couple of "bouncer" type looking guys and a camera crew.  They didn't move aside when we approached so we had to kind of weave/skirt around them to get to the door.  It was very weird.  I felt a little like we were walking through paparazzi to get inside of the restaurant.Inside the restaurant we went to the hostess stand and let them know we had reservations.  They took our coats (which was quite nice) and told us it would be a few minutes for our table to be ready and that we could wait at the bar if we wanted.  Which would have been okay had there been a spot at the bar.  The bar/lounge area was PACKED and VERY noisy.  After a while, a couple moved from the bar and we squeezed into their place so we could order a drink.  I had a diet coke and hubby had a beer -- they only have bottles, no drafts.  The drinks were overpriced IMO, my diet coke was over $2 and DH's beer (a domestic) was $6 or 7.  After about 15 minutes we were seated.  We had to pay the bar tab separately, and could not combine it with our dinner.  (An inconvenience, but minor.)  I had hoped there would be a separate dining area away from the bar, but no, our table was RIGHT NEXT TO IT.  So all of the nosiness from the bar was in no way buffered from the dining area.  I literally could barely hear him talking to me.The waitstaff was quick and friendly.  They brought us water and bread with flavored oil and took our drink orders.  I asked them to refill my diet coke and I was surprised when we got our bill to find out that I was charged AGAIN for my drink.  This seems like a bit of a ripoff.We went ahead and ordered: we had the mini sliders for our appetizer and then my husband order chicken and waffles for his entree and I had the steak two ways.  The sliders came fairly quickly and were warm but a bit flavorless.  I couldn't put my fingers on what they were missing, but they could have been MUCH better.It took longer than I would have expected for our dinner to arrive.  When DH got down to the chicken and waffles he seemed unimpressed.  He actually told me the SYRUP was the best thing on the plate.  I've seen this man put away chicken and waffles.  He only ate about half of what they gave him and didn't ask for the leftovers to be boxed.My beef two ways was... interesting.  I was really excited to try the sous-vide beef!  It tasted (and had the consistency) of pot roast.  It wasn't bad... it just wasn't good.  The grilled beef was quite tasty and the garnishes on the plate were good, too.  I had also ordered a side of mashed potatoes and they tasted like they were about three days old and reheated in a microwave -- and poorly at that -- they were cold and lumpy.We looked at the dessert menu, but having been so uninspired by the rest of the meal we decided to cut our losses.  We tipped generously -- the servers were friendly and attentive -- but that is about all I can say that is positive about this place.  We won't be returning.I had heard about Savoy for years. About how beautiful the space was and how expensive the food was but, I had never went for dinner. I had tasted Savoy's food before at the Pittsburgh Magazines Best Restaurants Party multiple times and at the Yelp Tech Shop Event and at the Yelp's Soirée @ Savoy Elite event. Each time the food was very good.I saw a $49 Groupon Deal for Savoy that I couldn't pass up that included two entrees and one dessert of your choice. I decided to check them out for a date night with my wife Tamika so we could finally see what all the fuss was about. Now let me tell you about the space. All I can say is WOW! It is absolutely beautiful. Savoy has to be one of the most beautiful spaces in Pittsburgh. Once inside you fill like you've been transported to Atlanta, New York or Miami. It was created by Pittsburgh designer Luca Paganico and transformed an dated three story building into a posh and intimate restaurant with leather couches and chairs, a fiber optic bar, and walls with lighting that changes color as patrons dine. Upstairs in the lounge area was just as beautiful. With four separate sectional couch areas with TVs on the wall. I know it had to cost a fortune to build and furnish the space.We started off with drinks. I had the Peach on Peach and the Mrs. had the Blueberry Mojito. The drinks took a while to reach the table but, once they did they were worth the wait.Next we enjoyed a complementary bread basket with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It was very good followed by an amazing lemon sorbet to cleanse our palates.For our entrees I had the N.Y. Strip Steak with compressed mushrooms, Yukon whipped potatoes and haricots verts. The streak was cooked perfectly and just how I asked for it to be cooked. My only complaint is that the sauce for the streak was extremely salty. Also like when the salt was added the top was loose and salt got dumped onto my plate. My wife had the Pork Chops which was one of the dinner features that night. Her pork chops were even more salty then my steak so she only ate about a quarter of it and took the rest home. Savoy does offer quite a few Gluten Free dining options as wellFor dessert we shared the salted carmel chocolate torte. (Roasted banana ice cream, milk chocolate cashew bark and chocolate fondue) It was even chosen as Savor Pittsburgh's Dish of the Year for 2013. IT WAS AMAZING! Service was superb the entire evening. I also like the fact that you can make reservations right from the Savoy website which are a must as the space only seats about 75 people.All in all Savoy is a nice place that I would visit for sure for drinks during Happy Hour and go somewhere else for dinner. I just cannot with a clear conscience justify the prices without a Groupon Deal.What a pleasant surprise!!Here's the deal: I was apprehensive about going to Savoy. The prices are on the high end, there's no doubt about that. There's a recommended dress code, and the website describes the restaurant as being inspired by high-end dining establishments in cities far bigger than our little 'Burgh.So these are fancy things. And, well, I'm just not that fancy of a broad. I was a little apprehensive that I was going to be way out of place at a fancy restaurant.But once you're in the doors, you're treated like a regular, even if it's your first visit. Yes, Savoy is classy, swanky, and as fancy as a 'get on the list months in advance' New York restaurant, but in no way is it pretentious. From the friendly hostess at the front to the excellent attention from our server and assistant server to the managers strolling through and chatting with patrons, this place has service down to an art form.We went on Monday night, which is Jazz Night, and you should too. Great music while you enjoy your food and beverages - who can argue with that?We started with the fried calamari and shrimp plate. This could have easily fed 3 or 4 people (and yet the two of us managed to plow through it somehow, mostly because we are foodie troopers, I guess). The breading was so light and crispy, and it came with a little dish of sun-dried tomato horseradish cream sauce that was heavenly.For entrees, my husband got the shrimp and grits (because he just cannot pass that up on a menu). This dish was stacked: andouille sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms, and scallions on top of the grits, and all the flavors worked together. Very savory and creamy and filling all at once.For my entree, I got the pork chop (because I just cannot pass up a pork chop on a menu). The house preparation is 'medium well,' which is waaaay more well done than I ever order my meat (yes, even pork), but I decided to trust the chef and go for it. That proved to be a good decision: there was nothing tough about this pork at all. It was super juicy and accompanied by a sweet potato puree, mushroom ragout, sauteed kale & arugula, and little balls of apples. So very, very good.Throughout dinner, we also had baskets of bread delivered to the table. There are several different varieties: olive, rosemary, little sweet buns, all accompanied by olive oil & balsamic for dipping. We enjoyed wine with our meals, as well as the fabulous sounds of Roger Humphries and his band the RH Factor, the featured band for Jazz Night.Service was excellent: never was a water glass empty, never did a finished plate linger on the table. All of our questions about the menu were answered by our server Jared, and he was prompt, attentive, and friendly.The only negative I could find about Savoy is that yes, it is a little on the pricey side, and (brace yourselves) they make their Cosmopolitans with triple sec. Yes, this may seem a minor detail to some, but it is one of the Seven Deadly Foodie Sins According To Fox. And I wouldn't have minded seeing some bourbon on the spirits menu for after-dinner. Lucky for me, there was a solid selection of wines to choose from (both by the bottle and by the glass, as well as a tawny port for dessert), so I didn't have to worry if the spirits menu wasn't right for me.So, triple-sec-related-sins aside, Savoy is the real thing. Great food, great service, great wine, great atmosphere, and great music on Jazz Night (complete with middle-aged couples getting up and dancing, the best!). With an option like this, there's no excuse for not going out on a Monday!
Rocky's=Rocky's is the kind of place my family loves, and I look at them like they are crazy.  Extremely greasy, divey joints are not my thing.  At all.  But they dragged me here one Saturday morning, and Rocky's is what it is.  No frills divey breakfast.Exceptionally greasy food makes me ill, and Rocky's succeeded at doing that.  I don't eat potatoes, and every breakfast meal option came with potatoes.  There is no variety, the menu has 10 things tops.  To top that off, they were out of a lot of things.  But you know what?  Where else can you go for breakfast and eat for around $5 per person including a drink?No bathrooms.  They must be grandfathered in, or they are just running a super illegal business.  Either way, when you are feeling violently ill after eating a meal here or just need to pee from drinking coffee, you'll be miserable, if you are like me.Why three stars?  Because my dad is watching me type this and told me that I couldn't give them two.  So for my dad and the cheap prices, three stars.  Bring your family members ages 50+ here.  They'll appreciate it.
SpoonZ Cafe=I would give this place at least 3.5 stars but they are a sold 3, not convinced they are ready for me to round up to a 4 just yet. As I leave my office for my typically late (130-2p) lunch, I decided I was craving a sandwich, after seeing the latest @sammich_es post on twitter. Knowing I would be hard pressed to get a true "sammich"around here I began my journey.  I had promised to give the Gyro at Coney Island another shot (they offer a $7.55 meal deal, hard to beat).  But I had also seen that this place [Spoonz] had opened up relatively recently and I am always one to try something new and spread my "wealth" around. They have a few tables outside, which is nice because for the most part this section of the street is shaded during the heat of the day.  I walked inside and positioned myself to the right side of the counter to see what they offered.  Their menu is simple but with a good variety, coffee drinks, teas, sandwiches, soupsand salads.  You can order one of their sandwich or salad creations or design your own from a list of options.  They also had a thick quiche in the fridge case and some yummy looking pastries.  Finally deciding on the Country ham panini with ginger mango chutney, tomato and swiss on multi grain bread, $6.95 plus tax, no chips...are they extra? I grabbed a seat in the colorful, relatively small diner and waited.  It didn't take long. I picked up my sandwich.  It was toasted, and generously filled with ham and the mango chutney was just right and complemented the ham quite well. I don't recall tomato and the cheese was one thin slice relative to the amount of ham.  But hey I guess I don't really need much more cheese than that anyway.  The service was no frills, no hello's upon entry, no "Dolores your order's ready.", even though they took my name, but they did say Thank you as I grabbed a menu and left, that counts.I'm sure I will be losing my Duchess status of Spoonz soon.  I have been going less and less over the last couple months, and they are housed on the lobby level of my building.The service has been just ok since Vita left.  The owner (female) is really unpleasant and doesn't seem to be happy about being there.The Scottsdale panini is decent, although the quality of the chicken seems a little lowered recently.  The owner (male) once told my coworker and I  that they cook the meat offsite and simply heat it back up at Spoonz.  Something about not having a proper oven/grill? An ex employee of Spoonz was an incredible pastry chef and made amazing desserts.  Not sure how the treats are now, as I'm skeptical there's a bunch of "boxed" desserts.For coffee, I'd rather walk a few hundred yards more for Starbucks.Wow, this review really is quite negative.  Spoonz is good when you're in a pinch downtown.  I doubt people are going too far out of their way to come here.
La Petite France=A HIDDEN GEM OF SCOTTSDALE! located in a court area of the Seville Shopping Center. (no signs to let you know it is there)Authentic French Bistro dining with real French staff featuring baguettes, crepes,quiches, Flammekueche (French pizzas), crosty (stuffed potatoes) and possibility the VERY BEST DESSERTS in Scottsdale.The Bistro is quaint and charming with a large patio and the dishes are served on interesting plates. We decided to try crostys for lunch they came with interesting fresh salads served first. My companion had his crosty with sausage, provolone, Parmesan and mine was smoked salmon onions, cream fraiche & dill. Both potatoes came out piping hot and both were ooey gooey with cheese but potatoes were not fluffy and were brown on edges, also I wasn't excepting cheese on the salmon and would ask for no cheese if I ordered this again. So the lunch entree was really about 3 stars on this visit but dessert was on a level so much better I think 4 stars rounds it up.The STAR of this lunch was the lemon mousse perfection in flavors, texture a perfect mouth feel and design,I have to say this is the VERY BEST mousse I ever had and if I came in for just dessert this would have been FIVE STAR Yelp. The mousse was a cut round in shape topped with a strong  shiny orange under it was the thick layer of intense lemon mousse that wasn't too sweet but perfect and under that was a thinner layer of chocolate mousse that reminded me of pot de creme but wasn't. If you dine near that dessert case you will get hypnotized and fall surrender to one of the many amazing desserts they all looked wonderful.Service was very charming but clunky. Beverages ordered came after salad water was not refilled and we had to ask for check.Slight updateBusiness has been sold to a new French Owners recently.I came here for a Saturday night dinner with V and L.  V and I had a hard time locating the place.  We drove around the corner not knowing the place was inside the plaza so you can't see if from the parking lot.  HA!  We loved the feel to the place.  It is small but just cute!  The server was totally helpful and funny.  We ordered:La Classique Tartes Flambees - crème fraîche, onions, bacon, cheese:  YUM!Notre-dame Wood Oven Pizza - prosciutto, mozzarella, tomatoes, onions, crème fraîche, pesto:  Pretty good!Chicken, Bacon, Mozzarella Pizza: WHOA, greatness!!!Dessert:Crêpe hot chocolate:  NEED TO GETCrème brulee chocolate flavored:  GOODNESSCrêpe nutella:  Was good, but the hot chocolate kicked butt!!!How cute is this bistro! I absolutely love this place! Went to La Petite France with some girlfriends who wanted to celebrate my 40th birthday, and was very thrilled this was the place that was picked, have been wanting to try them for a while now!When we got their we were greeted with a friendly warm welcomed and showed to our table. The place inside is just so cute! I love the Paris Clock next the coffee maker.I ordered the La Jardiniere (spinach & mushroom quiches) and was exactly how I expected it to be. Light, fluffy, and very very tastly! The dough was amazing, come to find out, they make their own dough by hand and everything is cooked in a brick oven. My friends ordered the Vegetarienne Tarte Flambees, which was loaded with crème fresh, fresh tasting veggies and cheese, and that too was amazing. The food was c'est magnifique! Also had a Carmel Café, which was devine! Loved it!Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu! One for sure is the crème brulee!! It's one of my favorite desserts!La Petite France is so quaint and cute!!  It is pretty tucked away in a nice outdoor shopping strip (curse AZ strip malls), which is kind of nice to be off the busy road.  The down side is I am not sure how much impromptu traffic they get, which is why I need to get the word out.  It would be horrible if this place went away.  I found this La Petite France on a mission for a new brunch spot, some of the central Scottsdale/Old Town Scottsdale places are too packed with poor service and food that is just okay and like anywhere else.  When I saw fresh crepes and chocolate croissants on the menu I had to come check it out.  Take the effort to find it (many other breakfast options)!  Park your car and basically walk to the middle of the shopping corridor and you will find La Petite France.  I sat down and was immediately poured a glass of water and they set a full bottle of water on the table for me.  I was informed of the daily specials, which all sounded quite delicious.  I ended up opting for the croissant plate with coffee.  MMMMMmmmmmm I was not disappointed; the croissants were so buttery and flaky!!  Get the chocolate croissant.A friend of mine happened to be walking by on a weekend walk, so I invited her to join me.  It turns out my server was the owner and he told us all about new changes happening with the menu.  They have an actual French chef, meaning he is from France.  The staff is outstanding: very nice, professional, yet amazingly 'neighborhoody' for a Scottsdale restaurant.  Review #2:  Before I finished my review draft I came back to LPF!  That is a testament to how great this place is in my book.  The owner told me about the mussels when he was talking about the menu at my breakfast visit, so Friday instead of happy hour with my girl Kristen, we decided on wine and mussels.  La Petite France can do mussels 3 different ways...we opted for the traditional white wine, garlic, etc.  We wanted to lick the bowl clean!!! The bread is house made and fantastic!  The mussels were of course good, but it was the 'broth' around the mussels that we dipped the bread in that had us drooling.  I am going to have to come back and try the other two mussel dishes.  Also two tables near us had the Le Filet du Pechuer (serves 2 people), which is basically a soup with various kinds of fish, squid and shellfish that smelled AMAZING as it went by on the cart.  The one table told us we have to come back just for that dish, and said they come here regularly just for it.  Did I mention they have rack of lamb too...looks like I have quite a few trips back to La Petite France in my future!A bunch of Yelpers and I were craving for something sweet after attending Irene's UYE at Cuttlefish yesterday.  Chez Vous, across the parking lot, was closed, so Linda and I thought La Petite France was another great option.  We initially thought there were five of us going, but one couple didn't appear...Linda had mentioned last year that LPF had changed owners, so I was glad to see that Val (co-owner) was still there!  (I suppose Linda's last visit was before I had started going there.)  On to the food... I decided to go with a past breakfast choice of mine, the $8.95 Hot chocolate ("sugar, butter, chocolate, cinnamon"), which Yelp friend Judy F. had suggested in her review.  While last night's crepe was d'lish, it wasn't as good as I had remembered to be. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-petite-france-scottsdale?select=1CMIghOEB95KYwUxjrg8AA#1CMIghOEB95KYwUxjrg8AA  I think it was the addition of whip cream, which I normally would have requested to be left out.  (I forgot to ask if the crepe came with whip.)  Last night's dish also had more chocolate syrup on it.  Linda's choice, on the other had, was so delicious!  She had the $9.95 Suzette Flambee ("butter, sugar, honey and rum, vanilla ice cream, whipping cream"), which was set on fire, complete with the lights very briefly turned off.  The dish was still afire when the lights came back on, so it wasn't quite as romantic a notion as it could've been...  The rum-laced ice cream was the star of the show, I thought.  A must-order-again, for sure!  :)Update 8/29/2015:I called the restaurant today because I'm befuddled by it all.  We've never had a bad experience with any of the Valley restaurants in the 2 years that we've been doing this and I owe some explanation to the people who plan around the 3rd Wednesday of every month to join Monica and me for ISCUYE. Apparently, there are some illnesses in the business-family that are consuming their attention.  A small business like this relies on everyone in the business to operate at its best.  No doubt! I get this.  My family owns a small business.  When one person is out, everyone feels the heat.  Our August reservation was forgotten in a vulnerable moment for the restaurant.   I understand.  My review, which is not caustic by the way, will stand.  I have no hard feelings!  This review is an accurate account of the events that transpired.  BUT, at least we know WHY it happened.  We might consider this restaurant again next year.  I really wanted that bouillabaisse!  :-)  In my review below, I said "I'd never go here again", but ... I'd give a try some time next year if Monica agrees to try it out.  8/29/2015_________________________________________________________We scheduled the July and August 2015 International Supper Club UYE at this location.  Why on earth would we have the ISCUYE  in the same place 2 months in a row?   Welp,  definitely not because we liked the food that much.   We never actually had ANY of the food.  I'm so disappointed with the lack of professionalism by this restaurant.   The first try here we made a reservation on the 3rd Wednesday at 630 pm.   Hours prior to dinner time, they called Monica O to cancel because of an emergency.   OK,  fine.   Things happen. . So,  we decided to reschedule for August.   Someone pointed out that the restaurant might be closed on Wednesdays for dinner.   So,  I called and left a message  inquiring about our dinner plans.   I asked if LPF would be open and gave a date,  day and time (Wed Aug 19 at 630pm).   I stated that if they were open,  please reserve a table for a 10 for Aug 19 at 630pm.  A couple days later,  I received a confirmation call/voice-mail confirming the details of the ISCUYE.   We arrive,  on time and the place was closed.   As soon as I can borrow someone's phone to record a video with the audio from the voice-mail confirming our reservation,  I will.   I waited a week to write this review because I called 3 times and left 2 voice-mails asking for a call back from someone to help me understand why they would tell me we had a confirmed reservation when they were closed   Maybe there was a good explanation.   Maybe the manager forgot they were closed on Wed.   I am not sure.  I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt.   But,  alas, it has been 8 days,  no call back.   Sadly,  I'd never go here again!   Extremely unprofessional.  But what irritates me most of all is 2 months in a row we had to scramble our plans at the very last minute because of this place.  Monica and I take a lot of pride in choosing local businesses to patronize every month.   Our fellow Yelpers rely on us to choose good AND reliable AND professional businesses.   This wasn't one.Return Factor: 15%
Icehouse=Come early to get a table, Icehouse takes no reservations and is tiny. Recently we mosied in at 6:30 on a Friday with a group of 4, sat down at the last available table and had a pitcher of bourbon lemonade within minutes. We watched 3 other groups come in right behind us and then leave.Icehouse isn't fancy, it's just central, tiny, friendly and no fuss. Plastic trays, no plates, no menus but everything we tried was undeniably tasty. The prices could be better but the bill at the end of the night still seemed cheap to our Toronto friends, and the food is really filling and flavorful. The $20 lobster burrito got rave reviews, I loved the cheese stuffed jalapenos and my deep fried oyster po'boy.2nd Review: I've been to Icehouse on 5 different occasions so obviously, I've been a fan. But not anymore. I was quite disappointed in the way they handle their clients if they happen to be a pair. Here's what happened: On our arrival we were asked if we would like to sit outside but declined because it was windy and cold. Despite there being 2 free seats at the bar we were told to wait - I did mention them to the waitress but she didn't acknowledge me. I just figured they don't use those seats for customers. After 10 mins of waiting in the cold a table was freed up and we were asked if we would like these seats but that we could only have them if we're willing to share with 2 other people. We said sorry, no thanks.  So a pair of ladies came in and was promptly seated at the 4pax table because they were okay sharing tables. Another 15 mins go by and two guys show up and the waitress asks them if they would like to sit at the two seats at the bar that were  free (but we thought it wasn't available because she ignored me when I asked about it), to which they reply: "But these 2 were here before us"and she says"Ce n'est pas grave" (Oh don't worry about it)And in they go to sit to eat. Why didn't see give those seats to us before and why is she letting them in before us?!Needless to say we were getting annoyed as it was the 3rd pair of people who were seated before us. We felt like we were being punished for not wanting to have our dinner right next to two strangers.Shortly after a table for 4 becomes free and after 5-10 mins of waiting (expecting they would give it to us..) I ask the other waiter what's the deal. I tell him we've been waiting 30+ mins in the cold and that there's a free table inside that we could use. He says "We only have two 2pax tables and this is our policy." I tell him it's a ridiculous policy and he shrugs it off and leaves.What a terrible way to treat your customers, especially when there's no one waiting behind us in line. It's not like we were even holding bigger groups back or anything. We just stood there incredulous and decided to leave. Lesser patient people would have made a much bigger fuss much earlier. Instead I felt this review would be enough to let others know that if you're a couple and don't wish to sit right against 2 strangers, you better hope those 2 places inside are free and that the waitress doesn't pick favorites.Overpriced Mediocre Food. Pretentious Service.I only eat here because I live around the corner.None of the items on the menu are particularly memorable or remarkable. In fact, just about everything tastes like what you'd expect from a hipster who developed an interest in Americana cuisine and has watched too many YouTube cooking videos.The drinks, however, redeem a visit. They have a solid selection of local beer, and their bourbon lemonade and ice tea are better enjoyed by the pitcher than by the glass.When it comes to the service, though, it ranges from rude to condescending, and is always slow (which is odd given how small the place is). The staff just generally tends to treat you as though they're doing you a favor for letting you eat there.If you're in the neighborhood and you're looking for a quick drink and snack before you move on to something better, it might be worth visit. If you're looking to enjoy an actual meal, though, I'd urge you to look elsewhere.
La Bulle au Carré=Old times charm... A rare find, a tradition and recipes that traveled over seas and oceans.I was greeted with a smile and ushered to the nice large table with Tintin books stacked against the wall...Their specialty - Les Crêpes Bretonnes, or Gallettes - thin, crispy, salty, delicious crêpes with toppings that sooooo masterfully done.I opted for Brunch Breton, with coffee, small smoothie, cup of fruits, far breton with caramel sauce (it was amazing), and galette with ham, cheese and perfectly runny egg yolk on top of it. The combination of crisp buckwheat crêpe, jambon and egg yolk was divine.While my coffee cup was refilled, I asked to try their croissant. I always do this, I just cannot resist this buttery, flaky, airy goodness (true croissants it is). Is was just as I described above. Yummmm.Merci, cheri.Definitely recommend.
Legacy Golf Club Restaurant=I am surprised no one has written this restaurant up yet.  It is located inside the Legacy Golf Club and is very reasonably priced, especially by Golf Club standards.  We have had breakfast here several times now and it is always excellent.  The view is incredible and the food and service are great.  Not much more I can ask from a restaurant.  There is indoor and outdoor dining available as well as a bar.  They are open for lunch and have recently added happy hour M-F from 4:00 - 6:00.  The happy hour looks to be a step above the usual offerings with some of the more memorable items being Bison Meatballs, Pastrami Sliders, and Pretzel Bread.  All priced with the discount at approx 5.00 and under each.
The Martini=I noticed no one has written a review for "The Martini" (previously known as Martini's). However, since they are under new ownership I took it upon myself to devirginize them on Yelp.First of all, it's been forever since my last review--I've been so busy (aka lazy LOL), but I honestly think the people who work here and run the place are terrific and I hope a favorable first review will inspire other people to try this place.I often make my rounds at the smaller gaming bars/ restaurants near my house because:1. I hate the traffic on the Strip2. I prefer cozier places where I can actually have a conversation3. The prices on the Strip are outrageous (yes a $20 martini is not just an urban legend)My roommate and I had heard that one of our favorite bartenders Al who had formerly 'tended at the Sedona Restaurant moved here so we decided to give it a whirl. I had only been to the old Martini's once after pulling one of my all-nighters so I really didn't remember it well. Regardless, I was excited to try "The Martini" for the first time.My first impression when entering the place is that it's elegantly laid out and immaculately clean. This goes without saying, but sometimes you go into a gaming restaurant/ bar and it feels dirty and ghetto and it goes downhill from there. This is not the case with The Martini--it's nice.The staff here is GREAT and I've been here several times and have always had great service. The manager Nick is also great and he always thanks everyone for coming in. He seems to go out of his way to make sure everyone is comfortable regardless of age, race, or orientation--which I find highly respectable. I've also met several other industry people who work at restaurants / bars in the surrounding area, which is always a great sign that the place is good.The Martini also has a extensive & diverse food menu that's way better than your typical bar food. In the 6 or 7 occasions I've been here since their reopening, I've tried several dishes and haven't been disappointed yet. I really enjoyed their cheese & salumi plate and they use a filet for their steak & egg breakfast, which i did find exceptionally good.Of course they are known as "The Martini" so they have a wide selection of martinis & martini-esque drinks to choose from. I've tried the traditional and the Pom, which were both good and balanced. They also have a pretty good wine list to choose from, both by the glass and the bottle and several beers on tap.The place is also a full gaming bar with several machines along the bar--I'm not a huge gambler so I can't really comment on the machines but I'm sure you'll find something to tickle your fancy if you're into gaming. Overall I really like The 'new' Martini and it's my new go-to place near my house. If you live in the area or are passing through, give it a try!Martini's was closed for a long time.  Not sure if it was because of the recession or some internal issue.  But it had been reopened for at least a month when I checked it out after a late night out.  Was told it is under new management.I only ate there once before the closing and was not impressed.  I ate there last night and loved it.  Whatever the new owners have done is working (except my Arnold Palmer which was way too sweet.  They must have terrible lemonade).1) Martini Sliders - some of the best sliders I've ever had.  High quality bun, a little blue cheese and caramelized onion, and thousand island dressing on the plate so you can put as much as you desire.  Meat was juicy with a nice seared crust on it.  Had that little bit of crispiness I like on a burger.  They seared it like a steak which is how it should be done.  Really just great.2) Chicken wings - served nice and crispy with either ranch or blue cheese dressing.  I got it mild so it was a bit bland.  Next time I'll get it hot.  But it was really well cooked.  Chicken was moist inside and the outside was nice and crispy.  They have the standard happy house menu late at night.  Great prices, great quality, great location, great atmosphere, and great service.Well done Martini.Next up for Restaurant Week was The Martini.  My junior-sized Shrimp Cocktail still appeared to be defrosting but was still tasty with a very good Horseradish-based Sauce.  Tomato Bisque Soup with Creme Fraiche and basil was zesty.  A Side Caesar Salad with Mozzarella shavings on top was also very good.  Grilled Rosemary Lemon Salmon with Risotto that tasted like vanilla, and al dente grilled Zucchini, featured a great moist hunk of salmon.  A gooey Fried Oreo Sundae proved to be an excellent, novel dessert.The atmosphere was comfortable in a large dining room walled off from the bar, with soft jazz piped in overhead.  Service was very good except I had to ask twice for Sweet & Low for my Iced Tea.  I expect to continue to frequent this fine establishment--not for libations for for beautifully prepared comfort food.I was here in January for our Yelp Book Club meeting and we decided to have our last meeting of this year at the Martini again.  I came an hour early and had dinner.  The dining room is small in width but runs the length of the building.  There's a nice wooden wall with some fireplaces that block the dinging room from the bar section and makes a great spot for our book club meetings.I started with the Caesar salad.  Good dressing with nice croutons.  There was a lot of salad.  It wasn't a starter salad but rather like a dinner salad without meat.For my main course, I ordered the chicken scaloppine.  While the menu says it's a chicken breast with artichoke, mushrooms, and prosciutto there was no artichoke.  The breast was very lightly breaded and fried and served with seasonal vegetables and risotto.  The dish was very good.  The artichoke would have added some to it, but it stood the way it was very well.For dessert, how could I resist the deep fried Oreos with ice cream?  Four battered and deep fried Oreos and a martini glass of ice cream.  It was very good, but the Oreos lose something in the deep frying.  The creamy inside got lost with the fried crust of the batter.  If someone should offer me this again, I wouldn't turn them down.My server was named Princess.  She was very good.  Great personality and good service.  She kept my iced tea filled all during my meal.  As I was tackling dessert, one of our club members arrived and we were soon discussion our book about living in a Mumbai slum.  I felt somewhat guilty.The Martini is a quality niche bar for me.  The drinks will not wow you, and none of the menu items put a craving in the bowels of your soul that needs satisfying...but there are several reasons why you should make your way in here from time to time.Upon walking in to the Martini you immediately realize that this is not your average Vegas neighborhood bar...it looks and feels too nice for that.  It is certainly aesthetically pleasing with a classy, warm feel.  They a lot of nice TVs here that make it a great spot to watch the game.  They also have an early Happy Hour with food and drink specials.  One of my favorite things is that the kitchen is open late, so you can head in to The Martini after 10pm when most other places have closed their kitchens and still order up some decent  food.  In general I would shell out 3 Stars for the bar & restaurant...but when you include these niche specialties it's and easy round-up for me.I am a fan and will come back to enjoy their fantastic happy hour from 3-6 again!They make an Amazing pink cosmopolitan martini, I was really enjoying them throughout the evening.This place is dark and cozy with a touch of class! The service is great with friendly staff who really complete your experience.This is a great spot to meet up for a drink and just unwind from a long day of work or sex. I only wish I had been a visitor sooner as this is a nice spot that I have passed a kazillion times however never stopped in.I will be back for happy hour for sure, with $5 Amazing strong cocktails how can you go wrong! Don't forget to try the pink cosmopolitan, you won't regret it I promise!We have been there a number of times.  I was attempting to try, at least once, every martini on the menu.  I must warn you that the martini menu has many drinks on it but only a few really are made well there.  I have gotten some really vile (as in too bitter to swallow) drinks.  So, stick with the really well known drinks, or you might be sorry.The music they have is determined by the customer who chose songs on the jukebox in the corner.  You pay for and select songs to be queued up on the jukebox (this can be done from you smart phone).  However, if someone has more "pull" with the bartender than you do, does not like your music selection you will not be able to enjoy your selection since the volume will be reduced or shut off completely.  As the bartender explained to us regarding our selections: "There is this women with a lot of money who does not like country music".We prefer to take our business where all the drinks are "safe" to be ordered and where if the music is truly customer selected the customer hears that selection and is not subject to the "censoring" of those who are considered too rich to disappoint.I LOVE this bar. But don't tell everyone, keep it to your awesome Yelp selves, because what I love about this bar is there is always a great seat to watch the game. Add to that consistent, exemplary service, and delicious food and drink, and we have a winner.Great Happy Hour food & drink specials, and interesting local beers on tap. Really relaxing lighting (very important). So important actually. Some of the 'new' startup breweries/bars could learn a thing or two from this spot.And smoke-free. Rare and awesome. (They didn't sell-out to the average chain-smoking mid-30s single mom with 2 kids that loses $1K+ a week to video poker machines.) A harsh generalization, but very real.Perfect volume for a bar. Not too loud, and quiet enough to be able to have a normal, private conversation. These folks know what they're doing!
World Famous Tuscany Pizza=What happened?!?!??!?! I ordered a pizza last night at around 1:30 am and I was pleasantly surprised. They were really fast, friendly, and communicated well. We ordered a 12" pizza with half cheese, and half tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic, pepperoni, and sausage. We asked for 3 ranch and a 6 pack of sierra mist, and all of it was brought to us within 30 minutes for a reasonable price.The pizza was amazing! The crust was crunchy and chewy, and the sauce was sweet and spicy. We were so impressed that my fiancee and I were talking about it all day and telling people about the place.The meat on the pizza was fantastic, especially the sausage, and it was overall so great that we ordered another one tonight.Tonight was a polar opposite of last night. We called a little bit earlier and the phone call seemed to go well. The person on the phone recognized our order and was really friendly. We got the same exact pizza and an order of mozzarella sticks. The food arrived in around 30 minutes, and everything seemed great, but once we got the pizza, I immediately noticed that there was no meat on it.  I had requested a lot of ranch since I ended up spilling all of mine the night before, and they didn't bring me the requested number, even though I had offered to pay for a lot.There was no marinara sauce for the mozzarella sticks, even though on the phone, they suggested the mozzarella sticks and that they were good paired with the marinara sauce. I was irked enough to call them around 1:30 am to express my displeasure with my pizza since we had planned to order from them tomorrow night as well. The person I spoke to on the phone was not helpful at all. When I said the pizza was wrong, he said "You wanted tomatoes and mushrooms right?"I told him I ordered a pizza with 5 toppings and read the list to him. I explained that all I saw were mushrooms and tomatoes. He had the gall to say to me, "Well, there's garlic on there too, you can't see it because it's cut up real small."Um, that doesn't explain the lack of sausage and pepperoni on there. He goes on to tell me that there's nothing he can do for me because they were about to close, and that I should call tomorrow. That's total BS in my book because he's dumping off his problem on someone else who won't know what's going on tomorrow, and I had ordered a pizza at 1:30 in the morning yesterday and had it delivered to me a little after 2 am. The pizza wasn't as good today, not only because of the lack of meat on the pizza, but also because of inconsistency in the crust. It's kind of soggy and doughy and as you pick it up, the whole slice starts to sag and the meager toppings start sliding off with the cheese. I'm giving this 3 stars for now because I'm going to call them tomorrow and see how they handle themselves. To be continued....
Don Tortaco Mexican Grill=Cheap, delicious and open 24/7. This place is legit!*They have a salsa bar with unlimited red sauce, green sauce, cucumbers, the carrot mix and limes. *They speak English *It's clean and beautifully decorated inside *If you are a rolled taco person they roll them and cook them fresh to order chicken or beef. So far my favorite is the Carne Asada burrito, but since I don't want to look like a double wide trailer I've only had it's goodness once. My lifestyle is low carb so I get the grilled steak platter with no rice or tortillas. It comes with beans and a side salad with fresh avocado and a tomato slice for $3.99. I'm completely satisfied. Everything I have tried has been pretty damn good. I just wish they offered the free warm chips like the place before.
Jaleo=Let me preface this by saying that Jaleo still has some kinks to work out, but it has 4 star potential.  If you're vegan, and don't feel like trekking to the Wynn, Jaleo has a ton of tasty vegan(izable) options for you.  I used to live in DC and go to the original Jaleo in my pregan days, so I was very excited to see Jose Andres open a restaurant here!I went there solo and ate at the tapas bar, which is fun, because you get to watch them make all kinds of little dishes and you can ask the sous chefs about what they're making etc.  Plus the people next to me were very friendly and we had a nice chat.  The atmosphere seems very laid back and conducive to such interactions.  (Note: it's not like a sushi bar; they don't serve you directly.  A server will come up behind you and take your order.)You would be well-advised to make a reservation if you want to eat there on a weekend night - it was completely packed with a line when I went.  I got the only seat left in the place!Note: the food here is VERY salty because they use a lot of finishing salts.  If you aren't into that, just request your food with "no added salt."  I had the pan con tomate (tomato bread), espinacas (wilted spinach with apples and shallots), papas arrugas (salted roast potatoes with red and green chile sauces - not spicy though), and the chef brought out a sample of the veggie paella!  I also had apple sorbet for dessert.  (For Bay Area people - they use the same Pacojet technology as Scream Sorbet to make an amazingly creamy vegan sorbet).Everything was very tasty, if a bit oily and salty.  Very rich!  (I will order w/ no added salt next time.)  The folks next to me shared their sangria, which was very tasty (although not made the traditional way... they add the fruit to your glass rather than macerating in the wine.)The service was very attentive at times, but hit or miss.  I had a great time and enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back with a group so I can try lots more things!For you non-vegan foodies, you might wanna check out e, the chef's tasting room at Jaleo.  They do a 20-course dinner (two seatings a night) for ~$150.  They can make exceptions for some dietary restrictions/allergies, but sadly don't do a vegan version (yet?). Here is a list of the vegetarian/vegan/veganizable dishes:Pan con tomate -tomato breadGazpacho - cold tomato soupManzanas con hinojo y manchego (minus cheese) - apple-fennel saladEspinacas a la Catalana - wilted spinach with sherry dressing and applesEscalivada - cold roasted eggplant and pepperSetas a ajillo - garlic mushroomsTrigueros con romesco - asparagus w/ Romesco sauceEnsalada de coles de bruselas con albaricoques, manzanas y jamon (minus the jamon - ham) - brussels sprout saladRemolacha con citricos (minus the cheese) - citrus/beet saladPapas Arrugas with mojo verde y rojo - roasted potatoesVerdura Paella - Veggie paella (they do not use chicken stock, only water)My last visit to Vegas we stopped by Jaleo for a late dinner.  We were sat immediately and given an iPad to order our drinks....very cool.We ordered a bottle of Wine and several plates of Tapas:Pan con tomate - Toasted slices of Bread with Tomato $5Chorizo Palacios - Spicy Pork Sausage $8Arroz de pato 'Jean-Louis Palladin' - Rice with Duck Confit, Duck Breast and Foie Gras Cream $11Patatas bravas - Potatoes w/spicy Tomato Sauce & Alioli $7The Tapas were very good and full of flavor.Overall, it was a great dining experience.Return Factor - 90%Oh Jaleo, you bring out the worst in me.I'm one of those eaters that: (1) has zero patience to read a menu, especially when most of it is in a foreign language; (2) if I can't decide what I want, I pester the server and neighboring diners for recommendations; and (3) knows exactly what I want and how I want it.  Jaleo, for better or worse, hits all four proverbial nails.Jaleo's menu isn't the biggest, but there are a large number of dishes offered.  And most of it is in Spanish.  Unless you read the English description.  Well, as I said before, I have no patience to read every description to settle on a handful of openers.  Which sucks because we ended up with the cod empanadas, which, oh, btw, doesn't really have any cod in it.  It's basically a fish cream that's been deep fried in thin and crisp empanada shell with some honey drizzled on it.  You might like it and love it, but my friends and I could not stomach this to save our lives.  We Fear Factored the shmuck who ordered it as punishment.  Yes, he smelled like fish after that.  The menu doesn't suck if you read Spanish.  Or you have the patience to actually read everything.  Deal killer?  Nope, because......I pester people to give strong recommendations.  Sucks for everyone else except me!  Using this method, we stumbled across a ginfully good Gin & Tonic.  They ship their ice sphere (don't call it a ball) from their sister ship in LA.  Seriously.  The care and attention that goes into this one drink suggests that they care about all of their products (apparently even that cod cream).  Speaking of attention, the food in the shoe definitely grabbed ours, as we promptly ordered the delectable pollo croquetas (sp?) that occupy the footwear.  Those little morsels of what tasted like really good creamed chicken in a crunchy fried shell are really yum.  Another great recommendation was that we try their off-menu paella (I don't know what it's called because we said we'd take it before the server even described it).  To our surprise it was loaded with a whole lobster tail, a giant lobster claw (a bitch to break open), a few prawns and a few muscles.  Killer good that dish, but......not as good as the Iberico Short Rib Paella recommended on my first visit.  It was so rich and tasty that we wanted another plate.  I daydream about it.  I drool uncontrollably.  My second visit to Jaleo was specifically to have this dish again.  Upon sitting, before ordering drinks or even water, we asked for, nay DEMANDED this paella.  To which our humble server replied they were not going to be making it.  At all.  For the rest of the night.  Once the tears stopped, I pulled myself together with a wonderful Gin & Tonic, had some pretty good dishes (like the potato wrapped chorizo and roast quail) then went over to Blue Ribbon for oxtail fried rice to dull the pain...but that's for another review.  Yeah, Jaleo, you've got a lot going for you.  Your food's mostly good.  But I think I need Rosetta Stone and some valium to get through the menu.  And you need to get some more damn Iberico short ribs for the best paella in the world!Snobbish foodies who contemplate with furrowed brow, the intricate flavors brought forth by the deft hand of the chef, EAT ELSEWHERE!!!  Jaleo is about great traditional and modernist tapas, and a fun experience.The long menu of unfamiliar sounding dishes can be intimidating.  Just remember, more = better.  The menu is cohesive.  Each dish compliments or contrasts with others building layers of flavors or creating flavor explosions.  You can throw darts blindly at it and every selection would work together.  Don't get caught up in the details.  Dining on tapas should be social and fun!After multiple visits, and tasting almost the entire menu, lets just say, my taste may not be the same as yours so rather than making specific dish recommendations, here are some general guidelines:- Follow Andre Zimmern's maxim:  if it sounds good, eat it.  Try, try, try.  - Do not pass on the jamones produced by Fermin (Spanish hams).  This is one of the few places that you can eat the real deal in the States.  The acorn fed, black footed pig has a very unfamiliar taste and might not be for everyone but try, try, try.- Spanish wines and sherries pair perfectly with the tapas (mixed drinks, beer, and new world wines don't).  Unfamiliar with wines Spanish wines?  Ask for a recommendation.  The restaurant has a great selection by the glass.  Try, try, try.- Keep it social.  Eat, drink (pass around a poron - just stick to the cava if you never tried it before so you don't stain your clothes), and enjoy!Note:  Jaleo houses the incredible E, restaurant in a restaurant.  It's Jaleo on steroids.  See the reviewsDining is an experience.  At Jaleo, your experience depends on you.  Live, love and enjoy!Three visits to Jaleo at the Cosmopolitan and each time I've left more impressed than the last time. This past visit was with a party of six. Their menu is always intimidating because of the number of dishes available, so instead of debating which to order we opted for a tasting menu. Similar to an omakase, we left the decision making in the hands of our waiter and the kitchen, although we mentioned a couple specific items that we wanted. Our waiter said it would be about $50 per person for the food.What followed was a gluttonous feast of about 13 dishes plus two desserts that were almost all amazing. Our meal consisted of:Pan con tomate (2 orders) - toasted slices of crispy bread brushed with fresh tomatoThree queso (2) - cheese platterJamon serrano (3) - 18-month salt-cured hamEspinacas (2) - sauteed spinach, pine nuts, raisins and applesBruselas de jamon (2) - warm brussels sprouts salad with apricots, apple and serrano hamGambas al ajillo (2) - shrimp sauteed with garlicPulpo a feira (2) - boiled octopus with potatoes, pimenton and olive oilMejillones al vapor (1) - steamed mussels with bay leaf, lemon and olive oilCalamares tinta (2) - seared fresh squid with squid ink sauce, artichokes and pearl onionsCarne asada (2) - grilled skirt steak with piquillo pepper confitCodorniz Catalan (2) - grilled whole quail with apple puree and pinenutsEnsalada Malaguena (1) - traditional salad from malaga of Spanish cod, oranges, potato and black olivesPaella Iberico (1) - made with the ribs of Iberico pigsFlan (1) - classic Spanish flan with espuma of Catalan cream and orangesPan con chocolat (1) - chocolate cake with hazelnut praline ice cream and salted caramel sauceThe spinach dish sounds simple but the flavors that they were able to coax out of those common ingredients was unforgettable. Even if you're not a fan of those leafy greens chances are you'll love it. Other favorites were the mussels (much better than the previous time I had them), quail, and the squid, a dish as beautiful as it was delicious.I could probably list all as my favorites because each was well executed. Some caught our attention with bold and complex flavors while others were more subtle, yet just as refined. It was an excellent mix that showcased the ingredients and the chefs' skills. The relaxed pace of the meal (about two and a half hours) gave us plenty of time to appreciate each dish and try plenty of cocktails and sangria.After it was all said and done, we walked out spending about $120 a person (including alcohol, tax and tip). For an outstanding meal on the Strip that's more than reasonable.Dear Jose Andres,Please stop making such delicious food. My bank account hurts.Jaleo has one of the largest menus I've ever seen. Factor in my inability to settle on just a few items, I will get just about everything that peaks my interest... Which unfortunately for me is everything on this massive menu T__T The food here is fabulous. It's not just delicious but creative, innovative and exciting!Jaleo has a 5-star selection of cured meats. I personally like to start my meal with these items. I consider the embutidos to be the money-waster section of the menu. Portion sizes are small. Zero bang for your buck but oh so totally worth it. If you're feeling frisky, opt for the kobe of pork products. You only get like 5-6 slices but the cured ham from the magical unicorn pig from the isles of... gotcha! In all seriousness, get the black-footed Iberico just once. It's supposedly fed only acorns and results in meat that makes your mouth water just looking at it.Vegetable-wise, Jaleo makes an amazing warm brussel sprouts salad with apricots, apple and serrano ham. They only use the outer leaves and they're cooked to perfection so they still have a bit of bite. Its a good enough portion for 2 but you'll want the whole bowl to yourself. Also noteworthy is their sauteed spinach. And where else can you get Liquid Olives? These little suckers are a result of some sweet molecular gastronomy. Little blobs of deliciousness that emulsify on the  palate. Sounds weird but I swear they're amazing. They're served with 'real' olives too. I'm a beet addict and always looking for new ways to prepare them. Their Beet Salad prep is 1. different from every place else (no generic roasted beets with goat cheese) and #2 has pistachios in it--the junk food of nuts.Some of my favorite fried items include the Bacon-Wrapped Dates (nothing special but still delicious), the fried eggplant, and the Cod Empanadas (they're served with honey which makes these totally addicting!)Seafood: Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp & garlic) and the Squid w/ Squid Ink. If you're craving mussels, order them elsewhere. The ones here are pretty uninspired.This review is getting a little lengthy so I'll just finish the food stuff by saying the carne asada needs to be ordered. :)How much you spend is entirely dependent on how much food it takes to satiate your appetite and how much meat you order in comparison to the potatoes.  I mean that literally and figuratively. We generally spend $50-80 per person when we come here. Most dishes run $10-20 but of course there are the outliers (like the ham and paella). And drinks are pretty pricy here too. When you have that WTF moment when you see Jose's $17 gin & tonic... trust me and Jose when we say it is THE BEST gin & tonic you will ever have in your life. Juniper Berries are the business. Plus, be endlessly entertained by the ice sphere (which I like to obsess over every time).We came back here for some Spanish tapas, food was still very delicious, it just they don't have any fish, people don't eat fish in Spain? A lot of meat choices, very few Vegetarian / Vegan and Pescetarian plates, so I couldn't order as much as I wanted, the choices were limited. But the plates I ordered were very very good! We decided to do small plates only, didn't want any Paellas. Started off with that famous Jaleo gin & tonic again, so sweet and refreshing, loved that ice cube! Hubby had a margarita drink, strong and yummy, two salmon roe cones for us, I just love that cone! Salty with a lot of flavors in one cone, amazing! Sautéed cauliflower, with chopped olives and dates: salty and sweet in one plate, unique taste, very delicious, loved it! Seared scallops, with romesco sauce: very tender with strong flavors, we liked it a lot.Shrimp sautéed with garlic: sooooo good! The garlic in it was amazing, shrimps were tender and delicious.Garlic soup: it came so late, don't know why? But right at the moment when hubby needed some warm soup, he liked it. Skirt steak from the famous black-footed ibérico pigs of spain served with toasted tomato bread, mojo verde and alioli: the portion was huge, good for 2 or 3 people to share, too bad I couldn't eat it, hubby loved it! Juicy, tender, great with the sauces came with it! The bread with tomato spread was so delicious! I had a Grey Goose martini twist after gin & tonic, the food was so good, the portions were not even small, especially that skirt steak, hubby couldn't finish it, we had it boxed, didn't want to waste a $60 plate. The tab was $200 ish. I like this fun looking restaurant a lot, colorful and playful, great service, great drinks, casual and relaxing!Ending up at Jaleo was a mishap, but dining here ended up being a pleasure.We thought we had made reservations for é by José Andrés, which is nested inside Jaleo. The Cosmopolitan's front desk had transferred our call to Jaleo, which oversees reservations for both dining experiences. Miscommunication ensued. The hostess was all smiles and apologies when we arrived. We were disappointed, but not shattered, seeing that Jaleo is still born from Chef José Andrés's creative mind, just less...avant garde. Compared to The Bazaar which I had visited in Miami, Jaleo's dishes had less pizzazz and showmanship, but still utilized fine ingredients, impeccably prepared. The menu offered a number of dishes procured from black-footed, acorn-fed pigs, like the Lomo Ibérico De Bellota Fermín, thinly-sliced cured pork loin. It was tender, rich, and flavorful. The Arroz de pato 'Jean Luis Palladin' was an impressive take on duck on rice, smokey grilled duck breast atop creamy, short-grained rice mixed with more duck. It almost didn't need, but was accentuated by, the foie gras cream.After some salmon roe cones, a cheese and fruit plate, and some pork mini burgers, we cleansed our palate with the Salmorejo, a chilled tomato soup garnished with a quartet of bacon bits, boiled egg, chives, and crackers. It looked like an impressionistic painting of a sunrise and tasted equally refreshing. The only two drawbacks from this dinner was that the Mini Pepito De Ibérico (mini burgers) were too greasy, and that the service slowed considerably as the tables filled up. Getting our waiter's attention by the end of the night was challenging, but enjoying a surprisingly satisfying meal we did not plan for was no challenge at all.The chef bangs the bell and then everyone yells PAELLA!!!!!!And with that, I knew the "Arroz Con Costillas De Cerdo Ibérico De Bellota" (made with the ribs of the famous, black-footed Ibérico de bellota pigs of Spain) was ready and would be coming my way any minute.  The paella was rich, flavorful and I gnawed on every rib until nothing was left.  I semi contemplated another order but then the manicotti/lasagnaesque/alfredoey pork and foie gras canelones with bechamel sauce shut me the heck up :)  My wife wasn't a fan of because it was too cheesy and creamy but I am down for anything foie gras related.  The seared fresh squid with squid ink sauce, artichokes and pearl onions was delectable.  Nice presentation!  It's rare for a place to serve the whole squid with innards and all.  I initially thought it was stuffed and couldn't put my finger on what was in it until our friendly server informed us.  I'd totally have squid ink as a hot beverage by the way.   Bottom line is I need to come back here with a bigger group to sample more stuff like a heckuvalot more black foot pig.  If they ever make Pulp Fiction 2, Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace might have a discussion over the $20 gin and tonics.  Oh wait, he was killed.  Nevermind.  I am ready to go to "e" asap!¡Saludos a volver por la buena comida! With so many wonderful internationally recognized chef owned restaurants located on the Strip, we returned to Jose Andrés' Jaleo for a Spanish lunch. We had just arrived into Las Vegas only a few hours prior to our noontime reservation and we were excited for a taste of paella and other tapas.  Our server, Jason, greeted us with friendly familiarity and described the lunch menu as an abbreviated or highlighted dinner menu that we were familiar with from previous dines. We started with cocktails and ordered their 3-course lunch special. Jason piqued my interest with a cocktail called "Con Membrillo" that was a Seasonal concoction of quince paste, rum, egg white and nutmeg. There were probably more ingredients in that cocktail that I don't just remember listing.  But, after a couple of smooth sips, I was transported to Madrid's Plaza Mayor in Fall. My husband ordered a Spanish beer, Estrella Damm Inedit Witbier to begin his "journey".  Meanwhile, our order of Jamón Ibérico Fermín with picos arrived.  It was a small plate of porky deliciousness that melted like butter as soon as it hit your tongue. The paper-thin slices were paired with crisp "picos" or mini breadsticks.  We both ordered the Complete Spanish Lunch that was a 3-course meal. It started with Ensalada Verde (Bibb lettuce, red onions and sherry dressing), Gazpacho estilo Algeciras (classic chilled Spanish soup made with tomato, cucumber, peppers and bread) and Paella del Dia (today's special featured chicken and mushrooms). It was a value for its price at $26 per person. Jason brought out each course in a timely succession...we weren't in a rush and had the time to savor the flavors. The food was well-seasoned and we were seated to watch the chef prepare the paella over the open-fire wood burning grill. We liked Jason's attentiveness, efficiency and positive attitude.Jaleo is great if you know what to order- I predict a second experience here would go far better than my first. We ordered several suggested dishes only to be underwhelmed and unimpressed at the beginning of our meal, but as we branched out and tried some of the more exotic choices, the quality and experience improved sharply. Learn from our mistakes!PLAY IT SAFEPAN DE CRISTAL CON TOMATE FRESCO: toasted bread with fresh tomato. Tasty but very basic, kick it up to something that's actually worth getting by adding Manchego cheese or anchovies.JAMON IBERICO FERMIN: if you're going to come here, you may as well try the famous ham. It's not all that much different from prosciutto, in my opinion. We were underwhelmed.COLIFLOR CON OLIVAS Y FRUTOS SECOS: the contrasting flavors of the dates and olives was enjoyable, but the roasted cauliflower that forms the base of the dish was treated as an afterthought. CROQUETAS DE POLLO: described as chicken fritters and served inside of a shoe, this will add some excitement to an otherwise tame table of dishes. One in our party described this dish as "like a mini hot pocket of chicken pot pie". It was tasty, but not the standout menu item other reviews (or even our server) made it out to be.ARROZ CON COSTILLAS DE CERDO IBERICO DE BELLOTA Y ALCACHOFA: The pig-rib paella is tasty but not particularly adventurous. This is the only paella I've ever had where the rice was extremely crispy- I am not sure if it was overcooked, if we just got the bottom of the batch, or if it was intentional, but I did not particularly like it. GO FOR THE GOLDJOSE ANDRES GIN & TONIC: $20 for a G&T is ridiculous, but luckily it is also ridiculously good.ACEITUNAS RELLENAS Y ACEITUNAS "FERRAN ADRIA": Olives two ways! One is stuffed with pimiento and anchovies, the other is a liquid olive using molecular gastronomy cooking techniques. It's essentially a flavored bubble and fairly fun to experience.BUNELOS DE BACALAO: Deep-fried salt codfish with honey aioli. The sauce is unlike anything else I've had, and the crispy fried fish is well-executed without being greasy.CAZON FRITO: AKA SHARK NUGGETS! I love this dish. Fried thresher shark with a garlic aioli. I've never had shark but now I'm definitely interested in trying other versions. This was battered without being crispy, fried without being greasy, and simple without disappointing. Would get again!PULPO ASADA CON CREMA CEBOLLA: Perfectly-charred grilled octopus, served with green cherry tomatoes, onion puree, and garlic oil. This was fantastic, the entire table considered it a top dish. Must order!COSTILLAS DE CORDERO MORUNO: Succulent grilled rack of lamb with parsley oil. Simple but amazing. One of my favorite versions of lamb in Vegas.PASTEL DE CAFE: "Chocolate, coffee, and hazelnut tart with coffee rum ice cream." The menu description doesn't do it justice at all. The base is like a crunchy cookie, topped with pure coffee-chocolate deliciousness, then a smooth ice cream with a delicious sauce on the plate. An indulgent, coffee-lovers dessert.We ordered the dishes above in nearly this exact order. Total with tax and tip was just over $250, for a filling dinner for a group of three. As later dishes kept impressing us, I began to get a better feel for the restaurant's strengths, and would come back to try new items.I really hate to give lower than 3 stars but in my opinion Jaleo flavors weren't all that amazing for very high prices, small portions and pretty bleh service. My bestie wanted tapas for her birthday and we decided on Jaleo since none of us had tried them yet. It was pretty easy to get a reservation for Thursday at 9:30. I was thinking it'd be a bit busier because it was leading up to fight weekend but nope! They had a normal steady flow of people. Ambiance is cute, a nice place to catch up with friends or family. The atmosphere didn't feel stuffy at all. However, I will say that the spacing between courses felt a little bit too long and when the food came out, all of them could have been a bit warmer. They all were lukewarm. As for service, our server was nice, however, he did not offer explaining the menu, did not ask if it was our first time or even talk about the portion sizes. The only thing he did mention was specializing in Gin & Tonic variations on an iPad lol which were $20 each! The menu is very extensive and a bit confusing since all the dishes' names aren't in English! I wish he'd mention what his favorites were. I also saw $55 & $85 chef tasting options available, which I'd like to come back to try.Cítrico Gin & Tonic $20: Oxley gin, Fever-Tree Mediterranean tonic water, grapefruit, lemon, coriander, mint. The birthday girl got this one but we all got to taste it and geeze, I've had better G&Ts from PT'S! Everyone agreed that no one could taste anything except for the tonic water. We really could not taste ANY of the supposed grapefruit, lemon, etc. And for $20? The flavor should be better than $17 specialty cocktails at the Chandelier Bar. 0/5Dátiles con tocino 'como hace todo el mundo' $14: Fried bacon-wrapped dates served with an apple-mustard sauce. These were okay, very underwhelming. I'd rather go to Firefly and have their bacon wrapped dates any day. The bacon tasted a little charred and the dates weren't sweet. The mustard sauce was okay, nothing special. 2/5Mini pepito de ibérico* $8 EACH!: Spanish mini burger made from the legendary, acorn-fed, black-footed ibérico pigs of Spain with ibérico bacon. These were really good! Super flavorful, soft buns and very tender! However, at $8 EACH?! What?! They're not THAT amazing, expecially for how small they were. 4/5Rossejat' negra con Cigala $27: Toasted pasta, squid ink, sepia sofrito, Norwegian lobster and alioli. This one was my "favorite" but again there were some big issues that shouldn't be in a $27 dish. Half of the squid ink pasta was burnt onto the pan that it came in, I know this definitely only had enough to split by 2 people but between the 4 of us, we got basically a tablespoon of squid ink pasta each. Also the body of the super skinny Norwegian Lobster was cut in half but left the claws with no cut so we couldn't even get in them! Flavor was alright but I'll go to RX Boiler Room for his squid ink entree instead for larger portion and more developed flavors. 3/5Arroz con costillas de cerdo ibérico de bellota $36: Basically the Paella with the pig ribs. I was super excited for this one but was very disappointed. Rib meat was not tender, more on the dry and chewy side and as for flavor, meh. 2/5Salmón crudo con huevas de salmón $5/cone: Salmon tartare w/ salmon roe on top. These were super good! 4/5Overall, I still feel bad giving a not so great review after seeing so many people love this place but the whole experience for us was pretty underwhelming and forgettable for basically all areas: specialty drink, food, and service. Maybe we just came at an off night so I want to give this place another chance just for the tasting menus but it probably won't be anytime soon.I loved Jaleo DC and I jumped on the opportunity to dine at Jaleo when I realized they're in The Cosmopolitan next door to The Aria where I am staying. However, it was a little different!Menu looked identical but it wasn't the same. Some of the stuff I had in DC weren't here and the portion was super small. I remember dining in DC and was completely stuffed and our tab weren't that bad. It seemed the prices were way higher here.The dishes were good but just really puny for the price. Our server was good but she kept recommending things that were astronomical in price and she got the manipulation down in getting you to believe you had no other choice or that was the right choice.One of the most disappointing item she recommended was the hand carved jamon iberico. It came as dried puny sliced up ham at $35. It was so not worth it. I had the jamon on the bread before with crushed tomatoes in DC, it was so much cheaper and better. It felt like a snow job in this dessert heat. What a rip. Also, we wanted the seafood paella and our server kept saying that wasn't available until an hour later and the one available was the most expensive one $38 which we sadly ordered because we were starving!!! However, the croquettas, the spring vegetables with duck egg, chorizo wrapped in potato, boneless wings, and the sliders were delicious. Still, I can't give it lower than four stars as I'm truly a fan. I was just disappointed that I brought some people to dine here and we left kinda hungry and the tab was over $500 for sharable food people had no more than a bite of each. It was kinda embarrassing for me and I was hoping they weren't mad at me for having to blow 3 days worth of per diem dinner money here and were still hungry.DC won.
Popo's Fiesta Del Sol Mexican Food=Firstly, the people posting 4 and 5 stars are the only intelligent ones. Let me explain. The others are saying that the food is the same greasy Mexican food you can find anywhere. Evidently these people don't have a very developed palate. I don't think they can distinguish between fresh and frozen goods, proper spices and just extra cheese, or anything else. This was the best Ameri-Mexican food I've had in a LONG time.As for the service, we sat at a table in the bar because they were so busy and we were served CONSTANTLY by not one, but TWO servers.....This place rocks, the haters just came here with a predisposition to not like it....I was excited when my row mate on the plane told me that Popo's had opened a second location taking over an old Garcia's. I was totally bummed that this Popo's was kind of poopy compared to the original one in Maryvale. I ordered a cheese crisp and it was so sad I almost cried. The chicken taco was decent and the rice and beans were the requisite decent as were the chips and salsa. What totally sucked was the fact that their "guacamole" is something green (not real avocado mixed with sour cream). False advertising and I can just imagine what any lactose intolerant person would have to deal with if consuming this (thankfully, not one of my issues). I managed to order a couple of sides of avocado slices, some lemons and used their decent salsa to make my own guacamole. I grew up on Arizona Mexican food. This was not right on so many levels-except for our server who was adorable and accommodating.
Vegas CheeseSteaks=So yesterday was my 2nd time attempting to go there and eat. But yesterday the restaurant was gone. The place was inside of another place. Ask the Bartender and he said they moved and dunno where they went. How lovely they moved without posting it on their web site and they don't like to answer the phone when people call to get more information. Waiting on yelp to refund my deal that I purchased from them.Grrr =T
Krazy Buffet=As crazy as it sounds (pun intended), I am definitely a fan of Krazy Buffet. Tell me where else can you find another buffet that serves crab legs for 12.99? Besides their other location I dont remember anybody else doing the same thing. While most other places that charge you more for COLD crab legs, the ones they serve here are STEAMED. What's the difference you say? Well, besides the fact that you know it hasnt been sitting out from the night before, (hence refrigerating it is necessary so they can serve it again the next day and thats why a lot of places prefer to serve it cold), steaming it kills a lot of bacteria and/or any other germs that it may have with it. Most importantly, the crab meat tends to be more flavorful and moist.Not into crab? Well they have lots of other choices like crawfish, grilled fish, clams, mussels, oysters and even sushi. Soup choices from hot n sour to egg drop. Honey shrimp, spicy chicken, chicken wings, etc. and lots more that I am not putting here simply because of the fact that you are not going to eat every individual item. What you will end up doing just like me is sampling here and there which will eventually lead you back to those items that make your taste buds happy.A major plus for me is their Mongolian option. You put together on a plate your choice of meats which is shrimp, beef, pork, and chicken along with veggies like onions, green bell peppers, jalepenos, and mushrooms. You can top it off with minced garlic and/or chili sauce to give it that spicy kick. Then you hand it over to the cook who grills everything together until all is thoroughly cooked. He puts it on a plate for you and off you go to enjoy. What you want and how you want it to taste is obviously up to you.Service is pretty good. They do a good job of refilling your drinks and picking up your used dishes.Just remember the 12.99 price I am describing is for Dinner only. Here's the breakdown:Monday through Saturdays are as follows.Lunch: Adults are $8.29 and kids 4 to 10 years old are $4.29Dinner: Adults $12.99 and kids 4 to 10 years old are $6.99Sundays are all day dinner price.Senior Citizens and Military get 10 percent offSo in closing, the food here is pretty decent for the price you pay. They have another location off of Sahara but my preference is this one because its bigger and I think the service is a lot better. So whenever you are thinking of crab legs (especially steamed), then this is the place to go for the price is decent for what you get.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #108 "Feeling Crabby?"
Black Chile Mexican Grill=Sorry, Black Chile... I just wasn't a fan!Jared and I felt like trying something new one night last week, and after reading about how great Black Chile's burger was from our friends at EaterAZ, we thought we'd give this place a shot.The restaurant itself is spacious, the hostess and service attentive and friendly, and the decor is tasteful.  But unfortunately the food was nothing special, and I won't be rushing back...We started with chips and salsa.  I think they bring these to everyone.  These weren't bad.  For our meals, Jared went with the burger and I went for the fish tacos (per our waitress's recommendation) and a side of corn.  I liked the sticky rice and beans it came with but the rest of the meal was underwhelming.  Jared didn't love his either.Since my visit, I learned that this concept comes from restaurateurs Michael McDermott and Jason Merritt, who have been involved with the development of numerous restaurants including the famed Kona Grill. I thought it felt a little chainy!  That explains it ;)I'm pregnant so I didn't have a Corona or margarita, which may have made my meal taste better, but regardless, I've experienced much better Mexican food before... and with so many other Mexican concepts to choose from in the Valley, I probably won't be rushing back. Lo siento again, Black Chile!Great deal on great food for restaurant week!
La Shish Kabob=It was late on that hot and muggy Carolina Friday, and most places were closed, but their sign caught my eye. The smell of falafel was a delicious draw, so we decided to stop in. This is not a restaurant. This is a hub. The small restaurant was full of good sights, smells, and the chatter of friendly people in languages I didn't understand. Women in headscarves talked animatedly to eachother while scooping up laughing children to sit on their laps. Families talked to all tables as they sat down to delicious food.  Behind the counter, herbed beef, chicken, and lamb sizzled as music from Jerusalem sounded over the system. Meet Izzat. He opened La Shish Kabob about two months ago after moving his family here from Jerusalem. When he invites you into his restaurant, it's like he's inviting you into his home. We gladly took a seat.SERVICE: Astounding. Very pleasant and hospitable, and when I realized that I had accidentally ordered something with onions and green peppers (my friend is allergic), they instantly made another one and apologized even though it was my err. Instead of the original lamb kebab that was ordered, he made something that was a little different to better suit my friend's food requirements, without even being asked. And it was delicious.FOOD: If you've never experienced good Middle Eastern food, experience it here. They have all of the classics, from falafel to baba ghannouj. The tabouli was out of this world (so much better than I make, I'm going to have to snag his recipe), with that clean and fresh parsley, lemon and olive oil flavor. The kebab wraps (chicken and lamb) were flavorful and huge. They also sell the brand of mango nectar there that tastes like you're drinking a whole mango. Delicious. The baklavah and other goodies in the case looked mouth-watering, but I was too full. That comes on round 2.PRICE: This is the awesome part. A heaping portion of tabouli for two, two lamb kebab wraps, one chicken kebab wrap, and 4 mango drinks comes out to: $26. So cheap for not only the portion size, but the quality and freshness as well.When you walk into this place, you can feel that it's good people. If you stay, you'll quickly realize that it's good people, AND great food. When it's all over, you'll also see that it's all for a really affrodable price. I highly suggest giving this place some love, because it's one of the few places that will give it back.This place is everything that is RIGHT about the middle east. Great service, Great food, a crappy atmosphere that just screams "We are serving amazing food not supplying comfy chairs". I cant wait to return, truly a hidden gem.I'm kicking myself for not going here sooner!One thing Charlotte doesn't have a lot of is good middle eastern food.  If you find yourself in need of an emergency fix, get yourself to La Shish Kabob, STAT!  It's only a ten minute trip from uptown Charlotte.I had the mixed grilled kabob plate, which is a sampler of all their chunk meat and kafta kabob offerings over a delicious rice pilaf.  Very, very tasty stuff.  Make sure you ask for the red and green hot sauces (relishes, really) that they keep behind the counter.  That'll take your meal over the top.I tried their baba ghanoush and hummos, and both were excellent.To top it all off, the guy who runs the place looks like a characher from lord of the rings.  You'll know what I'm talking about when you go try this place out, which you should do immediately.
Yocoko Noodle Bar=If I had even the slightest shred of self respect, I wouldn't come here. But I'm currently the duke, so make of that what you will . . .The service is terrible, the place is always cold and giving forks to Western-looking folks and chopsticks to Asian-looking people without giving you the choice is annoying. And just giving you one napkin. Is there a napkin shortage I haven't heard about? Just put the napkins and cutlery on the table and let us do it ourselves! That would mean fewer encounters for the rude staff to endure too. "One fork, one napkin and one menu," as John Lee Hooker didn't sing. Sort it out!So why do I go back? The food. Absolutely delicious. Under five pounds for a tasty stir fry or soup, with free green tea. Of course I always spend more as I can't resist the crispy chilli beef strips for a starter (see photos).It's just the kind of place that Edinburgh needed - no frills, cheap and cheerful noodle house in the centre of town. The menu is a crazy concoction of various Asian dishes, but it's better than Wagamama and half the price. The Singapore noodles (with the option of ho fun rather than vermicelli) are fantastic.I was going to give it 4 stars for the food, but last time I had to eat with my coat on because of the cold and one of the staff was incredibly rude (though the other was very nice). But I'll keep going back for the food . . .
Haulin Balls=Forget about all the ball jokes. This is one food truck that should be taken seriously because of their tasty eats. The Godfather was a hit -- 2 ground beef meat balls with fresh basil, parsley, garlic, onions, pomodoro sauce, pecorino romano, and plenty of melted mozzarella in a soft, chewy bun. The savory meatballs had plenty of depth in flavor and were perfectly tender, not mushy.The Zorba (ground lamb, fresh mint, oregano, parsley, garlic, served with a tomato-olive spread, lettuce, feta, red onion and homemade tzatziki sauce) was decent, but the taste of the lamb wasn't overly appealing. I did enjoy the olive spread and appreciated the subtlety of the mint, but I don't think it's a sammie I'd get again.The pricing is as follows: 1 for $5, 2 for $9, or 3 for $12. Two sandwiches should be enough for most people, but if you're really hungry, add on a side. I was starving so I got an order of skin-on fries ($2). I have no idea if they were made fresh or were frozen, but the portion size is quite large and they were crispy, light, and delicious.
China Tango=Good consistent casual Chinese food at a great value. Located close to home, China Tango is on the corner of N Green Valley Pkwy & Pebble Rd. I've been meaning to write them a review for some time, so here it is. Whether I've dined in, gotten delivery or carry-out (I've done all three numerous times!) I haven't been disappointed with their food, service, and overall experience. It's been my go-to spot for fast, affordable Chinese food.What I love:- No MSG. Enough said.- They offer brown rice. Healthy!- Generous portions. Cause we're hungry people! Or we just love leftovers.- Lunch specials are till 4pm. Who can always fit lunch before 2pm?- Lots of vegetables. Crispy veggies too, not the gross wilted ones you get at other places.They have all the traditional orders, from chow mein, sweet & sour pork, orange chicken, honey walnut shrimp, fried rice, hot & sour soup, it goes on and on. Prices range from $7.25-$9.95. Lunch is from $5.95-$6.50, which includes fried or steamed rice & chow mein & egg drop soup (dine-in only). Complete family dinners start from $24.95 & they serve Thai tea or fruit smoothies with boba.Most importantly, they've always been timely. Food is served fast, carry-out is ready, and delivery is always punctual. Tasty, affordable, reliable. It's not gourmet, but it's fresh, clean Chinese for a great price! I'll be back soon :)
The Arrogant Butcher=Waiting for Arrogant Butcher to open, my patience was low, apprehension was high, and excitement was through the roof. Finally, the day has come when it was mine to try. Fox Concepts are hit and miss with me, as some of the ones I love are super cheesy (Olive and Ivy, Modern Steak, Bloom), and some that I don't love are ones that are extremely popular (Sauce, Blanco, and Zinburger.)What sets Arrogant Butcher apart from the rest is it is the first downtown Phoenix restaurant that Fox RC has put out there. I'm sure they are nervous, and you can tell that from the design of the restaurant... it's much smaller than normal like they are testing the waters, yet in other ways it excels in the money spent meter. Three beautiful private dining rooms, a chef's counter facing the exhibition kitchen which they spared no expense on, and a great four sided bar in the middle. The atmosphere is a definite throwback to the 40's and 50's, which is nice considering you can't find that in many places downtown. It's truly a feel of an old tavern and restaurant. Arrogant Butcher went out of their way to support local. Almost all of the beers on the tap as well as on the bottle list are Arizona breweries, there are pictures all over the restaurant of historic Phoenix landmarks and famous people, and they have done a great job of engaging the street with the patio and entrance. Yup, Sam Fox, the guy who is building a national empire of restaurants, brought downtown Phoenix a place that gives a nice sense of community.As for the food, all apprehensions were set aside when the bowl of mussels in wine sauce with spicy pork shoulder, roasted grape tomatoes, and french fries came to the table. The dish was outstanding and had me wishing I could drink the broth. My main course of the crab stuffed chicken, served cordon blue style, with myers lemon and capers was also a very well executed dish. It was served with sauteed spinach underneath which I ate ridiculously quick. Other items on the menu sounded great, and AB offers a list of meats and cheeses, as well as a daily special that rotates weekly, and a nice array of sandwiches and salads for lunch. The desserts are fantastic as well, especially the peanut butter cup dessert, which is not served the way you would think it is, and includes cookies for dipping. So no, this restaurant is not a locally owned, mom and pop style place, but rather it is a restaurant with a formula that is crowd pleasing, set in a location that could really use something of it's type, with the power to draw people in by the numbers. My biggest impression? on the first dinner service night, there were absolutely no hiccups in service. Our waitress, bussers, and drink people were all absolutely spot on. Keep it coming, Arrogance.I had the opportunity to take part in Arrogant Butcher's preview lunch and I was totally impressed with the restaurant's design and the staff's performance. The service in particular was nothing short of spectacular, especially considering the size of the event and the Downtown notables in attendance (Mayor Gordon, City higher-ups, media). I love the Butcher's view of US Airways Center and Chase Field and its vantage point will only improve if the city can just find a way to utilize that awful parking lot across from the basketball arena. With business reemerging in the warehouse district and baseball season fast approaching, things are definitely looking up for those blocks of Downtown.Anyway, back to the Butcher. The entrees were well-received. I found my pastrami sandwich on pretzel bread to be way too salty, but I figure I made my own bed ordering cured meat on a pretzel. The crab cake salad, stew, jambalaya, roasted chicken and salmon plates all received enthusiastic thumbs up from our table and the desserts (cheesecake and chocolate cake cups) were delicious.The bar is a huge square with heavy stone counters, plenty of seating and flatscreens, insuring that the Butcher will be a popular happy hour and pregame destination. There's also a wraparound patio.Prices seemed friendly, too. I'm not a Fox RC devotee but could see myself becoming a regular at Arrogant Butcher.Walking into Arrogant Butcher will instantly increase your swank level by at least 25.6%, seriously. This modern chophouse by Sam Fox puts a sexy spin on nouveau-nostalgic, and trendy flair on classic American fare in typical Fox fashion. Plus it's located in the heart of downtown Phoenix which is on the verge of a full blown revival, and right on the lightrail which makes it terribly convenient for anyone who lives in the area. The handcrafted cocktails were quite impressive. I'm all over house made mixers,  vintage spirits, and super fresh ingredients that translate into something really sublime in every sip. Don't miss the bourbon infused 'Candlestick Maker', and if you're in the mood for something sensational and eclectic look no further than the heavenly gin and chartreuse laced cocktail dubbed 'The Last Word'. Indeed.For the soft-opening we attended the service was spot on, actually more like exceptional. And the food they served up followed closely behind. We sampled the mussels in wine sauce with spicy pork shoulder with pomme frites (that's fancy for french fries), crab stuffed chicken, skirt steak and grilled swordfish with artichokes hearts.  Although slightly salty, and somewhat expected... it was still  flavorful,  delicious, and very satisfying. Yes, Fox is a somewhat of local restaurant giant and Arrogant Butcher does have a decidedly chain vibe to it. But why so serious, downtown/midtown/cenpho elitist diner? It's a chain vibe in the best sense of the term. It really was an overall a fantastic and festive experience! Definitely joining the ranks of lively new downtown establishments I plan to frequent often. Look for me at the bar, cocktail in hand, swag in full effect. Thank you very much.FINALLY!!! Downtown has a flagship restaurant. There are many fantastic restaurants downtown, don't get me wrong, but to me, The Arrogant Butcher now reigns supreme. The service was attentive and friendly, and they all looked sharp in their white shirts and skinny black ties. I'm a fan of Fox's other restaurants and have always been impressed with the food. I had Toast, which was some kind of bread from heaven covered in brie and apples and something else delicious. Then for 6 bucks I got a beer and a shot of Jim Beam. Best happy hour downtown?? I think so. The location couldn't be better. The patio is a fantastic addition to downtown streets. Now the city needs to develop those hideous empty lots across the street. Inside is open and airy with some areas for private parties and a huge bar. I could go on and on about how awesome the Arrogant Butcher is. (How I love the name!!) It's modern, masculine, urban, unique, and such a welcome addition to downtown Phoenix.This is a tricky one. AB is a really cool looking spot, really nice decor and ambiance, comfy booths, it even smells like a new car.My group was greeted promptly by smiling hosts, and seated in a nice booth. Drink orders were placed, and when our margaritas arrived, they were really, really off and tasted terrible. Even after stirring, and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough, and didn't taste good. Our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff. My replacement drink was a Polish Fizz, and it was perfect. Highly recommended.For an app we went with the pretzel fondue, thanks to Yelpers who recommended it. As advertised, it was delicious, and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips, and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty, but the price point, for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries, along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again, the food was good, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions, euro style, etc. but for a bar food staple? I wasn't looking for a Costco serving of anything, but either bump up portion size, or drop the price from $16 to $11.50.I really liked our server, but for some reason as things went on, he was more and more absent. To be fair, we had a really difficult person that joined us, some of the stuff this person said made me want to pull my hair out, so I feel his pain.Anyway, AB is a very attractive spot that might be great for drinks and app. but for this price point, I would hit Durant's, Hillstone, or Beckett's Table. It's nice to leave a spot feeling that you got your monies worth, and that just doesn't happen here.I think all the 5 star reviews are from people who work here, of which there must be 500.  Look at the trend all 5s then 2,3 and a few 4s.  I HATE that.First off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.Lets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.Next the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.Drinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.   Now the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here.No valueFood:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak.My mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.Dessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.Value:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!Arrogant Butcher is exactly what Downtown Phoenix has needed for awhile: a restaurant with a great atmosphere, yummy food, friendly staff and one that takes reservations! This afternoon, I dined here for lunch and was pleased from the get-go. I arrived a little bit before my fellow lunchers, so I put our name in. It must have been perfect timing because about ten minutes later, the place had a line out the door. So for note one, I say to come at off hours, so for example, come at 11:50 instead of 12. The atmosphere here is open, airy and fresh. I love the sidewalk patio and the windows so that even if you aren't eating outside, you can still experience the fresh air and outdoor feel. The bar is seated in the middle and I noticed several local brews on tap. I also noticed several tasty drinks such as a skinny berry mojito. Since it was the middle of the day on a Tuesday, I didn't get the chance to try it, but you better believe that I will definitely be back! Now let's move on to the food. Have you been to Culinary Dropout? If you answered yes, then you will be well familiar with this food. Sam Fox did an excellent job of mirroring the menu from his Scottsdale restaurant for the Arrogant Butcher. I saw that they have a similar Turkey Pastrami on the menu and I was told that the sweet potato tortellinis are to die for, more like dessert. Unfortunately, I personally didn't try either, but I did have the Grilled Chicken Tabbouleh with avocado added. It came in a rather large bowl and I will admit that I ate every last bite it was so good. The dressing is an Oregano vinaigrette and the salad is graced with grilled chicken, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta, almonds and a couple other secret ingredients they didn't list on the menu. After our "ladies who lunch" 'esque meal, the staff happily validated our parking (making my parking free!) and sent us on our way. As we walked out the doors, we were met with the carpenters union who decided that today was the day to protest, but that's what happens when you're in a real city right? And if that's the case, Downtown Phoenix...you are well on your way!This seems like the perfect spot to eat at before a game, especially since they accept reservations and they are across the street from the stadiums! I did overhear the hostess say that there aren't many tables that seat more than six, so if you are coming with a large party, you should probably call ahead to ensure seating. Bravo Sam Fox. Another job well-done.Arrogant Butcher. Arrogant Bastard. Arrogant Butthole. I don't care what the name is, I had a really great time here. Finding it, however, was laughable. This whole Cityscape thing is a big FAIL to me so far. Why they didn't choose to build an open aired mall like Kierland Commons is so Bed Bath and Beyond me. The signage is horrible. The curb appeal is non existent. But when we finally turned the corner and saw the big A, the sidewalk was bustling with guests and the inside was energetic, fun and most appealing. I had great service. Thank you Winston! The pretzel fondue was fabulous! The scallops with bacon and beans was okay. Not exactly executed as I would have liked. And the crab stuffed chicken was actually quite bland. But I washed it all down with a beautiful, buttery bottle of Carneros Chardonnay and all in all a good time was had. Arrogant? Perhaps. But certainly Insecure Butcher wouldn't work. So it's a winner so far to me and I will most definitely return.I'm teetering between 3 and 4 stars. In fact, I wish we were using Star Search scoring because I'd give 3 and 3 quarters stars. Really cool decor. Like a retro, train station kinda feel. There were these ginormous beehive lamp shade light fixtures that weren't cohesive and I wish they'd take them out because they were an eyesore as well. The restrooms were splendid, very clean, nice large stalls. Aside from the snooty hostesses, the service was splendid. My girlfriend and I came during restaurant week. It was packed when we arrived at 8:00 p.m. on a Tuesday night, I would recommend rezzies. For starters my friend had the soup and I had the cheese plate, both were delish. The cheese plate came with the cutest, tiny spoons and jars for jam and mustard... took everything I had to not put them in my purse. I can't remember what my main dish was called but it was two pieces of fried fish with a crab cake in the middle, topped with gravy and capers and a side of steamed spinach. It tasted like really good cafeteria food, nothing to write about here. For dessert I had the blueberry something or other. It tasted exactly like a pretzel torte I use to make in my early 20's, tasty but again, nothing to write home about. I will becoming back for sure. I know they're has to be more to that kitchen that what I was served, I just know it!Was at the Arrogant Butcher meeting up for happy hour with fellow Yelpers for the CMYE: Opening Night of Giselle and I have never been here before but had researched the reviews and knew right away I wanted to try the Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue, it seems Yelpers can't help by to Yelp about them, and let me tell you, OOOMMMGGG believe everything you read about them, they are soft yet firm bites (more like 2 or 3 bites) of balled up pretzel dough with the right amount of salt that gets to be dunked in this heavenly pot of provolone fondue, yes this is a perfect dish! Ok enough of them, everyone talks about them, now onto other things I tried.The artichoke hummus with olives & tomatoes and flatbread, yes that was good, was it memorable, no, it was ok.Also tried the chicken liver pate with pickled onions toast, my friend ordered these because she wanted to try it, I was game, my 1st bite was great, the red pickled onions and the pate mixed together was a perfect blend, but the 2nd bite, that's where it turned way too salty for me to enjoy. Now the local ricotta & roasted peppers toast was so delish! It was toasted perfectly, the ricotta & peppers with balsamic vinegar was omg cosmic, was very very sad when it had disappeared! Yep I think the next time I am their I am just getting the pretzel fondue & ricotta & roasted peppers toast haha oh and I heard The Fix is the drink to get!11/29/123.5 stars... First visit!Bookmarked this place months ago, and I finally had an excuse to make the trip from North Scottsdale... I'm taking Mom and aunt to see Cirque du Soleil's "Dralion" at the US Airways Center!  Thanks to friend and fellow yelper Dolores G.'s helpful info on where to park, I made the decision to choose Cityscape for both the chance to dine at The Arrogant Butcher and have my ticket validated AND take advantage of its proximity to the arena.  She wasn't kidding when she said that US Airways was across the street!  After waiting about 20 or so minutes for first availability, we were seated outside, and my views were of the four-way intersections, pedestrian traffic, and of the front of the arena, which were lovely given that most of my dining experiences have been in strip malls, Old Town Scottsdale, the Biltmore... suburbia.  I was able to sample a couple of reds before settling with a nice glass of Sebastiani cab from Sonoma.  While waiting for our table, we all decided we'd try the Artichoke hummus app http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=pMVWRf_4YH3y8gA7yX4NfQ#pMVWRf_4YH3y8gA7yX4NfQ, the Market salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=p8euqv1jrWI3dHs6F8Qw8Q#p8euqv1jrWI3dHs6F8Qw8Q, the Beef short rib stew http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=M50fqAft6N-pxOxsrjgaQA#M50fqAft6N-pxOxsrjgaQA, and the "Fish and Chips."  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=aaSSAu-_xck3KUofcyT-hA#aaSSAu-_xck3KUofcyT-hAWe all loved the artichoke hummus and pita bread app!  The bread was soft, yet had a nice chew, in spite of it not being warm and crispy.  The artichokes had great flavor, especially those that were touching the tomatoes.  We also adored the Market salad, which had so many textures to delight the mouth: mixed grains, chewy cranberries, sweet and crunchy gingersnaps, and creamy ricotta... Mmmm!  Loved the almost-nutty bite of the roasted butternut squash.  I plan to order this again on my next visit!  We also really liked the Beef short rib stew: I liked the smoky flavors of the beef and the green chile peppers, but my favorite were the beans!  Some were still chunky, while the others had tenderized down to almost like a dip you spread on crackers and crostini.  I didn't think the fried egg's presence made much of a difference...  I could take it, or leave it.  Since I couldn't sample the cornbread muffin (allergy), I had some of the fries from the fish entree with the stew, instead.  Mom and aunt enjoyed the crispy fish!  I really loved the batter, which was just the perfect amount to cover the fish and give it a very delightful crunch (and was the dish ever so pretty to look at!).  However, I found the pieces to be very salty, and I couldn't stand more than two or three bites of it.  I think my Mom would very much like to return, and so would I.  :)  I am going to try to make it here earlier for happy hour soon.  I really appreciate the location of Cityscape, its parking garage, and its easy access to many restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues!Arrogant Butcher continues to disappoint.  I came here on Friday to celebrate someone's birthday.  The pretzel/fondue appetizer was awesome, as always, but I'm beginning to suspect that it's the only good thing on the menu -- and really, that's not very impressive because how could they possibly mess up salted bread and melted cheese??We were headed to the art museum after dinner, so I decided to order an appetizer for my meal since I knew I couldn't finish a whole entree and I didn't want to lug leftovers around with me on the lightrail.  At first I ordered the steamed mussels, but sadly they were out of them for the night.  My second choice was the salmon rillette, which the menu described as "smoked salmon with crusty bread."  I was expecting a lox and french bread type of plate, but what came out was smoked salmon that had been mushed up into little chunks, soaked in some sort of liquid (tasted like vinegar maybe?), poured in a jar and topped with many capers.  I gave it a try and spread it on the bread, but after 2 bites I knew I did not like it.  it was mushy and sour and yecchh.I was waiting for the bartender (we sat at the bar) to come by and ask if we enjoyed our food so that I could exchange my salmon for a salad or something, but she never did.  she only came at the end of our meal and collected my plate (still FULL of food except for the 2 bites missing) and threw all the food in the trash.  you would think the plate full of uneaten food would've clued her in that I didn't enjoy my meal, but either she didn't notice or didn't care, but just brought out the check and gave it to us without comment.  I didn't want to be fussy, so we paid and left.My dining companion ordered the jambalaya for his meal and said it was really greasy.Arrogant Butcher, you make me angry that you charge so much money for bleh food.  I will not be convinced to come here again, no matter how good your pretzel/fondue is!After a "rigorous" evening of flow yoga at Lustre Bar upstairs, my friends and I were hungry and found ourselves at The Arrogant Butcher. I've always wanted to try this place and despite my friends wanting to get "salads" and the title of the restaurant didn't really yell salads, I made them come here and I was extremely glad I did!I learned several things that evening!1. Order the Candlestick Maker. (Well, if you're a bourbon fan like me!) It has Makers 46, lemon, Thatcher's Spiced Apple, honey and angostura2. Order the Old Fashioned. (They do it right here!)3. Share the Penn Cove Mussels with a friend -  Spicy Salumi, Charred Tomato,   Grilled Bread4. Enjoy the house soft pretzels with provolone fondue. - You may also want to share this one, but who knows, maybe you're extra hungry with those cocktails and want something to "absorb" the potency of those cocktails. We enjoyed ourselves so much here that we were there past when the kitchen closed. To my dismay, I didn't know that the kitchen closed at 9pm, and my husband, who was at home, wanted something to eat. When the waiter informed me the kitchen closed, I shamefully whined, "Wait! I was supposed to bring home something for my husband! You can't let me go home empty handed. He'd be so angry with me." The waiter then asked me if I knew what I wanted to order to go. I said, "The short rib stew!" He answered, "Well let me see what we can do.." He then proceeded to head to the kitchen. My anxiety reached all new heights as I awaited his response. It wasn't long before he returned and said, "We still have some stew, which means, yes, you can still get it to go!" I was so elated! I loudly exclaimed, "You and the kitchen just made my night!!!" I love how accommodating they were there! This is a great example of how great their service is!!5. So the whole point of this story above is... Spectacular food (at least the stuff I tried that night), stupendous service, and too cool to be kitsch décor yet almost farm like and trendy. I will always recommend and return to this place again, because I love them!Oh. They got me. They got me real good. Simply cannot wait to come back to The Arrogant Butcher.If I could write a short review it would say:+ Pristine Service+ Great Place to Hang Out+ Great Drinks+ Food hits the spot!Just go. Get your parking validated! Plan sufficient time!CUSTOMER SERVICEBuuuut I am a wordy nerd. And I have to give really give props to the customer service here. We showed up on a Thursday for lunch and had the fortune of sitting in Robert G's section. Showing an excitement level I don't think I've seen in a server *ever* he walked us through the delightfully robust menu. My taste buds salivated at the many options. Robert G. got more worked up as I ordered my porter beer. (They stock an excellent porter on draft! Deschutes Black Butte). When someone shows that much passion for their work it rubs off on everyone. OYSTERS | GET'EM!Based on Robert's elocution and delivery we, of course (!), had to sample some Boston oysters from Cape Cod. Oysters come with many accoutrement options beyond cocktail sauce and horseradish. We were sold on the jalapeño mignonette. It's this green, spicy heavenly goodness. The vinaigrette comes consists of cilantro, cucumber, shallot, jalapeño + red wine vinegar + v.oil.I'm sighing thinking back to how delightful an experience it was slurping my little raw guys down. I'm from the east coast. This Phoenix locale delivers raw oysters superbly. Had I not already placed a food order I could have contently eaten oysters the rest of the afternoon. (I'll come back and do just that.) GOOD STUFF.ENTREES | MM MMM!My friend and I ordered at the polar opposites of the palate menu. I went for something spicy (Jamalaya). She did something rather sweet (Pork Carnitas). Both were excellent. I'd enjoy either in a heart beat again. Warning: the portions are ginormous! When they say spicy, they mean spicy. The Jamalaya is just that! Generous servings of sausage, chicken and shrimp are provided. MISCThe bar is super! It's a central feature of the restaurant. Plenty of seats for everyone. Comfortable for anyone to dine solo. And (!) a number of televisions up high were showing work related content. (I imagine that changes depending on the hour.) I just really liked how unobtrusive they were.On our way out we noticed there were booths in the interior area of the restaurant. Something to consider checking out. The outdoor patio looks fab!Love, love, love!LOVE!We came here for happy hour and it did not disappoint they have a great happy hour and a large patio that's awesome for people watching. I got a specialty cocktail for $4 called the fix which was refreshing and delicious. Vodka with mint and berry puree. We ordered several plates of oysters, which adds up at $2.50 each. The mineit sauce came with the oysters was fantastic, but the oysters did have quite a few shells in them.  They need to be more consistent with the plating the first plate had yummy veggies on it second one didn't.The pretzel fondue was very good too. I can't wait to come back and try dinner soon.
Yoshi Bento=Looking for a decent Sushi spot and came across YB from Yelp. Good reviews and my family had a sushi craving. So here we are and I was pretty excited to try YB. Walked in and I was a little confused if this was fast food or a sit down place. Anyways, the owner greeted us and he he seated us. Very friendly owner. I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Bento which had a small salad, rice with a very generous portion of white meat chicken teriyaki and five pieces of tempura including shrimp tempura. Chicken was moist and tasty, loved the little cabbage salad and the tempura was ok. Very different tempura. The batter used reminded me of the batter that's used for fish and chips. The tempura was a little greasy but I enjoyed it. My wife ordered the chicken Yakisoba. It was pretty spicy and my wife usually doesn't like spicy but was able to eat most of it. I tried it and it was really good. Nice kick to it. Of course we had to try the sushi. So we had the caterpillar and rainbow. Very fresh and good. Only problem is that the sushi rolls weren't cut very good so it was crumbling while we were trying to eat it. Presentation was really good. Taste good. As long as it's good I don't mind it crumbling cause once it goes down the chute it's yum yum. Interesting that YB looks like a fast food but yet it's not. We ordered at the table and were served. The owner even served us our water even through its self-serve. Overall, the food was very fresh and prices reasonable. Enjoy and have fun.I've been here three times; yesterday with Mom.  She had a craving for sushi bento, so I thought she could try it here while I have some ramen.  I ended up ordering chicken udon, after having some wonderful udon at Waikiki's Marukame Ramen.  It cost almost twice here in Scottsdale, and it made me wish I was back in Hawaii having fresh hand-rolled udon there.  Yoshi's broth was tasty, with a good amount of chicken, both chunky and shredded, complete with sliced roasted chicken skin (not crispy).  I wished the skin had even a hint of crispiness.  There were tempura sprinkled on top, but even those were not crispy at all...  Marukame spoiled me, I think.  Yoshi also added an egg in the broth, so it looked like egg drop soup with chunks of chicken, sliced of chicken skin, zucchini, nori, onion, and green onion.  My main concern was that the udon had a slimy texture.  Not at all like the texture of the fresh hand-rolled udon noodles at Marukame.  This made me think that the noodles here at Yoshi were pre-packaged.  I would order the broth to be served with ramen in the future, if that option is available.  Be careful to allow the bowl to cool off for about ten minutes, or you're going to burn your tongue (and in my case, my eyelid, as the hot and slimy noodle whipped across my face as I tried to prevent the noodle from burning my lips- ouch!).  Mom was already eating, and I was hungry, so I couldn't wait.  Silly me- I ended up with a tender, burnt tongue, but thankfully my eye was only slightly puffy.Mom enjoyed her sushi bento, priced at $12 ($11.95 to be exact).  She missed the miso soup and salad that usually accompany bento boxes elsewhere.   $23 for lunch that should've included miso soup, a salad, and non-slimy udon... We'll try elsewhere next time.p.s.  The ramen here is just OK.  I enjoyed the spicy pork more than the tofu miso soup, although both tasted good.  The latter needed more pork in it, while I had issues with the miso.  I had ordered it without mushrooms (and was told that corn was not a standard ingredient in it), but allowed the carrots and whatever else it came with.  My order arrived with mushrooms, which I discovered after they floated to the top after having many spoonfuls of broth already, so I returned it and asked for a new one sans mushroom, but the second one arrived with corn in it!  The carrots were also omitted, even though I didn't ask for the omission-- I think due to the cook/owner spying the carrots I had fished out and left on the table next to the first bowl.  Needless to say, I was not happy with the second bowl, but after having some tofu and soup and then seeing the corn rise up from the bottom, I decided I'd had enough of soup for lunch.  I'll need to be more specific about the omissions and to inspect the bowl for ingredients before eating next time.
Dang Dee Thai Cuisine=First of all it's hard to walk into a Thai restaurant and only smell Subway bread baking. I've been here four times and it throws me off every time! Here's how I feel about Dang Dee.Prices- Cheap AND they offer lunch special on the weekends. Service- Really kind staff who always makes sure your glass is full. Beware- If you blow your nose because you are literally down one lung and should be in bed they will laugh at you and assume it was because the dish was too spicy for you, white girl. Hee hee, not funny. But, of course that didn't happen to me. Shhh.Food- If you remember anything at all about this review it should be to order the Green Curry Chicken. It's outstanding. Mad props to the chef for this dish.Eggrolls- Seems more like Lumpia to me in the shape of those party wieners wrapped in crescent rolls. Strange, meaty, but porkalicious good.Thai Iced Tea- I hadn't had one in a year. I'm not sure if I'm just super sensitive to sugar these days, but mine was entirely too sweet to drink. I dumped half a glass of water in it so I could get it down. That's what fat kids do instead of just not drinking it. You know it still tasted like shit with the water, but fatty "had to get it down". I'm sick, leave me alone. Tom Kha- I ordered it at the hottest spice level so there were pepper in my soup which I enjoyed. Other than the peppers I really did not care for this soup. Day 2 it didn't grow on me either. It was watery and the spices never really married the way they should. The quality of the chicken was nice, but the runny broth along with huge lemongrass rods and thick slices of ginger kind of killed it for me. Will I be back you ask? Absolutely. Dang Dee will stay in my rotation with the killer 5 Star Green Curry she's banging out. I do fear she's a one trick Thai pony. Ponies are still fun to play with and ride in circles every once in a while. Just don't step in their giant poop piles.
Iron Chef=Iron Chef is a Chinese and Japanese restaurant. Really. That doesn't make sense. Never heard of this combination. Ok so I was a little skeptical. Small little place. When we walked in I was looking for a hostess but to my surprise nothing. Someone just told us to take a seat. So we find our own table. Waitress is very good and tells us all the Chef's Special rolls are 50% off all the time. Very cool. We ordered the Dragon roll, Caterpillar roll, and Crunchy Shrimp roll. The rolls were really good. Very fresh. We really enjoyed them. Not bad for a Chinese/Japanese place. I also ordered the House Special Chow Mein which had a nice mix of veggies, BBQ portk, and shrimp. Noodles cooked very good. Overall, it tasted okay. Not great and also not the worst I had before so it was good. My wife ordered the Chicken Yaki Udon noodles. So I guess when you order one of their Japanese  dishes they give you a bowl of miso soup. Soup was really good. Have to say it was outstanding. My daughter and wife shared the udon noodles. They both loved it. The chicken was very moist and tender. My wife enjoyed he noodles said it was cooked right and wasn't overpowering. They gobbled it up. So I would have to say they enjoyed it. Service we really good. They had three waitresses running around helping out their tables. All were Asian women and were very helpful. Cup were filled in a timely manner and they were really kind and smiling. That's they type of service I'm looking for. Also, the food came out really quickly. They also have a nice little area outside that looked nice to sit at especially with this great weather right now. So we had a great time, good food, good sushi and good service. If you can handle a little self service to find your own table then this is the place for you. Choice of Japanese or Chinese food. Really. Iron Chef somehow makes this works. I'm not complaining and I'll be back. Enjoy.Iron Chef serves great sushi and cooked Japanese and Chinese dishes, the ambiance is pleasant, and the servers are extremely efficient and professional.I love the Golden Dragon Roll, which I get almost every time.  I also like the chicken yaki udon, and my boyfriend likes the kung pao chicken.YUMMY!
Cycle=An interesting concept that didn't end up being what I hoped for.  I was pretty excited to try the Posh Noodles & Noshes Japanese street food as prepared by Josh Hebert.  I love Japanese food and was looking forward to the dishes that are not readily available in Phoenix.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food.The location inside the Lexington Hotel has definitely seen better days.  An attempt has been made to create a temporary generic space with chalkboard walls and butcher paper topped tables.  However, it came across as worn and dingy.Our waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offerings ('I didn't work here last night') but was friendly and did find out answers from other staff.  Foolishly thinking that we would love each and every dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day, we tried a large assortment.  An expensive mistake.Duck Gyoza w/ Ponzu - I prefer steamed gyoza over the fried presentation here.  Also, these had the tiniest, greasy portion of filling I have ever seen.Homemade Tofu w/ Ginger, Scallion, Cherry Blossom - this was good, with a sweet, dessert-like flavor but a somewhat runny texture.Okonomiyaki - this 'Japanese pizza' was among the better items.  However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eatTako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by 'breading' that fell apart easilyThe ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.   We left most of them behind, deciding not to take anything with us.The dessert, Green Tea Pot de Crème was a nice finish but did not make me feel better overall about the $100+ meal.
Eddie V's Prime Seafood and Steak=The new 8,800-square-foot Eddie V's at Scottsdale Quarter includes three separate private dining rooms, in addition to the main dining areas, each with its own unique personality.  One room is dramatically situated in a round rotunda, where my partner and I had a wonderfully romantic dinner. Soft live jazz music played softly in the background while we enjoyed a cross section of delightful menu items.Dinner was truly memorable with a starter of Tuna Tartare. Beautiful sashimi quality tuna was set an top of diced mango then topped with just the slightest amount of sliced chile. The heat was mild and only helped to accentuate the sweetness of the fish and mango. This was followed up by a gorgeous long plate filled with a mix of lightly dusted flash fried calamari, julienne carrots and daikon drizzled with a sweet soy glaze. My entree was on the lighter side but was heavy on flavor. Crab Stuffed Shrimp were excellent; extra large shrimp were grilled then topped with sweet crab meat, panko bread crumbs and a lime finish. I couldn't stop eating there plump crustaceans. I did however stop long enough to try my partners perfectly tender Steak au Poivre.Dessert was a new take on an old classic, Bananas Foster Cake. As our waiter dumped brandy on top of the cake and set it on fire, even head in the dining room was on us, was quite a sight. The cake was the best finish to a extraordinary evening of food and romance.This place is a bit stuffy. It's nice and all, but let me put it this way- this place is very age specific (like most of Scottsdale I suppose). You will have a lot of people in their late forties and up here- not that there's anything wrong with that.I like some of the food,especially the tuna tartare, but they do some sort of sushi-American fusion roll that really sucks. I complain because it is one of the most expensive small plates on the menu and the number one thing the bartenders recommend (more on the bartenders... ahem...  'recommendations' later). So this roll consists mainly of lobster and high quality beef but then they go and ruin it by smothering the 2 indulgent ingredients in a sauce that overwhelms the entire plate, and the sushi rice is gross and kind of mealy. That roll pisses me off. It needs editing, but I guess it reminds me of some of the unedited clientele I see at Eddie V's as well- like the bleached platinum blond girl with a hair piece, fake eyelashes, dark navy eye shadow, oompa loompa tan, injected lips, caked on makeup, fake boobs, fake claws, wearing a skin tight designer t-shirt along with a thousand dollar handbag and $400  jeans to coordinate with her stripper shoes and abundantly accessorized sterling silver Tiffany's jewelry that sat by me last visit. I mean each element of her style probably works on its own, but all together it looks like a Vogue magazine threw up on her. That's sort of what the roll was for me. (BTW, she ordered the same thing- the roll- and liked it, so what's that tell you?)Now, for my big gripe. I can describe the type of wine I like quite well. I will ask for something that tastes a certain way and immediately every bartender- no matter what description I give- will direct me to the 2 most expensive wines by the glass (around $25 a glass) on the menu. Price does not equal quality and I find it offensive when I taste the $25 glass of  wine and it in no way mirrors what I was asking for. I feel like they are just trying to up-sell me without considering my taste. I get it. I work in sales too, but I think it's more important to give the customer what they want rather than try to push them into spending more money. Also, if I don't choose the most expensive wines, they kind of shrug their shoulders as if implying that all the other wines on the menu suck. I'm of the thinking that nothing on the menu should suck or not be worth suggesting in one way or another, so for that they get 2 stars. I have a feeling it's the staff more than the menu that is the problem.Met some colleagues here for dinner one evening.  Located in the Scottsdale Quarter, this high end restaurant is a great place for dinner.  If you're price sensitive, this is not the place for you....don't even bother.  Our reservation was for 6:45 pm and it was jam packed, good thing we called ahead.  We were promptly seated in the main dining room.After browsing the extensive menu, I decided to order:Baby Iceberg BLT Wedge - (Bacon, Maytag Blue Cheese, Buttermilk-Chive Dressing), $9Twin Lobster Tails - Broiled, MKT PriceTruffle Mac 'n Cheese, $6 (for small portion)Godiva Chocolate w/Vanilla Ice CreamAll of the food was excellent.  The Twin Lobster Tails were perfect and came with Butter to dip them in.  They were so good, I used very little Butter.  I enjoyed the broiled flavor on it's own.  The Truffle Mac 'n Cheese was very rich & creamy, amazing.The BLT Wedge was very good too, but the portion was too large and I had to leave 1/2 of it because I didn't want to be full when my entree came out.At the urging of my colleagues, I ordered the Godiva Chocolate w/Vanilla Ice Cream.  It was awesome, but very rich.  I had to split it with everyone because there was no way I could finish it after the big meal.  The hot Godiva Chocolate oozed out of the center of the Cake....and the Vanilla Ice Cream complimented it perfectly.The service here was impeccable.  They have a great staff.  Can't wait for my next visit.Return Factor - 100%I've eaten at Eddie V's many times over the years and its always been good.  I organized my company holiday dinner at the Scottsdale Quarter location for last Friday night and I can honestly say it was one of the worst experiences at a high end Steak/Seafood restaurant I've ever had.  In this case, the reason for the poor experience falls on the service.  We had a party of 9 which we had a reservation for.  Of the many issues that went wrong a few really stand out.  First of all we only had one server who also seemed to have a number of other tables which was not enough.  The first issue came when I ordered a bottle of Bella Glos pino (a great wine if anyone is interested).  The wine comes with wax covering the cork and the server couldn't remove the wax.  When I joked if she needed help, she actually handed me the bottle and bottle opener.  Note to all servers...on an expensive bottle of wine, if there is ever an issue please take the bottle back and bring me another.  Having me help you open it is simply unacceptable.  The next issue came when our meal was served.  We ordered enough sides that they suggested we keep them on a side table and they serve us since there wasn't enough room on our table.  Not a bad idea, except that our one server individually served sides for all nine of us.  As the last one to get served my sides, I was almost done with my steak by the time she got to me.  If you're going to help us by serving the sides, get additional help so everyone is served at the same time.  The next issue came at dessert.  Only two of us were given dessert menus, me being one of them.  When the server came back to take our order I asked if everyone had menus (I knew they didn't) and her response was for me to pass my menu down to others at my table.  really?The final, final straw came when we were all finally ready to leave and we couldn't get our server to the table because she was chit-chatting with her other tables.  It literally took us 30 minutes to get our bill paid.  For the record we did alert the manager who I think was new.  She took my email as well as the CEO of my company, though we've yet to hear a peep from them.  You'd think that if she went through the effort to take down our information we'd at least get an email or call.   The group I was with eat at these types of places all the time (Oceans Club, Mastros, Capital Grille, etc) and this was by far the worst service I've ever had in this type of establishment.  All the others at our table agreed.  I sincerely hope this was just a one time issue and it doesn't happen to anyone else.Come here (any night of the week) if you're looking for live music and prefer a cool jazz tune.After a rained out evening outdoor concert, a few of us decided we weren't ready to give up on an hearing some live music. We popped into a place around the corner hoping to find some live Jazz, and disappointed with who was playing that evening, we asked the bartender if there was somewhere else they would suggest for Jazz on a Sunday evening.I'm glad we decided to take his advice on Eddie V's, cause I had one of the best evenings of great live Jazz in the Phoenix area sitting right at the bar. After some encouragement by our group, the musicians decided to really lay into it with their music and turn it up from the typical elevator music to something you could really dance along to. The bartender poured some excellent tasting drinks, the band ended up chatting with us for a couple minutes post set and it turned out to be a fabulous way to spend four hours with your gal.Happy Yelping Phoenix! :-)
Spinato's Pizzeria=Spinato's just opened in Ahwatukee and you would think it was the first and only restaurant this side of South Mountain from all of the people there.  The place was packed!  However, it was our lucky day when our friends got there just in time to get us a prime spot at a bar table!There were servers and staff everywhere, so even though the confusion of opening night was obvious, everyone was having a great time and there were plenty of people helping out so it didn't really matter.  We ordered a few appetizers and four personal (7") pizzas.  The Trio of Meatballs appetizer was awesome!  Huge meatballs in a delicious vodka sauce (that is fantastic as a dipping sauce for any type of bread or pizza crust, so ask for a side) for only $3.99!The BF had the "Here's the Beef" pizza which looked meaty and delicious.  I probably would have had a bite, but my Da Greek pizza was overflowing with fantastic toppings (feta, kalamata olives, pepperoncini, spinach, and tomatoes) that I didn't want anything to mess with the flavors.Every day is a different daily drink special and $2 PBR all day, every day.I would say that I can't wait for the place to calm down so I can go back, but to be honest, I don't really care.  I'll go back even if it is just as busy as opening night.  The food was wonderful, the service was great, and the atmosphere is something I wanted to be part of.  The only bad part about Spinato's opening in the Tuke is going to be deciding which of my favorite pizza joints I'm going to pick on any given night!Super addition to the Ahwatukee scene!I've been here a few times now, and every dish I've tried has been very good. I've tried their sandwiches, their pizza, and their pasta dishes. Oh, and the spinach and artichoke dip is divine--you must try it. They have good drink specials and all kinds of stuff going on every day of the week.The service is very friendly--every server I've had has been great. One of the times they had a new person running food to the tables. After he was at our table, the manager came by literally 30 seconds later to ensure that he was polite and mentioned the things they wanted him to mention. I was floored.This place can get quite loud at times over the weekend, especially if you are seated in the side of the restaurant where the bar is. It might have just been the night I was there, as there were three different donkey beasts braying 100 decibel laughter at regular intervals one Sunday I was there. If you are looking for a quieter dinner, ask to be seated on the other side.I feel a bit bad for Bell'Italia across the road... they've already cut their hours, and I don't think Spinato's is going to make it any easier for the other Italian places in Ahwatukee...I had a great experience here. For starters, they have some good drink specials each night. On Tuesday, they have $5 glasses of wine and $3 beers. We ordered a pizza and it was really good. Lots of toppings and cheese and sauce and cooked to perfection! For dessert we shared a canollo (yes the Italian in me wants to use the proper term! lol. One conollo, two canolli!) Ok, I digress! The server found out it was a birthday and wrote on the plate in chocolate Happy Birthday and took the dessert off the bill. Very nice. She checked on us several times and kept our drinks full. The owner or maybe manager came over and he was very nice. Very genuine and you could tell that he really cared about what people thought and wanted everyone to have a great experience. Where I would have probably given this place 4 stars, his presence and personality easily put it at 5 stars. Service was impecable. Pizza and dessert was really good, and they made a new customer out of me!
Szmidt's Old World Deli=I've noticed this place while driving to the South Side via Greenfield Ave. One evening the boyfriend and I were looking for a bite to eat but neither of could decide where to go. On a whim, I pulled up to Szmidt's and man, I'm glad I did! The aroma of all the spices and fresh bread when you walk in the door is intensely pleasing. The deli case is filled with various fresh pasta salads and sides that include grape leaves, pickled cucumber slices, mac 'n cheese with jalapeno, apricot glazed meatloaf, potato salad, tuna salad, haluski (looked amazing, I will definitely be back to try it), and various other items that evade my memory at the moment. Have I mentioned that everything is made in-house? Breads, salads, sides, and pierogies - ALL home made! Speaking of pierogies...all your classics are here - Potato & cheddar, potato & kraut, potato & jalapeno, sausage, and plain kraut ($4.95/6 $8.95/12). In addition to these are "New World Pierogies" ($5.45/6 $9.95/12) - Reuben, thanksgiving with turkey gravy, southwest chicken with cilantro lime sour cream, buffalo chicken with bleu cheese, cheese steak with horseradish sour cream, and bacon cheeseburger with rage sauce. They also offer sweet pierogies like apple mango, granny smith apple pie, and a seasonal special. So much deliciousness in one place, we didn't know where to begin. After thinking long and hard, I finally decided on a spinach & feta doughbie (think stromboli) and Justin opted for the Frankie (sliced turkey breast, ginger mustard glazed ham, maplewood bacon, american cheese, mayo, lettuce, and tomato all on a toasted homemade bun. While our food was being prepared, we chatted with the owner. I told him we've been living here for a year now and can't believe we never heard of his place then he informed us that they just opened up a month ago and offered us some samples from the deli case. We had a little scoop of potato salad (better than my mom's - sorry ma), 4 grape leaves (the best I've had and I do love me some dolmas), sweet cucumber slices (JB was a huge fan and now wants me to try my hand at recreating them at home so he can have them all the time) and ziti pasta salad (which is great WITH the cuke slices)!! Everything we had was exquisite!! The entire experience was pleasurable - The shop owner was personable and inviting, the shop is darling and homey with pictures of the family hung on the walls and the food is delectable and very affordable. Sorry for such a lengthy review but I just can't say enough good things about Szmidt's. If you happen to find yourself in the Greenfield/Squirrel Hill area do yourself a favor and give this place a chance!!!Pittsburgh is rife with pierogies.  If you walk outside for any reasonable length of time, somebody will throw a pierogie right in your mouth, and charge you a quarter.  That's just part of living here.We had family in from out of town, and they had never had pierogies, so I did the laziest internet search in the world, and found that Szmidt's not only had pierogies, but was the closest location on google maps!  Much like the other places along Greenfield Ave, I've been driving past Szmidt's for at least two years, never even considering whether it was a place I would ever be inside.  But fortune conspired, and I found myself there on this glorious day.It's a tiny place with very little seating, but once I smelled whatever delicious mystery meat they were cooking, I lost all sense of space and time.  We ordered some sandwiches, and some old world pierogies, but...what's that other stuff?  New world pierogies?  Are you mad?  Who would ever want one of those...I'll take 6.  You will probably have a similar thought process.The sandwiches are huge, and messy, and quite possibly the best I've ever had in the city.  Each sandwich is special, because the final step in its creation is that a unicorn with a sparkling tail gives each sandwich a gentle kiss as it leaves the kitchen, thereby rendering said sandwich magical.Or at least that's what I imagined as I ate my sandwich so hard that I only paused to gasp for air.Oh, right, and we got pierogies.  Some traditional potato and cheese, and some buffalo chicken ones as well.  If anybody wants to challenge me to a pierogie eating contest, let's do it here, because Unicorn Kissed Pierogies (tm) are amazing.So everybody who loves sandwiches, pierogies and magic should come to this place and just go to town.  I honestly don't even know if this place is real, so I didn't check the hours.
Crêpe Expectations=I am so giddy because I luv crepes!I found out about the opening in the zip code magazine I get in the mail, and bookmarked it forthwith.  I knew that this creperie served crepes on a plate, not hand-held style, but so what?  They serve up YUM!Even though it was a late lunch for me, I opted for a sweet crepe.  I will definitely need to get back here to try savory and breakfast crepes, but The Avalon called out to me: buttered pears, goat cheese, candied walnuts....it was amazing!  So was the service.  I was the only one inside (a few brave souls were eating outside) and I had a nice chat with the two ladies working.  I am intrigued by the flavored mimosas and will come back for those (they have a 3 mimosa sampler for $10 or one for $6) - white peach, passion fruit, lychee, traditional, pomegranate. This would be a really fun place for me to get the yelpettes of Vegas for a crepe and mimosa brunch before my wedding (so keep your eyes open for that, belles!)Yes, I will be back...they have guacamole for savory crepes and lemon curd for sweet ones so I have to come back for those options!The interior is swanky, purple hues, fun art and mirrors on the walls, nice tables (I sat at the one by the crepe-making station), flat screen TVs, and even really nice flatware!Crepely speaking, you cannot go wrong here.Absolutely phenomenal. It has been a bit since I have been willing to give an establishment 5 stars after only one experience, but my initial visit to Crêpe Expectations was simply all around perfection. I met a friend for brunch on a Sunday at 11 am. The place was packed, with a line of people waiting to order and be seated. For a minute I contemplated leaving and finding a less busy place to eat, but we had been talking about trying the crepes (and mimosas!!) here for too long to do that... Besides, that may people willing to wait was almost sure to be a indicator that good things were to come to us if we exercised a little patience. The line moved surprisingly quick, we were seated at the 'bar' in front of the crepe making stations about 20 minutes after arrival. The bar is a prime spot to sit.. You get to watch every crepe get made. Based on what we saw, I already know what I will be ordering the next 2-3 times I go in. We started out our meal with some of the self-serve cucumber water (love that there is an option other then lemon!) and a mimosa trio. We tried the raspberry (ok), the blood orange (delicious) and my favorite, the nectar of the gods, aka the white peach. I have no idea what kind of bubbly is used at Crêpe Expectations, and I do not claim to be an expert on champagne either...  but these mimosas were some of the tastiest I have ever had. On to the grub!! I had the Sunday Morning with bacon added. This crepe slaughters every breakfast burrito I have ever had with regard to taste. It was amazing, the only thing it was lacking was a little salsa, but it was still excellent without it. Since we were debating between sweet and not sweet crepes, my friend and I also split the Berry Delight. Strawberries, blueberries and blackberries, all super juicy and fresh... with just the right amount of whipped cream. Honestly the ONLY thing I can say about Crêpe Expectations that isn't positive is that it's on the small side. With food and service this good, I think they could easily fill an area double, maybe even triple the current size. Regardless, even knowing there may be a wait, I'll be back. And for the days I can't wait, there is always the option of takeout! I look forward to warmer weather, as the outdoor seating looks right up my alley (and they are dog friendly at Crêpe Expectations!!) 5 star, all around amazing place.I have to say I was impressed. I'm not a big crepe or pancake person but this place was nice. We shared the monkey, our company got the berry delight and a breakfast yum (can't remember which). They all were huge! Can't imagine finishing one by myself let alone the little one and I shared and we couldn't finish The strawberries, banana and Nutella was really a good combo without being overly sweet. We didn't want whip cream and the guy who took our order recommended adding strawberries to the monkey which was awesome.The service was excellent, there was a mess made and the guys were helpful and quick to respond. You go up and place your order and get your drinks but they are quite helpful and attentive stillThe only reason a star is missing as not enough seating during crowded times, we got the last table.One time I got drunk at a wedding and had a crêpe. It was good and only filled with a mild amount of shame. From then on, I've been on the hunt for crepes. Luckily, located in what's quickly becoming my favorite shopping center, Crepe Expectations specializes in the craft. While the place is small (maybe 8 tables?), their menu boasts 23 ways you can eat this thinny pancake. I scooped up The Sunday Morning (scrambled eggs, seasoned potatoes, jack cheese and bacon added) and it was way better than expected. These things are large and the perfect size for lunch. With flavored waters and a side salad included, this is solid deal for under $8. Def worth a try for a croob (crêpe noob) or crêxpert (you get it).Items Selected:The Elvis - Caramel, Banana, Peanut Butter, BaconThe Avalon - Buttered Pears, Goat Cheese, Candied Walnuts, HoneyThe Greek - Grilled Chicken, Spinach, Feta, Tzatziki Yogurt, Red Onion, TomatoAlready planning to be in the area early Saturday morning, finding a breakfast buddy would prove an easy task and trusting the Henderson local despite the truly lame "Yum" menu and "Have a crepe day" voicemail I walked into Crepe Expectations with an open mind; the result an hour of gregarious service, great conversation, and some truly Parisian quality crepes.  A bit of an odd space, dim lighting and dark wood beneath big screen televisions orders are placed at the counter and arriving just as the restaurant opened our order of three thin pancakes was expedited on the open kitchen's three stones with each arriving soft on the interior with the slightest browning adding textbook chew enveloping bold, balanced ingredients.  With prices a bit higher than the majority of creperies Stateside or abroad but service and ingredient quality equally elevated it was with a sweet, a savory, and a special that our morning passed and although my tastes veered toward the complexity of the Avalon it would be hard to argue against the Elvis or the Greek, the former pure decadence with added whipped cream and the later finding balance for the slightly oversalted chicken in the punchy yogurt.
BLD=7/6/11Arrived early for the OYE party at bld, so I decided to check out their happy hour.  It's a good thing I did, too, bec. the margarita I had here (priced $3 on the menu card, but I was charged $3.50) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bld-chandler?select=-iHx38oezn6KQER2Aw8ytQ#-iHx38oezn6KQER2Aw8ytQ was one of the beverage highlights of the evening!  The meatball mac 'n cheese, however, needs a tweak-- while I enjoyed the mac 'n cheese portion of the dish, I found the meatballs and sauce to be too acidic. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bld-chandler?select=UFsIK9G_6MZxb-GvezRedA#UFsIK9G_6MZxb-GvezRedA  If I wasn't trying to slow down my body's absorption of alcohol (I'd just gotten a massage before, too, so circulation was revved up!), I wouldn't have eaten as much as did, and I left more than half in the bowl.Still, what I had tried was enough to keep my mind open for more happy hour adventures here.  Take a look at the interesting HH food menu!I cannot believe I have forgotten to review BLD!I am definitely a regular here. I'll start with Breakfast...My boyfriend and I eat here at least once a week for breakfast. He always orders the Green Chili Tostada and the few bites I've had were delicious!! I have ordered many things...the open faced sandwich is delightful, the waffle has bacon in the middle, the short rib eggs bene and the breakfast burrito. I normally go back to the waffle because it is so good! I don't normally eats sweets but the bacon with syrup is prefect and for $5 (if you order the waffle as a side) is a great deal!Lunch is another time of day you can find me at BLD. I love taking clients there and the food is always spot on. You must get the Prosciutto & Fried Goat Cheese salad. SOOOO GOOD! I can't really order anything else...Happy Hour is one of the best around. Great prices with unique food options (no chicken wings and potato skins here). Get the Ahi (See pic). Trust me!Had dinner here the other night and our server suggested the Braised Short Rib Pasta. It was unbelievable in a prefect Pesto sauce (see pic).The patio is beautiful and allows dogs. They actually have a dog dinner availble for your pooch.GO HERE ANYTIME. You won't regret it and say "hi", I'll probably be there.Here's the thing.  We're pretty big fans of Cork, so when we learned about BLD we were super excited to go.  Sadly, our first experience was really bad.  Because we loved Cork so much we decided not to write a review until we had gone a 2nd time.  Could be a fluke, right?  Wrong.  Here's the breakdown.Visit 1:1. We received chicken that was still releasing pink (not clear) liquids.  When we asked them to give us new chicken the server literally asked "oh, you want that more well done?" as if there is another way to serve chicken.2. After getting the chicken back we found that they didn't actually replate the dish, they just put new chicken on it.  So if the pink liquid did contain any bacteria it was definitely still there.3. Both my husband and I had some pretty terrible "digestion issues" that I wont go into detail on.4. The servers seemed genetically engineered to avoid their tables.  In the 2 hours we were there I'd say we saw our server three times.Visit 2:1. The service was a bit better today but...2. Both my husband, myself, and a 3rd guest had "Bridesmaids" style reactions to the food within a few hours of our visit.  I'm talking total upper and/or lower GI evacuation. Both visits I'd say cost roughly $30 per person and we ended up sick and annoyed.I will never return.BLD is the one place in Chandler that I really want to like, but after three visits, I just give up. They have a great-looking menu, a hip-kinda vibe, and all the promise in the world. And that's where it ends.A disinterested hostess will invariably seat you in the one table you'd least prefer. Near the kitchen entrance. Near an angry baby. Whatever.Next, one of several equally disinterested servers will arrive to take your drink order and by the time you've worked up a good thirst, drinks will arrive. If you're lucky, it'll be the drinks you actually ordered. If you're really lucky, they'll be good.The one saving grace on the breakfast menu is the Monte Cristo. A+, seriously. Everything else is average, despite how it reads on the overpromising menu. And don't worry about the prices: just pretend you're in Scottsdale or, say, Midtown Manhattan, for the entire meal. If you remember you're in Chandler, you'll just get angry.Like the breakfast menu, the lunch menu equally overpromises, but that's okay, because you'll wait just as long to receive your food. If it's not over or undercooked, you might as well just dig in and not think about how much you overpaid for a sub-par meal.BLD looks and act like they want to be a BFD (big friggin' deal) but they need to start caring about both their customers and their food first. A good menu doesn't make a good restaurant if you don't deliver the goods.Brunch: Making morning binge drinking seem classy since forever.I woke up this morning, checked my texts, and suddenly I'm at brunch with the guys and a boy [the cutest 4-month old baby boy at that!].  Everybody ordered their food, some bussers knocked over a huge trashcan, and suddenly champagne bottles were rolling across the floor.  Surprisingly, the baby doesn't cry.  Phew.  Our hostess was pretty unfriendly but the waitress was a peach!I had ordered The Cali Eggs Benedict [bacon, grilled tomato, avocado, topped with hollandaise, and includes breakfast potatoes.  $12.25] and it was alright.  The hollandaise was creamy and smooth but lacking that lemon juice tangy tartness.  Still though, those eggs were poached beautifully.  The bacon was also pretty fantabulous and cooked perfectly.  As for a random wedge of avocado on the side, it kind of felt like they forgot to put the avocados on top and just stuck it there.  Oh well.  The bites I had of the House Made Biscuits and Sausage Gravy [two eggs, apple wood smoked bacon with breakfast potatoes.  $12.75] were super flavorful.  You can tastes the fat in that sausage gravy.  I can see myself gaining 5lbs just eating that.  Oh man.  As for breakfast potatoes, there's not much you can say about them.  They're crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and needed some ketchup love.Overall, I had a decent brunch with great company.  Perhaps with all my attention on making faces at the baby, my meal wasn't too note-worthy.  I wouldn't mind coming back for brunch though!
Tacos El Gordo=Alright! Everyone is a winner when Tacos El Gordo opens up a new location on the strip. Whether you're a tourist, drunk late at night, a poor college student, or just simply looking for a quick and affordable meal. Actually if you're staying at a casino on Tropicana and walking is your means of transportation then.. sorry, sucks to be you, but at least you have Earl of Sandwich at the Planet Hollywood. HOWEVERRR if you're a beast and can walk 4 blocks or so in triple digit heat then you indulge yourself by all means.Why I love Tacos El Gordo:1. Corn tortillas that are slightly fried before you get them2. The asada is cooked when you order it (or at least in my experiences). That deserves a high five.3. ALL-YOU-CAN-DRINK HORCHATA for $1.40? Don't mind if I do.4. The spicy pork shawarma (adobada) looking thing, most definitely the star of the establishment. There is a slice of pineapple sitting on top of it, leaking all of its delicious juices into the delicious spicy pork. Plus you get a slice on pineapple added to the taco. 5. Plenty of meat is given, along with the onions, peppers, and green sauce (I'm not sure if its guacamole or not). 6. The bathroom is CLEAN! Be honest, you know how most cheap eats don't have the cleanest bathroom.They also have beef head (Cabeza), beef tongue (lengua), and tripe I believe. No chicken just in case you're wondering. Lastly aside from the tacos they have asada or adobada fries ($10), tortas ($4), and quesadillas ($4). All the essentials to a drunk meal.Random note: 3 tacos @ $2.00 each plus one drink comes out to be $7.99 after taxI've been searching for a new "go-to" taco place since Los Parados on W. Sahara closed a while back.  Their al pastor was one of the best things I've had in LV and seeing the Yelp pics of Tacos El Gordo's adobada on the spit posted had me salivating in front of my laptop.  Must. Go. ASAP!We ordered 4 adobada, 1 carne asada and 1 beef tongue.  We really liked everything except the tongue.  Maybe it was just our mood that day?  I was freaking starving so I was ready for more.  As soon as I'm about to speak to the guy manning the adobada, he grins and asks "How many more do you want?".  I'm sure this happens every 10 minutes there.I got 2 more adobada along with a brain taco.  The guy automatically perked up when I ordered brain.  The person in charge of the internal organ taco dept went to work digging out some to chop up and put in a corn tortilla.  They also assumed it was my first time trying it.  They assumed right!It wasn't bad although I didn't love it either.  It was like a beef pate with a lobstery taste to it.  Not ready to order another the next day but we're glad we tried one.     I might be in the minority of reviewers eating here while sober.  I definitely see how this place would be even better when you're loaded like a freight train at 5am.  Certainly look forward to when I am here in that condition.Sorry to all of the people who rave about this place, but it's exceedingly overhyped. I was actually really looking forward to this place and had high expectation for what was popular which was the adobada and carne asada. Since there was 2 lines to order, I told porky to wait in the asada line while I wait in the adobada line. I made the big mistake of trying to make an order to a wab without porky there. I asked for a big adobada fries without cilantro and he replied OK. I waited there for about 10 mins....My bf already got his order and finally, he asked the wab where my order was in spanish and he replied that I never made an order with him, putting the blame on me, and trying to make me look stupid.. gtfo -_- I finally got my fries and I went up to the cashier. Without realizing it, the cashier girl gave me an attitude and my bf had to defend me telling them that I'm paying for the fries and he's paying for the tacos since I don't know spanish and I didn't understand the situation. how RUDE! I do not appreciate the fact that I was being put down for not understanding any spanish when we are in a country that English is the primary language, especially from people who sound like they don't even have their citizenships!! *slam fists*In any case, on to the food. I looked at my food and I specifically asked for no cilantro, and of course they would fuck it up by leaving little pieces of it all over our food. I don't mind the cilantro but porky hates it. -1 point there for making me put the effort of playing hide and seek with the cilantros. The carne asada was ok. The meat was tender and juicy but bland. The only thing you could really taste in it was the guacamole since they slapped on a handful of it on the taco. The adobada tacos had no flavor whatsoever. I read that there was some pineapples sliced in it, the sauce was amazing but I did not taste anything on that taco. The best ones I have had was the stomach and the shoulder. I should have fought porky more for the brain, tongue, and head tacos since they were all cooked in the same way as the shoulder and stomach, but I gave in since porky was so adamant about not trying anything else. Never again will I let his closed mind affect my choices in food! Anyways, the fries were awesome! I love the sauce in it and the fries were the thin and crispy ones, not those disgusting steak fries. I just wish I got the carne asada instead because the adobada was flavorless and dry.Anyways, I really want to like this place because I want to come back and try the other tacos, quesadilla, and tostada but I wouldn't want to come back here by choice because of the rude workers and there's nothing really special about their popular stuff. 2 stars for their stomach and shoulder tacos and fries!One of THE BEST carne asada tacos I have ever had, hands down.  The juices and everything about this taco is worth every penny.  I usually get mines with no avocado, since most of the time they usually put a spoonful of avocado & i really dont need to taste that much avocado in one sitting.Not only do i order the carne asada tacos, but also the carne asada fries. The carne asada fries can either come in half ($5) or a large order ($10). I ordered the half ordered and OHHH GEEZ it was pretty BIG! I couldnt even finish it, it was good but not THAT good. Needless to say, I could always come back to this taco eatery. Yumm yummI finally made it to Tacos El Gordo after hearing rave reviews about it for ages. The place was pretty empty, but service was fast and efficient. I ordered one adobada taco and one carne asada taco to go. They were pretty small and they packaged them on tiny paper plates and wrapped them in foil. Not the best form of packaging I've ever seen and definitely not cost efficient for them, but I assume most people eat them there.Everyone always raves about how cheap this place is, and it is for the most part, but for the price I felt they skimped a bit on the meat and filling. They were definitely tasty and I really enjoyed the flavor of the adobada. Nicely balanced heat and sweetness. The carne asada was good too, albeit a little on the dry side. The condiments definitely enhanced the flavor of these for me. I'm a big fan of the adobado and I'll definitely be back again to pick these babies up next time.This place is the real deal y'all.  If you're like me and want a couple of tacos or maybe even a burrito to end your night then there is no better place in Vegas than El Gordo.  My mouth is literally watering as I type...I have seen this place popping up on yelp and decided to look through the reviews and pictures. I was happy to learn about the 2 separate lines since I would be wanting both asada and adobada and thanks to Nelson Q's picture that I can add pineapple to my taco.The seating inside this location is limited. They have 2 tent type things outside were you can eat. If my memory isn't too foggy this location used to be a taco bell when I was a teenager. The car clubs would hang out in this parking lot and drink etc. Well, the parking lot being ghetto fabulous hasn't changed a bit. Maybe more ghetto then anything. The inside was kinda chaotic. I know it is on the strip so a lot of tourists especially drunk ones are going to want some of these $2.00 crack tacos. They are addicting and delicious! I like that I can get adobada tacos on either side. They have more then one line for the same thing since they get so busy at times.There is a parking lot so if you can find a spot then you can just go back and eat in your car if you can't find a spot at the tables.THIS IS A GEM OF A FIND ON THE STRIP!Once you are all buffet'd out and are looking to save money without sacrificing quality, then this is your spot! It's perfect walking distance from the Riviera and the Wynn. These guys are open late into the early hours especially on fridays and saturdays. They have some booths inside but most of the seating is located outside in two decent sized tents which you cant miss if you're driving by on the street. On cold nights they have those gas powered heating elements for those of you that think Vegas doesnt get that cold.The parking is decent and on some nights you have street racers meeting up here just to hang out. Im suprised this location doesnt have an armed security guard like the Charleston location.As for the food, the three most popular items that I usually get here are the El Pastor tacos, Carne Asada tacos, and the Adobado Fries. The tacos are 2 bucks a pop and the Adobado Fries are 5 bucks for the half order and 10 bucks for a large order (the half order is virtually a meal in itself!). You have the option of having everything on your tacos and fries at no extra charge. These are the guacomole sauce, onions, and cilantro for your tacos. For the fries you can get sour cream, guacomole, and extra cheese. You can even ask for grilled green onions and jalapenos on the side. Also you can have them put grilled pineapple bits as well, BUT YOU HAVE TO SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR THESE so if you dont than they will not give it to you. That's why I love these guys, no extra charge for all those mentioned above.I also like this place better simply because of the fact that they have TWO service stations meaning they have twice the amount of food servers and cashiers (yes they take cards and there is no minimum) which equals faster service although on really busy nights you cant tell. Plus, it seems that they speak better english here than the other location. http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-gordo-las-vegasIf you are up for it, there is another place that serves an even better El Pastor. They are a couple miles away on Charleston just down the street from the other Tacos El Gordo. They are called Taqueria El Pastorcito. When you go East on Charleston, look for the trailer with the bright lights on the left side of the street just right before Los Tacos on the right side.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-el-pastorcito-las-vegas#query:Tacos%20El%20Pastorcito$2 dollar tacos on the strip? AWESOME!!! I tried to place recently due to the rave reviews on yelp. I was pleasantly surprised! I come from Los Angeles, and know all about "King Taco" and "El Taurino" and been to taco places in Mexico itself. I would say this place is in the same category as "El Taurino" if not better. Their Adobada (spicy pork different from Al Pastor style) with everything on it, is my favorite! I can eat 6 of these easily lol. I tried the "Taco el Lengua" (cow tongue) and was thrown off a bit. (I love cow tongue in Japanese and Korean BBQ) but the taco version is a little... well tastes like a mushy tongue lol. I wouldn't order that again.Avoid this place on Friday nights and Saturday nights unless you want to deal with dozens if not a hundred drunk loud clubbers who are literally throwing up outside in the parking lot... :( Also their "Horchata" and other mexican drinks are not made fresh or from scratch.  (kind of a bummer really), they use the mixed syrup machine dispensers. I guess I'm spoiled because where I come from the Horchata is always made fresh daily.This is my go to spot for late night tacos after work. If you are just visiting, I definitely recommend this place if you are a taco lover such as myself.Oh my goodness....THIS...is freaking amazing!!!! Pretty much every review below mine has covered everything. From the price, the flavoring and taste of these tacos....I know I'll be addicted to these. I've already gone twice in the past week alone.Street tacos to the max! Small in size but packed with flavoring.This is located on the Las Vegas Strip, so all your drunk tourists can stop by here after a night of drunken nightclubbing and sober up with these tacos.For you So Cali peeps: You know King Taco? Yeah...that infamous place with bombass carne asada tacos. Well....TACOS EL GORDO is giving King Taco a run for its money. Maybe this surpasses King Taco. Who knows? I'll let you decide. So if you had KT before, you got to try these tacos out!!!!!! These won't disappoint, I promise.BEST TACO EVER! Adobada Pork!Ask for extra salsa. Ask for the plate of veggies.EVEN BETTER WHEN DRUNK!Right next to the Wynn. They had live music at around 2am...!So SooooooOOOOooo GOOOOD!-Give it a try!This spot seems like one of the best deals on the entire strip, and with all the great reviews, how can you pass this place up?After a day spent strolling around aimlessly, it was time. Time to eat. It's been a bookmark for a while now and decided we'd make a stop this time through town. We were passing right by it - so why not?The lines were kinda hectic, at first I wasn't sure what to make of it, but after a minute, I saw that there were about 8 lines for ordering your food; direct from the kitchen staff. Watch them cook up your order, then take it to the register to pay. Pretty simple once you realize how it works. Finding a place to sit and eat on the other hand, was a challenge. Five minutes of hovering around the tables, and a spot finally opened up - this place is packed with customers enjoying their meals.The Carne Asada tacos were excellent, but the disappointer here were the Adobada (spicy pork) fries. Usually a fan of pulled or shredded pork dishes, the Carne Asada would have likely been the better choice to top that huge mound of (half sized) fries; I certainly am glad the lady and I didn't order the large. The pork was good, just not awesome or over the top delicious - I'll plan to stick to the Carne Asada if I stop in again.With four tacos, a (half) order of fries, and a coke our bill came to about $15 - I dare you to try and find that anywhere else on the strip for less than $30. If you do, please let me know - I'm always down for some tasty tacos.Happy Yelping!WHY DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE SOONER???What's wrong with me! I'm usually on top of these things, and I've been missing out this entire time. During my trips to Vegas, I spend most of my time at Encore and for the longest time I did not know about Tacos El Gordo. The boyfriend heard from a friend about this place, because it was one of his favorite places in Vegas in terms of food. ARE WE AT THE ZOO?The boyfriend and I came during lunch, and the place was a zoo!!! Where to order your food may be quite confusing at first, but if you look there are signs at each station that tell you what they're making. So, you just go to the correct station and tell them what you want, and they'll make it for you. While we were waiting for our tacos, I noticed an employee wiping the stainless steel walls by the grill stations down with a towel. Then my eyes started to wander around the entire kitchen, and I noticed that the ENTIRE KITCHEN WAS SPOTLESS! Holy crap!! This place was clean as hell, which means NO DIARRHEA. YES!!!After we were given all the food we ordered, we walked over to one of the two cashier stations to pay for the food. Yes, so you get your food first and then bring your tray to a cashier where they will ring you up. This is where you can order your drinks. OUTDOOR SEATINGWith the number of people inside, I was surprised that there was a good number of tables available. I was expecting the table and seats to be filled with leftover food from the people who previously sat there, BUT there was nothing. Again, spotless! The tables are sitting under a big tent, so don't worry about birds crapping on your head or trying to steal your food. LUNCH IS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE DAYBetween the boyfriend and I, we had one spicy pork taco, 3 carne asada tacos and one half order of their carne asada fries. I've been to so many taco trucks and taquerias in San Francisco, and usually the dirtier the place the better it tastes. But Tacos El Gordo was clean, and it tasted even better than most of the taco trucks and taquerias I've been to in SF!! =X CONCLUSIONLike I said many times in this review, and I'll say it again, this place is very clean. Even their stainless steel garbage cans sitting outside are clean, not a spot to be found! With that being said, if you're afraid of getting mud butt, Hersey squirts, bubble guts, the runs or whatever else you want to call it, because you've eaten dirty tacos from a dirty taco truck or taqueria, you won't have to worry here! You can get the same delicious tacos without worrying about having the run to the bathroom later. Haha, that sounded like a commercial. Anyways, I'll definitely be coming back for more tacos in the future. I love tacos, and I love that there is a legit place on The Strip I can go to, to get it! :) I want a taco now.EGG-cellent inebriated location for those late night munchies. I had Tacos El Gordo in San Diego...and they were absolutely delicious...and I was sober. One can only imagine how much more I would have enjoyed them if I werent sober.So remember this...It has been a long and fun night of fist pumping to insane EDM music...your drunk because for some reason your liver thinks its a god in vegas...you dont want to travel far becuase your lazy...and you dont want to overpay because your cheap. So where do you go?TACOS EL GORDO is your solution!-TACOS EL GORDOs is probably the best tacos in Vegas-TACOS EL GORDOs is as authentic as it gets-large variety of proteins to choose from-closes late!-located at the end of the strip-taste absolutely amazing...especially when drunk-cheap!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!UNTIL THEN!! ^-^Tacos El Gordo is the only place to go for real authentic tasting tacos at very affordable prices!  Located right on the strip, this is a very popular spot and is usually very busy.  They have a tasty selection of food to choose from.  I ordered the Tacos Adobada (spicy pork) and Tacos Asada along with a Sope Asada .  The Tacos Adobada was sooo mouth watering delicious! The pork was so tender and the salsa sauce was flavorful.  The Asada tacos and Sope were really good too, but the Adobada was the winner.When it is crowded (which is usually all the time) ordering can be a little confusing, especially if it's your first time. They have several counters where the meat is prepared.  Above the counters are the menus the items you can order from that counter. You pick up a tray go to the counter and place your order. They prepare the food in front of you. While at the counter you can also order grilled jalapenos and green onions. Very yummy.  After you visited the counters you go to the register to pay and also order any drinks.   Then you find a place to sit and enjoy. There is also a salsa cart with a variety of salsas fresh radishes, and limes. They offer free refills on the fountain drinks.  The inside seating is limited, but they also offer outside seating as well. Family owned straight out of Tijuana! They keep the prices affordable, $2 tacos! So please don't forget to Tip!! If you like the authentic feel and taste of a real taqueria, then Tacos El Gordo is a must stop when visiting Las Vegas!Where can you get authentic, fast, cheap tacos in Vegas? TACOS EL GORDO. There's one on charleston, but this review is for the one on las vegas blvd.Typically $2 tacos for a variety of meats: cabeza, lengua, adobada, and many more incarnations. Sad thing is I've waited so long to have amazing, real tacos until I've been introduced. Been here many times since then. WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU'RE A TACOS EL GORDO VIRGIN/TOURIST: Standing around awkwardly trying to figure out where to order. HOW TO ORDER: It's simple: one line for all other meat (cabeza, lengua etc.). One line for adobada (at least at this location). I believe they have more lines open to order, but I've come here a few times when it was just two lines. To those griping about the format of the lines, get over it. It's understandable that you want instant gratification and to get all your tacos at once, but the food comes out quick enough. If anything it's a bit more efficient. If you come with at least one other person (and chances are you're here with someone else) here's an idea: have one person stay in one line for a type of taco, and another person in another line waiting for the other tacos. Simple. Meet up at the register to pay for your tray. For $2 tacos and this delicious AND on the STRIP (lots of overpriced food places on the strip), it's not all that bad. You're free to try swankier places on the strip if you're that peeved. PERFECT FOR: Drunk people! Tipsy people! People-watchers! Night owls! Broke people! You might get a heart-attack if you ate here everyday, but you cannot beat the prices and the prime location. It does get super busy, but luckily, it's got late-night hours for that after-club/after-party bite. FOOD: The adobada tacos are deliciously marinated. It's fun watch it turn spit-style on a pineapple as it's being sliced for you. Flavorful, fattening, quick, and cheap. They don't skimp on the tacos either. Loaded with marinated meat, lettuce, tomatoes..my mouth is watering just remembering it. Carne asada fries are disappointing, yet still tasty for me. Crackly, torn adobada instead of soft mixed with guacamole and green sauce loaded (key word: LOADED) with cheese, sour cream, and fries. Nothing too special, but very filling and good for sharing. Wished it had more guacamole and green sauce. Might be a miss for some people. VERDICT: For the price you can't beat it. For the flavor, it's some of the best tacos in town. Overrated? Yeah. Best tacos ever? No, but it's better than Roberto's or a taco bell. This place has performed consistently for me that it's always perfectly moist, flavorful, rich meat. For others, the rush hour and lines might throw some off. Not a bad place for tourists and locals alike to try out for late night eats.Oh Tacos El Gordo. Really sucks that you're located on Las Vegas Blvd where every tourist and their mom wants to try your delicious tacos. And it also sucks that you have bad air circulation, barely any AC, and barely any place to park. However, your tacos are the boooommbbb diggity and this is why you deserve all the stars. Nothing about the food needs to be changed... the adobada, lengua, and tripa tacos are all seasoned perfectly and melt-in-you-mouth and I would recommend them to anyone. What you do need to change is the ordering process. Long lines with bad air circulation and sweaty people do not make for happy customers such as myself. Thus, because of this I will not be coming back.Vile. You steered me wrong, Yelp.  El Taco Gordo is disgusting.  You show up and there's a giant flat-top griddle.  You have to go to a different station for each meat you order.  (Annoying.)My asada ("steak," in theory) tasted like little gristly chicklets of shoe leather.  I spent the rest of my night cradling my stomach in agony.   AVOID AT ALL COSTS.--------------------------------------------------IMPORTANT NOTICE:--------------------------------------------------THIS LOCATION HAS CLOSED DOWN. I just walked over an hour ago hoping to get an adobada (spicy pork with pineapple) taco, but l left empty-handed.Go to the one in Downtown if you still wanna go!I'm so behind in reviews that I never got around to reviewing Tacos El Gordo before they closed this location. Well, I just wanted to say that while the food was okay, the dining experience as a whole was rather forgetful.First, what is the reason for having multiple lines for different kinds of meat? It makes zero sense to me. The lines are slow and you can forget about getting multiple meats if you come alone. Luckily, I was able to try several meats because we got in different lines. We waited over an hour at the two popular lines but there were other lines that had much less people. Why don't they make things more efficient and let people order any meat at any of the stations?The adobada, which is the meat they're known here wasn't all that interesting to me. I don't understand why everyone is crazy about this red pork. Don't forget to ask for the slices of pineapple off the top of their spit. You can also ask for the grilled veggies and peppers with your tacos. Out of adobada, asada, cabeza, and lengua, I liked their lengua the most. It was probably one of the best lengua tacos I've had, actually. Unfortunately, I didn't think much of their sauces.Even though the tacos weren't bad or anything, the whole waiting in line forever and having different lines for different types of meat marred the overall experience here. It was very difficult finding a table to eat at as well. Hopefully some of these issues were particular to this location. I'm hopeful that I'll have a better experience at one of their other locations.
Smoke BBQ Taqueria=First sign of a good restaurant: I wanted everything on the menu because it looked so good!Second sing of a good restaurant: Everything on the menu actually turns out to be great!Look closely for this place, because in the dark, you can easily pass it by.  It's totally adorable inside, and come to find out it's actually registered a historic landmark.  Makes it even quirkier!  The owner is super friendly and helped us pick out some awesome menu choices, being our first time there.  As soon as she said she had just cooked the ribs, for the rib taco's, I was in BBQ heaven!  I also chose the brisket taco, from reading all the other reviews, it seemed like the smart thing to do.  Both were incredibly tasty, with the fantastic BBQ marinade.  I was more into the rib taco than the brisket, but both were awesome.  I was also torn by the sides, because they all looked so yummy!  I decided to get the Jalapeno Apple Coleslaw. I love coleslaw, but it's one of those sides you can very often get wrong.  Too much mayo, not enough mayo, not enough vinegar, too much vinegar, etc.  This was perfectly marinated with a touch of vinegar and mayo and delicious apple slices mixed in.  I also sampled my friends white cheddar mac n' cheese.  WOW.  Obvious next time side item for me, it's incredible!  A couple things to remember:  It's BYOB, so bring it!  CASH ONLY. Also, they're only open until 7pm mon-wed, so make sure you're in before then.  She was nice enough to serve us and not kick us out...and was very nice all the while.  She even brought a sample of this delish cantaloupe drink, get that too on your trip out, because you must stop in!Holy SMOKE!    First up in the list of wonderfulness to be experienced is the service.  I'd called ahead to check whether or not corn tortillas were available to accommodate my gluten issues. I was lucky enough to have my first opportunity to talk with Nelda, the wife half of the Smoke duo.  Nelda said she'd be happy to set some homemade ones aside from breakfast service for me....just let her know when I get there and she'd take care of everything.  And she did.  Warmly.  With Nelda's help, we built a couple of tacos without any gluten problems at all. The brisket.  Everything you've read here about the brisket is true.  THE BEST BRISKET IN THE CITY!!!  Mine came with avocado cream, pickled onions and fresno hot sauce instead of the porter bbq sauce (porter = beer = verbotten gluten).  I can't imagine anything being better than the smoky, creamy, spicy taco that was created.  I didn't stop there, I also had one of the new tacos...the Chicken, Apple, cheddar, smoked jalapeno mayo and house cured and smoked bacon taco!  Loved it.  It made my taste buds dance!  My husband really enjoyed the Philly taco....brisket, onions, hot peppers and a sharp white cheddar sauce.  I wasn't able to sample it, but he was a very happy camper!  He agreed it was the best brisket anywhere.  He enjoyed the mac and cheese while I enjoyed the apple jalapeno slaw...both measured up to the tacos....outstanding!  The horchata was sweet, spicy with cinnamon and delish....I think a shot of spiced rum would be an awesome addition.  And since SMOKE is byob, you could do that!  The hubby - as cautious as he is about new tastes - enjoyed his agua fresca - a strawberry version - quite well.  Again, maybe a shot of tequila would take it over the top?Our SMOKE break on way to Kennywood Christmas on Saturday evening. was one that will be repeated....often  We can't wait to go back and give everything on the menu a try.  Next time...breakfast at SMOKE!  One last thing...SMOKE has not only the best brisket in Pittsburgh, SMOKE has the BEST TACOS IN PITTSBURGH!!!!
Kaleidoscope Café=This café is the reason I like to wander backstreets for hours on end, because when you find a gem like this, all those hours are worth it. Every single one. The only thing, literally, the *one* thing that makes me not want to yelp this place, is that I'm afraid I won't get  the owner's undivided attention when I go back and it's packed. So I sat down in the dining room, completely alone. Some Ben Harper came on and the chef/owner/waiter handed me a menu. He asked me what I was in the mood for and I rattled off random thoughts (filling but not heavy and a little spice perhaps?)...I ended up getting a cranberry sausage dish smothered in a sweet sauce with hits of cayenne and topped with brie. I know, I know, food porn. It was even better than it sounds. Not one flavor was overpowering so every bite was a perfectly balanced little world.The owner hung out with me after cooking and we talked about his travels (roasted goat in Africa is where it's at!) and future menu plans (gorgonzola cheese cake topped with bacon!). We agreed that if the world ever runs out of bacon you can throw us in the river because who wants to live without the sweetest of all meats? Everything (including an ice tea) was under $15. The menu is probably best classified as "New American" or "Modern American."It was nice (it was better than nice, it was awesome) to find real foodie dishes being served in a relaxed atmosphere where I felt comfortable walking in off the street in my lazy Sunday clothes. And next time I'm getting the deep friend gnocchi because that's so genius it can't be ignored.Talk about off the beaten path!  The place is in Lawrenceville nestled between houses off Butler St.  But once you walk in, it's an adorable little cafe with tiny homemade Kaleidscopes on the tables and giant colorful triangles all over the walls and ceiling.The menu was actually larger than I thought for lunch with salads, sammies and main dishes like pasta (surprisingly a lot of pasta's actually!).  The people next to us had a huge dish of pasta that looked good, but the fries the other person had smelled even better!  So I opted for the Veggie sammie and fries.  The veggies were eggplant, zucchini and a portobella cap.  The bun was so good!  It was fresh and soft.  I hate when sammies are served on sour dough because, number one, I don't like sour dough, but number two, it's hard to eat!  The fries were just as awesome as they smelled, nice thick cut and crispy!  So the veggies totally canceled out the fat in the fries, right?!Ever since I first found Kaleidoscope Cafe two years ago when I was looking for dinner in Lawrenceville and they couldn't seat me, I've been wanting to come back and try it out.  When I saw that they were participating in PGH Restaurant Week, I made a reservation for Fri. evening at 6:30 for CM and I to ensure that this time, I'd be able to try their unique culinary offerings.  Because of the PGH Restaurant Week promotion, CM and I ordered more than we usually would, so we were able to try a good portion of the menu.  We ordered the following: Deep-fried gnocchi (shared), Kaleidoscope salad (CM), autumn harvest salad (me), miso glazed salmon with risotto (CM), chicken cherry pot pie (me), and flourless chocolate torte (shared).  Additionally, the chef included a complimentary serving of pita bread with pineapple-mango (?) infused butter.In general, I was quite impressed with the flavors and quality of the dishes that we ordered.  The deep-fried gnocchi was quite unique, and the marinara sauce that accompanied it was tasty--Darren W.'s description of this dish is very apt.  The bright, citrusy notes of the butter made for a wonderful accompaniment to the pita bread, with a mouthwatering sweet-salty balance.  The salads both had a nice variety of flavors and textures, and were quite fresh and pleasant.  Unfortunately, the Kaleidoscope salad was missing avocado due to a kitchen shortage, so it wasn't as texturally balanced as it would have been, even though CM subbed in walnuts.  Although a bit small, the flourless chocolate torte was rich, smooth, and creamy, and was one of the best renditions I've tasted.For my entree, I was originally planning to order the sweet potato tagliatelle per another Yelper's recommendation, but the chicken cherry pot pie also captured my interest, so I asked my waitress which dish she'd recommend. Without hesitation, she recommended the pot pie, so I decided to order it instead. In terms of diameter, this was the largest chicken pot pie I've ever eaten at about 10," and it was quite tall as well, due to a light-as-air puff pastry top. While it was delicious and unique, the overall flavor turned out to be a bit sweeter than I'd have liked due to the cherries in the filling.  CM's salmon, on the other hand, had a great balance of savory flavors and textures, and was more to my taste.Aside from the food, service was on point, with dishes being served and cleared at a perfect pace, and attentiveness to our needs.  The one disappointment was that the chef didn't come out to greet us--it's my understanding that he usually does this, and I saw him do it for the next table over as we were waiting for our entrees, so perhaps he was too busy (?).  I really enjoyed the decor and the intimate setting, as well.Overall, despite a few small hiccups, CM and I had a wonderful dinner at Kaleidoscope, and enjoyed sampling the menu.  Our check came to $63, which I felt was very reasonable, given the amount of food that we received. I'd highly recommend Kaleidoscope to anyone looking for a cozy, intimate, and delicious dinner in L-ville, especially for dates. 4.5 stars.
Technique Restaurant=What in the hell is there not to like about this restaurant?  Listen, for $10, $10 measly dollars I could bum up from strangers outside of CVS within an hour, I can get a three course meal during lunch.  Instead of going to the movies, you can redirect that money and come to Technique and get shrimp risotto, halibut and chocolate mousse for dessert.  Or, if you would prefer, you can get a caprese salad with fried mozzarella, a sandwich with handcut fries and housemade mayonaise and a caramel creme dessert.I might complain about my food taking a bit too long in the kitchen, but "might" is a distinct impossibility and in a world where I would make such a complaint, gravity makes things fall up, cats drink purple and I'm a complete bastard.  It's time consuming, but it's inexpensive and the food that you get is legitimately delicious.What a great way to enjoy excellent food.  You must put this place on your must eat here list.  I really enjoyed the dinner service and so did everyone at my table.  Imagine great plating, excellent choices of protein, a starter, and a dessert.  This is what you will get here and on a shoestring budget.  At only $16 per person for dinner service this is an excellent value.  If you must spend more, bottles of wine, by the glass, cocktails, and beer can be had as well. I still am in shock at the bill, it was literally nothing for the 3 courses of food provided.  Bread is also part of the meal, which was quickly devoured by myself and my guests.  With 3 types of butter to sample and enough fresh bread just to get you excited for the meal to come.  I enjoyed the pork belly starter and also sampled the pizza starter by one of my guests.  Truly excellent pork belly and the pizza had fresh mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes. The tomatoes had a nice sweetness to them.  I would personally pick the pork belly again or try the scallops for a starter next time.  I assume the menu changes every month so get down there if you want to sample the same dishes. :)For the main course I chose the flat iron steak.  It was a  great dish and no steak knife was provided.  No worries, the butter knife provided cut the meat well with no effort.  Looking for a flavorful steak? Try it here, I was most impressed and yes I eat it rare plus.  I would never cook it rare plus at home, but I am always excited to try it at a restaurant.  Finally the dessert course.  We all were full at this point.  However we must not let the sour cream ice cream go to waste.  Yes the most delicious part of the desert, yes the hazelnut chocolate was rich and very good, but the ice cream was different.  That difference will bring us back.  We could eat the ice cream without anything else.If you did not know this it is a school and most likely you will get waiters, waitresses, and I assume even the chefs are students.  Not a bad idea and most likely the wait staff and chef is trying to do their best.   Also this is a nice restaurant and reminded me of typical fine dinning.  The only thing I will request for next time is a window seat.  It would be great to be by the huge glass windows at night during dinner.  Give them a call and set up a reservation.   Hope you have the opportunity to enjoy dinner here, cheers.
Le Filet=Amazing meal.  The dishes were inventive without being cloying or overly complicated. We had six seafood dishes each better than the last. They were all light but filling. I loved the tuna tartar, hamachi, and scallops min particular. Great atmosphere and service as well. Not cheap but worth it!
Los Cabos Mexican Restaurant=This was a good week for food.Great Mexican food, I think I'm swayed by free salsa and chips. For a place that isn't really conducive to sitting down and eating (seems less like a restaurant and more like a takeout) I was surprised by the presentation of the food as well as the pleasant service.  It had all the benefits of being a quick to go restaurant and a proper sit down. +Speedy +Cheap+Huge portions to last for days+Pleasant staff +Complementary chips and salsa (really got me) +Relatively Clean and Quiet +Convenient Nothing to hate.When anyone asks about Mexican food in the city and someone starts to say Mad M--smack them (unless you're just trying to get a bigazz marg!). And then bring them here.This place is that So-Cal Mex done perfectly, filling my rather pathetic size self with a burrito larger than any (and have been doing so for at least the last five years). I used to even trek here from the South Hills for my shredded chicken before moving to the East End. A pilgrimage from a south 'burgher is rare. Between the family running the place that is constantly here with sincere, friendly service, and the enchilada sauce (yes, seriously, just this sauce by itself), you can't get better.Enchilada sauce. I could live off this stuff. I've had enchiladas elsewhere and been like, cool, tomatoes. But this! Red gold. It covers the huge, tender shredded chicken burrito that shares its huge shell with corn, lil' peps, rice, green beans, and is totally finished by me every time.. and these are massive. Those shredded burritos are under the radar it seems.  Everyone else gets the beefy Pittsburgh burrito, which I have to salute if only for the use of french fries.You also get to begin your meal with their salsa and chips, and while free, are also some of the best. I do think they make everything themselves and will not believe any word otherwise. My only draw back is trying to stop by for late night, and they are often already closed before the listed hour. Maybe I just like the chase.. The elusive burrito. Good to note a few of the local food delivery services will also drop off your puppy sized lunch to the surrounding neighborhoods.I can't compare it to others anywhere in the area (maybe a joint or two while living in AZ, but that's a given). Not saying Western PA is a hot spot for Mexi, but we hit a gold mine here. This is a Penn Ave sauce covered gem.
Thirteen North=So, this is owned by the guy who owns Stumpy's down the block, and I want it to succeed, because I think he's a good dude who always greets customers and seems genuinely concerned about all of us.I dropped in for Happy Hour one Friday evening (which ends at 6pm, btw) and the crowd was mostly people in their mid 40's-50's out for Friday night to kick off the weekend. The bartenders were friendly and they were busy. I had some cold draft beers and the salmon flatbread, which I thought was great. Anything with capers and horseradish on a pizza crust (and it's the same crust as at Stumpy's which I do enjoy) I'm all in and not only did it taste great, it looked appetizing. Everyone else at the bar was eyeing my grub but I told them to get their own.Thirteen North is walking distance from my place, so I'll likely be a regular, even though the crowd is 10-15 years older than I am. I love to support a local business that cares about its customers.When a restaurant manager says "Of course we can make a grilled cheese sandwich for you, even though it's not on the menu.  We have cheese and we have bread.  What type of cheese would you like?  What type of bread would you prefer, sour dough or wheat?"  I am forever sold on this place.  Customer service lives and thrives at Thirteen North !!!Chili Chicken Mac and Cheese was very, very tasteful, while entirely different than I expected.  Beverages were refilled before we knew we wanted more.  I will go back to try the Ahi Tuna salad.  Long live excellent food coupled with divine service!I hate to leave a terrible review for a restaurant in our neighborhood, but unfortunately, the following is what they earned.We drive by Thirteen North often as it is located near our home. We love to eat local and tried this restaurant once many years ago, but for whatever reason never returned.  More recently I noticed they were offering Groupons, so I made a mental note that the establishment may be struggling and that we should go in and support our neighbors. Big mistake.Upon entering (myself, Husband, and 3 year old daughter) we were walked toward a 2 person table and offered a high chair. Possibly the hostess has never had children...possibly?...so I kind of understand why she may have thought that a 3 year old will sit in a high chair. Mine definitely does not. We declined and she was so kind as to offer us a larger table so we could all sit in a chair. When our server arrived we each tried to order a drink. She had no problem with my tea or Husband's water, but when we asked for milk for our daughter she replied "this is not Denny's". (WE SHOULD HAVE LET AT THAT MOMENT)We stayed and ordered our food. While waiting for our mediocre entrees to arrive, the server yelled from a few tables down that we "need to drink in unison" so she doesn't have to fill my drink and then come back to fill his later. It was most likely meant as a joke, but that is the type of thought she should not articulate. (I told her she does not need to fill mine anymore...wouldn't want to take time away from her leaning on the bar doing NOTHING).When we were finished eating (I only ate half of my pasta) she took the plates away quickly, did not offer a box, and dropped the check.We will NEVER be back.
Brio Tuscan Grille=HAPPY HOUR IS AWESOME! They do it twice a day, 3:30pm-6:30pm and 9pm-close.  The evening one is packed from what I've heard, so I went tonight and was pleased that there was open seating on the patio.  So nice out tonight, too.  Restaurant is open until 11pm on weeknights and 12am on weekends, so it's a good late night option for food.All dishes are $2.95, and there's 10-12 dishes.  I tried the shrimptini (shrimp cocktail), which was ok aka great for $3.  I also had the steak bruchetta per my waiter's recommendation, which was really good.  There's two flatbreads on the menu, which is a steal for the price, as is the burger.  Also a few other unusual items like a shrimp & eggplant dish.  Going to have to try that one next time.On Thursday nights they also do $5 martinis, which I didn't know about.  Got a razztini to complement my meal.  Total bill was under $12 with tax.  Not bad at all.  See ya soon, Brio.I liked the Town Square location the one or two times I was there. But the food I got at the Tivoli location was mediocre at best. The sweet potato and chicken risotto ($16.25) was gummy and tasted like paste. The fettuccine napoli ($15.95) was better, but nothing stellar. The best thing I tried was the kid's cheese pizza. Yeah, that means the place is kid friendly. The prices are reasonable -- although from what I hear happy hour is the best time to go since apps are $3 each.WTH BRIO you broke my heart.I have visited brio in town square numerous times. but the Brio on Rampart is so much closer to my home. I came to enjoy their wonderful happy hour and great sangria and was heartbroken by the WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.1) it took the waitress 35 minutes to take our order. fine fine i'll let that slide..2) the waitress didn't bring us any bread. we thought it was because it was happy hour but all the surrounding tables had bread. 3) we were sitting at a tiny cocktail table with 3 cups of water pitcher of sangria with 3 wine glass plus the salt/pepper sugar... summary. Not much room. when our food came he wouldn't take other dishes away. we asked him nicely to if he could take some dishes away and even passed it to him and he just walked away! HOW FREAKING RUDE. i thought he was going to put something down and come back because we CLEARLY had no room on our tiny little cocktail table to put 4 giant plates on the table and eat comfortably. but guess what. he left. like the jerk he is. 4) when we needed the bill to get out of this place the waitress was no where to be found. this was suppose to be a quick drink eat and go that ended up taking over 2 hours because the waitress forgot we existed. the food was still consistent and delicious as expected. but nothing ruins an eating experience worse than bad customer service.the worst part of this visit was not only was the waitress terrible and inattentive. the food server guy was also terrible. it wasn't just one person that ruined my night. it was TWO. TWO TERRIBLE WORKERS. i couldn't believe the lack of customer service we received at this place.I'll never come back to this Brio again.My wife and I have been to Brio in Tivoli Village and Town Square for happy hour, lunch and dinner many times over the yrs, sometime with our friends, too, and always have good experiences. This evening my wife and I went for an early dinner. The pleasant hostess took us to a nice and quiet corner table. The dining room was not crowded, yet, so was pretty quiet, although the bar area was hopping, as the patio was a bit too cold, even for the tough young crowd. Our server, Kim, was very friendly and helpful, and got our beer orders (Blue Moon, $5.25) started immediately. Good thing she did that for us, too, because the barkeeps were kept super busy by those happy yuppies, who "never seem to have to work!"  Boy do I envy them!  ;-)  The wait staff quickly brought us our favorite bread basket with warm and delicious rolls, which we enjoyed over our beers. And I started feeling great!BTW: Brio's STILL  DON'T serve Blue Moon on DRAFT, yet, only in a bottle! SIGH! For dinner, my wife ordered the "Sliced steak salad" (15.95), and I had the "Mediteranian shrimps" (15.95). Both were delicious! The steak was tender and juicy and in good quanty; shrimps were cruchy fresh and very tasty! Their presentations were quite appetizing - I totally forgot to take any pics of our dishes, being distracted by our hunger and discusions on our travel plans for 2014! Trust me, our dinners looked good! Our sweet server Kim (no, she is NOT Korean) was attentive and pleasant; her crew was efficient, keeping our water glasses full, and putting our finished dishes discreetly away. Kim also did us a great favor, taking the time to straighten out the mistakes with my Brio's reward account and honored my $15 reward credits - very nice of her!During our dinner, the hostess (perhaps also mgr) came by to say hello, and later helped the waitress out with our check. [i.e., taking it to/from the cashier, but NO, she did NOT really help out with the $Check, You Silly!]  ;-)   - A nice business practice! The Brio brand is characterized by its reliable, good italian style cuisine of VALUE; spaciousness, comfy ambience; vibrant bar scene; excellent service. Hmm...table cloths also add a touch of elegance. Of course there are other comparable restaurants, but I think Brio stands out in ITS CLASS. - My friends say, it's like dining in a "Mid-Upscale" restaurant at Olive Garden prices. For me, the Brio's in general and this locale in particular is one of the places I would go on a whim for happy hour (their $4 tasty small plates, Wed Martinis...are hard to resist at times) and/or for a tasty meal - NO SURPRISES!Jan 2014
Akahana Asian Bistro=So Akahana what's up? Do you hate me that much that you always pair me up with the very inattentive waiter that messes up my order every time?Leanne C.'s review pretty much sums up our experience there. I got told I could have cake, then the cake was a lie, then there was cake again. Quit playing with my heart! I would've ordered some food to go with the cake if you hadn't taken almost an hour to bring it out of the freezer. My love of dessert for dinner is unrivaled, but this was really crappy cake that I ended up giving away because I couldn't stomach it's frozen sickly sweetness. I suggest that you inform people next time you're serving them cold chocolate cake because I kind of envisioned a warm fluffy moist piece of chocolate yumminess.Service was awful, bad, below mediocre, crap, pick any negative adjective you like. Sake was ordered at the start of the meal and came out near the end after we had said we didn't want it anymore since it was so late, at least our server realized how big of a mess that was and comped us for it.I hate the stupid BOGO deal, just price your stuff reasonably because I don't want to always eat 2 rolls when I come here. I think I'll have to end my relationship with you here for a while Akahana.Where Akahana isn't an incredible location based on locale, they definitely pack a punch with a sushi menu of note. Checked these guys out for lunch after a long awaited and needed visit. The decor is actually pretty swanky. I really like the waterfall with the glass logo behind it. Pretty snazzy. Cool bar setup, too. We ordered a ton of sashimi and a few basic rolls. Check out my photo from the sashimi/nigiri platter. Gorgeous presentation. Fresh, flavorful and service was very fast and direct from the chef over the counter. My biggest dislikes are the prices and the TVs. Prices do seen a little steep, but for the amount of food we ordered, it was well worth it. Can't say the same if it weren't for the buy one, get one half off deal. Probably wouldn't go back if it weren't around. And the TVs. Just yuck. Jerry springer and other garbage channels on all of them and the sushi chefs were glued to it. Kind of funny, but really disappointing. Daytime TV + sushi = no thanks. I can say I'd be back, but maybe for a change from the regular sushi go-tos. Cheers!
Bistro 1843=Très bon resto français!  Situé dans une belle maison (probablement centenaire), l'ambiance est chaleureuse et intime.  Les coupes de viandes et cuissons sont excellentes, servies avec des sauces très aromatiques, et se marient vraiment bien ensemble.  Tout est vraiment très bon, de la soupe au dessert!N'oubliez pas votre vin! Le resto n'est pas très grand et bien connu dans le coin alors réservez tot!
Bollywood Bites=This place is unprofessional in every way possible.It's really a shame that for a place that serves up very decent, authentic indian cuisine, that the customer service is so deplorable. My parents and I went in today to pick up an order of undhia and bhajia at 6pm. They had pre-ordered it and arranged the pick up time. We were told to wait for 5 minutes, which we did with no problem. 5 minutes turned into 10, 15, and almost 20. When it finally came out my father rightly expressed concern about the timing since we were ordering a very large amount for a special event. The owner snidely replied, well, if you are so concerned, then why are you even ordering from us? Ummm, say what? First rule of customer service, the customer is always right. And even if they are obnoxious, which we were not, you APOLOGIZE for being late. And you don't make snide comments. And here's the kicker, we let it slide because there were other people in the store, and when we got home we realized we had gotten the WRONG order, we had 2 orders of bhajias. So we called the owner, Hetal, to note this error. Instead of an apology (at this point we were owed two) we got her adamant denial that she was in the wrong. No, it was us who had placed a wrong order. My father expressed his disapproval of her behavior and you know what she said? I don't have to listen to you, I've opened restaurants before, I don't need to be told how to run it. UM, actually, you do. Because you are RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, and cocky enough to think that just because your food is good, you can get by with the worst service I have ever encountered. This is America, you can't treat your customers like this and get away with it. And it's such a shame, because in this small indian community of Charlotte, one wants to spread the word about their fellow indian's business and help them out. But this place is not worth all the undhia in the world. It left a really bad taste in my mouth and we will never step foot in there again.Holy god, this place is delish. But if you're stuffing your face with deep fried, hot toddy S.Indian goodness, tables in full 95 degree sunlight don't work as seating - an umbrella, perhaps, would make this an easier lunchtime sell.Fav? Lilva Katchori - tiny nuggets of buckwheat groats and mustard seeds, turmeric, curry leaves, covered in pastry and fried. Crunchy, textural, rad. Comes with their house hot tamarind sauce - a sweet, gradually crescendoing spice experience, thin, and everything tastes better dipped in it.Got some sort of sandwich, let's go with curry and lime pickle and chickpea spread - and damn, it was awesome. A slider by way of Punjab. Killer.Prices are low to mid - and there are things being made here that you can't get anywhere else, plus the classics are fab - samosas, two huuuuge pastry-covered piles of fennel seed, potato, unidentifiable delish, for 3 bucks. A garlicy, smoky dal, multiple legumes, a cup or so of Paneer Masala, a perfect amount of rice, papadum, and thin, pancake-like Naan, for 7. Sweet.
The Ol Pizzeria & Cafe=It's been almost 2 years since I've been here. the fact that they're still open is a good sign. I tried the to slice in a drink combo again today.The crust is amazing, thin and crispy yet chewy at the same time.The butter garlic sauce on the back of the crust was excellent. The cheese was fresh the sauce was light but good, I would recommend extra sauce. Service was good, the owner asked how everything was and made some suggestions. Too bad I am outside their delivery area.
Due Forni=First, I want to say thanks for opening a great pizza place near me in the Southwest. It's right off of the 215 and Town Center. It's next to Hokkaido and Rachel's Kitchen. Next, the restaurant is very cool looking with a covered outdoor patio. I'm sure they are waiting for the weather to get warmer but they have heat lamps out there so they can use it now... hint hint =) The interior is sleek and urban with orange and brown accents that match their logo/theme. The restaurant is split into two sides, the dining area and and the bar area. I like this because there is a separation between both which has a different vibe for each. Dining area is much more family feel while bar is casual cool wine lounge with yummy food. OF course the centerpiece are the two pizza ovens in the kitchen area. And if you are wondering, that's the kitchen... that's it, all open. Isn't that crazy?And you can if you want, stand up at the glass partition to watch them make your pizza. I watched them for a bit and that's when Chef Carlos said hi and told me about the open kitchen. I just got off work and was hungry so I went straight for the good stuff.. the pizza. There are two kinds of pizza: Neapolitan or Roman. I was like, what is Roman style. Apparently, it's like a cracker crust. I will try next time. I ordered the Picante (cuz I like it spicy), and added garlic and an over-easy egg. I love pizza places that add egg to the top of the pizza! Well needless to say, the pizza was amazing and spicy. The Sopressata, red peppers, garlic, San Marzano tomato and egg all worked together. The crust is thick enough to hold the toppings and probably a couple more. I usually dip my remaining crust in olive oil and I ended up pouring the olive oil all over the pizza - some good olive oil. Next time I will need to try the app, esp the Carpaccio, Gnocchi, Scampi the Mozzarella Bar, and of course more pizza. Ciao!Really cute restaurant on Town Center near the 215.  Nice décor.  Our server was really enthusiastic and, at one point, did an ode to sea salt that I cannot do justice.  We had the tricolore salad ($9.95) which was very light and refreshing.  I believe they added some pears to the salad, which was nice.  We also tried the mozzarella bar ($10.95) where you pick one mozzarella and one side.  They have three different kinds and we went with the classica and the anchovies as our side.  Don't get the anchovies unless you are serious about anchovies.The great thing about this place is they have two different types of pizza, which is rare for gourmet pizza restaurants.  They have pizza ovens for both Roma and Neapolitan.  Figure out which one you like before you go.  Roma is thinner crust, kind of like Grimaldi's but not as greasy.  Neapolitan is thicker crust, like Settebello.  We prefer Grimaldi's so we went with the Roma Due Forni pizza ($15.95) and it was really, really good!  It comes with tomato, mozzarella, sausage, bacon, and pequillo peppers, which are roasted red peppers.  The mozzarella had a good, slightly smoky flavor and the bacon and sausage were delicious.They offer Moretti on tap ($5.95/glass) and have a good variety of bottled beers.  They also offer all wines by the glass and have an enomatic machine behind the bar.  Our red wine was served warm so I think the enomatic machines are reserved for the more expensive wines.  Some of their wines cost $50 a glass.  We had the Educated Guess Cabernet ($13.95/glass) and the Suri Barbera ($11.95).  Very good wines but I just wish they were served at the right temperature - slightly cool.The dessert menu is pretty cool (see pic) and they have a chocolate pizza that I would like to try.  We had the tiramisu gelato and it was very delicious.They are open until 11pm on the weekends, which is pretty late for Summerlin.  We usually don't make it out until 9pm to eat so it's nice to eat somewhere that isn't trying to close while we are eating.I'm so happy this place opened in Summerlin and I can't wait to come back!I've been looking for a place that cracks an egg over pizza. Thanks to Debbie N's review, that place is Due Forni.The name means Two Ovens in Italian. When I walked in, the owner showed me the two ovens, which are both on full display from the dining area. (I just assumed he's the owner because he seemed very welcoming and grateful that I chose his establishment). On this occasion, I was just there to pick up a take-out order, but the interior is very classy. There is a bar area on one side with a dining area on the other.We decided to go with the Tartufo because it's the one with the over easy baked egg. The other ingredients are black truffle, parmesan crema, fontina fontal, and roasted cremini. I didn't realize it at the time, but based on the menu description, I guess we had the Neapolitan style pizza. Each of their pizzas can be ordered Neapolitan or Roman. That's why they need two ovens. The Neapolitan is baked at 900 degrees for no more than 90 seconds whereas the Roman is baked in a 500-degree oven for 3 minutes.Although the egg was extremely undercooked, the pizza was oh so good. It is certainly an expensive pizza if you look at the size versus the price ($20.95 for the Tartufo), but the ingredients were high quality and the crust was cooked to perfection. We paired that up with a Tricolore salad, consisting of farmers market greens, taggiasca olives, artichokes, avocado, and white balsamic. Wow was this salad excellent. Great flavor throughout with (again) high quality ingredients and a reasonable price ($9.95).It's not in my area of town, but I would return to Due Forni in two heartbeats.So I'll have to preface this with the fact that I don't eat undercooked eggs. In fact, I have a fear of them and can't even watch people eat "egg goo". I'm sure I'm missing out on part of the magic of this restaurant by not ordering the egg-goo pizza, so perhaps this would be a 5 star review if egg-goo was my thing. The decor of this place was awesome - chic, clean, and modern. Service was quick and polite. We ate here on our lunch break so I appreciate good service when I'm trying to dine quickly. We settled on the gnocchi and the prosciutto pizza . The gnocchi wasn't dense like most gnocchi I'm used to, but was utterly fabulous. The bacon was divine and the peas and light sauce were perfect. YUM. The pizza was pretty damn good, but I like Settebello FAR better. The crust was very similar, but I found the cheese/topping ratio at Due to be off. I didn't really taste any cheese, but my pizza was covered in tons and tons of proscuitto and salad. I will say, ounce for ounce, you're getting a ton more meat on the pizza here, but it was in obnoxiously huge pieces there were impossible to eat without cutting. But then cutting the meat ended up making the entire pizza fall apart. Settebello just holds together better. Also, I love the Carbonara pizza at Settebello featuring a FULLY COOKED (and goo free egg!). Additionally, the prices at Settebello are much better. I felt like I was eating good pizza dough with tons of meat and salad on it here. The balsalmic on it was tasty, but just added to my meat salad feeling I was getting. Truffle oil and more cheese would have served this pizza well ! I do love Italian style pies, so I'm pleased to have another option in Vegas. Don't miss the fabulous pasta, this place has many exciting options besides pizza !A little wine and pizza for lunch. And although a lot looked great on the appetizer end of things..we got what we came for. One roman and one Neapolitan. Ordered the prosciutto e rucola for the Neapolitan pizza which was awesome. The smoked buffalo mozzarella really brought it to a whole new level. Crust was light, chewy and just the way we like it. The roman margherita was just ok. We weren't crazy about the crust but I think that's just our preference. Will probably be the one and only time we get roman. Glad we tried it though. Nice wine selection. Friendly service. Atmosphere was great. We'll definitely take advantage of the outdoor seating when it isn't windy. Definitely top 5 pizza for Vegas but there's another place that begins with "S" in Henderson that's still #1 for me.Amazing selection of Italian wines by the glass.  We dropped by on  Friday evening after dinner to enjoy the wine bar.  My only regret is not trying this place sooner.  Right out of the gate you notice the wine selection is standard issue.  Don't worry if you're not an Italian wine expert, the staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  Our server, Alexander, was more than eager to describe and talk about all of the wines, as well as explaining how the wines are selected. Between the two of us we tried 6 different wines.  Not a single one fell short of stellar.  I was most  surprised by how much I enjoyed the Grecante, mostly because the texture put me in mind of melty butter on my tongue.The Due Forni wine set up is like no other wine bar I've visited.  It is pretty rare to come across some of the higher end wines offered by the glass.  And you can even get a 2 oz pour at 20% of the glass price.The owner stopped by briefly to check with us, which is always a nice touch.  I highly endorse this lovely little spot.  You can tell that a lot of thought and effort have been put into Due Forni.  The ambiance is warm and welcoming, and we got a kick out of the silly Spaghetti Western that was playing on the TVs above the bar.On my next visit I am looking forward to trying their pizza, which can be ordered with a crispy crust (Roman style) or light & chewy crust (Neopolitan style).After a long Labor Day weekend of Tropicbeauty bikini modeling all I wanted was some really yummy pizza. Due Forni came up on my Yelp with good reviews, so we decided to give it a try.We arrived late, around 9:40pm (they close at 10pm) but the host and sole waiter were as sweet as ever. I did not feel rushed in the slightest, but did try to be conscientious because I can only imagine how annoying it is to wait around on people when all you want to do is go home after a long day.Our order:-Beet salad-Buffala mozzerella with roasted tomatoes-Due Forni Neopolitan crust pizza-Speck Roman crust pizzaYum! Everything was very tasty. My favorite was the buffala mozz with roasted tomatoes. The mozz was creamy and beautiful, so good.The beet salad and pizzas were all very good, but my only complaint was that the speck pizza was a bit soggy in the center. Perhaps it wasn't cooked all the way through? When I picked up a slice from the pizza plate to move it to my single serving plate the crust didn't hold up, it started to slip downward and the toppings began their slow slide down until I rushed the slice over to my plate. However, the taste was fresh and I really did enjoy the meal.Service was excellent, especially considering we were there after closing and there was only one other pair of people in the restaurant (they seemed to be regulars/friends of the waiter). Their wine selection look varied, I would love to come back and try some wines next time.Scratch one off the personal bookmarks. Been meaning to hit up Due Forni for quite some time. Heard about it from my yelp social group who had nothing but good things to say about the place. Highlights seems to focus more on the braised octopus dish that's so tender it's not like any octopus you've ever had. Well...i've had a lot of octopus and i do enjoy octopus...CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!!! - Polipo The revered octopus appetizer...The description on the menu honestly does not do this dish ANY justice. How much does the menu description downplay the epicness of this dish? Well it's kinda like calling a nuke a typical explosive...it goes boom things get fucked up u know how it goes...Whoa where do i start...Okay first impression was the smell that hit me. I was confused at first because it sorta had a fish sauce smell and i was raised around fish sauce. Seeing the greens in the bowl and the smell of fish sauce my mind already determined what this was going to taste like. Not saying this is a bad thing it's just from my prospective my mind was playing tricks on me based on what the senses were collecting. Imagine seeing the lid pulled from a plate of steamed veggies and you smelled steak...kinda like that...confusingAnyway first bite of a piece of octopus it was just...WOW it's tender. Not too salty and was well balanced with the dressing of the small salad. I gotta be careful with this dish in the future because it may just raise the standard for my future octopus experiences. - Speck Pizza in a Neapolitan Very nice and well balanced. Only thing i hated about it was the difficult of getting enough prosciutto with every bite. Not exactly a pizza friendly ingredient but...what ever..file it under First World Problems. Very balanced and i enjoyed the layers of flavors from the order of toppings, to cheese, to dough. Noticed half a slice in that there was no sauce. My first reaction to this was 'well...why not?' then i started to realize that adding a sauce would have added another layer of flavor and it was just perfect without it. Apart from the cheese, i was thoroughly impressed with the crust and dough in general. Granted it's not as crispy as i'd like it but it did have a fresh taste to it as well as a decent chewy texture. There was no discarded crusts at this table we ate it all.Overall the ingredients are just top-notch. I dont know exactly where their cheese comes from but i'd love to brush my teeth with it.As real and authentic as it gets!!  As good as it gets!!Terri R and I were planning our next meal together and when she found out that I haven't had a good pizza in at least 3 years, she gave me a choice of 3 different places out here.  Not knowing where to go (remember I haven't had a good pizza in awhile), Terri suggested Due Forni.When it comes to pizza in general, you have your branded commercialized choices (i.e. Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, etc), NY Style, Chicago deep dish, and the authentic stuff.  Due Forni is the authentic stuff for sure.Their easy one page menu, descriptions of the pizzas, and the pictures from other Yelpers immediately reminded me of my last visit in Italy.  I even knew what to expect; a thin crusted, a little runny, and a very tasty pizza that wasn't overwhelmingly saucy. If I got anything different, I would be disappointed.  We chose the Quattro Formaggi which consisted bufala mozzarella (cheese from water buffalo milk), ricotta, parmesan, and fontina fontal (cheese from cow milk).  Your crust choices are Napoletana (cooked in their 900 degree oven, result is a chewy crust with crispy outside) or their Romana (cooked in their 500 degree oven result is a thin and crispy pizza).  We got the Napoletana and it was simply delicious.  The pizza was just what I expected and exactly what I've experienced in Italy itself.  The inside decor, seating, and colors even reminded me of some restaurants in Firenze.Service was great and the waitress took the time to give me, since I am the noob here, a detailed description of everything on the menu.  She also reminded us that we can add any type of topping on our pizza of choice.  Authentic pizza without the European prices equals a perfect a deal. You really can't go wrong with Due Forni if authentic pizza is your thing.  If you enjoy the Americanized branded pizza, Chicago Style or New York Style, then Due Forni may or might not be for you.  But if you ever experienced a pizza the way it's suppose to be made and loved it, then Due Forni is a can't miss, a must try, and as good as it gets.  Visit again or bookmark it, you can' go wrong.PS: Thanks Terri R.  Pizza slump cured!!!500 or 900 degrees.  60 or 180 seconds.  Yup, great Italian style pizza.The pizzas.  Two styles of crust made from a lightly salted, uber elastic dough.  The pizza Romana has a distinct crispier bottom crust,  the pizza Napolitana a chewier crust with blistered / blackened edges.  Personally, I like the bitterness from the blackened edges.  Note: as the pizzas cool, the texture becomes the same.  Refrigerator or AC chilled slices in the middle of the night don't cut it.Tried them all.  The quality topping combinations work well, there is just too much of it.  All the excessive "stuff" obscures the crust and isn't that the point of using these special ovens?  That said, the simplest is the best (the Margherita - San Marzano tomato, bufala mozzarella, fresh basil).It's not just about the pizzas.  Great starters including the roasted beet salad (roasted beets, arugula, goat cheese, pistachios, basil pesto and drizzled with a fig vincotto).  A contrast in sweet, tangy, nutty, earthy flavors and textures.  Delish!  Do not pass up the polipo (braised octopus topped with a mint vinaigrette).  Fork tender with the perfect "octopussy" flavor (sweet, salty, briny, oceanic goodness).The mozzarella bar a nice touch.  Three selections (classic bufala, smoked, and stracciatella - soaked in heavy cream) offered with various sides and pizza bread.  The classic pairs well with marinated artichokes.  The sour notes of the brine make the sweet milk flavor come alive.50 plus Italian / Italian varietal wines by the glass.  Nice pours, prices are fair.  Friendly, off the Strip service.  Bottom line, Due Forni makes it easy to have a good time.I have been wanting to try Due Forni for a while so I was glad to finally try it. Here they offer pizza, appetizers, salads, mozzarella bar and have a selection of wines.  They have 2 different ovens for 2 different types of pizza. The "Neapolitan" had a crust that is more soft and thick and the "Roman" had a crust that is thin and crispier. Since I was here having lunch with a fellow yelper who has been here several times, I asked her suggestions as far as portion size and what was good. She said the pizza was huge and filling so we decided to split a pizza and salad. I can't remember the name of the salad, but it was the special of the day and delicious. The figs were very tasty and I'm usually not a fan of arugula however everything paired well and tasted great. Then came time for the pizza. We ordered the "Quattro Formaggi" priced at $15.99 with the roman crust. This pizza had buffalo mozzarella, parmesan, fontina fontal and ricotta on it which made for one cheesy delight. All the cheeses were perfect together and tasted very good. This pizza usually comes white, but we requested red sauce made with san marzano tomatoes be added and the sauce is boss! The crust however I wasn't a fan of. I found the roman crust very chewy and tough to eat so I would try this pizza with the neapolitan crust next time. Another thing is I was still hungry when the bill came so I wouldn't share again since I could have easily eaten 3 pieces of the pizza and all of the salad *oink oink*. Service was great and I will definitely come back to Due Forni. **Happy Hour is from 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm 7 days a week** Current HH menu: $5-Oven Baked Goat Cheese-Dates Skewer-Meatballs-Gnocchi-Vegetarian Flat BreadI really can't say I was impressed -- especially not impressed when comparing it to my beloved Settebello. I came here on a Saturday night with some friends. Molly was kind enough to make reservations for us because some reviews mention that it was an absolute must. That was not the case. The restaurant was about 3/4 empty. It is a very elegant restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. They were patient with us while we waited for out fourth person to arrive. In the meantime I opted for a Moretti beer, he brought me a Hefeweizen (about $3 more). I can't speculate on whether this was intentional or a simple oversight, but it still annoyed me. We started off with a Capraccio appetizer (thin sliced prime beef, arugula, pine nuts, parmesan, cremini mushrooms, black truffle) - for $11.95 it did nothing for me. It actually was fairly tasteless even though I was hungry.We then opted to share three pizzas --Due Forni, Bianca Al Prosciutto Cotto, and Prosciutto E Rucola. That was roughly $50 worth of pizza alone. Had it been as amazing as people rave it to be I would not have minded this price tag, but it was not. The neapolitan crust was still too thin and hard without too much flavor. Everyone had piles of crust left on their plates and that says a lot. When Molly and I go to Settebello for our neapolitan pizza fix, you can bet your life there will not be a drop of that pizza left. For the price, this place just isn't worth it. The service was fine, the food was adequate but overpriced, and I would not go out of my way to dine here again.We popped in for dinner one night after the gym. It's located in south Summerlin off of town center, across from the gardens park. The restaurant itself has a great feel. It's pretty casual and comfortable. The music... Well that needs some help... Really weird melodies playing on a Monday night:/ We were greeted at the door by a very friendly and well dressed older man. I'm assuming he is the manager. He held the door and sat us promptly. We opted for patio seating and I was so glad we did! The patio is covered with fans to help keep it cool. The seating was comfortable and the tables were sturdy. Our server was nice. He told us about the menu and went over the beers and wines. I ordered a red blend, nothing fancy... Still tasty though. My boyfriend and I opted to split the beet salad (made vegan) and the veggie gluten free pizza (also prepared vegan). I'm not one to complain... But... $4.95 extra to prepare a small 8inch pizza gluten free is just a tad bit pushing my limits. Our pizza was around 23.00 dollars after tax. It was pretty delicious though. I would order it again... When I want to splurge on pizza. The veggies were fresh And the dough was not overly spongey or crisp. We did mention sharing the beet salad... And they split it for is on two plates (nice gesture) ;) It was really good. One of my favorite beet salads thus far... The pistachios added a great crunch. Our friend ordered a chicken Caesar salad. It was a pretty standard portion... Not very difficult to mess up... He said it was good. The server gave us our bill without an itemized (something I really despise). I like to look over everything on the tab. I can not tell you how many times I've been over charged, under charged, didn't receive add Ins I was charged for, and auto grated on tabs I would of really just never questioned without the itemized. If I could knock half of a star for this... I would. Overall, it was a good experience and we will definitely be back.
German Bread Bakery=What a little gem of a find this bakery is! I was in the parking lot headed to Subway when I noticed it. I thought I would stop in and see what they had for bread. I was surprised at the appetizing variety of goodies they had!I got a "Apple Danish" and a "Bear Claw" to enjoy for dessert :)They were so tasty! I wish I noticed this place before but now I can at least stop in and get a danish after eating my healthy Subway right?! *wink wink*The store was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful.Items Selected:Bear ClawBee Sting CakePretzel CroissantApple StrudelAlmond TwistOwned and operated by two of the most pleasant ladies I've yet to encounter in Las Vegas one would be hard pressed to name a more 'authentic' ethic destination in the city - Asian, European, Latin American, or otherwise.  Featuring a wide variety of baked goods and imports both sweet and savory straight out of Deutschland at prices representing a veritable bargain compared to many of the area's artisan bakeries it was plain on entry to the small shop that things were bound to be good when I heard staff and patrons communicating nearly exclusively in German and with no less than two dozen offerings available the only difficulties presented by German Bread Bakery was not ordering too much...eventually settling on a mere five selections at a total of $10.89.  Focused on the classics, particularly those most familiar to me growing up to a Hungarian-German heritage, it was with an apple strudel that my tasting began and reheated quickly in the microwave I'd strongly suggest others do the same, the result a light trickle of butter running from the flaky dough as fresh apples and light sweetness found balance in hefty cinnamon notes and delicate pastry.  Moving next to two almond options it was perhaps an effect of my 2pm arrival that the sole remaining bear claw was found to be a bit doughy though the frangipane was well utilized and moving on to the laminated layers of the almond twist I'd wager that no better exists in the city, a light glaze overlying toasted almonds as each shattering bite made a mess of my table and floor, a similar result found in the signature 'pretzel croissant' as buttery salted layers gave way to a soft crumb speckled with seeds and flavors harkening the Bavarian classic but ever more delicate.  Last but certainly not least, my final taste of German Bread Bakery on this day was the classic Bienenstich - a dish rarely found but always astounding when done well and in this case done perfectly with light vanilla pastry cream proving a marvelous balance to rich almond/honey/butter crunch topping all anchored by the yeasty yellow cake - a must order more than worth a trip to both fans and those (unfortunately) not yet familiar.Beesting cake and pretzel croissants. You're welcome.Just about everything is phenomenal here, and I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong no matter what you get, but the two items above are my favorites.Staff is super friendly: if you don't know what to get, they're happy to suggest some items and explain what's in the different pastries. Don't forget to check the discount table for 30% off of day-old bread loaves.Pricing is super reasonable and quality is astounding. Location is a bit of a drive for me, but I'll go out of my way to come here. Heads up that sometime they forget to turn on their OPEN light, but they are open til 2PM on Sundays.This is a must visit Bakery. Located in the Smiths shopping center on Lake Mead and Rampart, The German Bakery is addicting. The hubby is from Germany so when I found out about this little hidden gem i knew I had to surprise him with a treat. I ordered a Cherry Strudel, German Cheesecake, Nugat, and pretzel. Me being allergic to gluten unfortunately I was not able to try anything but he ate everything in 1 day. If i would have bought more he would have eaten that too haha.He said everything was very traditional in German baking. Not too sweet like a lot of American bakeries. He even went back the next day... Ive created a monster!There really isn't not much you can write about a small German bakery considering all they offer is German pastries and pretzels. Me and Ellen F. came here after a hearty breakfast next door and decided we weren't finished stuffing ourselves yet. We've been here several times and we always get pretzels and pretzels rolls, they are to die for! These are some of the most authentic German pretzels I've had since I've been to Munich. They are cooked just right and have just enough salt on them that isn't too much. Along with the pretzels I also get a Berliner which is equally awesome. Good amount of powdered sugar and not stingy on the filling, these are puffy so to me you get more bang for the buck so to say. The lady that helped us is always friendly and courteous. She was extremely patient while I picked which Berliner I wanted from their glass display and rang us up promptly. If you like German pastries or snacks this is the spot to go to, there aren't to many in town.Though my visit to the German Bread Bakery was brief lasting only about 5 minutes, it was a good 5 minute first impression.  I was struck first by the smell of fresh baked goods.  I love that smell.  It reminds me of growing up when I would bake with my mom and my grandma.  Especially around the holidays.There was nobody up front when I first walked in but the lady came out almost right away and asked how she could help me.  She was not a Chatty Kathy but not unfriendly either.  Just very professional with her answers in a German accent.  I asked her about a couple of things and told her it was my first time to the shoppe.  She told me about the bee sting cake which I had heard about through Yelp.  I was already leaning towards trying that and she just pushed me a little closer to the decision.  Close enough that it was decided and I ordered one of those.  I also was eyeing the rum balls.  I like rum and I like chocolate so that was a no brainer.  I ordered one of those as well.  Next thing I know I was being rung up ($4 and change) and instructed to keed the bag on its side so that the sweets inside would not get all messed up.I took these treats home with me and broke into the rum ball first.  It was the smaller of the two and I was kind of full from lunch an hour earlier.  This was the perfect size for a mid day dessert.  The first thing I notice is that it does not appear to be baked at all.  It seems almost like under cooked brownies with some grit.  Not in a bad way at all.  Infact, I loved it 100%.  I looked up some recipes to see exactly what it was.  The best I can figure is chocolate, sugar, butter, ground hazel nuts, and rum.  Perhaps even some toasted coconut.  There aint nothin' wrong with that.  It was so good.  A little sweet.  A little drunk.  Divinely evil.I tried the bee sting cake later in the day for my after dinner dessert.  I was only going to have a few bites of what was actually a rather big piece of cake.  That plan was quickly tossed aside after the first bit proved too much to ignore.  It was not overly sweet as I expected it to be.  The cake is more of a yeast bread and is a little dry compared to traditional cake.  There are two layers of this baked good with a Bavarian cream in the middle.  On the top is a caramelized almond cap with honey.  That is where the bulk of the sweetness seemed to be but even that was not too sweet.  It was just right.  Before I knew it the entire piece was gone and I found myself wanting more.  I love almonds. honey and Bavarian cream.  This is like a trifecta of goodness.I will have to go back for some other baked goods.  Like pretzels and rolls.  There are many other desserts to try as well.  It may take me a few more visits to try it all.  Oh darn the luck.Since moving to Las Vegas in June my husband and I have made the most interesting and serendipitous discoveries!! We were driving from the Ace Hardware on Cheyenne toward the Dog Supply Outlet on Sahara today and a teenager was spinning a sign at the northwest corner of Rampart and Lake Mead near the Smith's. The sign said German Bakery with an arrow. I got the young man's attention and he confirmed it was in this shopping center.We did a safe but rapid turn around to get back to the bakery. (as safe as a Bulgarian-German who was up late last night and did not have lunch can do at 1pm...)We found the bakery and it had some of his mother's family's traditional berliner pastries, cherry cake, crispy sandwich rolls, cinnamon and raisin rolls, chocolate and almond corner bars, and almond marzipan pastries. My husband's eyes were glazed over and he started relating all the familiar items to the very sweet woman at the counter. She is warm and welcoming and very helpful. I love it when a storekeeper truly appreciates the visitors who chose to come to her shop. There was an older woman there whose mother in law had made the same German delicacies and she too was very excited to have her first visit to the bakery.We slithered out to the car with our treasures and gobbled down one of the almond marzipan pastries plus a cinnamon roll. Oh how fresh they are! This is truly a great find.Well now I have no worries where my husband goes when I am working from home because he is either at the dog park or at the German Bread Bakery.  We cannot wait for the Christmas goodies either!!Lovely lady, lovely bakery and amazing pastries. I came here this morning to pick up some goodies for my work. As soon as you walk in, you get excited. The smell is amazing! They have all sorts of breads, pastries, desserts, etc. I got an assortment of pastries - poppy coffee cake, almond coffee cake, cinnamon roll, chocolate croissant, etc. My branch is crazy about them! Everything is so soft and you can tell it's fresh. Love this place! I can't wait to go back to try more things.
Grimaldi's Pizzeria=This is one of those spots I would probably deem a 3.5 if there were half star options, but since there aren't, I decided that it was worth rounding up. I got the chance to check out the newest Grimaldi's while on the way to a graduation party. We wanted a casual atmosphere in North Scottsdale and decided Grimaldi's was it! It was around 6 PM on a Saturday and we got a seat on the patio right away without a wait. The decor of Grimaldi's has the same vibe as the others but with a North Scottsdale feel to it. They have split patios that hold about six-ten tables each. Red checkered table clothes line the tables and apparently they are even on hand for for customer's who get chilly. Seriously, I saw a customer eating at a table while wrapped in one of the red checkered table clothes. I really liked the private room they have with about six tables and big enough for a group of probably 15-20. For those who want to drink their dinner, they also have a bar in the front with bar seats. Moving on to the food, this is the same Grimaldi's food as other places. We started with the Cesar Salad which tasted like your typical Cesar Salad. For the entree, we went for a sausage, mushroom and pepperoni pizza. Now the only problem I have with the pizza is that sometimes it doesn't have enough cheese or sauce, so to fix that we asked for extra cheese and sauce and that absolutely helped! I really like the pizza but only when I eat it at the restaurant. Every time I get the pizza to go it gets cold and loses the taste. This is a great addition to the Scottsdale Quarter and I think it adds a family atmosphere option to the area. Parking here is such a hassle though that I will probably stick to the Old Town location for the most part, but when I'm in the area, I will definitely keep this as an option.Mmmmm...  garlic!A recent Sunday afternoon found us wandering around the Scottsdale Quarter.  It was around 3pm, and many of the restaurants were in the lull between lunch and dinner - a great opportunity to try the newest Grimaldi's location without a crowd.  It is no secret that I am a fan of pizza.  While I am typically a 'pepperoni and mushroom' kind of girl, having visited the Grimaldi's DC Ranch location I knew exactly what to get - the White with Garlic pizza.  It is a simple sauceless combination of flavorful cheese and garlic.  Lots of garlic.  And that is a good thing.We ordered the large, which proved to be much bigger than expected - it nearly covered the entire high-top bar table, making it interesting to juggle plates, pizza, wine (house Montepulciano) and water glasses.  Hey, there are worse problems to have!I look forward to enjoying more of that coal-fired garlicy goodness soon!
1947 Tavern=Full Disclosure: My brother works here. Lucky for you, he tried to drown me when I was four years old, so I would never let that influence my review. If anything, I would dock them a star or two for employing someone who would so callously throw a toddler into a pond.* But I'm far too levelheaded to let anything like that color my judgment, or to hold a grudge for twenty-something years. Anyway. I could drink here all night. Because I like this bar. 1947 is a simple space. The decor is all dark wood and back-lit bottles, and the vibe is warm and friendly. There's a long bar that runs the length of the space, and as far as I can tell, it's all about the whiskey. I appreciate that they've got at least 25 different bourbons back there, and that the bartenders will mix you a mean Manhattan with any one of them. I haven't had a chance to try any of the food yet, but I did see a man going to town on a burger I gladly would've stolen, and the mac & cheese smelled amazing. Either way, a fireplace and lots and lots of bourbon was all I really wanted anyway.  Although, as a general rule, lots of alcohol and no food can lead to you making an ass out of yourself. I know a guy that once vomited directly onto the shoes of a police officer. Definitely wasn't me. I don't care what you heard.__________*It was a lot like this: http://whatshouldwecallme.tumblr.com/post/19239895670/my-relationship-with-my-siblingsWe headed out here after my bff's birthday dinner this past weekend. It was my first time at 1947, and I was pleasantly surprised. Inside, the restaurant itself has a bar area, booths and a long table...during our visit a group of at least 14 or 16 people came in and were seated in the middle of the restaurant at the long table. So, pro: they can accommodate large groups; con: it's right in the middle of the place so difficult to maneuver around people.Since it was a nice night, we opted to sit outside in the 'beer garden'. Place is cute and comfortable. I can't comment on the food, because we just had some drinks. I usually just go for a beer, cause I'm a simple gal, but I chose to get a frozen bourbon lemonade with framboise (which was lemonade and raspberry) because it just sounded so good. And it was! But, it was super sweet....so, for me, one was enough. Our waitress accidentally made my friend the wrong drink so she gave us a second frozen bourbon for free and I could only get a few sips down. Anyways, prices seemed reasonable, the staff were friendly...overall a decent experience. Due to the positive reviews on their meals, I would definitely come back for dinner!My first time at 1947 Tavern was a little mixed.  The drinks were good, but I found the service to not only be inattentive but downright rude.  So when my friends and I headed there after having dinner I was a little suspect, but I noticed they had their Biergarten open and we really wanted to sit outside so no brainer we headed toward the door. We were greeted by a very fun and colorful hostess/server.  He was upbeat and kind of dancing there as we came in.  I asked if we could sit outside stating it was my birthday.  He happily went out to find a table and treated me very nicely saying anything for the birthday girl!  It was cute.  The outside is very quaint, but open, I liked it a lot.  The other server working was also just as friendly.  My girlfriend and I started off with a frozen Bourbon Lemonade with Framboise, where as the men ordered a couple beers.  They were very refreshing but also very, very sweet.  I couldn't drink another so I ordered a Manhattan (shocker).  I asked for the Manhattan and she accidently brought another Bourbon Lemonade.  I said quickly that I wanted a Manhattan.  She apologized and went to take it away then said, just take this and I will bring your Manhattan.  That worked out great, since my girlfriend was drinking the same thing, though she couldn't finish both either, just really over-the-top sweet.  1947 Tavern proved to be a great stop on Saturday.  With great service, nice atmosphere, good drinks, and best friends, I can't ask for much more than that.I visited 1947 Tavern this evening with a friend for happy hour.  We were looking for a non-dive bar in Shadyside with a good happy hour, and 1947 fit the bill.For drinks, my friend and I both ordered frozen bourbon lemonades ($3, HH price).  My friend described this drink as an alcoholic slushee, and she was right on!  The texture reminded me of water ice, but was finer and melted more easily.  The flavor was quite sweet, though, and lacked the characteristic tartness of lemon water ice.  I couldn't taste any distinct bourbon flavor, but it was definitely there, given that my head started to tingle after drinking the last third of the drink.For food, I ordered the mac and cheese, which was half off for happy hour ($4.50, HH price).  Although it wasn't the best mac and cheese I've had, it wasn't bad.  I particularly enjoyed the noodles, which consisted of Fede pasta, according to the menu.  Thanks to the crispy top, the cheese sauce had interesting textural variation, but its flavor was mediocre.  If you're looking for a good mac and cheese, I recommend Harris Grill's across the street.  Unfortunately, I don't believe that they discount it for happy hour like 1947 does, though.Overall, my experience at 1947 was solid 3.5 star quality.  The HH prices were right, but the drinks and food leave room for improvement.  We sat at the bar, and service from the bartender was great, despite being the only customers for awhile.  If you're in the neighborhood and are looking for an alternative to the Harris Grill, consider giving 1947 a try.
Tommy V's Urban Kitchen & Bar=If you blindfolded me and put me inside this modern, newly renovated space, I would never guess that it used to be Cafe Carumba or Jacqueline's!  OK - maybe I would, but only because of the layout... they did a great job urbanizing and upgrading this restaurant!I went in for an early dinner with friends recently and was pleasantly surprised by the new decor, service, and of course, the food.  Being welcomed by Zoran, the Operating Partner of Tommy V's, and former GM of the (now closed) Estate House, was a treat as well.Service was top notch as our party of five made our way through a variety of menu items family style.  Highlights for me included the following:-Legume Spinach Soup (lentils, beans, garbanzo, spinach, vegetable stock) - I know it sounds very healthy and boring, but it was delicious!-Manila Clams Linguine (a tad on the buttery side, but I didn't mind)-Spinach Ricotta Ravioli-Veal Parisienne (I'm not usually a veal person, but I enjoyed this breaded preparation)-Grilled Asparagus (you can never eat enough veggies)-Potato-Hazelnut Truffle SouffleAnd, finally, we shared a dessert plate, but I think I ate the majority of the lemon dessert that was served with fresh strawberries.  I don't know what exactly it was, but Baby M was all about it!I noticed Tommy V's "happy hour menu," served Monday - Friday from 11am - 6:30pm a little late in the game, (it includes a solid variety of $5 wines and discounted appetizers), but I plan on returning soon to check that out.We decided to come to Tommy V's because of some of the reviews from Yelp friends.  I don't know if I should thank you or curse you,  I am supposed to still be on my Hcg diet, so I was not having anything.  However, my hubby decided he was doing the Restaurant Week dinner.  It looked amazing, so I took a little bite of his beet salad, ohh, perfectly roasted golden and red beets with arugula and goat cheese.  Then he had the Eggplant Torta, OMG, it reminded me of the Melanzana (italian for the Eggplant Torta) my daddy and I used to make on Sundays, I had three bites.  Then it came the Lemon Torte, my willpower caved and I had to have two bites.  I guess I will have to go on the treadmill a little longer this week.  Michael behind the bar was fantastic.  I had a taste of a few wines before settling for the Heavyweight Cabernet.  Zoran, stopped by to say hello, we have something in common, he also has twins.   I can't wait to come back with friends and have the Eggplant Torta again.My husband is going to need a second job to support my love affair with Tommy V's.  Love the new decor (clean and modern) and the staff.  Our visits were almost 2 weeks apart, and we were surprised that not only did the bartender (Lisa) remember us but remembered what we had to drink!And the food...Fantastic happy hour that sadly runs only Mon-Fri and is really more of a lunch menu with salads, pasta dishes, and sandwiches.  The very happy hour menu offers select $5 apps, $5 well & wine, and beer specials.  First time we shared the short rib sliders from the $5 menu as well as risotto carbonara and smoked salmon bruschetta. While the bruschetta was perfectly fine, it was the only thing that didn't wow me.  The sliders (2) were worth twice their price tag and the risotto was incredible with pancetta, parmigiano, and peas.  Weekends offer only the dinner menu.  My husband had the grilled shrimp risotto (yes, he's into risotto thanks to all the Hell's Kitchen viewing this summer).  Although a little pricey ($18), it was well worth it.  Because good things come in threes, I had the hand-made pasta trio ($19):  mushroom and mascarpone tortelli; brie and asiago gnocchi in a brown butter sauce, and spinach ricotta ravioli.  The only bad thing about this dish was I had to offer my husband a bite of each.My diet had been going so well, too.  What a shame it's all over.  See you soon Tommy.02/07/12Met up w/ Violeta for happy hour today, and what a nice change in atmosphere from former Cafe Carumba's!  I really liked the all-glass wine closet display behind the host's desk- what a nice touch!  Cool indoor atmosphere/vibe, as well.  I wouldn't mind spending more happy hours here in the future.I was hungry and thirsty, so I ordered two apps, the short rib sliders and roasted butternut squash ravioli w/ brown butter sage sauce, and a glass of their white wine blend, which had a bit of moscato in it.  Everything was very good!  I'd order all three again, most definitely.  Especially the ravioli and the glass of white blend.  :DHmm... I'm thinking another happy hour here is going on my calendar soon!
BeeGee Kitchen=Little chunks of dead animal bits on bamboo sticks with seasonings thrown on it then left on a fire for a few minutes...SMART!!Cool new place for Yakitori, a pretty decent selection at decent prices for a decent size. What's not so decent: The flavor. Plenty of deliciousness if you know what to orderLamb - Not very gamey (i like gamey), good fat to meat ratio. lightly dusted with cumin after it's grilled. Very niceChicken Thigh - Not dry, generously seasoned, damn tastyChicken Gizzard - a table favorite, ate over 6 of theseChicken Hearts - they've been butterflied and are slightly on the dry side but not to the point where they're hard and chewy, still perfectly tenderChicken Cartilage - I assumed it was going to be the cartilage from the breast since other places i've been to served it that way. Instead i received the cartilage from the joint of what i'm assuming to be the drumlet. This is a hit or miss depending on personal preference, for me it was a miss as i was expecting something else.Beef - I think it's the ribeye skewer, honestly didnt compare to the others, ribeye is an excellent high quality cut of beef but in my opinion doesnt do very well in this application. chunks of boneless short ribs would have been my choiceScallop - What they lack in size they make up in flavor. these are DAMN TASTY and juicySalmon - SalmonFish Ball - mehBeef Ball - Whoa these are good, lightly brushed with some sauce they're slightly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Some good stuffShiitake Mushroom - Nicely seasoned rehydrated mushroom caps. Garlic Butter Mussels - Order the 12 piece...6 won't last. Passion Fruit Brain Freezer Slushy - Got this with the BeeGee mix which is the Lychee Jelly and the Passion Fruit Jelly. Very good on the size to cost ratio and even a better deal with paired with an entree. I like it better then Tea StationWhat i'd like to see on the menu:- Okra - Chicken Liver- Chicken Cartilage (from the breast)Overall Beegee has a lot of potential once it decides what it wants to be. The menu is part Tea Station part cheaper Ichiza (limited to the Yakitori obviously). The location itself takes advantage of the drive through but i wouldnt consider or recommend ordering anything drive through or take out. Yakitori is ment to be served within minutes of cooking it.Portion sizes are small and priceing is fair and out of everything we ordered there was nothing to complain about taste wise. Everything was nicely seasoned, sometimes overseasoned but not to the point where it was too overwhelming. I would LOVE to come here to snack and socialize. There's enough variety and flavor as well as an comfortable atmosphere to bring a few friends, order a bunch of dead animal parts and share a few laughs. Now if only beer was on the menu and instead of a closing time of 11pm it was adjusted to 1am...oh well wishful thinking.
DumplingHaus=I've been twice this month. A pretty good sign that I dig it. And although I've oft compared dumplings to lovely lady food, the place is filling. I will agree with many who've said the prices are high given the ingredients, but I'm happy to pay for things that take a gentle hand. I wouldn't dare try stuffing delicious meat and veg into a small pocket, sealing that up, then lightly pan frying it. No way. And so I'm glad someone else has it down. I do with the menu was more protein rich, but on my last trip, I discovered you can take whatever protein they have and add that to whatever dish you like. So for example, if the spicy noodles get you going but you'd like some chicken... ask them. They seem happy to accommodate.
Kitchen 56=I've been to Kitchen 56 for a couple of happy hours before and the experiences were probably about 3.5 star-worthy.  The outdoor patio is cute, the wine selection is decent, and the happy hour is better than the Vig's if you prefer wine over beer.  This solidly-decent streak was broken last night when seven of us showed up and were told there was no room for us on the patio.  Fine, we took a table in the dining room.  A manager stopped by to apologize for not being able to accomodate our desire to sit outdoors.  We forgave her.Our waiter was surly, telling us he was the one who was "forced" to help us.  I get that it was a wry joke (maybe!) but there was zero humor behind it, and he seemed more genuine than not.  He then informed us that we did not "qualify" for happy hour because we were not seated at the bar or on the patio.  He was so unapologetic that I thought he was joking.  We asked if we could have the special anyway as we were there specifically FOR happy hour and had intended to sit outside if the few tables had not already been taken.  He disappeared to ask and returned with a solid N-O.  We decided that this would not stand, and walked out as multiple members of the waitstaff and the manager watched, expressionless.  Guess they had already made too much money that day and didn't have any more room for ours.The dining room was empty, by the way.  WTF mate?  Seven of us could easily have racked that tab up to $200 in drinks alone, if only they had let us partake of their flimsy happy hour deals (which do not include food specials) for the one hour that was remaining of the special.  Real nice, Kitchen 56.  REAL NICE.They really deserve one star for that as my previous experiences weren't exactly shining examples of service, but, unlike the staff at Kitchen 56, I am feeling a little generous today.The four of us were piled in my brothers car, I grabbed shot gun, as I'm instinctively want to do, quickly plopped into the passenger seat, only to have my little sister backhand the crown of my skull from the rear seat. "Let Mom sit there dick!" she said peevishly "Whose birthday is it again?" my brother chimed in. I let out a groan and climbed out, my mother and I exchanged positions.She sat down next to my brother in the front, as I cast a sidelong glance at my sister. "SO! Where are we going?" My mother asked impatiently.  "It's YOUR birthday, where do you feel like eating??" I asked annoyed. "Oh I don't mind, where do you kids feel like eating?"My brothers knuckles tightnened on the steering wheel, my sister and I exchanged glances and rolled our eyes. We three knew this could go on all night, and the further we pushed her the more she wouldnt budge. I knew personally that the blame would fall on me. Being I am the oldest, and the birthday dinner/movie was my idea. I scrambled in my brain cataloging the bookmarks of places I thought she might deign to eat at."FEZ? Maybe FilmBAR aftertward..?" Weeks earlier I'd made this suggestion to which she responded enthusiastically; and true to her nature, the day her birthday rolls around she's completely forgotten we even spoke about this. I began the routine again. "Fez?" I ask. My sister groans, my brother is silent. "Mmmmm nah.." my mother mused. "How about Durants, we could..." "OH NO NO!! Too expensive!" she said in abject horror cutting me short. "Whaat..? No they're not.." my brother pleaded my case, he obviously wanted steak. "Yeah!" I concurred almost getting offended "I could buy us all filet mignons and a bottle of red wine for under $100!!" I boasted. "No you couldnt." my mother said defiantly. We argued over the price of steak at full volume, my mother screeching at me from the front seat, my brother pivoting his head and joining in. My sister stared out the window until she was just too annoyed to contain her silent fury, a friday evening wasted with her brothers and mom was almost too much to bear.  "LETS JUST DRIVE UNTIL WE FIND A PLACE" she commanded in an imperious voice unfitting of a 14 year old girl. We drove on in silence, passing one good restaurant after another as the street numbers climbed higher and higher. I was quickly outta my element. We came up to 56th st. and The 56 Kitchen stood out like a neon monolith, hewn from rock by the brawn  and sweat of men long dead, it stood there in the distance like it was born to host our evening repast. We all knew, without saying, that this would be our destination. My brother pulled up the car and we wordlessly agreed and filed into the restaurant like a mock execution. The 56 Kitchen. I'd never heard of it, not even the merest bleep on Yelp, yet here it stood. I wondered afterward how a place so tasty could be so far off my radar, it wasnt even, to borrow that piece of shit Guy Frieri's phrase, a 'diner, drive-in, or dive'.  We all ordered like champions, ironically only my Mother's dish wasnt very good. We started with appetizers of "drunk bread" and some hot cakes with pulled pork. The hot cakes were a def. crowd pleaser, the "drunk bread" was..interesting, and while not bad, was...eccentric.  I ordered an "Arcadia Pie", a tasty artisan style thin crust with leeks, bacon, and big dollops of ricotta. My brother ordered a bowl of housemade Pepperdelle style pasta with a creamy pork gravy. My sister opted for the house mac 'n cheese with a side salad. Mum ordered a pizza that my lil' sis' described as a "totino's frozen pizza", underwhelming but tasty and edible none the less. We ordered beers and sat and leisurely enjoyed our meals, sharing from one anothers plates, I ended up eating most of everyones, and even finishing off my brothers pasta in the car, his dish was the obvious winner. When the dust settled the damage came to about $90 some odd dollars. Mother let out a hyperbolic gasp, and I nearly had to find smelling salts, bro and I split the bill down the middle and we all drove back home.Meh! =I Totally neutral is how I left Kitchen 56.  We arrived with reservations and were promptly sat at a high top table in the middle of the restaurant. I was surprised to see It was pretty busy for 8PM on a Friday.  Our server greeted us very briefly and took Hottie's drink order (I wanted to look over the menu) and then left. He seemed pretty frazzled.  About 5 minutes later our drinks were dropped off by someone else, who did not ask if we needed anything.  Another 5 Minutes pass and a female server comes to our table and asks if we are ready to order. No, "Hi my name is"... "let me tell you about the menu", nothing!  I told her I would like to order a drink and she seemed annoyed, like I was being rude.  She took my drink order and our appetizer order and left.  We started with the Onion straws, a little greasy but overall pretty tasty especially because the sauce was fantastic.  For my cocktail I had a Maple Manhattan, which was so delicious one of the best Manhattan's I've had.   For dinner I ordered their tofu and vegetable stir fry with Soba Noodles. This had received good reviews from fellow yelpers so I was excited to try it.  I was greatly disappointed. The noodles were over cooked, it had no flavor except ginger and there were no vegetables in it except red cabbage.  I never send anything back, but I did. This of course took about 10 minutes, because our server never came back to check on us. I flagged down a manager and she suggested the green chili macaroni.  By the time this came out, Hottie had already finished his meal and his plate had been taken. This kind of kills the dining experience.  When the macaroni came out, it was much better, great flavor and just the right amount of creaminess and spice. Again the noodles were a little over cooked; they were breaking apart, but still edible. Overall, the service was pretty poor, but being a former Server I could tell that they were all "In the weeds" so I gave her a break, and still left a 30% tip.  The food was good, but not great.  I think I would try Kitchen 56 again under the right circumstances, but with so many other options in the area, it won't be anytime soon.Totally disappointed on so many levels with this place.  I went there last night  excited to finally try the place since I drive past it on my way to and from work everyday.  When it is all lit up at night it just seems so inviting.  I was meeting a friend to talk business and we arrived a bit before 830. My experience started off bad and just went downhill from there.  When we walked in all the booths were taken but none of the tables in the dining room nor the 2 tables along the back wall that each seat 6 but have the comfy booth seats on one side.  We asked to be seated there but was told they needed to keep them open in case a large party came in.  Seriously?   It was a Wednesday night at 830, there would have been plenty of seating if a party larger than our meager 2 top came in.  Strike 1.Next our server Lissa did come by quickly to ask if we wanted to order, we asked for a few minutes.  I also asked what the soup of the day was, butternut squash, mmmmm! Those few minutes turned into more than a few and another server asked if we needed anything and ended up taking our order.  I ordered the soup and tuna tartar.  Lissa then came back to the table to inform us that they were out of the soup of the day.  Strike 2.  I order a side of vegetables instead.Lissa refills my water glass, brownie points for that, but spills some not only on the table but my hand.  She doesn't apologize, clean it up, nothing, just walks away.  Strike 3.My companion gets the edamame, which were not bad but the bowl that they were served in had a serious chip on the rim.  It was bad enough to cut someone if you weren't careful.  Strike 4.My tuna tartar was pretty terrible, a few chunks of chewy fish that were somewhat grey in color hidden among some greens that had way to many capers which made it super salty,  I ate a little less than half of it because I was so hungry and didn't want to deal with sending it back.  Strike 5.Next up the sorry ass, poor excuse for a side of vegetables,  When Lissa set down in front of me this tiny dish with wilted spinach and 1 piece of squash that was quartered and 1 piece of zucchini that was quartered I couldn't believe it.  There was a layer of spinach water at the bottom and it tasted like it was seasoned with Mrs. Dash.  Again I ate it because I was starving but realizing that each bite basically cost me a dollar, it was 5 bucks. Strike 6.Not even done yet......At 9:30 Lissa asks us if we want anything else, my companion informs her that her boyfriend will be joining us in a few minutes to get some dinner.  We are informed that the kitchen is closed.  There were still people in the place and from what I gathered from the website the kitchen closes "when the party is over."  So now my companion is on Yelp trying to find another place to go meet him so he can eat,  Strike 7.She finds a place not far and is going to meet her man by 10 because we still had some business to discuss.  I said she could just go so he didn't have to wait but always the professional, she stayed so we could wrap up our meeting.At 945 some people walk in, are seated and given menus.  I ask the server that helped them, a very nice gentleman, if they were going to be eating because we were told the kitchen was closed.  He went and checked and apologized for the mix-up but the kitchen was still open.  Strike 8.  I wish that guy was our server because he was great. I also see him speak to Lissa, who glances at our table but she never comes over herself to apologize.  I think she was in a hurry to clock out.  Strike 9When Lissa brings us our bill, the soup that they were out of, was still on it.  When I point this out to her she states since I got the side of vegetables, which wasn't on the bill, she just left the soup in place of it.  First, from a management prospective, you have to keep track of everything that is served to figure out your food and production cost.  Second, it was just plain laziness to not correct the bill.  Strike 10.Furthermore the soup was 7 and the vegetables 5, a cost difference that I pointed out to her.  She said she would take care of it.  She brings back the bill and say, "Ok they took a dollar off."  Are you kidding me?!  You can't subtract 5 from 7?!  Strike 11.I am so done with this place at this point I leave a chintzy $5 tip, I really wanted to leave nothing, but the old school server in me wouldn't allow it.  I left feeling cheated out of $70 and will never go back.
Mozart Cafe & Bakery=I stumbled into Mozart Cafe unexpectedly with twenty five minutes to spare mid-afternoon on a week day. I had pulled into the shopping area where my nail salon is and was positively ravenous. My eyes caught mention of "kosher, vegetarian and wifi" as I walked past the outdoor seating.I didn't mean to make an entrance. Conversation stopped as an orderly room of eyes peered up at me. I'm not quite sure what prompted it. I can only explain my observations of the patrons, and then my wonderful dining experience. My only regret is that I was short on time and couldn't linger. The food was fresh, delightful, prepared efficiently fast as was my strong turkish coffee. As I stood in the entry way my first thought was, "Oh dear. Where am I? Should I be here?" Stunned silence filled the room. I felt shy looking for a hostess. (I wasn't sure if I should approach the bakery counter, or seat myself. You can seat yourself.) I noticed women wearing head coverings, which ranged from scarfs, wigs to small hats. The men that day were wearing button down shirts.Seated, an incredibly gracious host helped select the Spicy Tunisian panini to go with soup. A complete steal for $8. (1/2 sandwich.) Albacore tuna (ala the style from my childhood), boiled eggs, kalamata olives, potato was presented on a crispy panini. Perfectly grilled. I enjoyed it so much I almost forgot to eat my large bowl of soup. The soup itself is worthy of a meal. Dining solo I was privy to the conversations in the room. Bits of French and German wafted my way. Patrons ordered loafs of kosher bread from the wall. The Torah was discussed.And then, just as I was wrapping up my meal, a gentleman right behind me. Clearly hailing from New York answered his phone.  (I'm from there and familiar with the accents.) "Yes Mom! YES. It's me. You called me, remember?"[Loudly]"Ok. OK. No. NO.You'll have to ask Ira to do that.I said IRA.Whaaat?Ok, never mind. I'll do it myself.I SAID. I'll call IRA. I'll Call IRA."So I think this is a place you can meet a nice Jewish boy.Some folk go broke from gambling, other folk go broke from indulging in luxury. I'ma be, I'ma be broke from eating out.  $7.00 for a small slice of old cheesecake. Daaayum! Well I was feeling a bit inebriated when I walked in, but I sobered up quick.It's hard to think of Mozart as a cafe because the menu offers breakfast and supper plates which include salmon, tilapia, pasta, and pizza dishes. There are also several choices of salads. It's a perfect - restaurant - for vegetarian and pescatarian foodies. Everything on the menu sounded good and I really wanted one of each item, but they would have had to lock me in overnight and return the next morning to find me still sitting there trying to finish eating.  Decisions...I went with a couple of easy prep sandwiches.The satisfying one:Sabich Pita ($11) - eggplant, potato, tomato, cucumber, hummus, tahini, mango curry sauce, sans egg- skimpy on the hummus- not like the mango curry- good tahini but it was light coloured and creamy as if something was mixed in.Couldn't get no satisfaction:Eggplant Chile Panini ($11) - eggplant, garlic, tomato, basil, chili sauce, parmesan - did not taste basil- did not taste chile sauce- did not taste parmesan- oily eggplantBoth sandwiches came with side salads made of fresh field greens and radish. Good salad, but didn't care much for the lemonish oily dressing. Would have prefered more tahini.
Ah Hai Sushi & Grill=I am always afraid to try out new Sushi restaurants, but thanks to a recommendation from a friend and some good Yelp reviews I decided to give Ah Hai a try. My son and I are the only ones in our family who like sushi so I persuaded him to come to lunch with me today since I had a Val-Pak coupon for 50% off a second lunch bento box. I really enjoyed the miso and salad that started off our meal. My only suggestion is maybe to order the dressing on the side since there was a pretty fair amount on there even though it was delicious. The bento lunch itself was pretty large and everything tasted very good and the California rolls tasted very fresh. In fact I can't wait to go back and try some of the rolls.They have a great happy hour as well and since this place is right around the corner from my house I am sure I will be back to give it a try.Food (from HH menu):Albacore Nigiri: 3.5 starsSmooth, good sized piece & tasty. Tuna Nirgiri: 3 starsFresh, no fishy smell / taste & good portion size.Salmon Skin Roll: 2.5 starsThere wasn't much salmon skin inside of the rolls but more rice surrounding all of the rolls than anything. Squid Salad: 3 starsThe squid in this salad tasted exactly like the squid salad mixture that Costco has, except this had extra greens on the bottom of the mixture.Dynamite Roll (Cali roll w/ baked crab on top): 3 starsThis had way too much rice & sauce on top which overwhelmed the whole roll. Overall: clean place with good atmosphere & good sized portioned food here. If you like rolls more than sashimi then you'll like this place. =)  Service: Very slow, they forgot to check on us during the meal & we had to wave them down several times for water. -1Tip:HH: M-F 4:30- ClosingSat & Sun: 3PM - Closing
DJ Hollywood's Pizza & Gyros=I just stumbled across this hidden jewel today by accident! I saw it and decided to walk in and grab a menu to check out their offerings. The smell was irresistible, I then decided I must order something and give them a try! I had my Sister and friends with me and we were hungry so it was the perfect time to taste some of the goods! We ordered the special $7.99 for a 16' pizza with one topping, so we ordered two an Italian sausage and a pepperoni. The toppings were generous and delicious! The sauce fresh and flavorful indeed! The crust was good as well, tasty with a nice consistency for all of you crust eaters! lol The restaurant is very hip and is a very comfortable environment to dine in and eat as well. Not only can you dine in and enjoy a meal, they also provide delivery and take out. The Owner is super nice, not to mention easy on the eyes! :) The staff is Amazing and friendly and the food is great! I can't wait to get back to try one of their strombolis or a gyro or a greek platter or sandwich! So many delicious options!Check this place out!!!!! They are new have only been around approximately 6 months or so. I will be back for sure!!!
Cook Out=My wife has become addicted to the Cook Out "peach cobbler" milkshake. So when I was visiting her near Uptown, I popped over to this Cookout to pick one up. Firstly, this is a sketch neighborhood. I did not feel at all comfortable here with a "bars on the windows" vibe. But the Cook Out itself is a bright shining diamond in this rough.As for the shake, she pronounced it "meh." Unimpressed with not enough peach in it and the few bits were too small.Note that there are TWO drive through lanes. The outside one is a bit complicated so if you don't get it, stick with the inside one.
Rush Espresso Cafe and Wine Bar=Rush is my go-to coffee spot when I'm at the office and can get away for a little while. When you walk in, you immediately notice the modern, European aesthetic: lots of sleek black and metal accented by splashes of red. Most coffee shops tend toward the cozy, which is not a bad thing, but Rush's approach is welcome.Fortunately, the coffee is high-quality as well (and also European). I have to admit, I didn't really care for the brew when they were serving Illy, but LaVazza is a much better label according to my taste buds. Two more things I appreciate about Rush: the loyalty punch-cards and the fact that the owner remembers my name, even though I am sure he has customers who are much more frequent visitors than I.If you're in Ballantyne, Rush should be high on your list of coffee options.This place is adorable. I am a coffee addict and especially love a good locally owned shop. I came in here early before class to grab a quick study session. There are probably ten to twelve tables but they do have a wonderful outdoor seating area that is a pretty decent size. They have great food and coffee (duh!)  I came in and had the power bagel. I think it was called that. Anyways it had ham, Swiss, avavado, tomato, spinach, an cream cheese. What a great way to start the morning! I have had coffee wise two different drinks. The vanilla latte which was so amazing. They serve their coffee drinks in clear glass glasses and do a beautiful little design on top of the foam. I have also had the chai tea latte. I found the chai tea to be a little more sweet than I typically like it so I didn't finish it. They have a choice of vanilla spice or regular spice and maybe I had the vanilla. The location is great and seems to be convenient to everything!! Love this place and look forward to trying every drink they offer!I always enjoy having coffee when it's not from the green lady people and Rush does an excellent double espresso. Just as good? The lemon cheese pastry with a side of sweetened cream cheese. Delicious!I sat here at Rush for about an hour and used a good amount of their wifi while drinking my coffee and eating that pastry. Mostly decent music played and there were several interesting conversations going on that kept me entertained.Cold morning, so the outside seats weren't occupied and there were still a couple of two-tops available inside. I liked this place!
Phuong Dong=Did the waiter just asked me if I wanted ice water? Yes, yes he did! How dare he ask such a foreign question! It should be automatic if you know how the real Viets roll!The unusual warm service was smothering my nonchalant, I-just-want-to-eat-good-pho mood.  Its very uncharacteristic when you compare them to the rest of the Viet joints in the valley.  No big deal, I guess, but if you are going to impress me, do it through your food. ;-)I also didn't expect the waiter to sell me on trying the ever so popular Spring Roll that exist in every Viet menu.  I appreciate the smiley attitude and extra mile but I GOT THIS! I'm Asian afterfall! ;-)Anyways, I ended up ordering the Banh Xeo and #1 Pho Dac Biet.  + The Banh Xeo had the right texture and taste.  The pork and shrimp filling was seasoned and cooked nicely.  The veggies that came with it was pretty fresh.  The homemade fish sauce tasted perfect.+ The Pho that came with the usual tripe, beef brisket, steak, and meatball was a bit of a letdown.  The most important element in a Pho is always the broth, which in this case lacked the beefiness.To compound the blandness even further, the steak meat was too well done while the rest of the meats were mostly mediocre.   Some minor PROS went to their semi-swanky bar with a few LCDs and DirectTV subscription for watching sports and a spacious, sparkling clean decor.  The question remains, would I return? Sadly no, Pho truly does make or break my decision on every Viet establishment.  Sorry PD! Its just that those other places know how to please me! :-)A new favorite! Excellent service, clean, great prices and delicious food!I had the fresh spring rolls and white meat chicken pho. The chicken was in manageable pieces (almost "pulled") and the noodle-to-broth ratio was perfect. I will definitely be back!(minimum $10 for debit/credit cards)
Café Falco=Peaceful, bright and pretty space full of greenery in the middle of a contentious and crumbling cavernous strip of industrial de Gaspe. I didn't expect to notice the subtlety of the coffee - I guess I suspected I'd swilled way too much to have much sensitivity left - but the layers of flavors did stop me in my tracks. I sat down on the steps in the sun to savor it slowly, and was thankful for the moment of zen.Beautiful siphon coffee - just beautiful. A rare perfect cup in the city. The open, concrete, warehousey space is nicely designed with a clean, pared down black, white and grey colour scheme and some vintage industrial decor items like old cast iron sewing machines, loved leather chairs and drawing table swivel chairs at a large wooden table in the centre. Also, fab large scale art. I haven't yet tried the food, other than a brownie (which was good but it's hard to go wrong with brownies), but I know I'll be going back to try it out. Wide open kitchen, and everything looks fresh and clean. If you're looking to hang out sipping coffee with your laptop, don't go at lunchtime - there's no wifi during lunch and there are no outlets anywhere, so go fully charged when you do go. Bonus: lots of galleries on the street to also visit.
Big Wong Restaurant=I like Big Wong and I cannot lie. This strangely named restaurant just opened today. If you happen to catch this review soon enough, you can drop in and get a free entree with the purchase of a $1 soda or bottled water. It's for dine-in only and is valid through May 18.I stopped by for lunch and ordered the Authentic Curry Chicken Over Rice. This dish normally costs $4.95 but was free with my $1 can of ginger ale. So how was it? It was actually very good. For $4.95, it's a great deal. For free, it's a steal!Everything on their menu is $4.95 with one item coming in at $3.95. You'd think that you were looking at the lunch menu, but no my friends. This is their regular menu. If this place was open after midnight, it would be the new unquestioned late night king.I'm inclined to give this place four stars based on the one dish I've tried so far, and the extremely fast and friendly service. Add in the fact that everything is under $5 - oh and that's tax included - and I'm glad to bump that up to a fiver.I went to Big Wong Restaurant for a Meetup (Sushi & More) gathering, met some diverse and interesting folks and we for the most part enjoyed the meal we had during their opening $1 promotion.My first visit was on the evening of the opening day.  The place was packed already by about 7pm, and I was glad I grabbed a 6-top for our 7:30pm get together.  Service was hectic, but that is to be expected with the place being so slammed from everyone and their coworker's grandmother stopping by to check out the new Chinese restaurant near the corner of Decatur and Spring Mountain, which serves basically Malaysian, Taiwanese, Cantonese and a little Asian fusion food.The thing I immediately like about Big Wong is that it has a very basic menu of 17 entrees, which can be consolidated to just 7 main items (i.e., steamed chicken, fried chicken, fried pork chop, curry chicken, wontons, thin ribeye, shrimp). Personally I think the biggest common  mistake restaurateurs make is having way too much items on the menu, where their kitchen is not able to perfect them all.  Better to have a smaller menu and make them all perfectly, I say.Anyway, I ordered the Hoi Nam Chicken (boneless dark meat) Over Rice - dish with origin in Chinese's Hainanese regional cuisine, which is also very popular in Malaysia and Singaporean due to Chinese immigrants to those countries. The chicken is fine, but I prefer my rice to be more "seasoned".I have also tried the Fried Chicken Over Rice (boneless) - I really like this one, as the chicken is fried well and is still juicy.  I know I will order this in the future.The Fired Pork Chop was disappointing for me.  I was expecting it to be more tender and juicy, but it was on the tough side. The minced pork sauce that it was served with help me finish the entree, but I will most likely not try this again.The Curry with Roti looks good when my dining companions ordered it.  I will try that next time, besides what is not to like about Roti!  The curry itself can be a little less on the "greasy" side, but other than that I heard the flavor was good.Now that the $1 drink + free entree grand opening promotion is over, we will see if the restaurant can sustain the buzz and continue to draw in a steady flow of customers.  I think at $4.95 (inclusive of tax) it is hard to find a better meal deal cheaper at a sit down restaurant.And for those who are expecting this to be just another typical Chinese take-out restaurant, you will most likely be disappointed with their menu selection.  You will not find Kung-Pao Chicken or Egg Rolls here. But if you are down to try some different kind of Chinese regional dishes, this is a good place to start without breaking the bank.------Version 1.0.1 Update------Came here after hearing about their House Special Shrimp Wontons from Nelson Q and reading his review.  When I arrived I was told that they also have new menu items that just got added today (Beef Ramen, Shrimp Ramen or Udon and Malaysian Beef Curry over Rice).I was pretty set to try the shrimp wonton, which was pure shrimp in wonton wrapper.  Yum! The Shrimp Wonton Udon also comes with vegetables, so it is a pretty complete meal.The new Beef Ramen (made with tender braised beef briskets and tendons) was very good.  The beef broth has a nice flavor, and the brisket and tendons were braised for hours until they are perfectly soft and tender.  It also comes with a really generous portion of ramen, the same kind sourced by Monta Ramen. At $5.95 it is a very good deal, based on the combination of taste, portion size and good culinary execution plus the hours and TLC dedicated to braising the chunks of beef brisket and tendons.  I can see this new Big Wong Beef Ramen as the new featured franchise item for the restaurant.5-29-2011------Version 1.0.1 Update------Note:  They also have Japanese ramen noodles, which you can substitute for the odon noodles. It is not on the menu, but the manager told me it is available.------Version 1.0.2 Update------Big Wong still serves up solid and wholesome Chinese food, my many repeat visits are proof enough.  One of my favorite is the Steamed Chicken, Mushroom and Chinese Sausage. The congee is great, especially on days when I am not my usual ravenous world devouring self. 12-1-2011 (Update reminder courtesy of Warren P)------Version 1.0.2 Update------Decor:  3/5  More attention was used in fitting the 68 seats in the restaurant than the overall look.Food:  4/5  Now offering soups, appetizers, congee and even desserts!Location:  4/5  Pretty convenient for those working, shopping or living near the Chinatown area.Price:  5/5  $4.95 including tax is a good deal for a full meal.  They are definitely going for volume and not high margin per order.  Great for customers and I hope it works out for the restaurant.We couldn't resist Big Wong's Grand Opening special - Purchase $1 beverage and get your meal free!We were concerned with how packed this place would be during their opening week, but we easily got a table with no wait.  Lucky us...the news was just spreading!What surprised us most was the pleasant and welcoming reception we received when we walked in.  Yes, it may have had to do with the non-Asian face smiling at us as we walked in, but it definitely gave us a different impression of how our meal was going to be.Getting our drink beverage orders out of the way, it was easy to decide amongst their 15 item menu.I went for their Hoi Nam Chicken ($4.95).  They have three variations of it and I went for the Boneless Dark Meat version.  It was surprisingly moist and decent portioned.  Yes, I've had better and I've also had a lot worse (especially in Vegas) but it was decent.  The seasoned rice that accompanied it could be a bit more seasoned but it worked.The Husband had their Shrimp Wonton Soup ($4.95).  This soup came with six generous all shrimp dumplings and some Chinese vegetables.  You have to give them credit for making it a very shrimpy dumpling with no filler.  We didn't realize that their grand opening special was limited to one per person per visit, so we went ahead and ordered another beverage to score a couple more free entrees.This time I went for the Curry Chicken with Roti Pancakes ($4.95).  I loved their version of the roti, not overly greasy and had a nice flaky texture and crunch.  The curry with chicken and potatoes had a good flavor too.The Husband tried their Deep Fried Pork Chop ($4.95) and found it to be disappointing.  It wasn't quite what we expected and it was dried out.  Too bad about that one.  (Apparently you have to request crispy if you want it that way...but that's news to us!)When it came time to pay, we then discovered that we were going to be charged for the second entrees.  Due to a waitress's mistake, they took it off the bill without any hassle, which is something we really appreciated.  They didn't even charge us for the second round of beverages, rather telling us to leave it for our server instead.  Now, you gotta love that! Overall, you can't complain for the price you're getting.  A decent size portion for less than five bucks, and that's including tax!  (I heard they are adding to their menu next week, so we'll see how that goes.)  A quick bite without the fuss - a simple and straight forward menu!3.5 stars.Its a little awkward telling someone you just ate at Big Wong...."You just ate a big.....what?" HA HA HACheap Chinese Food doesn't have a positive ring to it. But this place is all about good food, good prices, good quality. Most Chinese restaurants are overly greasy and leave you with a less than satisfactory taste of MSG. But you'll leave Big Wong's with a full tummy and they won't put a dent in your bank account.Right next door to Monta, they're not there to have a ramen battle. Their ramen is NOT Japanese style; its a cross between pho & oxtail soup with ramen noodles thrown in. But there's so much variety, be sure to try the rest of the menu--99% of it is $4.95. So don't be cheap and order a few different dishes. A few suggestions: crispy shrimp wontons, salt & pepper wings, & the chicken curry.Happy NOM-ing.TIP: Call ahead! They do take-out and they use quality containers, not those cheesy chinese-y boxes.We went here for the first time after the Elite Event at PJ Clarke's with a bunch of other Yelpers.  The predominant thought running through my head after looking at this menu was "Why the hell did it take me so long to come here??".Super cheap prices!  You could spend more and get far less at any fast food restaurant.  I got the Hai Nam chicken and my wife for the shrimp soup with udon.  Both were very tasty and filling.  We finished up our meal splitting an almond jello dessert for a whopping bill of $11.20.Great, friendly service too.  The staff knew a lot of the guys in the group by name.  The owner came in to say hello and gave us a few plates of shrimp wonton appetizers on the house.  There were so many other dishes that looked great.  A lot of people in the group doubled up on entrees since they were so cheap and I look forward to trying more of the menu.  Consider me a Big Wong believer!!I haven't been back to Big Wong's since their grand opening. I finally made my way back last night in need of some cheap eats and I'm sad I haven't been back sooner. We ordered the curry chicken with roti, beef ramen and sweet roti for dessert. They have a much more extensive menu than before and they also have daily specials that look delightful. All the food is still incredibly cheap for the portions and quality, which you just can't argue with. I enjoyed this visit quite a bit more than our first visit and I'm already craving some more of their cheap eats. There aren't many places that you can have a sit down meal, including dessert and a drink for under $14 and still leave satisfied. Sometimes good prices makes food just taste that much better.Big Wong can get in this belly anytime.Their menu is simple, easy and cheap.After reading several reviews and seeing several of yelp friends visit this place, it was time for me to give this place a try. What I loved:The desert rotis.The plain rotis.The chicken curry.The shrimp wonton soup.What I liked:The salt and pepper chicken wings. The beef and tendon ramen.What can I say? Good, decent food at cheap prices. I will definitely be back time and time again. To go ordering is simple and so fast and painless.Like a dubbed old school low budget kung fu movie, Big Wong keeps it simple with good menu selections and low prices.Was gonna go to SnowFlake Shavery but didn't have dinner yet so we decided to check out this Wong place. After looking over the menu, I was astounded by how simple it was laid out and explained. Most dishes were around the 5 to 6 dollar range. I was excited that it was pretty cheap and at the same time cautious because of the quality you might get because of it. First visit I ordered the Shrimp Wonton with Udon noodles and the wifey ordered the Rice Vermiccelli Noodle Soup which she shared with my youngest son. We were all amazed at how hot and fresh both dishes were especially with how fast we received it too. The Shrimp Wonton mixed with Udon Noodles were some of the best Wonton I have had in a while. As for the the other dish my wife and son shared, it was basically a pho bowl, which was pretty good as well.I was impressed so we came back the next day for lunch to try some of the other items. Our second visit verified that this place was gonna be one of our go to places for good, cheap fast food. What we got this time was the Beef Ramen, Salt n Pepper Porkchop, and Thinly Sliced Ribeye over Rice.  The Beef Ramen has your basic Ramen Noodles accompanied by tender chunks of Beef Brisket which gave the overall taste of the soup tremendous flavor. The Salt n Pepper Porkchop was exactly that. A deep fried Porkchop lightly coated in salt and pepper, then sliced and garnished with thinly sliced sauteed jalapenos. When you bite into it, all the flavors put together are like a really good orchestra playing in your mouth. I asked for some sweet chili sauce on the side to dip it in and some steamed white rice to accompany it. As for the Thinly Sliced Ribeye, it comes with an au jus type of of gravy to dip it in and then you eat it it with the steamed white rice. Really good flavors from this as well.The overall total with tax and tip was around 20 dollars. Not bad for all the food I just mentioned! Service was decent. They would come around refilling our drinks every so often so I never really had to ask for any refills. So if you want good food at low prices with decent service, you can't go wrong at Big Wongs! (Pun intended)Great place to come for good, cheap food but because of recent service experiences I'm sad to have to downgrade them because it's no longer of 4 star quality overall when you factor in their terrible customer service. If you want take out be sure to call your order in before showing up to avoid being questioned why you didn't call in advance. And when dining in, don't ask for split checks because this just pisses off the lady too and she'll likely tell you off like she did to us. Prices also have gone up in the last few months because they now charge sales tax, whereas before it was always included in the price.I usually get the same few things when coming here: hoi nam chicken w/ seasoned rice, fried chicken or the chicken wings. I've been avoiding the fried items lately because I'm always told that it takes an extra 20-30 min...is it never prepped in advance? Very odd. The only thing I would NOT recommend getting is the beef ramen because this is a Chinese place and they don't make it right. I think they're only offering it to compete with Monta next door and it's definitely not worth getting despite the cheap $5.95 price tag.People think this place is fast but it's really not. I'm always waiting a while for my food whether I'm dining in or taking out. There is usually only 1 server and a couple of kitchen staff which is likely why...Not sure why the people working here are always so grouchy...especially the lady that serves the food!We're two of the few Yelpers who are not habitues of Chinatown, mostly because when I eat out I like atmosphere, and when we want Chinese food we usually do take-out from the local place.  But we came here after our Airbnb friend and fellow Yelper, Chan, hosted a Meetup for LV Airbnb hosts and also set up a UYE for Big Wong.  And we were delighted to participate in this trifecta:  meeting new local hosts, meeting Yelper Antonia R., and getting to try a new Asian restaurant to add to our woefully inadequate go-to list.True to form, Big Wong lacks atmosphere, but makes it up with an interesting menu and very cheap prices.  Sure, some of the dishes are small, but the low cost lets you try a greater variety of their offerings.I ordered the Shrimp Soup with noodles.  My husband, who was suddenly gripped with some mysterious illness (not food related!!), needed some broth, so he ordered a plain cup of chicken broth and I shared the huge quantity of noodles in my soup.  But after seeing the wonton in someone else's shrimp soup, which looked fabulous, I was sorry I hadn't gone for that one.  Still, my soup was amazing, and a great size for the 4.95 price.  Next time it'll be the wonton version.  We also got a Curry Chicken with Roti pancakes, and I loved that combination; it was a big change from the usual rice. Unfortunately for me, the hubs wasn't so sick that he gobbled it all up before I could get more than one bite of chicken, but that one nibble was moist and tender.  I also got to sample the baby bok choy in garlic that Chan ordered, something that I had never knew existed, and it was astounding.  We probably would have ordered another dish if hubby had been feeling better, but it was a good start to what I know is going to be a regular stop on the Silk Road.Today I received an email from Yelp HQ advising that my review of Big Wong, from last March, has been removed due to not being detailed enough about my experience at this restaurant. The purpose of me sharing reviews is to share my experiences; whether it be Exceptional, Good, Bad, or Ugly.  So now as a Yelp "Newbie" I've learned that a one liner is not enough. My review read..."The food was cheap and good tasting, but the service sucked!"Big Wong is a small hidden gem of a place near ChinaTown located in a crowded U-shaped strip mall off Spring Mountain, just west of Decatur, on the north side of the street.  We went for dinner last March in search of inexpensive Chinese food that would taste great! Thanks to fellow Yelpers, we got what we asked for, and then some...The restaurant is small and the tables are crowded together. The food were small appetizer portions and we sampled at least a dozen types. Most people would spend $10 bucks or less to eat here, but our bill came to over $50 because we sampled foods we were familiar with and foods we never heard of. Overall, the food was good, yet as mentioned; appetizer portions.  One lady serving at least 20 tables packed with people. She had zero personality, despite me trying to hopefully cheer her up with some jokes, etc. I asked if they had Big Wong T-shirts for sale, similar to the one she was wearing. She apparently thought I was making fun of her, as my question was ignored. I was sincere, as I would honestly wear one of those T-shirts offering them free advertising every time I wore it. When asking about the most popular dishes on the menu, she told me to make my own decision and walked away. Perhaps, she was just having a bad day as her fellow co-workers called in sick or something. I suppose it would be fair to read other reviews and look for references of the wait staff service.One guy working in the back as the chef. He was hustling with the woks and pots and pans, really producing some efforts for the hungry patrons that were pleasured by our lovely waitress. He really did a good job, but clearly understaffed for some help.Would we return? Only if they decide to sell T-shirts and we were once again in search of a Chinese restaurant that was cheap and good tasting, but the service must NOT suck!Better than a 1 liner? If you think so, please review with a U for Useful, F for Funny and/or C for Cool.  Thanks for reading my review of Big Wong.
ShinBay=In one word, ShinBay is AMAZING!!!  Let me preface this review by saying that this is NOT a typical sushi bar, it is a gourmet Japanese restaurant, so if it's specialty sushi rolls that you're looking for, head to Geisha A Go Go or any of the other sushi spots that serve deep-fried, cream cheese laden, Americanized sushi as you will not find such fare here.  Rather, what you will find are some of the highest quality and most unique dishes that I can honestly say I've ever had paired with exceptional service. We decided to sit at the sushi bar, at which the manager had graciously reserved us prime seating.  My husband and I opted for the seven course chef's tasting as we've found that this is usually the best way to get a feel for what a new restaurant has to offer.  The courses that we had are summarized as follows:1.  Chilled asparagus soup - light and flavorful, left us looking forward to the courses ahead.2.  Scorpionfish carpaccio - the fish itself as well as the sauce it was served in had excellent flavor, I could have eaten a whole plate of this as an entree.3.  Sashimi sampler - a beautifully presented plate of six entirely different preparations of six different sashimis (including things we'd never had before such as giant clam and Japanese sea scallops), each having it's own unique flavors.  We watched this dish being prepared while we were consuming the first two courses and it took over 15 minutes just to prepare this one course.  The attention to detail and presentation was unbelievable!  4.  Steamed manilla clams with 5 types of Japanese mushrooms, served in their own broth - this dish actually derives its incredible flavor simply from steaming the clams and mushrooms together.  So delicious!5.  Foie gras wrapped in halibut - this Japanese "fondue-style" dish was incredible!  Our waiter brought out bite sized pieces of foie gras wrapped in a thin piece of halibut and served on a pick with a variety of dipping sauces and then brought us each a wooden box which housed the flame that heated a paper-lined wire mesh basket containing sake and water in which we placed each skewer for approximately 30 seconds before eating.  The foie gras absolutely melted in my mouth!6. Nigiri sushi - two separate plates (perhaps even two courses) of the highest quality Nigiri that I've ever had.  We inquired with the manager as to where the chef gets such high quality fish and were told that he has his fish flown in daily, which explains how such a small restaurant can have such amazingly fresh fish.7.  Japanese egg custard with fresh fruit - light, fluffy, and the perfect end to a perfect meal.  We aren't typically "dessert people" and rarely order dessert at a restaurant, but this was delicious!The chef's tasting that we had was $130 per person and without a doubt, was worth every penny.  We typically don't splurge quite that much when dining out and it would certainly be possible to order items a la carte and keep the cost to $50-$70 per person.  If you've read any of my other Yelp reviews, I think it's apparent that I do not gush about mediocre restaurants and am probably a bit harsher in my reviews than most are, but I can honestly say that if it were possible to give ShinBay six stars, I would.  We will be back soon and often.  I'm so glad that we found this gem!I have to agree with every word that Michelle G. said...AMAZING only scratches the surface!  My friend and I usually go to another sushi restaurant, but it was closed on Sunday, so I pulled out Phoenix Magazine Best New Restaurants and thankfully we found ShinBay!  The restaurant is tucked away in the Scottsdale Seville, and the atmosphere is very clean lines, modern, fantastic!Our server Meredith, and another server (I'm so sorry I forgot your name) helped us navigate the small menu...when I small, it is not to offend.  I believe a menu should reflect one cuisine and every single item should be able to done to perfection.  In this case, this small menu does not disappoint!  Meredith suggested a wonderful wine, a crisp, fruity Sauv Blanc to go along with our ShinBay tasting menu.  1.  We started with a trio of cold items....Tuna tar tare with pine nuts and avocado (melt in your mouth, the pine nuts added a different spin on the typical tar tare), Halibut sashimi in miso, and a charred Scallop on heirloom tomato with truffle oil, truffle salt, and thinly sliced truffles.  I am normally not a truffle lover, but this knocked my socks off!  Each item was seasoned to perfection and delicious!2.  The hot course was Wagyu  beef served with a Japanese ceramic grill.  It was accompanied by oyster mushrooms, Himalayan sea salt and ShinBay's variation on steak sauce.  This was an interactive course.  The grill is presented sizzling hot, you add a bit of the beef fat to the grill to season it, then you start grillin'!  Cindy and I had a great time preparing everything, and I am sure the expressions on our face were priceless to the staff!3.  The third course was a compilation of fresh nigiri.  You will have to forgive me, I can't remember their exact names...each piece was meant to escalate from lightest tasting to the fattiest.  Again, I don't intend to offend by stating "fattiest".  In this case this was Toro, which literally melted in my mouth!  We actually started with the Toro and went backwards.  Next was shrimp, a "sardine" like fish but less oily, tuna, and then something similar to yellowtail.  Each piece was seasoned again to perfection to enhance the fish.  There was just enough ginger to cleanse your palate after each piece!  No need for wasabi and soy sauce AT ALL!!4.  The final course was a Japanese custard with black sugar cane syrup and fresh fruit.  I love Creme Brulee and this was light and delicious, the perfect ending!On a Sunday night, we were the only patrons, so we chatted with everyone there.  They were all so kind and we had a fantastic time!  You have to forgive me for not remembering everyone's names, but your wine selections were spot on!!Thanks for an amazing Sushi experience!!I broke my cardinal rule of dining, which is never eat sushi/sashimi/Japanese food outside of California or Manhattan in the U.S., because the reviews of this place were so solid that I had to try it.ShinBay blew my mind (in a super fantastical way). We did the 4 course tasting menu (we couldn't call ahead to reserve a bigger tasting menu because we only found this place online 3 hours before dinner on our last night in Scottsdale). We also got a bottle of sake from the less expensive menu. Every course was ridiculously amazing. The uni alone changed my world. It is the best sushi I have ever eaten in my life, and it may have ruined me for lesser places.I will seriously fly back to Scottsdale just to eat here again, and I'm not that big a high roller. It's just worth it.
Winghart's Burger & Whiskey Bar=As most of you all know, this burger joint is my jam! I will argue with anyone who crosses my path and tells me this place doesn't have the best burger in the Burgh. So don't get in the way of me and my Winghart's burger!The real deal behind my update is that they've updated... their space! Yes, it may still be a narrow space to wiggle yourself into downstairs, but now the upstairs is open, which offers you even more space to squeeze into! I say squeeze because it's still unbelievably busy, regardless of the day or time. But that's the price you pay for having legit tasting food.I say legit because everything here stands alone. Burgers aside, I've had a stellar pizza and now an awesome veggie Stromboli type offering that rocked my world just as much as the burger. And don't even get me started on their double fried fries! If you like crispy taters, you won't want to pass these bad boys up.They of course have a massive whiskey list and pretty impressive draft beer line up. With two bars now, they're fully loaded and ready to go. Can't wait until the summer so I can sit out on their new upstairs deck and spy down on the square below. But, I'll surely be back before the warmer weather. Heck, I'll probably be back next week!When I start picking about the decor of a restaurant that means I am in trouble.  That means that I am not enjoying my  meal. Here's what I didn't want to notice but noticed while dining at Wingharts. The music that was being played was coming out of a visible iphone that was hooked up to a juke box.  One of the high top tables was stabilized by two dish rags folded and propped under the table legs.  We all jerry -rigg from time to time.   But I expect more from a resturant that sales $9.00 bugers. Moving on there were some horrific looking paintings on the walls. One which reminded me of the movie the Ring. Yes  the shipwreck burger was delicious.  The pizza I got was not so great. While the toppings were good and the crust was warm the artichoke paste that was spread on it was only slightly cool.  The crust of my pizza did nothing to heat the artichoke paste. That was very distracting.So why 3 stars and not 4 or 5?   I really wanted a meal I could sink my teeth into but that's not what I got. It's probably my own fault for going to a buger joint and getting a pizza.There aren't enough words in the English language to convey how much of a fan I am of this place. There are two reasons I say this: the food, and the service.I guess I'm getting in the long line of fans exclaiming that the food here is fantastic, but, it really is! If you want a great burger, then hightail it over here for the Shipwreck, a masterpiece combination of Brie cheese, caramelized onions with bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli. They had me at 'Brie'! My friend snagged a bite of this and said he wanted to come back just to have a whole one.Not a burger person? These guys do veggie burgers (I've heard good things about these) and also offer pizza and wraps. As a note: their incredible fries - which taste like real potatoes, quite a rare feat when you think about it - are not automatically included with the burgers, but considering they're 1/2 pound masterpieces, you don't necessarily need an order of fries, do you? If you want an alternative side or appetizer, I've had the spinach dip and pita twice and absolutely love it. There's a nice kick to the dip and it's nice and thick, complete with freshly baked pita chips. I think I'm drooling just thinking about them right now...And the service? It doesn't get better. My friend and I were actually here for a special event, and the bartender was fantastic. From checking in on all of us in our massive party to offering us specially made drinks on the spot invented just for our special occasion, this guy went above and beyond the call of duty for a bartender. I feel like I haven't said enough about Wingharts yet but I don't know what else to say. The staff is wonderful, the food is fresh - they told me they don't freeze their ingredients and go for local whenever possible - and my next meal here can't come soon enough!
Cibo E Vino=Please don't waste your time or your money. For half the price, you would be better off with Domino's - which tastes better. The only positive thing I can say for Cibo E Vino's pizza is that the ingredients are fresh... but the freshness of the pizza does not make up for the lack of taste.Three pizzas and a batch of those pepperoni rolls (not sure the name, I didn't put in the order) and the total was around $60. A little pricey, but we were feeding 7 total, so I figured that was justified. Until I saw the pizzas, that is. "Dainty" is a nice way to describe them. Any other company would call them small. Flavor? It's there, but you have to concentrate to find it. If you had told me they were just using a fancy frozen dinner, I would have had a hard time disputing the claim.The food itself is meh, but two stars seems a bit generous for a pizza place that's robbing its customers blind. At this point, I'm just going to believe that location is cursed - no matter which business occupies it.Drove through the parking lot and decided to "take a chance" and not look at the reviews. Sat a dirty table with a frenetic, attitudy-waitress who informed us that she was the only one there and it's going to be slow. Not even apologetic, more like a "sucks for you that I'm the only one here, deal with it!" kind of thing. The entrees were quite expensive for the dated pizza joint decor, topped with the notion that we would probably never eat (based on her warning... Sat there 10 minutes without a glance), we left without ordering. Never even got water, but the place was just depressing and I couldn't imagine spending a dinner there.Back open for a week after renovations.  We got here at 7:05, and after several follow ups on our pizza, we stil had nothing at 8:27pm. We gave them 5more mins, the pizza still wasn't done. So i  ran over to Sesame Inn (which is excellent) to try and catch them before closing, while hubs paid bill at Cibo. They ended up pulling a nearly-raw pizza out and giving it to my hubs, no Charge for our drinks, salad, or pizza.  So Sesame Inn stayed open longer, just to get food for us after Cibo wasted an entire evening of ours, waiting for a meal that didn't come.. (We weren't the only ones waiting 90 mins for pizza; they claimed it's a new pizza oven and only heats to 300' instead of 600'....but I'm pretty sure my 300' oven at home can cook a pizza faster than 90mims). Other notes of importance: the chef/owner left at around 8....and left his staff to deal with this mess. At the time he left, I commented that I hoped he'd put my pizza in before he left. We were not offered bread until 8:15....70 mins after we ordered (and after multiple complaints). The Caesar salad was average. They have no fresh pepper in the building. The bartender didn't know what kind of beers they had on tap (and we sat at the bar). Could it get better after they were open longer? Maybe, but this isn't a new restaurant. They're just reopened after a remodel...??WHERE TO BEGIN?We received a slick and shiny full-color Grand Opening announcement from Cibo e Vino. Great food photos. Intriguing menu. Famous chef. 10 minutes from home. Saturday night dinner with another couple. BaDaBing!   THE GOOD:Outstanding waitperson. Superb Chicken Parmigiana.    THE BAD:Upon arriving, I asked for coffee; they were "out," deeming it cost prohibitive to make a new pot. It was 8:30pm, 30 minutes before their late Happy Hour started--we weren't THAT late--don't people often have a cuppa after a meal?   One of our party requested Arnold Palmer, but they didn't have/were-out-of iced tea too.   Ironically, there seemed no "supply" issues with alcoholic drinks   Two of our party ordered Vodka Penne ("Penne tossed in Homemade Vodka Cream Sauce, Peas, and Prosciutto") which arrived sans Peas and Prosciutto. We alerted our server who returned with The Chef's response: they were "out" of the recipe's ingredients. We let her know we expected, at the very least, a discount on those dishes.   THE UGLY:After dinner, having received our check, we requested to speak with the manager. When she arrived, we explained A) The "outs"--coffee and tea and peas and prosciutto; B) that a $2 discount on a $17 dish, that should never been served, was a joke; C) We had come as a result of their Grand Opening announcement and were extremely disappointed; and finally, D) We would not be coming back.    Without taking personal responsibility or offering even one solution/option, she said "I'm sorry" and could not have cared less.   DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON Cibo e Vino.
Root 174=I haven't had such an amazing meal in a while!  No lie!I kept saying that over and over again as I was stuffing my face with the delicious food served tonight!  I swear to you I was so stuffed half way through my entree and I had to keep going because it....was...so...good....The place describes it's dishes as comfort food.  I imagined the offerings would have a southern flair.  But the GM, Wil,l describes it as food that comforts you.  I love that!  It comforted me so much that I felt like I had to roll myself out the door!I started with the Root Salad, which was a mix of red and golden beets, candied walnuts, goat cheese with sea salt and lime sprinkled on top.  Have I told you lately, that I love beet salads?  Like, so much!  It was incredible!  My main dish was the Ricotta Gnocchi with peas, parm, mushrooms, cherry tomato and an egg on top.  I'm usually a fan of red sauce with my gnocchi, but this blew away any red sauce I could ever have had!  The gnocchi was just how I like them, like pasta/potato cloud puffs of amazingness.  All the ingredients complimented each other so well.  No red sauce needed!  The gnocchi comes from a local hook up, so you know it's not from the frozen section of your local Giant Eagle.  The place is Incredibly intimate with seating for about 40.  Be sure to make a reservation because this place is going to fill up fast!  If you want comfort food style, look no further!I have been waiting for the perfect moment to write my review of Root 174. Since I woke up this morning craving the fried brussel sprouts (read: salivating over them), I figured this was the perfect time.The head chef, Keith, personally invited us to the opening party, after we creepily stood in the doorway peering in the night before. I noticed that he was going around to every table, introducing himself and making sure everyone was taken care of. He believes in "giving back" to the community and offers a discount to those livin' in the 15221 (my hood, holla!). The guy is just super nice, period. Will, the manager, I also no slouch- he came over, chatted us up, and really made use feel welcome. Great guy. Ok- now on with the food:Fried Brussel Sprouts. Oh lord in heaven, they are so good. Crispy, tangy and the perfect balance of salt an sweet, topped with a bacon chutney. The tostanoes, a flat plantain with refried black beans and corn exploded with flavor- so tasty, perfect sweetness. They have a seasonal menu, so these goodies may not still be on there but TRY them if they are. I cannot wait to return for the entrees!They are BYOB, which is always a plus. Root 174 is the perfect spot to bring out of town friends who you want to experience the best that the 'burgh has to offer. I am so pleased that these friendly, innovative folks have graced my neighborhood. I am hoping that they do a brunch, but will contInue to love them regardless!!It would have been hard to be more impressed with the meal I had here.My wife and I came for dinner at about 6pm; luckily, we had a reservation, because the space is small and the dining area and bar were packed. As soon as we got a look at the menu, though, I realized why. There was not a single dish on the menu that did not intrigue me.After much deliberation, I settled on my app and entree. I began with the "bone marrow creme brulee" -- holy crap, it was delicious. It wasn't soupy like other bone marrow I've had -- more like it had been churned, making it easier to spread. And of course, it was caramelized on top like any "creme brulee" ought to be. The caramelizing brought forth a sweetness that was unexpected, and a great counterpoint to the saltiness. It was a great spread which I enjoyed on buttery crisps of bread.For my entree, I was a little less adventurous, opting for the eye of ribeye, served at a perfect medium rare, with creamy potatoes and Brussels sprouts. It was a lot to eat, but I bravely soldiered on and downed every last bite, just so I could tell you about it. Okay, I'm lying. I ate every last bite because it was freaking fabulously prepared, and I couldn't even stand the thought of allowing it to get cold.For dessert, I had a pumpkin roll that was unlike any I'd ever tasted. It was spongier, not heavy at all, with toasted pumpkin seeds and a nifty whipped cream cheese. I was truly blown away by every aspect of the food, and our service was stellar. Our server just seemed to anticipate what my wife and I would need, and was always at hand without seeming to hover. I can't wait to come back here and have another meal -- perhaps I'll dive in the deep end and try the headcheese next time?Culinary creativity is a rare entity to encounter in Pittsburgh.  However, thanks to photos uploaded by fellow Yelpers, chef Keith Fuller's gastronomic work caught my attention during one of my random nights perusing this site.  The next step was to verify my curiosity, by making a visit to Root 174 and indulge myself with the multi-course tasting menu.   Food (9.5/10) = 1) Watermelon soup with cantaloupe, peach, ricotta cheese, pistachios = A very refreshing way to initiate the multi-course dinner on a summer night.  The pistachios provided a balanced nutty component to the natural sweetness of the fruits, while the ricotta cheese added a non intrusive creamy/savory element.2) Crispy brussel sprouts with bacon-black pepper jam = Big fan of brussel sprouts!  Root 174 excels with this dish.  The name of the dish says it all.  It's crispy.  There's the fattiness from the bacon.  There's the sweetness from the jam.  A true winner.3) Black caviar caesar with parmesan, baby kale, egg, white anchovies, focaccia = I'm usually bored with caesar salads, however the execution of this caesar salad was impressive.  Note, I'm also a sucker for poached eggs!4) Figs with blue cheese, beets, brown sugar crumble, and a gastrique (forgot what kind of gastrique) = One of the best fruits to indulge in during the summer months.  It doesn't get any better than pairing fresh ripe figs with cheese.5) Apple fennel salad with  macadamia "cheese," maple black pepper vin, grilled radicchio, walnuts =  Another outstanding refreshing summer time salad.  Certainly a great dish to have before moving on to the more savory dishes on the menu.6) Pork belly with rhubarb, strawberry apple compote, savory rice crispy, jalapeno, barbequed pop rocks, banana = Love pork belly.  But to pair it with rice crispy treats and barbequed pop rock candy?  WTF?!  This was the most creative dish of the night, and was I immediately intrigued when I saw it on the menu.  All the components work well with each other.  This dish was absolutely fun and playful, and I wonder if this dish best exhibits chef Fuller's personality.7) Grilled octopus with romesco, olives, pickled potato salad, pesto = I rarely...RARELY order octopus, since most of my prior experiences were overcooked, tough octopus meat.  Wow, was I pleasantly surprised when my fork sank into the meat with little effort.  I did not expect to find octopus this tender in the middle of Pittsburgh.  Bravo.  The brininess of the olives were well balanced with the octopus.8) Coffee confit chicken wings with curried creme fraiche, dried banana chips = The only other time I've had coffee rubbed into meat was with steak.  I've now been educated that coffee can work well with chicken.  9) Chorizo stuffed chicken leg with mole sauce, creamy grits, pickled cauliflower, and peanuts = My favorite dish of the night.  The chicken meat was hella tender, and married well with the spiciness of the chorizo.  Also, some of the best grits I've had since I left the South.  10) Hanger steak with halloumi, apricot, cardamom, black rice puree, kale, cream corn, tomato, bread = The hanger steak was very tender and well executed.  The black rice puree looks just like chocolate.  11) Beignets with ganache and orange chips = The only dish of the night I was not impressed with.  Having lived in Louisiana for several years, my palate has been spoiled by beignets from down South.12) Bread pudding with ice cream dessert = Soft.  Moist.  Warm.  Sweet.  Chocolate.  Ice cream.  Need I say more?13) Celery sorbet = Second time in my life I've encountered celery sorbet (first time was in San Francisco 6-8 years ago at One Market Restaurant).  This dessert was a fantastic way to conclude the night, and was just as exciting and refreshing as the watermelon soup, Service (9.5/10) = Our waiter was fantastic.  Not overbearing, and he knew the menu well to describe the components of these complex dishes as they were brought to our table.   Ambiance (8.5/10) = A very simple and small yet cozy environment. Overall Opinion = Chef Keith Fuller's tasting menu is an absolute killer.  $67 for all the dishes I mentioned in this review?  What an awesome experience.  I'm surprised this restaurant doesn't share the same level of popularity as other restaurants in Pittsburgh (e.g. Meat and Potatoes, Butcher and the Rye, etc.).  Is it location?  Is it the simple ambiance?  Is it the level of creativity that Pittsburgh palates may not be accustomed to?  Who knows... What I do know is this restaurant is a true gem, and if you have been in Pittsburgh for a while and haven't visited Root 174, get your ass to this place ASAP.  Why didn't I give this place 5 Yelp stars?  Well, it was the beignets.  I only give 5 stars when everything has been perfect to me.   Ideally, I would've given this restaurant 4.5 stars.  Regardless, bravo to Chef Fuller!I like the trend in restaurants that started some years ago and is now really taking off in Pittsburgh; namely, locally sourced produce and meat thoughtfully put together by people who are serious about food and willing to not only try new things, but return their kitchens to a time when most things (like pasta and bread) were made by hand. Throw in some fun and delicious cocktails, and you have Root 174. We made an early dinner reservation for a Friday night, and, while the place was empty when we arrived, it was getting busier by the time we left. It's a small space, so reservations are recommended. Both the drink and dinner menus are brief, so choosing was a fairly quick affair for me. I had the Royal Oligarchy, a very good cocktail made with Remy Martin, Jim Beam Rye, St. Germain, house bitters and Cava (Spanish sparkling wine), served straight up and ungarnished. I tasted every element present in this drink, and enjoyed it thoroughly. Caesar salad is a favorite of mine, and their Black Caviar Caesar arrived to the table somewhat deconstructed, with the baby kale dressed, topped with a large crouton  and liberally sprinkled with parmesan, and the poached egg, anchovy and caviar off to the side. This is a very good salad, and the well balanced flavors in the dressing, as well as the egg and parmesan cheese crisp, somewhat mellowed the stronger flavors on the plate. For my main I chose the Tuna Bloodline Bolognese, the description of which (olive infused pappardelle, tomato, zucchini, poached fennel) I found very intriguing. I did ask the waiter about the whole tuna bloodline thing, and he explained that the dark red meat that cuts through a tuna steak is the bloodline, and they take that part and create the sauce with it. Interesting. This is obviously not a typical Bolognese sauce, and the tuna was either pureed or melted into the sauce, which was thick and tasted of, well, tuna. I'm not sure what else goes into this sauce, as it doesn't say on the menu. The other parts of the dish...pappardelle (either house made or hand made locally, but brilliant either way), zucchini, poached fennel and tomato, were all done perfectly. The sauce got a little heavy for me after awhile, and there was a lot of it on the plate, so I didn't finish it all...you really have to like the somewhat fishy taste of bloodline tuna to enjoy this dish. And I did enjoy it. Dessert, a lemon and lavender infused cake, sounded simple, but was completely different than any cake I've ever had, both in texture and taste. French press coffee completed the meal. Everything I tried here was delicious, beautifully presented, and just a bit different from my expectations, which is a good thing. Service was low key and helpful. I'll be back.After eating next door at the Thai Cottage, we ambled on over to Root 174 for cocktails. Little did we know that we should have parked ourselves here originally and forgone the Thai!! The small, unassuming storefront opens up to an intimate dining room with a half bar at the back. Though there were many tables open (rather surprising for a Friday night at 8:30), we opted for the bar. We typically enjoy talking to the bartenders, and they always give great recommendations. Root 174 has a unique list of cocktails. I started off with the Royal Oligarchy, a slightly sweet blend of rye, St. Germain, and Cava. I loved the added bubble provided by the Cava. My boyfriend chose the Mezrita as his first (he is currently nursing an obsession with mezcal) and enjoyed the bitterness of his drink.As we sipped our drinks and looked over a local pittsburgh events magazine, a heavily tattooed man showed up behind the bar and asked how we were enjoying our drinks. After we assured him that they were delicious, we realized he was the chef and owner! We then asked him for appetizer recommendations (who better to ask, right?). We needed some food with substance after our subpar dinner next door. He told us to try the coffee confit duck wings, and when they came out we were so happy to have taken his advice. They were crispy and literally falling off the bone. The coffee rub was slightly sweet and gave the duck a lovely flavor. The skin melted in your mouth. The wings normally come with a vanilla creme sauce, but since it included dairy we asked for it on the side. Our waiter was very helpful and gave great suggestions on other options for me with regards to my numerous allergies.While we ate, the owner walked around the space and spoke with patrons, even sitting down with some to enjoy a drink. I appreciated his hands-on approach, and his eagerness to please his customers. He has an obvious obsession with Star Wars (you can purchase a Star Wars koozie,ha) and will unashamedly tell you all about it. After one more delicious drink each, we headed out into the cool night, already planning our next visit to this unique and fun place.
Country Boys Restaurant=Stumbled upon this place when looking to turn around to go to someplace more familiar.  Decided to eat there just to shake things up.  I was not disappointed.  Country Boys on Greenway is a smallish 24-hour diner and their menu is typical diner fare.  My party experienced breakfast, so no comment, yet, on other meal offerings.  Caveat: I was looking to dine out cheap.We took some time to peruse the menu and made our decisions.  Notably, our server asked us if we had any coupons, which we did not.  We voiced our lament, me more so (remember, my goal was to eat cheap?)  She proffered to take our order and determine if there were any options that would save us money.  Cool!  I liked this place already.  Once she knew what we wanted, she had suggestions for us that saved a few bucks for my dining partner and shaved 1/2 off the cost of my meal.  The concessions from our original menu choices to gain those savings were minimal.  I hadn't taken a bite and I was already happy to be there.Our meal was served quite quickly, almost too quickly.  I had ordered pancakes as a side and I know they are typically made from premixed ingredients.  Note: I don't like restaurant pancakes.  Grandma taught me how to make them and restaurant pancakes are no substitute.  However, I occasionally try the pancakes at a new place to use my relative level of dissatisfaction as a gauge of the overall quality.  It's a tough measuring tool, but it works for me.  Overall, the meal was quite satisfactory.  I was not expecting innovation or dining nirvana from a 24-hour diner and I did not experience either.  I did receive my food promptly, hot, and in quantities sufficient to satisfy.  It met and, in the case of the pancakes, slightly exceeded my expectations.  The bacon, in particular, was perfectly cooked, thick cut, and quite tasty.  Home style potatoes were very good with none of the onions or other crap restaurants add to try to make them special.  The eggs were perfectly cooked to order - I can't tell you how many times I've differed with cooks regarding the definition of "Over-Medium".  Overall, I give Country Boys a rating of 4 stars.  Fine dining it is not.  Good quality diner fair, with friendly and knowledgeable service?  Absolutely.  Oh, they have a drive-through too.  That's just icing.
Garofola's Italiano=YELP PLEASE WE NEED A NO STAR RATING  I CAN ALWAYS TELL HOW GOOD THE FOOD IS GOING TO BE WHEN THE TABLES ARE STICKY  BARF...                   Where do I start first you sit on lawn furniture then you wait and wait and wait for what nasty food sauce out of a jar Alfredo out of a packet . And you wait  2 hours NO thank you . The servers are so confused they do not have a clue who ordered what. And the Owner ( I assume) says I am not sure what happened ?        I know what happened you should not have quit your job at Walmart and who ever told you you knew how to run a restaurant  was A) A Family Member looking for a job  or B) Drunk  c) A Drunk family Member looking for a job.            Are you kidding me?Never saw a Sports bar next to a "SO called Italian  Restaurant" And you go in the sports bar side to walk in? I tried giving  the "food" that I did not eat( All of it) to my Dog he looked at it smelled it and walked over to a tree and raised his leg.Damm  THATS BAD
The DawgFather Grill=This is a perfect lunch stop if you're ever downtown - amazing dawgs, great prices, faygo rootbeer, and a homey atmosphere. I happened to walk in on a poor guy trying to beat their "big dawg challenge" - he ended up in the parking lot with his attempt before him.
Province Urban Kitchen & Bar=I really wanted to like this place as I heard good and bad things about it. Maybe last night they were having a rough time, but alas here is my review.I met other yelpers here for pre-theater dinner. I will say there were about 20+ of us give or take at various tables. At the larger table of about 12, for some reason they just couldn't seem to get it together. Drink orders got mixed up, food orders came out very late or not all. Yes you read that right, not at all.  It got to the point that we were scrambling to eat the food some of us did receive and pay our bill to get out of there to catch the show. The table across from us, the entire party came in later than we did ( table of 6) and yet they were served there drinks, food, and checks in a very timely fashion. (and yes they were part of our group)I will say this, the food that we did receive was good and the staff was friendly enough but still it does not make up for the service. The restaurant was not busy and we had reservations so it was not like they didn't know we were coming  which makes this even more puzzling. Maybe I will try again if and when I am downtown and just sit at the bar. Maybe it was the fact that we were a large party, but again the restaurant was not busy. Maybe they were just having an off night.According to Calvin Klein, the key to looking young is remaining thin. I certainly agree! Portions at this restaurant are definitely not big which is fine because I don't like to eat that much. My roommate and I had dinner here a few nights ago before seeing a show at the Herberger Theater. We met some of the lucky yelp elites who scored tickets to the Daddy Long Legs performance which, by the way, was enjoyable. We thought our service was efficient and attentive. We didn't have the same experience as Linda, but we were at another table, so everything seemed to run like clockwork. I don't drink spirits, but they do have a very interesting wine list. The food was also good, and reasonable. I certainly enjoyed the chilled cucumber soup. All of this plus a nice atmosphere makes Province a place worth, returning to time and time again.
Thai Basil Signature=I'm kind of worried about this place. First, this is for the new location Downtown. I guess they have another one in Park Central, but I've never seen it. When you call for takeout, they remind you of which location you're calling. I like that because some people are idiots and will probably go to the other one.I loooooooove the curried noodle dish. I've eaten it in the restaurant and ordered it for takeout.The service is super friendly and the place itself is really nice. Call ahead before going, though. I drove down there one night after checking their hours and they were closed. Who does that????? That's the main reason I'm worried about this place staying open. It gets a good lunch crowd, but they need to work on dinner, too.Prices are reasonable and on par with the 87 other Thai places Downtown.
McDonald's=This update has been way over due.But they have made several changes to their staff and thank God. It makes a world of a difference when you have customer service oriented employees. Some days it is still crowded and the service should be a little faster. It is FAST food. However, there have been several improvements and we have little to no problems now.
Leoné Café=Leoné Café is a step above the chain coffee houses and cafés.  I think they fall a little short when compared to the 4 star coffee establishments we have in Vegas...They are a strong 3 stars or a weak 4 stars in my book though.  They do a better job than most at offering gluten/dairy/soy free options for those with dietary needs.  I only end up here if I am already at Tivoli though.  I have not been impressed enough with any drinks, salads or breakfast items to come back specifically for them...nothing was bad, just easily forgettable.This review is for coffee and the pastries. I came in with Amelinda L. and Teresa S. last week after we had just grabbed dinner at View Wine Bar. After walking in, we were informed by one of the staff members that some of the pastries were 1/2 off. Great. As we took a closer look at the cakes and tarts at the counter, we were appalled to see a lot of not-so-hot looking little guys there. We're talking smudged frosting, and fruit that had been sitting out too long, i.e. strawberries that were shriveling and browning, plus a dried kiwi. Oh wait, no, it's just a kiwi slice that has seen better days.When looking at the pastries we asked a couple questions:Us: What is this pastry here? Guy: Uh...this is the caramel, and this is the strawberry, and I'm not sure (runs off to ask a coworker)Girl (who swoops in): That's a caramel, this is the strawberry chocolate, and that's the chocolate. It's my favorite!I love nondescriptive answers! Thanks for the enlightenment. Like I couldn't figure it out by the caramel drizzle, the strawberry sitting atop the second choice, and the chocolate garnish on the third. Worst of all, the conversation when ordering went like this:Me: I'd like two Nutella cappuccinos and the pumpkin latte - all medium size please.The same guy as earlier: Um, what size do you want the latte?Me: A medium? Guy: OKMe: I'd also like the strawberry chocolate cake and the carrot cake.Guy: OKMe: How much are those?---Guy runs off to check, and at this time the girl in the front proceeds to tell me again that some of the pastries were 1/2 off---Terrible. Hot mess express. When I pointed out that some of the tarts were severly dried out to the girl, she said "No, those are fine!" What a lie! Seriously, is this amateur hour? The two stars are for the barista..who seems to actually have a clue, since our drinks were totally on par. The rest of it though? No thank you.This is honestly the best coffee I've found in Vegas. I absolutely love the atmosphere and the employees are always so sweet. Amazing pastries too! Try an iced cappuccino, delish!!Hanging out at Tivoli with my kid, he wanted to stop by Cafe Leone for a snack. Who am I to say no? Especially when desserts are involved. Their display is on the small side while prices are on the high end. We can blame their Tivoli location for that. Everything here seems to have a sizeable mark-up compared to other off-Strip spots.The tiramisu ($5.75) was not good. It was almost all cream with very few lady fingers and lacking the liquor or espresso flavor that it should have. The cralin ($5.75) was much better fortunately. Chocolatey, crunchy, sweet, but not overwhelming, it was a huge step up from our first dessert, but still not on the same level as desserts found in the top tier bakeries on the west side.A year later, this spot deserves an update- and an upgrade!I'm not a fan of the Tivoli Village area but proximity to work makes it a good spot for lunch now that I've discovered (and thoroughly explored!)  their salads! The Champagne Chicken Berries is my favorite, but the Apple Chicken is a close second. Both are ~$11 and served in a small boat. No joke, these salads are massive, enough for a hearty lunch AND leftovers. And while they may not be the healthiest, you can request the dressing on the side and ask the to go light on the bleu cheese (or sub feta). But what's the fun in that?! Dine-in service is attentive, helpful, and happy to bring you anything you need. Can't believe I underestimated this place! Or used so many exclamation points!
Naked Pizza=There seems to be three types of pizza.  Chicago style, New York style, and the pizza that we actually buy and eat.  These days you go to a pizza joint and ask for thin crust and they say, "Sure, we've got non-existent crust."  And you say, "Yeah, I'll get the non-existent crust." Maybe I'm watching my weight; maybe I just don't like that much bread underneath my cheese; maybe it's none of your business.  And they say, "Yeah, that's good because our crust sucks." So it's great that there's actually a pizza joint where I can get some crust with character - crust with taste.  And the fact that I can get a slightly healthier pizza for my daughter is a plus that is hard to pass up as she could live off of pizza if one could actually live off of eating only mushroom pizza.  How a five-year old ever convinced herself to like mushrooms I'll never know.  My wife loves the skinny pizza with pineapple, feta cheese, hold the mozzarella, jalapenos, and onions.  Yeah, I know, that pizza makes even less sense than a five year old eating mushrooms.  Personally, I'm settling on a peperoni and basil combo with full crust.
Barfly=Takes airport bars to new heights with decent beer list and menu
Pasta China=Pasta China immediately caught my eye the first time I drove past it.  The name tells you everything you need to know going into the place, it's a mixture of Italian and Chinese cuisines.  There a few Italian-only and Chinese-only dishes, and five fusion dishes.  All are priced between $4.00-$6.00, so no breaking the bank here.I wanted a little kick in my meal, so I went for the Szechuan Angel: angel hair pasta with chicken tossed in a spicy peanut sauce (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z57kLRRnYXcaIhFZnxNJCA?select=mOwNIOGbhJLhNgWX9NUVFQ).  My entree came with a side salad and two pieces of garlic bread.  The salad had an odd dressing that I couldn't quite place; some bites tasted of sesame, others of citrus or orange.  The garlic bread was good as it was also topped with pesto.The real downside to the Szechuan Angel dish is that it wasn't spicy at all.  That was the main reason I ordered it, so that was a bummer.  The peanut flavor was a lot more subtle than other peanut sauces I've had; this can be a good or bad thing depending on your palate.  I was fine with it, I just wished it were spicy.  The entree is a generous portion and decent deal at $5.00.Many of the sides are only $1.00, so I also ordered the Curry Beef Puffs (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z57kLRRnYXcaIhFZnxNJCA?select=gUUVV5Zuapt7sL3TXNHq5g).  The filling is ground beef cooked with a yellow curry.  I've never had ground beef with curry before, but it turns out better than you would think.  It would be better if there were a stronger curry flavor!Overall you're getting a well portioned meal for no more than $6.00, and sides are cheap enough where you can order one while still eating for less than $10.  I think the food is decent, but your mileage may vary depending on your expectations and palate.  I'll be back again to explore the rest of the menu!Just came back from there and I kid you not, I have 3 to go boxes like I ordered take out. Funny thing is, me, my wife, and two kids actually ate dinner there. Here's the simplest way I can describe these guys. Pasta China is a Chinese/Italian fusion restaurant that serves you big portions at really good prices.Their entrees average 4 to 6 bucks and can easily feed 2 very hungry people. Since it was my first time here, I made the mistake of having everybody order their own entrée. Since the prices were decent, I decided we also needed to order an appetizer just in case it wasn't enough. I was so wrong. Every entrée comes on a huge plate. If you refer to my pic, my entrée was the Kung Pao-Ghetti. Its Kung Pao Chicken with Spaghetti Noodles. I chose a spiciness of 4 out of 10. Whoa. It was pretty spicy. For all you spice lovers you need to get this and make it a 10! My oldest ordered the Combination Fried Rice which had Shrimp, Pork, and Chicken. He could only eat half of it and he usually finishes his food. My youngest got the Bowtie Pasta with Chicken. He got it because it had Alfredo Sauce which he loves. His plate didn't even look like he touched it. Good thing my wife didn't order just yet because she was on her phone. After she saw all the food, she knew she didn't need to order anything at all.As for the service, there was this nice Asian lady that greeted, seated, took our order, and brought out our food. She even came around constantly to refill our waters. The only thing that she didn't do was cook our food. The location of the place is not bad at all. I see this place all the time driving by it on Craig Road. So when you drive by this place you cant help but wonder, "Chinese food with pasta?". The inside is nothing fancy. If anything, you just have basic chairs and tables. Doesn't bother me because I came there to eat, not to look at expensive paintings or high end wood flooring. Random info: They have a minimum of 5 bucks to use credit/debit cards. There is free wifi. The password is on the soda machine. There are separate solo bathrooms for men and women. Hours are Monday thru Saturday 11 am to 9 pm. Closed Sundays.Bottom line is, you get decent food, great portions, and nice service at decent prices. You can take your whole family and friends here without having to worry about the check. Im coming back for sure.
Filiberto's=Located just off the 101, I drop in here for lunch and breakfast quite often.  The Queso Monterrey is awesome and addictive and when it comes to mind, I have to have it.  Below are a few menu items I've sampled.Bean & Cheese Burrito, $2.50 or $1.98 with a couponhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/filibertos-scottsdale-2?select=oSJ58ABgIq2TFjeRLNTXmg#oSJ58ABgIq2TFjeRLNTXmgCarne Asada Burrito, $5.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/filibertos-scottsdale-2?select=jHXxF8BQJX-fWOmm08D3PA#jHXxF8BQJX-fWOmm08D3PAQuesadilla, $3.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/filibertos-scottsdale-2?select=6Ac-zNf8JfrsDKIENxje3Q#6Ac-zNf8JfrsDKIENxje3Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/filibertos-scottsdale-2?select=oEULZHEQrQjvI4GppysguA#oEULZHEQrQjvI4GppysguAChips, $1.00 w/Queso Monterrey, $3.00http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/filibertos-scottsdale-2?select=-O8i4x4IPRX9aa6yJZweFQ#-O8i4x4IPRX9aa6yJZweFQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/filibertos-scottsdale-2?select=TK-CGg1FzQH-0f1t--N25g#TK-CGg1FzQH-0f1t--N25ghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/filibertos-scottsdale-2?select=6T3NQkwl9DGSJBWFQAfwNg#6T3NQkwl9DGSJBWFQAfwNgThey have a Salsa bar where you can select from a variety of different Salsa flavors....mild, med, spicy.  There's also freshly sliced Radish and Lemon avail as well.There's plenty of seating in the restaurant, but it can get busy during the 12-1 pm lunch rush.  I usually go just before or after that time period.Return Factor - 90%
Two Hippies Gnarly Burger Joint=I like the freedom to pile up as much or as little as I want and they have a nice fresh selection!  ASK for sourdough bread, you won't regret it!Good service.  Nice decor, not over the top but very fun and lighthearted. You get Onion Rings OR Steak Fries OR Potato Salad as a side, no price difference.  Good thing I brought my Lunch Buddy - we  ended up with Fries AND O-rings...........life is GOOD.  Gnarly is a Great Addition to the neighborhood.  Definitely added to my list of favs.I'll start this review by divulging that "Build Your Own" concepts really stress me out. I don't go out to restaurants to BUILD MY OWN. That puts WAY too much pressure on me. I much prefer having someone to blame if I don't like what I'm eating, and with Build Your Own the only person I can blame is myself. If I wanted that kind of pressure, I'd have children.Also, how can you really accurately review a "Build Your Own" place. It's impossible! The quality of the experience is based on the reviewer's skill at building stuff! I don't want to know how good you are at making burgers, I want to know how good Two Hippies is at making burgers, AMIRIGHT?  That said, in effort to write a review of this establishment in a way most unaffected by my own culinary skills or lack thereof, I decided to order what I believe should be considered the quintessential "Cheeseburger". To me, that Cheeseburger is clearly: Bun, Burger, Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, PICKLE (Some say the pickle is debatable, and they are what's wrong with America) mayonnaise and ketchup.The burger was okay. I asked if I could get it cooked to order, medium rare, and they said yes but the burger was not medium rare. The meat didn't have a ton of flavor and I didn't even get a lot out of the cheese. But the toppings were quality and it was a good size so all-in-all, I enjoyed it. I did not enjoy the fries. I did not receive one fry that, when held vertically, could stand upright on its own devices. They all looked very sad. And it made me sad. I did enjoy the fact that they have Coke Zero and the fact that everything is a reasonable, set price, no matter what toppings you get (including good shit like mushrooms and guacamole). I also enjoy that it's BYOB (Bring Your Own Beer, not Build Your Own Burger. We've already discussed my thoughts on that). Though whenever I see a place is BYOB I always mentally note it and then never do it! I really need to be more proactive in my BYOBing. But it's still nice to know.Overall, while it wasn't the best burger of my life (through no fault of my own), their price and topping selection is good enough that I'll probably come back, even if it means I have to accept full responsibility of the outcome of my burger. Oh, and I'm going to bring beer.4.5/5This place is really fun and has great food.  I have had it bookmarked forever and finally have been up in their area for a training class so I gave it a try for the first time on Friday.  I took a couple of coworkers with me and we all enjoyed our food.  We called in the order when we left the office and they had it ready when we got there.  I had the mushroom and Swiss burger with pesto on a potato roll.  I love that blending of flavors and my burger was really good, but decided at the time that the next time I would get a double.  The burger isn't really too small for the bun, but they are good, hearty buns and a double would really fill it out well.  The homemade chips are just like I like them, light, crispy, and brown.  A couple of them were soggy, but overall they were very nice.  I got to try an onion ring and knew I wanted to order them the next time around as well.So...the very next day I brought my husband up to try it out.  We ordered a double and he chose the toppings.  It was something like mushroom, Swiss, bacon, and lettuce, with the onion rings.  I decided to try their brat with chips.  Everything was delicious.  The fresh buns really are a nice touch and we like the fact that you can bring up to 2 beers with you and drink them with the meal, as long as you are sitting inside.  I can easily handle and appreciate that.  The two gals working there are super friendly and helpful and add to the positive experience.  The only reason they aren't a perfect five stars for me is that the burgers do have a pressed look to them that leads me to believe they might have been frozen.  If they did freshly-ground, never-frozen beef for those burgers, they would really be over the top.  Aside from that though, as a whole, they put out some great food in a fun environment with funky album covers, posters, and memorabilia all over the place.  I love Billy Joel with those bedroom eyes staring at me while I'm in the can.  All the reminders of when the best music was created.  I look forward to my next visit.
Fatburger=After a few hours hanging out at the bar, I was in the mood for a Fatburger.  I ordered a Large Fatburger with Cheese.  The wait was the usual 15+ min....standard for Fatburger.  I appreciate the fresh food, so I don't mind the wait.  The Burger was awesome as usual.....it didn't have a chance.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EzUypdlXXX75D_Cj14DnuA?select=ZlevLbfaM4ZX2BkAxIQNowReturn Factor - 90%
Excalibur Pool=I stayed at this hotel during last year's Spring Break.The pools overall looked okay, and the hot tubs were very comfortable.As what some other people mentioned, there's no shade here at all. Make sure you have your powerful sunscreen with you when you're out there. Also, the pool area closes really early. It would be nice if they stayed open until the extreme late evening hours.You get a 42 inch tv, snacks, nonalcoholic drinks, upgraded chairs, and a mini fridge all for the $25 winter cabana rental fee.How can you beat that anywhere. I agree that this isn't the best pool in Vegas and they close the slide in winter. My kids are able to play as long as they want and I can relax and read a book as I watch them. I can tan on the upgraded chairs or sit in the shade. You can't beat the price and for twenty five dollars you can't go wrong. Even if you only use it for an hour you got your money out of it. It's January and the pool isn't even cold. The hot tub is empty because everyone is in the pool. One really good thing about this pool is that it has a shallow spot that kids can play on. If you don't like kids I say avoid this pool at all costs. They have an adult pool that you can use.One of the top kid friendly pools in Las Vegas.There are multiple pools and a lot of lounge chairs at the 30,000 square foot Excalibur pool area. The most exciting and family friendly of these pools is the Slide Pool which has a cool "rock" formation along one side of the pool that includes a very fun water slide as well as waterfalls flowing from the rocks onto the edges of the pool. Another pool has a very shallow area which is good for lying out in the sun while in the water or having your non-swimming kids playing in the water. You can upgrade to two plush lounge chairs, an umbrella and a bucket of ice with 3 small water bottles and 3 bags of chips for $50 until the pool area closes at 6pm.
Red Sushi=A friend and I came here on a Tuesday and were seated right away. The ambiance is really cool however I wasn't a fan of how close together the tables were. You could hear every single word coming out of the mouths of those around you.Save the far too intimate seating, the service was great. We got our order in quick and the drinks and sushi came out very fast. And thank god it did because these people know sushi. Edamame - same old same old, but good.Super volcano roll - dynamite. It combined all of my favorite things into one roll. Only bad part was it was so hard to eat - I had to eat the roll and toppings separate, but I did not mind.Tropical roll with spicy tuna - if you're a fan of the traditional spicy tuna roll, this is for you. They combine our favorite spicy tuna with delicious and fresh mango. Awesome sauce. I can't remember what my friend ordered, probably because I was so focused on my delicious rolls. But she said hers were just as fantastic. I don't know if I'd venture here on a busier night, but I will definitely be back!Okay, so it took me a long time to finally write a review about Red Sushi. Why? Maybe because I wanted to keep all the fresh sushi to myself. I've been here quite a few times and have had mainly their sushi. For lunch, you can get 2 rolls for only $10; add miso soup for only $1 more and you have a meal ;). The cool thing about their rolls is that they offer the good stuff and at good quality/freshness. For example, there's the Spicy Scallop or Crab (yes - real crab not crab imitation on their lunch menu), Duck Tempura Roll, Red Snapper, Yellowtail, Spicy Escolar...etc. My point is that they continue with quality even during lunch specials; majority of sushi joints here mainly offer crab imitation, shrimp, salmon and vegetables only during their lunch specials. Other than sushi, I've had their Grilled Black Cod, Calamari and P.E.I. Mussels (creamy bacon garlic white wine sauce) that were all pretty yummy. I've only had the cod once since $13 for an 'appetizer' portion hurt my wallet more than it filled my stomach, but the flavor is pretty worth it.All in all, it's a great place for lunch and dinner. Note: make reservations for dinner during the weekend or you'll find yourself on a 1hr+ waitlist.Check out more food photos here: http://www.getnmahbelly.com/2013/12/red-sushi/We had a pleasant but nonetheless disappointing experience at Sushi Red. While enjoying our cocktails, we watched one of the chefs craft one meticulous, gorgeous roll after another. But when served, we realized that he was stationed there for a reason: to impress diners while less talented chefs assembled rolls to his right in a less visible spot. Our rolls tasted good but were sloppily made compared to other places in town like Takumi. The rolls were sliced unevenly so each piece varied significantly in size. The end pieces were tiny and didn't have any fish. Between those problems and the pulsating music, I'd probably opt for Takumi or Muramoto over Sushi Red.
Sabi's Kitchen & Catering=Talk about a small place with big thai flavors, this is where you want to be for thai food. The owner, Sabi, is very nice and friendly and keeps her kitchen clean. Sabi dishes out some of the best thai food in Las Vegas. Prices are low & very affordable by anyone. Serivce is very good and fast. I am a chicken pad thai fanatic and a pineapple fried rice guy. So, I chose those items to eat. The pineapple fried rice was delicious and seasoned well. Rice was not mushy, had the right amount of curry and all the ingredients mixed well. The chicken pad thai is my favorite thai dish and Sabi sure knows how to cook it right to satisfy my taste buds. Not salty and seansoned to perfection with a little sweetness and the right amount of spicyness. Food tasted great and fresh. Winning!Okay, make sure you don't pass this place up. If you are near Arville and Hacienda or not near, stop by for a legit Thai food experience presented by Sabi.
Deville Dinerbar=You know.. It amazes me how a night can be going so well and how you can rate your experience very highly in your head until in one split second the manager ruins it all for you.Unfortunately that was our experience here.I had plans to come to Deville with a few girlfriends last week and was so excited to try it out because the reviews looked great.We were seated, and right away you could feel a funky vibe from the diner with bright purple lights and cool oldschool booths lining the space. After looking at the menus, we were told that the mango mojitos were the special of the day so we went with those and they were pretty good.We then ordered our mains (I had the Adam's Ribs) and received our food in under 20 minutes. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious, the cornbread sweet but well made, and the coleslaw was good too (not too smothered in mayo). I wasn't a fan of the matchstick fries, but that's just me.Others at my table also really enjoyed their food and overall experience.Once we finished dinner, we asked to see a dessert menu and were approached maybe 5 times by our server asking if we had made a decision. This was a little bit annoying because he was hovering but even then, I wasn't mentally taking any stars away from my review. We ordered the apple pie ice cream sandwich to share which was also very very well made.By that point, we had been at the diner for about two hours to 2.5 hours and had been chatting as most people do (9:30pm on a Thursday). We paid around that time also and proceeded to continue our conversation. Around 10, the manager came to our table pretty much kicking us out saying that she had reserved our table for another couple who had been waiting over 35 minutes for us to leave, and that she could seat us in a corner (our booth had access to the TV) because they wanted to watch the game, or we could just leave.Now you can imagine our disdain....no one had said anything to us about our table being reserved. We were paying customers who didn't really overstay their welcome in terms of going out for dinner, drinks, and dessert. And you can't just kick people out because they've paid their bill and now someone else wants our particular table (which was nothing special by the way).So, as you can imagine, the three of us left with a very bad taste in our mouths, and although I was really excited to bring other friends and family to try out the food here, it's safe to say that I will definitely not be back. There are tons of delicious options in Montreal with excellent service as I've mentioned before in another review or two. Bad service or being spoken to as we were for no reason is really not acceptable in a city where competitors are a dime a dozen.But to those of you reading to see if the food is good, it is. The service was quick and the decor is well done. Before the manager came over, I was planning on a 4 star review, but two stars removed for this unneccesary action on her part........
Baja California Restaurant & Cantina=I recently gave this place 3 stars for good food, great service, but not so awesome prices.  Reasonable review right?  Apparently, wrong. What I am reviewing with ONE star is the message I received back from the owner.  Not only did she accuse me of being a certain customer who used happy hour, restaurant.com and a yelp check in, she acted as though I had given her restaurant a horribly undeserved 1 star review instead of a more than half 3 star.  As it is, I am NOT that certain customer.  Not only am I not that person, I, as a customer, am extremely put off to learn that the management looks down upon those that use the very coupons they put out to draw people in.  I now realize why this place was completely dead the night we went in.  I do NOT appreciate being put down by ownership.  I thought my review was fair and honest.  Not only will I never be back, I will never recommend this place to anyone, ever.  Fresh food or not,  I don't like to be treated as such!
Aji Picante=DH literally dragged me here, ALMOST kicking & screaming.  I had read over their menu several times, and then read it over once again :P.  Nothing jumped out at me or grabbed my attention, not like Alma Pan.  I kept insisting that if he wanted to have Peruvian food that we go there instead, but he insisted.  So off we went on a late Friday evening with a bottle of Spanish wine in tow.  They are BYOB with NO corkage fee to my delight, I thought if the food was bad at least I could drown out the taste in my mouth.  I was delightfully surprised.  We ordered two appetizers, the "Torrejas de Choclo" & "Causa de Langostinos".  Both were bursting with flavor, and beautifully presented.  We were thrilled with the appetizers.  DH & I however shared an entree, which we did not like.  We got the "Paella Latina" which was bland bland bland, and oily!  Why the four stars?  Their appetizers were exquisite and I'm sure their other entrees are good, and I'll definitely be back to try them.  We finished off the meal with an amazing dessert "Port Wine Whipped Cream" on top of dulche de leche.  I could have inhaled it, and well I sort of did :).I also have to say the service is a huge plus here.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and talkative.  She explained the menu well and gave us suggestions.  We even got a free glass of chico morade on the house, which was refreshingly good.  It did not taste like it came from a mix at all.  I would highly recommend it!This review represents many "firsts"...a) my first post as Yelp Elite (in San Francisco such a status requires much relationship building, review writing, and general hobnobbing whereas in Cleveland you're invited to be Yelp Elite just by friending the right Yelper...oh, Cleveland), and b) my first post back home on the East Coast.  Living in Cleveland, I get to spend one or two days a week with my mom back home in Pittsburgh, where I'm discovering the foodie scene is pretty. damn. awesome.Take Aji Picante, for example.  We walked in post Bikram Yoga Squirrel Hill class around 8pm on a Friday night, no reservation, clutching a bottle of Trader Joes wine I'd brought with me, and they were able to squeeze us in.  And the experience was PERFECT from start to finish.  Our half-Peruvian waitress was just the right amount of attentive, genuine, and friendly...she provided the sort of service where you wonder if a 22% tip is enough.  The ambiance was warm and inviting and only a little loud.And the food...oh, the food.  The Causa de Langostinos was strange and spicy and delicious, a mushy blend of mashed potatoes, avocados and shrimp that somehow works perfectly.  We devoured our Torrejas de Choclo and scooped out every last bit of that minty sauce.  But the highlight was the special of the evening, a squash and vegetable stew that came served in a little pumpkin.  The perfect dish to warm up your insides on a cold night.And because it's BYO, with two appetizers, an entree and a dessert (the rustic creme brulee, not too sweet and very, very rich) the total cost was not bad at all.  I'm starting to think that the food snobbery I've built up after years in the fine dining industry in Philadelphia, and years eating my way through San Francisco, will be well satiated in Pittsburgh.  Cleveland better step it up!
Aly Baba=From the Jerusalem kids next door comes Aly Baba - all the cheap, tasty hits (falafel, shawarma, kebab, etc) in a sit-down, less linoleumed setting. Still 4 bucks and still my fav in town - ze falafel. One of only a couple veggie staples on the menu but a sweet rendition - 3 fried chickpea balls, chopped tomato, hummus, pickles, hot sauce, wrapped in lavash like a mini burrito, 4 bucks. If you're eating this on the go, you're going to need napkins (pita-stuffed 'lafel doesn't suffer this fate, rawr). Hummus and ganoush delish. A larger, more comprehensive (read:meatfull) menu for the rest of ya.Service smiley and efficient. Palatial side yard full of running fountains, wrought iron and stonework - comfy and gorgeous, with some goldfish darting around for added awesome factor.We lost a rad Viet place. But this'll do just fine when the falafel need hits.
The Dirty Pelican Grill=This place is probably closed by now.  Heard it was from the rumor mill.I hate to say it makes me happy because I really try to support local spots.  This one is so close to my house and I want it to be good so badly.  Its been through at least three different names/owners over the last couple years (Hammerheads, Portofino's Beach Bar, and Dirty Pelican).Every one of them were horrible.  Mediocre food at best.  Decent drink prices but the ambiance is just atrocious.  Ever want to have a beer at Wal-Mart or your local aquarium store?  Me either.  This place is a cross between them.  Unappealing, uninviting, just poor all the way around.Advice to the new owner...  Change the beach theme and lose the aquariums.  The place needs to be gutted.  Make us want to come in and when we get there give us service that makes us want to stay.The last time I was in there we had pretty bad service from the bartender.  He didn't notice us for quite a while sitting at the bar after we arrived (it was slow).  Then it was just poor from there on.  He didn't seem to know the food specials.  My wife and I both gave each other the "wow" look.  How does the bartender not know the happy hour specials?Turns out we get our bill and the guy (bartender) tells us he is the owner and to come back again soon.  WHAT!?If owned a bar...Such an unfortunate waste of space. The place has huge potential to be a phenomenal neighborhood bar. The staff had me waiting long enough to order a beverage that I was playing on my phone in order to waste time. They were too busy chit chatting about their personal life drama out loud instead of tending bar. When they finally did help me both bartenders had zero clue on pouring the proper 4 count. I ordered two different shots and they made up their own recipe. As a former bartender I would not recommend this place to anyone. Sorry Dirty Pelican but I recommend a phone call to bar rescue...
Shish Kabob House=I hate to slag on this place since their location on West Flamingo is one of my go to spots.  But I gotta call it like I see it.  For reasons I won't go into..I'm vegetarian for the month of January.  I am pretty much hating it so far and I'm only 5 days in but I figured I would try this place out since they offer a few things the W.Flam location doesn't.  These things include gyros, beef shawarma and FALAFEL.  I got the falafel plate since the only alternative was a "falafel burger".  I would've ordered a falafel sandwich w/ pita had that been a choice.  The atmosphere is pretty much set up for people on the go.  I imagine people on conventions might get a quick bite here.  Drunk bastards/bitches would be fine here since they're open til 3am daily and all their furniture is plastic.  So I was a bit excited when they brought out my plate.  4 huge falafel balls along with the usual things Shish Kabob House offers like the roasted pepper and tomato.  But they don't include salad at this location and the rice isn't as good here.  My excitement completely died as I had my first bite .  Dry, bland..almost like eating an overdone oatmeal raisin cookie and it kinda crumbled like it too.  They also served a side of super thick kinda tzatziki sauce which didn't go too well with it.  I would have much rather had tahini or hummus but I am not shelling out $4.95 for a side order of it.  Really unsatisfying.  I have no question that their kabob menu is just as excellent as the original location but they shouldn't be serving falafel here.  The W. Flamingo location is better to go to..ambiance (even though they use folding tables), side salad with your entree and music from their country as opposed to Fuse TV playing at the strip location.I might be back here...but it'll only be for LAMB CHOPS!!!
Burgatory=I just docked a star from my review of BRGR. There's a new sheriff in town, and he's telling BRGR to suck it. My brain is still spinning from so much awesome, so I'm going to have to enumerate everything I love about Burgatory. 1. Someone at Burgatory stole my iPod and hit 'shuffle'. I spent as much time singing along as I did chatting with my friends. Either my taste is becoming progressively more mainstream as I get older or there are some very cool (and aggressively non-hipster, I hope) people in charge of the music.2. Spiked milkshakes. Spiked Milkshakes. SPIKED MILKSHAKES. Heavens, what was I thinking when I foamed at the mouth over BRGR's? I wasn't thinking. I hadn't yet experienced Burgatory's Apple Pancake and Bacon shake. Did you absorb all the Awesome in that shake's name? Again: Apple. Pancake. Bacon. There's also alcohol in there, but it's almost secondary to the chunks of apple and bacon floating in the heavenly swirls of Happy. The whipped cream tasted homemade and worked surprisingly well with the slice of bacon (A SLICE OF BACON!) adorning the side of the glass. Oh, heavens. I'm having heart palpitations just thinking about how amazing it was. My friends' milkshakes were equally swoon-worthy: the bourbon and caramel soaked Grandad's Secret and the rummy banana goodness of Monkey Business.  3. The menu burgers were insanely creative, and unlike BRGR, you can create your own masterpieces. A little gouda here, some Kona rub there; Cabernet sauce here, applewood bacon there. The possibilities are endless... and DELICIOUS. The only area Burgatory seems to fail is with well-done burgers. A little too dry. But not enough to take away from the overall experience. And even if the burgers totally sucked, the milkshakes would've made up for it. Seriously. I would go to the restaurant just to drink myself into ice-creamy oblivion. Word of warning: because Burgatory is still in its infancy, it gets packed very, very quickly. We waited over 75 minutes for our seats. And every minute was worth it.Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness! These burgers are delicious! I absolutely love burgers! My wife heard about this place and decided to take me here. I love her! We went on a Friday night and the place was packed! We had a 25 minute wait but it went by quick. (thank God for Angry Birds!) So the hostess came and took us to our booth. FYI walk slowly or you will bust your ass. Their floor is extremely slippery. I don't know if there's grease on the floor or what. We looked over the menu and started off with the Berry Lemonade and the Bourbon BBQ Sriracha Wings. They were both delicious! Next we both had the Standard Deluxe Burger. It's a burger with White American Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and their House Burger Sauce. It was huge and outstanding! The homemade potato chips are really good also. I also like the fact that you can build your own burger in 7 steps . Step 1. Pick your burger. You have a choice of beef, chicken, bison, sausage, lumb crab or veggie patty as a burger. Step 2. Pick your bun. Next you pick your bun with Brioche, Wheat, Baguette, Focaccia, Topless or Full Monty Style as choices Step 3. Pick your rub. Choose from Angel Dust, Kona Crust, BBQ, Kingston Jerk, Cracked Peppercorn and Bayou Cajun Step 4. Pick your cheese for $1 more Choose from Cheddar, White American, Horseradish Cheddar, Sharp Provolone, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, Smoked Gouda and Buffalo Cheddar. Step 5. Pick your sauce. Choose from Bourbon BBQ, Dijon Mayo, Banana Ketchup, House Sauce, Spicy Marinara, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Roasted Garlic Mayo, Sriracha Remoulade, Buttermilk Ranch, Spicy Ketchup, Whole Grain Mustard, Avocado Wasabi, Bleu Cheese Dressing, Buffalo Sauce, Relish and Chipotle Sour Cream Step 6. Pick a topping for $1 more. Choose from Fried Egg, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Avocado, Chicken Chili, Caramelized Onion Marmalade, Grilled Pineapple, Sautéed Mushrooms, Maple Cured Ham, Onion Straws, Roasted Tomatoes, Grilled Onions, Brandied Peppercorn, Cabernet Sauce and Roasted Red Peppers. Step 7. Pick a free topping. Choose from Iceberg, Romaine, Field Greens, Baby Spinach, Arugula, Red Onion, Tomato, Poblano Peppers, Cucumbers, Banana Peppers, Bread & Butter Pickles and Jalapenos. Lots of choices and ways to customize your burger. Burgatory is my new favorite burger place!We came in late on a Saturday afternoon.  The place was busy, but not overly packed.  They were advised of a 25 minutes wait, they took our number so they could text us and sent us on our way.We got a table in the "patio" area.  Our server greeted us right away and I went straight for a Monkey business shake.  The shake wasn't very thick and I was surprised by the weird pieces of banana and the mountain of whipped creme.  But still, very yummy.I am a fan of the build your own burger.  Loved their whole wheat buns.  My burger was very thick and perfectly cooked.  I got the angel dust and bourbon barbeque.  BJ got the Crab Shack.  Not exactly jumbo lump crab meat, it was very flavorful.  I really wanted to try the What-A-Jerk chicken burger, but was advised this isn't wasn't all white meat.  The only downside was the potato chips.  They were just taking up space on my plate.  We didn't like 'em.   We really liked it here and will visit again.I just have to share with yinz how much I LOVE their spiked milkshakes!  I know, I know...it's a burger place.  It's called BURGATORY for gosh sakes!  But, gosh darnit, those shakes are killer!  I just had my second one today, the S'Mores, and it was beyond amazing...They bring it to you with a huge seared marshmallow in a large 20oz glass, with a tin of the extra inside.  It's supersize American all the way, and I love it!  It's made with vanilla ice cream and chocolate liquor, with tiny graham cracker crumbs inside.  The first milkshake I had was the Almond Torte, which is made with Prantl's Burnt Almond Torte with vanilla vodka and amaretto.  I'd have to say this is a close call between which one is better.  Either or are gonna satisfy your sweet tooth.  Okay, so the burgers.  Still good.  Still a lot to decide on!  They give you a whole sheet of options to make your perfect burger.  Seriously, any way you've ever thought of making your burger, I'm sure you could get it here!  I always go with the whole wheat bun (to make myself feel better about that shake) and my only gripe is it falls apart as soon as you pick it up.  So I usually eat the burger with a fork.  I had come here when the place first opened and I wasn't too into the chips they server with the burger.  They were a little limp.  Now they're nice and crunchy, still with the mix of sweet potato and regular.  I just hope they bring a Burgatory closer to town...although that boozy milkshake will be calling for me!What can I say that hasn't been said. Outstanding burgers, should be enough to say.Went for lunch Saturday of memorial day weekend. Got there at 2 and the place was pretty full with at 15 minute wait for a party of three. But actually got seated in a booth in 10 minutes.Service was pretty quick, I'd say within 3 minutes or less after seating. Got the drink orders in right away while we looked over the menu and the build your own configuration sheets.I ordered the standard deluxe with white American, and their own house burger sauce, done pink. I also ordered the fries instead of the chips which come with.Jody ordered the bison burger and Linda the Crab Shack.Jody, who has been around and is hard to please gave his an 8 or 9 out of ten. That's a real complement. Linda said she loved the crab shack. Also we had two shakes, one just plain chocolate shake and Linda had the Espresso Love which sounded great and was except it was just kind of too sweet.Funny thing happened while we were here when the power went out for a few minutes. Just a little added excitement.Well we will all be coming back here again to try and work our way through the menu and all the options. This place is highly recommended by usens.Some people say that everyone is creative, that even the small choices that a person makes are his or her art--the fruits on our breakfast plate, the washed-out blue denim with the herringbone blazer, the scenic drive over the straight shot. For people who appreciate this, the Burgatory menu is a thing of beauty. It's like sitting down with a skilled artist who has laid out all sorts of materials--oil paints, watercolors, pastels, charcoal, googly eyes--and you get to choose all of your favorites for them to create a masterpiece. Charcoal with deep red paint. Pastel pinks with glitter. Except, you know, this involves food, which is the actual best thing ever.Caramelized onion marmalade, truffled shallot aioli, angel dust rub, cabernet sauce, bacon jam. Literally anyone can be made happy with meat choices including elk and bison, regular beef, chicken, crab (!?) and veggie burgers. Traditional white bun, whole wheat, or no bun at all--among other options. If you're not up for trying to pair BBQ with sriracha and horseradish cream and just want food in your mouth stat, there are some predesigned burgers that are their own works of art. Help yourself to a Monet. And it's always possible to get a regular burger on a white bun with lettuce and tomato. But then there are the shakes: s'mores, caramel pretzel, apple pancakes and bacon, Nutella crunch. Some are spiked. This arrangement is actually too ridiculously wonderful to exist, but there you go. Show up, eat beautiful things. Die happy."I think everything in life is art. what you do. how you dress. the way you love someone, and how you talk. your smile and your personality. what you believe in, and all your dreams. the way you drink your tea. how you decorate your home. or party. your grocery list. the food you make. how your writing looks. and the way you feel. life is art." --h.b. carterYummy, yummy, yummy I got Burgatory in my tummy is what I was singing in my head my last trip here...  I should preface that this was the first time I have eaten in at Burgatory, as other attempts were halted due to extreme wait times.  In the past my office has ordered takeout from the Waterworks location.  The take-out was still yummy, but through transportation and whatnot the burger arrived pretty messed up.  So eating in is my preferred method.Last time there was a real treat as I usually don't get to go out to eat for lunch due to time constraints and this chain they have on my leg attached to my desk, however I was in luck this day.  My Operations Manager was in town that week and asked if he could take me out to lunch to talk about some things.  I happily excepted and strongly suggested Burgatory, so off we went.  When we got there we didn't have to wait for a table, which is something I had yet to experience with other attempts to eat here.  Seated I looked at the menu and decided on the build your own burger...  I went with the Dry Aged Wagyu, on a wheat bun, with Diablo Dust, Smoked Gouda, Sriracha Remoulade (on the side) with lettuce tomato, onion, and jalapenos.  I like my burgers cooked medium rare, I think Burgatory cooks closer to rare in the middle but that doesn't bother me, but as a tip I would suggest most people would like it a little more cooked.  I on the other hand was extremely pleased.  The burger didn't take too long to come out so we spent the next 10-15 minutes in complete silence as we ate...  Oh so much better than takeout!  This is up there with one of the best burgers I've ever had, and since it's on the boss it was also the cheapest, meaning free.  Can't turn that down ever.  Can't wait until they finish their new location east of the city, 3 miles from me : )Burgatory is probably the most hyped burger bar in Pittsburgh.  I would reccomend coming at non-peak hours or when the store opens... This place gets packed.I ordered the hard Espresso shake ($8.50) at 11:00 in the morning because I wanted to try it.  The shake was quite good.  It wasn't an overpowering amount of alcohol, nor negligent.  If you do order a shake, they are large, and you will want to be prepared to take some burger home with you.  I tested out a fairly standard burger.  I ordered a Standard Deluxe Burger ($9.50), which came on a Brioche Bun with Smoked Gouda, Lettuce, Tomato, and House Sauce.  The burger wasn't overly memorable but tasted good.Is it worth waiting hours in line to eat at Burgatory?  Absolutely not.  But if you want a quality burger and the wait isn't too bad, check it out.
Ben's BBQ & Smokehouse=While at Vegas StrEATS downtown, I sampled a pulled pork sandwich that Ben's BBQ brought to the VIP yelp tent. It was pretty good so I walked down to Ben's food truck and purchased a "Hot Link Sandwich" priced at $7. It tasted good but it should have been called a hot link slider because it wasn't very big. I don't mind that it came on a hamburger bun however for the $7 it cost it should have been a bigger hamburger bun with more links in it. The bbq sauce on it was decent but it was just a drizzle and could have used some more. It was just too bad that the guy taking the order was in such a hurry (there was no line BTW) that he didn't realize my husband who was standing right next to me might want to order something. I guess he thought the $7  mini sandwich would fill us both up!? The food is good but the specials they had going on during this visit to their truck left me still hungry and feeling like I payed too much.
The Flame Broiler=This is a welcome dinner destination after practice with my swim team in the nearby Student Recreation Center of ASU.  The place is small, clean, and basic; service is fast. Simple menu and tasty, healthy food at a good price. My favorite is "The Works" - beef, chicken, veggies, and rice, topped with green onion; I jazz it up a bit with sriacha because I like this kind of food spicy.
Rocky's Bar and Grill=The good old  Las Vegas bar and grill, the place where the end of the work week merges into the weekend. This past Saturday, Rocky's Bar &  Grill (abbreviated Rocky's) was the bar and grill where my work week merged into my weekend.   Rocky's is located in the small shopping center at the southeast corner of Maryland Parkway at Windmill Lane. The locally famous Grouchy John's Coffee Shop is the landmark.   For a couple of years I had been parking near Rocky's when I hung out in Grouchy John's. I never stepped inside until this weekend.   In similar style to many bars and grills, Windows here are nonexistent. Once I stepped inside the heavy brown doors, I left the outside world for an isolated world of dining, gambling, and moderate drinking. In similar style to several bars and grills, the layout is a dimly lit restaurant separate from the smoky bar and lounge.   From the time I walked through the doors, I waited a few minutes to be acknowledged. The host and only waiter Roland arrived a few minutes later. He was friendly and professional. He invited me to sit anywhere. I chose a comfortable booth in a room that was sporadically populated and quiet to the degree that it is a nice place for a date or me time. The primary sounds were the hard Rock classics playing at a soft volume.   My mind was set on the chicken parmesan sandwich. When it came time to ordering, Roland let fall that it is a hero style sandwich that doesn't come with fries. Okay. I'd order the fish & chips.   The three large pieces of cod and the steak fries were tastational and filling. The portions were large to the point of Roland placing a second plate containing  bowls of tarter sauce and cole slaw. The cole slaw was out of this World. Rocky gives the knockout punch with the cole slaw. I give Rocky's kudos for including cole slaw with the fish & chips. In my opinion, fish & chips without cole slaw is like nachos without cheese. Yet, it amazes me that there are so many restaurants that just don't get it and exclude cole slaw with fish &  chips. A few restaurants that I lately reviewed that are guilty of this are Village Pub and Red Robin. This delicious cole slaw rounded up my rating from 3.5 to 4 stars. The fish &  chips with bottomless Pepsi came out to $14.47 before tipping Roland.   If I was still hungry, I could of ordered a homemade apple cobbler or vanilla ice cream. Subsequently to the end of the work week dinner, I  headed for the beginning of the weekend revelry in the bar/lounge.   The bar/lounge is a long rectangular space with sofa style chairs and a bar with monitors above showing sports and video gaming below. I played my video Keno while enjoying a $3 PBR and watching the UFC. I shared the bar and lounge with a friendly clientele.   Time went by fast. When I opened the heavy brown door to return to the real World I had a few thoughts lingering on the isolated World of Rocky's. As I put the thoughts to words they are that this is a good spot in the Southeast Valley to enjoy tasty fish & chips that include delicious Cole slaw before a cold one and some moderate gaming or watching a sports event.         I                                                                  I        I        Pictures of the food &  menu       I    \  I  /                                                           \  I  /      \I/                                                               \l/
Yorkmont Deli=I heard from a buddy that place has amazing fried chicken. So I came in, ordered a three-piece meal, with a side of mac n' cheese and potato wedges. I must say, these guys have fried chicken covered. It was delicious!My friend ordered a pizza, which was a tasty and valuable choice only because all toppings are complimentary. However, the juicy fried breast, thigh, and leg that I managed to eat all in one sitting were nothing short of amazing, particularly with their homemade gravy! Their sweet tea is very sweet, which I think works only in the South, haha.The workers here are very friendly and polite. The owner of this restaurant is a sweet man, and is extremely approachable. The service is top notch!I will definitely come back again.
Crescent Ballroom=Great sound, nicely laid out space, good service, solid beers on tap... This place is a game-changer. The lounge area on the street is awesome, and opens today (and everyday) from four PM till 2 AM. The concert space is great, as well. A knee-high stage has plenty of room for large acts, while in the back of the room, tired/lame attendees can relax in the bleachers. The bathrooms, while boring,  were spotless. We'll see how long that lasts, haha. I can't WAIT to update this review with more experiences. (ESPECIALLY FOOD!!! Next week!!!!!)This is the new mecca of Phoenix music. Charlie Levy who booked for the now legendary Nita's Hideaway and also the owner of Stateside Presents is the man behind it all! He is a music fan first and ... well ... that's just what he is ... a music fan not a natural businessman. The place is just beautiful (for now, soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt). The room is small ... stage big (for the size) ... no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come!Thank you Charlie!Music fans unite! This place MUST thrive!btw ... they have live music every single night of the week ... and they open at 4pm every day (the lounge will have musicians and DJs for your entertainment).I have a confession to make. I am... A hipster. It's happened. And ya know what? I'm okay with it. We came here last night in search of PBRs and live music. We got that. And so much more. As we're standing there sipping our Champagne of Beers and someone says:"Damn, that's a really good Jimmy Eat World cover band playing."And then someone else says:"Wait a second! That IS Jimmy Eat World!"So awesome. So 2001.The atmosphere of this place is great. You have a big outdoor area with space heaters for the cancer lovers, a nice sized front area for the boozers with high top tables and low tables, also plenty of room to stand and chill. The music venue is spacious and well amped. Apparently the food is great, I would definitely give it a try next time.One star off for the minimal bathrooms. There was always a huge line.I saw a really great show here with my girlfriend and friend.  The venue itself, I think, has too many bizarre rules and they are pretty disorganized.Going to take a piss, I'd just bought a beer and, hey, I kinda like pissing with a beer.  It's fun!  Above the urinals they have these metal deals that are perfect for setting a drink on, in fact I can't think of a single other application in which they might come in handy.  As I walk in, this security dude goes, "Hey!  You can't bring your beer in there," and I'm like, "Well, I'm gonna set it down right here, then..." when I came out, fuck, my beer was gone and so was the security dude.  Thanks, asshole, this place doesn't charge you up the ass for a drink or anything, anyway...Later on that night, the bar lost my friend's ATM card, and as she periodically checked the balance, she saw that at least one charge she wasn't present for at $2 went through.  Lovely.The venue itself is fine, in terms of set up.  It could stand to be bigger, because this fucker gets packed to the gills, and apparently it gets ten times more packed than it was when I saw it.It really doesn't get any better than Crescent! I have been saving up all these wonderful things to say in a review about Crescent Ballroom but, if I wait any longer I will never write it...Every show, every experience at the bar, every encounter with the staff, it all just gets better all the time. Something in the water perhaps? This venue is the tits! The show room is so intimate. You can get up close and personal with your favourite artists or chill back in the stadium bleachers There's not a bad spot to stop and listen in the whole place. The sound, the lights, the temperature! Its all oddly perfect. You are never really standing on top of someone else and I really love that. But some sold out shows do get packed.Los Dias de la Crescent was such a stand out event for me this past year. Really a unique experience at a venue other than a park. They have a good beer selection! Though they don't have Hop Knot on tap I can order it in a can or, in lieu, grab an Odells on draft. I have not had a chance to order food from the cocina but I have tried the nachos and they do not disappoint!I try to see at least two shows a month here. No reason not to! So many great artist and at such an intimate venue. Stop over at Stinkweeds, pick up some tickets and get your bottom to a show!Nice, large new venue, & decently priced. Sorry Marquee, I dont care to pay $25.00 to see local bands play.Lots of seating in the front bar and a pretty nice patio. Loved that there is seating in the actual venue AND that if you use it, you can still see the bands!they have some pretty tasty cocktails on the menu here that are available at the bar inside the actual venue or the regular bar.The staff seemed to be very courteous, even w/ it being SO busy while we were there.Depending on who's playing, we'll likely be back!Hands down, my absolute favorite venue in all of the Valley.I've seen about 6 or 7 shows here now.  It's a very intimate place, where even from the seating (stadium bleachers, for reals) you are still very much "there".  Pricing, including fees, are very reasonable.  I've rarely paid over $20 for a show, and one at that price even included the artist's new album (thanks, Donovan Frankenreiter!)The food looks and smells delicious, though I've never ordered any yet. Plenty of lunch specials are advertised via Facebook.  Yes, I am a Facebook fan as well!  I appreciate the help-yourself water and cups, so that the wait for drinks at the bar is not held up by a request for 10 waters. Mixed drinks (vodka press, at least) are an extremely reasonable $4 or $5.  Crazy cheap for a music venue. Beer selection is well-thought out as well.Bathrooms are always clean and well-stocked...even at the end of the night.  Practically a miracle.Staff is super friendly. Seriously.  This place has no flaws!Parking is always an easy $5 cash payment at the lot across the street.  Easily accessible to the PHX Light Rail as well, but I've only gone that route once.I notice most other reviews have lots of hipster references.  Can't say that I notice a huge influx of hipsters here versus other similarly sized music venues.  Could that mean that...I am.. *gasp*..a hipster myself?  Uhhh...I say nah...only because I don't own enough hats or mustache-inspired clothing/accessories to quality.  Yet.The Wife took me here for a Date Night to see her band ZZ Ward and have a few drinks. We both really enjoyed the ease and simplicity of the whole experience. Parking is right out back for around $5. Tickets for the show were $15 each and both the drinks and food were very affordable and tasty.Inside has a small lounge up front where you can enjoy some good eats and drinks. You can even hear the bands playing in certain areas without getting a ticket. There is also a small patio that you can use if you need to light one up or just get some fresh air.The bands are in the middle section and it is a rather large area. Most of the people listening are standing up by the stage and you can move around wherever you want to go. There are also some bleachers along the wall if want to listen sitting down. Really like the cool bar area in the back when you need a quick refill and the easy access bathrooms when it is time to go. Nice!This particular show was sold out and packed to the rim. Even with a full crowd it was still a very enjoyable event. The sound is pretty amazing no matter where you listen. It does have a tendency to get pretty loud at times so you may want to bring some ear plugs as an option.Get there early so you can goof off and work on your buzz. The music can go for a few hours depending on the length of the sets and who is playing. We both ordered the giant Lalo Guerrrero Burger to soak up some suds before the main act and it was delicious.Don't tell the wife but I thought ZZ Ward was really CUTE and could easily be my new Yelp Current Crush. Definitely will be back for another show soon. Check online for tickets and schedules. COOL MAN!4.5 STARSThis is my spot! I come here quite often. Cheap drinks, fun & friendly staff. Just don't be a drunk douchebag and they won't mess with you. It's simple.I've been to Crescent several times, but on this last visit, I noticed just how old I am. I literally could not handle the sound level of the music. My first move was to rummage through my purse to see if there was anything to stick in my ears. For some reason, I actually had ear plugs in my purse. I guess when you turn 30, you just start carrying crap like that around. Unfortunately, my boyfriend does not carry ear plugs or a man purse to put them in. So our second move, was to go outside on the patio. When people started smoking around us, we were forced back inside ... because smelling like smoke is now something I avoid like the plague. Then we sat on a bench and decided that if we were just going to sit there and talk to each other, we might as well go home. Now that is sad. I would definitely recommend this place to see a band, but for the love of God, the music in the front room is so loud it hurts. It's just not worth the hearing damage. Yes, I turned 31 last month.Have you ever experienced that moment where you realize you're not half as cool as you think you are? Yeah... well Crescent Ballroom did that for me. The first and only time I've come here, was to play Bingo. That statement alone should be enough evidence to myself and anyone else who will listen that my days of coolness have passed. If they ever existed at all.This place is pretty sweet. I had dinner before Bingo because grandpa (me) knew it might be a late night and I didn't want to eat after I left here. Doing something like that would lead to a night of indigestion and no sleep. Psssh... who needs that in their life. Am I right? I tried the carne asada quesadilla and it was unexpectedly good. I would eat here again without a doubt. The Bingo was played in the concert area. I'm not gonna lie... it was fun. The event was put on by Jackalope Ranch and emceed by the National Comedy Theater of Phoenix. They did a great job. Funny people. Especially this guy Marcus. Hilarious. They were all about audience participation. Like it or not. I was actually glad I never won a hand of Bingo because then you had to go up on stage and try to match wits with a trained comedian. I don't need that in my life. I'm the kind of person who thinks of a comeback 3 days later. It was a lot of fun though. Crescent Ballroom seems like it would be an amazing live music venue. I checked the calendar and there was not one band that I knew. Oh, wait... except the Toadies. You know the "hipster" line, you wouldn't know who they are... Well they're right. I don't. Bottom line is that this place is cool. A solid 4. Hopefully one day a band I know will play here and I can bump it to a 5. Until then I'll live in happy acceptance that my days of coolness are behind me.They must have recently hired a new crew. Last two times I've been there, there's one girl in particular who is insufferably rude. PRO TIP: bring cash for the bars. Every time I go there, my card either gets charged twice or I get overcharged.Small, intimate venue for shows/concerts in the middle of downtown. The bar is located at the end of the ballroom, near the bathrooms. There are three rows of "stadium" seating toward the back, facing the stage. Overall, clean, cute atmosphere and cheap drinks - $5 for my usual vodka cranberry. Had a great time seeing Yus, Mas Ysa, and EMA here - and Crescent Ballroom made the event free - which was awesome!What's not to love! How can a place called the Crescent Ballroom not be an experience! It is not a place where little old ladies dodder around, looking for a handsome, dashing, debonair dance partner. It is also not a place for the faint of heart who wish to challenge the trivia gods on a Sunday night.It is primarily a music venue where local acts can hone their skills in front of an appreciative audience of just post adolescent audiophiles.If you do venture out on a Sunday evening to play trivia here, be prepared to be completely destroyed by the local experts. They really know their stuff. There is some parking around back and I think you have to pay unless you are a gambler.The food choices are limited but they do have an eat-your-face-off plate of nachos that should satisfy anyone's hunger.The drink choices are quite acceptable if you can get the waiter to hear what you want.Try this place. You won't be disappointed.
Azuza Hookah Lounge & Cafe=I loved it here. The menu is clear. Prices are fair. The ambiance is prefect. I could stay here all day/night. The staff were exceptional. This place has already been recommended to friends and I will continue to do so. I say yes!
Malaya Kitchen=Oh, Malaya Kitchen. How in the world have I passed by your doors for so long after dwelling, eating and shopping in and around the Arboretum for so long? Made it in after finding another restaurant was closed on a Sunday afternoon. Boy, oh boy, am I glad they were closed! These guys are on my culinary map for good. A quaint, low-lit dining room with a few tables, bench/booth-ish seats and a full bar. We made it in around 1:30pm and were seated immediately. For you soda drinkers, know that if you order a coke, you'll get a 12oz can with a cup of ice. Kind of a bummer, but I guess it's better that limit the intake to one per meal. We started out with the Roti Telur. "Pancake" style app with egg, onions and peppers served with an incredible curry dipping sauce. There are a few potatoes in the curry sauce. Like little starch boats floating in a delicious stream of Malaysian happiness. That good. Each bite was perfect as it was drenched with the curry sauce and a little added sriracha. I saved the curry sauce for the rest of the meal!My wife had the Stir Fried Okra and Belacan Sauce. Served with white or brown rice. The sauce was spicy and smoky. It had a hint of fruitiness. Kind of difficult to pinpoint but each bite was intriguing. The veggies were aplenty among the rice and sauce. I ordered the Char Kway Teow. Malaysian pan fried noodles with red onions and bean sprouts. I ordered it with chicken. WHOA. Smoky, tender noodles with so much chicken in each bite, I'd thought there wouldn't be any left for anyone else to order! I added the remaining curry sauce to my entire plate and couldn't have been happier. Whoever discovered this flavor profile deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. I cleaned my plate. Our server was so helpful and described each dish and how it was made. Very nice and so happy! The prices are very, very fair for lunch. We ate for just over $20. Can't go wrong in that department. Thanks, Malaya Kitchen. We'll be back soon and very soon.

Thanks all! Malaya Kitchen is a wonderful little gem in the Arboretum.  It's cozy and comfortable and the servers are so helpful.  You can tell they love explaining their dishes to newbies.  My hubby and I had the Malay Roll - it's seasoned ground chicken rolled up in tofu skin and deep fried - it's served with a sweet-chili sauce and it was delicious.  It reminds me of a Chinese-Filipino dish, called Kikiam, I grew up with and it brought back some really nice memories.  We also had the Hainan Chicken  - it's poached chicken served at room temperature with the most amazing rice! And last but not least, we had the Char Kway Teow   - pan fried noodles - oh my - so good.Can't wait to go back! And their hours fit folks who tend to eat late - they close at 11:00 PM Mondays -Thursdays, at 12:00 Midnight on Fridays and 10:00 PM on Sundays.
Estiatorio Milos=Up until dining at Milos, my Greek food experience has been gyros from a truck and/or sitting in a divey restaurant where ladies with hairy chins serve up greasy plates of spanakopita and crinkle fries. Delicious nonetheless, but certainly not what you get at this upscale Las Vegas eatery. Yes, Milos is fancy. Not pretentious fancy, but they do have linen tablecloths and fancy art on the walls. Because it's Vegas, you don't necessarily have to dress up to dine out here (you see it all!) but I wouldn't want to come in here wearing jorts and a cutoff t-shirt. Just sayin'. This is the type of place where you could show off your hella proper table manners ;)Apparently this spot gets pretty crowded at night, so we came here for a late lunch. It was not busy at all! In fact, we were one of two tables seated in the entire restaurant. I felt kind of bad for our waiter since he was obviously wanting to chat with us, but kept his distance as to avoid being annoying. The prix-fixe menu is definitely the way to go. As many have mentioned, it's a good deal for the amount of food you're served. Definitely go with the grilled octopus as your first course - it's quite spectacular. I've always liked this eight-legged food, but have really started to appreciate it over the last few months. I had the shrimp as a main course and it was also delicious. For dessert, it was the yogurt martini. IMHO, Greek food is not synonymous with dessert, but this was about as good as you can get.We were in and out within an hour, although we could've stuck around much longer. I would imagine that this would be a place to take business clients or a good friend for a midday meal. Or if you want to call ahead a few weeks in advance, go here for dinner. It's classy, good food and excellent service.If you are looking for a fancy seafood lunch under twenty bucks on strip, you should definitely consider Milos. It offers lunch menu with 3 courses for $20.12 from Monday through Sunday. You can chose one from 6 different appetizers, 6 different main courses, and 3 options of deserts. I came here with my mom for Sunday lunch, and got seated at terrace. Atmosphere at terrace was very relaxing with stylish ambiance. My first course was fresh diver scallop skewer. Scallop tasted very fresh. It was cooked perfectly with right amount of seasoning. I could still taste sweetness of fresh scallops from my dish.  I had grilled Mediterranean bass as my main course. It was absolutely delicious!!! Fish meat tasted very elegant. Chef removed all the fish bones during preparations, so I could enjoy my dish with no worries. Bass was grilled beautifully with little seasoning of olive oil and sea salt. Is was simple and just perfect. I had walnut cake as desert. It was light and not too sweet. Overall I had a great time here, and would definitely be back very soon with friends and family. Milos truly won 5 starts on my yelp book. It is truly worthy every penny I spent here. Two thumbs up!!!I have no legit excuse why it has taken me so freakin long to hit up this place for lunch.  It's not like there aren't enough 5 star reviews on it already:P  I've read them all, had this place bookmarked forever and it lived up to the hype!  Definitely won't take as long to come back here.  My petite wife gets cold pretty easily.  Anyone else ever bring a snuggie to the movie theater?  So being seated on the terrace was the clear choice.  The sunlight, high ceilings and decor really transports you somewhere else.  The indoor dining area isn't too shabby either but this is where it's at!Down to business!  The 3 course lunch for $20.12 was what we were here for.  Appetizer:My wife got the Greek meze plate which had tarama (creamy paste with fish roe), tzatziki (cucumber yogurt), htipiti (Greek feta dip, kinda like hummus), manouri cheese (like super creamy feta), olives and cherry tomatoes along with a side of pita.  Yum yum.  The tarama was the clear standout as it was the first time either of us had eaten that before.  I love fish roe and all things caviar.  I shelled out the extra $10 for the grilled octopus: sashimi quality Mediterranean octopus, charcoal-broiled with lemon and olive oil.  It was worth every....single....penny.  Grilled octopus has to be one of the top 10 meats of all time!  I cut the pieces even smaller to try and savor each bite.  Entree:And just when I thought things couldn't get any better...they DID!  The waiter and a lot of Yelp reviews stressed the Lavraki (grilled Mediterranean bass) and it was so fucking good.  I could eat this for lunch 3 times a week for the rest of my life easy!!  A whole bass grilled up with lemon and oil was simple yet perfect.  I even ate the head bits and eyeballs for chrissakes!! My wife went with the tuna burger but it was pretty much carb overload at that point.  Between the second bread basket, pita from the meze and then the bun on the burger, she just went from the protein.  The tuna was cooked nicely.  I think there was an orange slice in it?  The zuchinni fries were great as well.  They added mint to them which had them take on a whole different taste than the usual way they're done.  Dessert:     Walnut pie with kaimaki ice cream was like a super spiced coffee cake and my wife loved the yogurt martini.I am not so hot on the dinner prices here but I would recommend this lunch to anyone.  I am ready to go again!Really amazing fish entrees, and the fish tour was a nice touch (ask for it!). I also thought the lamb chops and grilled octopus were delicious too. Our group was on a bit of a tight schedule and the staff was in tune with that (though due to timing of our entrees we were eating right down to the wire). Only complaint was the restaurant was filled with light smoke by the end of our dinner, not sure the root cause but hopefully that's not a regular occurrence.wow Milos I love you!Best lunch special on the strip and city!Been here twice for lunch and I'm in love!Locals and visitors you must come here for lunch!Great customer service, ambience and value :)I'm a fan!-------LUNCH ONLY--------I'm NOT a fan of Greek food at all but this restaurant may have completely changed my mind. This gem is located inside the Cosmo hotel right near the escalator but can be easy to miss. In fact, I only came here on a total whim but it turned out to the best decision ever. Their 3-course lunch meal for $20 is pretty difficult to beat. It was the perfect way to end one of the most tiring business trips I've ever taken. Service is really great, the setting is really nice (good for business or casual). If it's not too hot, be sure to sit outside because it really just makes the meal that much better. I went with my co-workers and we shared a bunch of dishes and everything tasted great but here are a few of my favorites:Grilled Octopus - Had just the right amount of chewy texture. Really great flavor. Definitely a table favoriteLobster Pasta - Most pasta dishes are the same but what I REALLY appreciated about this dish was that they were GENEROUS with their lobster portions. For a $20 lunch meal, you'd figure there'd be tons of pasta and only a little bit of lobster. No sir, they definitely piled on the lobster.Roasted Beets - Our group just really likes beets and this side dish was just executed really well.Greek coffee - SUPER SUPER sweet but that's right up my alley so I fell in love with this. My co-workers? Not so much hahaDefinitely a surprise hit for me considering I never like Greek food. But this restaurant has turned me into a believer.Excellent place for lunch.  For $22+, you get an appetizer, entree and dessert.  The portions are just right and they have great selections.For appetizer they have: Greek Meze Plate (tarama, tzatziki and htipiti), Canadian Classic (smoked salmon, cream cheese, red onion and a bagel), Scallop Skewer (with green bell pepper and couscous), Tomato Salad, Grilled Octopus for an extra $10 or Crab Cake for an extra $10.  For entree: Lavraki (grilled bass), Salmon (with steamed veggies), Organic Chicken Breast Skewer (with grilled mushrooms, onions and pita), Shrimp Saganaki (with couscous, tomato and feta), Lamb Chops (with fries and broccoli) for an extra $10 or Losbter Pasta for an extra $15.For dessert: Walnut Cake (with Kaimaki ice cream), Yogurt Martini or Fresh fruits.Greek Meze Plate:I started dipping my pita from the most flavorful to the not-so-much. I was not in the mood for flavor elevation today.  The tarama (creamy fish roe paste), bursts with pleasant brinyness, reminded me of  eating pregnant sardines but creamier (pardon the Andrew Zimmern-esque description).  It was very smooth and you can't tell you're eating fish eggs.  Dip your pita in the htipiti (red pepper spread) next.  Huge flavor difference from the tarama. Then move onto the tzatziki for a cool, tangy, creamy dip. Repeat.  Your plate comes with feta, olive and grape tomatoes too. 5/5Grilled Octopus: Hands down, THE BEST octopus I've had in the past 2 years.  It was tender and had an excellent smoky flavor to it.  It was absolutely wonderful. 5/5Lavraki:Served head on.  Grilled sea bass drizzled with olive oil, capers and served with broccoli.  The skin got soggy except for the part closest to the tail which was crisp and flavorful.  They'll warn you about the fish collar being too boney. 4/5Lobster Pasta:Great presentation. Lobster head, pasta, and lobster tail on a plate. Huge chunks of lobster in the pasta in a light tomato sauce.  What a beautiful dish. 5/5Walnut Cake:A small slice of what tasted like a banana bread except less moist. The ice cream tasted similar to absinthe/anise which I personally don't like. 3.5/5Yogurt Martini:Greek yogurt in a martini glass topped with strawberry sauce and half a strawberry for garnish. There's nothing more to elaborate on this one. 3.5/5Service and location were superb.  There's nothing bad to say about this place at all.Review of: $22.13 Pre-Fixe Lunch Menu 2013My friend and I have attempted to eat the Pre-Fixe at Milos before, back when it was $20.13. Indeed, they have upped the price, but I don't think $2 is much more for what you are getting. However, if they upped the price anymore than that I would think twice about coming here for this particular Pre=Fixe.I believe one of the best ways to eat well, in fancy places, and get the bang for your buck is to eat happy hours, lunch, and Pre-Fixe menus. Numerous fancy-dancy places in Vegas offer these menus in their "off" times (IE: not dinner) and this accommodates especially locals very well. I imagine the meal I had at this particular lunch would have set me back a whole lot more than 20 bucks-ish had I been dining during a "dinner" time at Milos. With that being said, onto the food:First Course - Meze PlateComes with three sauce, pita bread, cheese, one tomato and one olive. I really wanted another kalamata olive. Why just one Milos?! Why?! Oh right, presentation or something probably. I chose the meze plate because I wanted an option to just get my palate going before I had my main course. The other first courses on the menu are quite sumptuous (scallops, octopus, etc.) However, the meze plate eases you into your meal in a nice way, being able to play with which flavors you slather onto your pita bread. I enjoyed the dish and the presentation.Second Course - Sea BassA fish you'll wish you could eat every time you eat fish. It is presented sliced in half, tail and head still attached (please do what you can to scrape some meat out of the head - I did!). The flavor is - buttery, meaty white fish. If you don't know what that tastes like, then order this dish and enjoy. My fish did not have too many bones, I believe I probably ran into about 5-6. However, my friend's fish seemed to be loaded, so just be careful when eating.Third Course - Walnut CakeMeh. I was not impressed and wished I had ordered another dessert. This cake was dry and tasted like gingerbread. I'm not a fan. The ice cream on top was the only reason I could stomach the whole piece. Had the ice cream not been on top I would have just left it on the plate after the first couple bites.Service - Genteel, warm, friendly, upscale, quick, we were not forgotten, nor were we hovered over. When we arrived the place was empty, when we left it was totally full. So kudos to management and servers for keeping a service exceptional through a lunch rush.Overall - A decent Pre-Fixe to try out. Since Milos specializes in seafood, those who may not want to dump a whole lot of money into such a specialized restaurant should consider the Pre-Fixe option and then decide whether or not they would return for full price. Now, if I had a hankering for seafood and had some extra money to throw around I would definitely return to Milos, probably with out-of-town friends to wow them.I came here for my birthday lunch with my mommy. I have been hearing and reading rave reviews for this place for ages so was thrilled to finally be able to try this place. We arrived at 12 on the dot and the restaurant was just starting to fill up. We were approached immediately by our waiter who took our drink orders and sent over some bread to our table. The bread bowl was pretty good.I was a little disappointed that a lot of the things I had been interested to try were out since they didn't get a new shipment of seafood, so I didn't get to try the octopus that everyone raves about. I was only bummed for a short time and decided on starting with the hummus plate, lobster pasta and Greek yogurt for dessert. My mom got salmon bagel, chicken and Greek yogurt for dessert. Everything was really great. I was happy with our choices for the most part. The dips were great and the Greek yogurt blew my mind, it was so tasty. I had heard a lot about the walnut cake, but they don't offer that on the lunch menu anymore. For lunch, this is the place to be and you could tell as they were very busy. Great deal and I can't wait to go back and hopefully try a few of the options that weren't available to us this time. Service was impeccable as well.This is a fun place for an epic meal!  Over a year ago, Eric R. and I came here for the $20.12 lunch, both getting suckered into the supplement (me for the octopus, him for the crab cake).  We thought it was good but figured dinner here would be out of reach.  Yesterday I get a call from him around 3 PM asking if I wanted to have dinner here with his uncle.  Both of us have a lot of really cool uncles who seem to visit Vegas often and treat us to nice dinners.  I would never turn this down!  Reservations were set for 8 which gave me plenty of time to run errands after work.We arrived fashionably at 8:04 and were seated immediately.  Four of us dined without abandon.  We all had cocktails - I tasted the cucumber-based "In the Know" and the apple one, but opted for the "Sticky Rice" with tanqueray, plum preserves, and jasmine syrup.  It sounded me-ish and it was delicious.  We were given grilled bread and a fruity olive oil to start.  Then the ordering commenced.  The server said due to the east coast weather, they were limited on types of fish and oysters and were out of the octopus (gasp) and sardines.  Bummer!First, we opted for apps only.  Eric R. and I shared the Raw bar tasting, which normally has 4 types of fish but due to this shortage it had 3.  It included bigeye tuna with YUZU kosho!!!, salmon with fresno chile and shallot, and some white fish that ended up being quite excellent considering I do not often get white fish sashimi.  I also ordered 3 oysters from Washington state, and we got the grilled shrimp app with endive salad.  The other guests ordered the mushroom side as an app and so I tried abalone, trumpet, and shiitakes and they were great of course.  Eric R. also got taramasalata which was nothing like any I have had before - the roe was not visible, and Eric thought it tasted and looked like hummus (to me the taste was closer to taramasalata) but they did not give us anything to eat it with for probably 20 minutes - we had to ask for bread from 3 different people, and it was the least interesting thing to eat on the table.Next, we ordered Greek salads - everyone spotted the beautiful Canadian (hah) tomatoes near the bar and the salads are just tomatoes, feta, cucumber, red onion, olive, and green pepper - no lettuce.  Eric R. and I split one and I ended up with leftovers for today which I am eating now, yum!  We ordered the whole opakapaka for the table prepared simply with olive oil and lemon and had the server split it tableside.  It was delicate and tasty, and I could only eat half.  I tried the fish cheek which was cool.For sides, we got chard, broccoli, roasted beets, and sweet onions.  I was the only beet eater so I got to take those home too.  The rest of the sides were okay.  No room for dessert!  Because I am local, I am fortunate enough to take the delicious extra food home which I am sure many tourists do not do.  This meal was delicious from start to finish which service pretty personable throughout.  The sticky rice cocktail was also excellent.If I return, I still would get octopus if it were available again.  This was likely a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me, so I am glad it was delicious, fun, and with generous family!Hands down--worst experience in Vegas. Never have I been this disappointed in a Vegas restaurant.Was it because we didn't order wine (our bill wasn't going to be high enough)?Was it because we were the only Asians dining at this restaurant at dinner time? My husband and I have been regulars at the Cosmopolitan Hotel for almost 2 years now (we are here every 4-8 weeks) because it's dog-friendly. We come here and easily drop $$$$ on food and we were so disappointed on how this restaurant ignored us for an hour.  No exaggeration. I looked at my watch.WE WALKED OUT WITHOUT EATING OUR FOOD BECAUSE WE NEVER GOT IT....AFTER OVER ONE HOUR.We made reservations for 8:30pm. Despite other empty tables throughout the restaurant, we were seated at the worst table next to the hostess stand.We were not given menus. (What?!?)We had to wait at least 10-15 mins to finally get someone's attention to get us a menu.The server....where was he? No clue. He didn't even come to our table till TWENTY MINUTES AFTER WE SAT DOWN.Everything I wanted to order ran out, including lobster and octopus -- I told you spend money on food in Vegas.  (This is our second time here. Last time, half of the menu items had also run out at dinner time.)We never got our meal. No, seriously. We never got dinner!!!Our server didn't even check up on the kitchen to see if our order was in....turned out that it never made it to the kitchen. Can you believe it? How does that even happen?When we got angry and stood up to complain to one of the managers, he went to check on the kitchen.....yup, our dinner was no where on their radar. We then complained to the general manager. He was hardly empathetic.  WE ARE NEVER EVER EVER EVER SPENDING OUR MONEY AT THIS RESTAURANT. My easy going husband has never walked out of a restaurant. In fact, I'd have to say that this is a first for us.GO TO STK. In terms of food & service on the third floor, STK Is the winner.Best lunch deal in Vegas bar none...Restaurant is located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan HotelThree courses for $22.31(As of 2013)We have been going here since it opened and prices have bumped up from $19 the first year it opened.As a starter we have had...-Tomato salad(Always ripe and juicy with cucumber ..Very fresh and tasty)-Diver scallops ..its still good but this year it is one skewer with about 2/3 small scallops and grilled vegetables.-Smoked Salmon(Very standard..just ok)-Grilled octopus..This used to be a must get. With big chunky pieces of octopus. Now its much smaller pieces of octopus but still very good. (This is a supplemental dish and will cost an additional $15)Main dish-Lavraki (European sea bass)...This is a must get. Cooked to perfection with sprinkles of sea salt. Splash on some lemon and you are good to go. Just be careful of the tiny fsh bones. If you like-Lamb Chop..Tasty..very tender and cooked perfectly. The sleeper entree.-Salmon...Its salmon and you can get this anywhere...Had my buds and its was OK...-Lobster Pasta..Worth the supplemental $15. Pasta is al dente and cooked to perfectly and pipping out. Lobster chunks are meaty and sweet. Very very good dish.Dessert-Greek Yogurt..Very good. -Mixed Fruit..Just Ok...This is a must stop every time we are in Vegas.Would recommend you try this place out...We have had dinner here as well but prices jump up significantly.Brought clients in and celebrated securing a major hotel remodel project on the strip. I made it a point to make reservations ahead of time since it was a Thursday and Milos lunch is popular.We decided to get three different appetizers and share them between the three of us.They were: Grilled Octopus -sashimi quality Mediterranean octopus, charcoal-broiled,Greek Meze Plate - Tarama, Tzatziki, Htipiti, manouri cheese, olives & cherry tomatoes and the fresh Maryland Lump Crab Cake. Two of the three had a $10.00 up charge but they were all delicious and worth the extra money. For my main entree I chose the Lavraki - grilled Mediterranean bass cooked perfectly with a sauce and capers. The fish was whole and so moist and fresh. Lastly I had the Greek Yogurt which ended my fabulous meal. My clients were just as pleased with their meals as myself and everyone was satisfied. I'm so glad I chose Estiatorio Milos for lunch and would suggest this restaurant for a business power luncheon or for lunch with friends or family.My new favorite lunch place in Vegas! I've visited Milos in Greece and New York and am so excited that there is now one in LV. They offer a set lunch for $22. You get the choice of several appetizers, a few different mains and dessert. We ended doing one set lunch and ordering the Milos special, a must when at any Milos! It's lightly fried zucchini and eggplant with tzatziki and fried Greek cheese. OMG, I could eat this all day long. Plus their tzatziki is like yogurt of the gods. It's super thick and filled with cucumbers. For the set lunch, we ended paying a lot of supplemental charges for the octopus and the lobster spaghetti but it was worth it. I think next time I'd do the dips to start instead of the octopus, but regardless everything was wonderful. The atmosphere is bright, with some seating outside, which is so lovely for lunch. I hate feeling like you are in the basement of a casino for lunch and that is not the case at Milos. Dessert was some of that thick Greek yogurt with strawberry puree. We licked the bowl. You get the picture. Have you booked a table yet?!Let me start off by saying my favorite yelper Melanie A just gave this place 3 stars. I'm going with 1 star, I was going to go 2 stars but then she reminded me about the nasty attitudes at the front desk.  I walk in and give everybody a nice big friendly hello and get the nastiest looks with not 1 hello back from any of the 3 hostesses. Just a curt follow me from one of them.Strike one.Next we sit down in loud drafty room with more attitude from our waiter.Now before I go any further let me preface what I'm about to say with the fact that I have been to the original Milos in Montreal and the Milos in Manhattan, both were great dinning experiences but I don't know what this place is! It's more like a Myli's than a Milos!!I love octopus and eat it all over the world and have never paid $32.00 for octopus of any size. This was an appetizer which came out COLD,  we sent it back. Second octopus was inedible chewy as rubber, possibly the worst octopus of my life.Next we order the fish tasting appetizer.  Very good to excellent but at 82.00 for 16 pieces of sashimi that they should serve with a pair of tweezers and surgical magnifying glasses so u can see and properly handle the tiniest pieces of fish u can imagine.Bread and olive oil r great. Greek salad was pathetic with mushy tomatoes, one olive, yes one olive in a salad for two. Feta was of poor quality also. So bad I refuse to classify it as Greek! It was left half uneaten. We didn't want to send another dish back to appear like nasty tourists so we just left it on the table.We go pick out our fish, a Greek snapper of some sort. Came out dry as sawdust!  That went back. We had no choice it could not be swallowed with out risk of solidifying in your throat like some cemeticious  marine leak stopper that u slap in a hole instantly stop leaking water coming out of it.  Well at this point no employee of Milos restaurant is talking to us. Just nasty looks and attitude.We order Dover sole and that were the only words spoken. Icy silence from the staff.  No inkling of anybody coming over to say we're sorry your extremely outrageously expensive dinner is sucking so far.Dover sole came out and it was good but no where worth the price of admission. When we were done with the fish we sat there forever it seemed like we were in Quarantine with the H1N1 virus!Finally ordered coffee and no mention of coffee on the house for your miserable dinning experience, I am giving this a DANGER DANGER WILL ROBINSON warning.AVOID AVOID AVOID. Go put your money on Red or Black you'll get more enjoyment out of it then you will here.I just received THE WORST SERVICE I've ever had in my life.  Let me paint you the picture...I've been here a couple times with excellent service, friendly staff, and efficient food courses....as well as good food. Today, I noticed a HUGE difference in just receiving my WATER and BREAD.The bread was almost FINISHED before I received water...nothing to drink.  It was also almost finished by the time my order was TAKEN.  And no, we weren't starving...it just took that long.  I'd estimate about 12-15min.There was a HUGE difference of time between my first course and the entree.  So bad, that I noticed THREE OTHER TABLES (that arrived after me and ordered afterwards) receive their food before me!!!This wouldn't be a huge deal if it wasn't for the fact that I had to get a MANAGER involved, and I STILL didn't have my food until they were almost FINISHED with theirs.  One of the three tables actually WAS finished with their food.  And I think most of these tables had the SAME SERVER!!!Because my lunch was now taking almost 1.5-2hrs before I have received my entree, I ask the manager to bring my dessert WITH my entree, since I wouldn't have enough time to finish my meal.BEST PART :  While we are STILL waiting for our entrees to arrive, the server actually comes over to us, and asks how everything was....ARE YOU SERIOUS???  How can you be that HORRIBLE at your job, to NOT realize that you didn't even bring us 2 out of 3 COURSES and think we are FINISHED???  When I complain to her, she asks if I already talked to a manager...then brushes us off.  I am seriously considering walking out!!!The food finally comes in hand via the manager.  My Lobster Pasta (which I've had twice here before now) was a bit undercooked (noodles).  I mention it to the waitress, and I left a pile of noodles on the plate when I was finished.  Pretty sure it goes to deaf ear.When I don't get checked on via the manager, I just ask for the check and some water to finally be refilled.  She brings over the water and takes a while to get my check.  NOW I AM STEAMING...I WANNA LEAVE THIS PLACE!!!I follow her to the damn kiosk to print my check, write a big fat $0 on the tip line (PROUDLY) and write in huge print "THIS WAS THE WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER RECEIVED."  I've NEVER stiffed anyone in my entire life...not even a valet bringing a friend's car down...you're still gonna get money outta me.  But I could not FATHOM giving this DISAPPOINTMENT a dime of my money.  I dropped almost $100 for lunch for two with ice water to drink...I am not sitting at a Dennys at 3am!!!I wait for the same manager to finish talking to another group that was ALSO COMPLAINING, and hand him the checkbook with written note and walk away.  Good luck.Greek restaurant in a German hotel on the Vegas Strip?  Why not.Estiatorio Milos continues to impress.  Outstanding seafood that calls one back to the costal villages and towns bordering the Mediterranean.  And let's just say, you will pay 40 percent less for this level of quality and freshness as the "other" place in the twin parabolic, glass sheathed extensions of an eccentric, once vegan, billionaire's ego anchoring the North Strip.  Huh what?Milos features extremely fresh and vibrant ingredients like Mediterranean seafood, air flown live daily.  Dishes are prepared with respect for the incredible ingredients.  Most seafood is simply grilled, dressed with a peppery Greek olive oil and a squeeze of sun ripened lemon allowing the flavors to shine.  Exemplary examples include simply grilled, uber sweet, live langoustines (the only other place in Vegas to offer this), salty, oceanic Portuguese sardines, and a tender braised then grilled octopus.  The razor focused flavor of each carried by richness of the oil and enhanced by the acidity of the lemon.Grilled whole fish also benefit from the simple finish.  Simply tour the seafood bar, pick one out, pay by the pound and enjoy.Finally, for lobster lovers, do not pass on any of the lobster pastas (the lobster pasta for lunch uses an American lobster, dinner choices include the deep sea Bay of Fundy or Mediterranean blue lobsters).  Perfectly cooked chunks of tail meat mixed in a mild but acidic tomato base served with the cooked head.  Be sure to scrape out the tamale and mix it with the pasta for the added briny oceanic finish.Tip:  Lunch offers the best value.  Three courses beginning at $22.14 with a maximum $20 supplement for top selections.Very good wine list.  Wine by the glass offerings mainly Greek and pair perfectly with the food.  Service is attentive and very friendly.A restaurant that has vastly improved with time.**This review is for the bar area only** I was in Milos for about 45 minutes to meet with my cousin and pre-game for a bit before heading down stairs to see Mariachi El Bronx explode on the main floor of Cosmo. The bar area is super cozy and the bartenders are very attentive. This area not only overlooks the restaurant, but you also get a sweet view of the bustling Cosmo floor, great spot for people watching. The drinks here are pricey, but are also pretty stiff, so it balances out. I didn't eat during this quick trip, but I will be back because the food smells coming out this place were intoxicating. PRO TIP:Avoid the long wait and eat at the bar. You can order food and chow down in the bar area if the restaurant is slammed.We came here to celebrate our anniversary with the family. I am Greek and a pretty decent cook, I know how good Greek food should taste, so its not easy to please me, Milos Estiatorio did!We decided to dine at the patio.We had the prix-fixe thee-course lunch for $25 with some upgrades, at this price its a bargain (a steal), personally I believe they need to raise it to at least $35+ so they can keep the quality of the meal.They were out of Nova Scotia Lobster (not very happy about that) The grilled bread and olive oil was 4/5The Meze plate Tarama 2/5, Tzatziki 3.5/5, Milos special fried zucchini and eggplane with tzatziki and cheese 4.5/5Grilled Octopus +$10 upgrade (it's worth It) 4/5Lavraki/Bass 4/5Shrimp Saganaki 4/5 cous-cous 4/5 tomato sauce 5/5Calamari 4/5Lamb chops were 4/5Karidopita 4/5 with kaimaki 1/5 I wouldn't call it kaimaki it was a melted and refrozen ice something. Kaimaki is a creamy rich stretchy unique tasting ice cream with Sahlep powder and Mastixa, what I was served at Milos was not even close.They serve the Turkish version across the street for $5 for a Mini size, so as you see the real stuff is pricey. The Hoegaarden Belgian white Ale was the lightest no after taste beer I ever had 5/5 to bad you can find it in Las Vegas The service was good 4/5Loved the Mediterranean decor 4/5Over all we had a great time, I like to go back for dinner.As we ate our lunch, the table was divided over whether our experienced rated an optimistic  four stars (me) or three (everyone else). Unfortunately, the dessert course took it down rather than up. It's a good value for lunch, and the majority of four- and five-star reviews seem to be based on lunch experiences that emphasize the value: at $25.15 per person for a three-course pre-fixe, it's not bad. But it's not great, either. Diner who opted for the $16 wine pairing thought neither selection was particularly interesting, YMMV.APPETIZERS: Table bread had a light char on it that infused a slightly burned taste, fellow diners were divided over whether this added to or detracted from their enjoyment. Would appreciate herbs added to the decent-quality dipping oil. The mezze platter features various dips and crudités, the hummus was one of the best local versions I've had with a great texture. The tomato salad was simple and tasty but went unfinished with our group. The crab cake ($10 supp) was extremely good, but also unexpectedly tiny. The much-hyped grilled octopus ($10 supp), which I'd most been looking forward to, was well-flavored but disappointingly overdone and tough. I was bummed to see the scallop and calamari options visible on their website were not on the available menu.MAINS: The sea bass lacked seasoning but was perfectly cooked, broccoli side was unremarkable. The shrimp saganaki lacked flavor and the shrimp themselves were overcooked and cold instead of hot, fresh, and juicy. Lobster Pasta ($15 supp) has beautiful presentation but received mixed feelings at our table: I enjoyed the light tomato sauce while others found it bland and complained about the lack of lobster content and flavor in the dish. The chicken skewer was nicely seasoned and juicy but fairly boring, however the fries were spectacularly well done and paired well with the tzatziki sauce.DESSERT: We didn't finish even half of any single dish from this course. The Greek yogurt was the only decent item, and had great texture, but could have benefitted from additional fruit garnish rather than a single berry and a drizzle of compote. Would have preferred this with honey and walnuts, as it was previously served. The fresh fruit plate looked like the dismal remains of a business meeting buffet. The walnut cake and ice cream was a dry, flavorless mess topped with an icy, flavorless glob. I like the option to do the pre-fixe but if nearly a third of the available options incur a fee that then doubles the price, why bother? The dishes are fresh and appealing, but the trend of overcooking-and-underseasoning dishes is a basic execution error I don't expect to encounter on the Strip. Meal for four with coffees and  tip averaged to $50/pp and was underwhelming to all, which negated the "great food for a great value" claims that brought us in for our visit in the first place.Who ever thought you could get your bang for the buck in Las Vegas, one of the top places known for helping you empty your wallet?! But by far, this is one of my favorite dining experiences on the Strip. And that's saying a lot!FOOD:-------The pre-fixe lunch menu is a straight up steal at $25.15 for your choice of appetizer, main course, and dessert. And mind you, they're not skimping on the portions either. Here's what we ordered: APPETIZERS:** Fresh Maryland Lump Crab Cake ($10 supplementary) - So flavorful and juicy! And paired well with the marinated navy beans and mustard emulsion. Definitely a great choice.** Grilled Octopus appetizer ($10 supplementary) - My friend ordered this. I'd never wanted to try octopus before (usually stay away from seafood with a rubbery texture) but it smelled so good I couldn't resist. Prepared to sashimi quality and charcoal-broiled, the octopus was delicious. I don't know if I'll be able to eat it anywhere else!MAIN COURSES:** Lavraki - You get an entire grilled Mediterranean bass. This blew my mind. I was heading to the airport directly after lunch, so I had to eat the entire portion. Which wasn't a bad thing because it tasted amaaaazing.** Shetland Island Organic Salmon with steamed vegetables - My friend ordered this dish and it was also a great choice. I usually don't order salmon in restaurants as a rule, but this one was just right. Not dry at all and very flavorful.DESSERT:** Karidopita with kaimaki ice cream - What a happy ending to this meal! Absolutely wonderful with a great texture, not too sweet, and topped with ice cream. What more could you want?!** The Real Greek Yogurt - A nice, light dessert with berries. Not as sour as I expected. Yum!SERVICE/AMBIANCE:---------------------Wait staff was extremely professional and treated us just like everyone else, even though we were the only ones dressed very casually since we were soon airport-bound. Very attentive just as you'd expect from a $$$$ establishment. Very pleased with the service.The ambiance is just gorgeous. It gives you the fine ding experience while also adding a cultural flair with the seafood market theme and beautiful Greek decor.TIP: Come here for lunch! You can't pass up this experience especially at the price.DATE TIP: You can be a baller on a budget here, fo sho. You'll certainly impress your date! Only thing is the price is displayed very clearly at the top of the menu, so hopefully they're impressed by your deal-finding skills. Otherwise you should kick them to the curb anyway!
Ichiban Sichuan=Ichiban is up there with the best Chinese in Madison. Most of the menu is authentic with a few American standards thrown in.  Think General Tso's chicken. It's best to come with a few adventurous friends and order several items. The portions are huge for the prices.  String beans with or without minced pork and cumin lamb are my faves.  I will be back. Soon.At Bob S' behest, I finally got around to ordering from Ichiban.First, I would just like to say this was the fastest delivery order yet. We placed our order at ~7:30, and received a call at 7:50. I was expecting an hour's wait, as is typical for delivery in Madison, and was pleasantly surprised. Second, this place has real, yes REAL, scallion pancakes (though it could have been crunchier). Ever since moving here from Boston, I have been on a crusade to find scallion pancakes. I've tried dozens of Chinese places, and have received bread with scallions, fried crepes with scallions, but never actual scallion pancakes... Until now.Now, moving on to the actual food, which is among the most authentic Szechuan cuisine (along with Fugu) in all of Madison. We ordered the ox tongue and triple with chili sauce (different cuts of beef doused in chili oil), scallion pancakes (yay finally), eggplant with chili garlic sauce (huge chunks of sweet eggplants immersed in chili sauce) and poached sliced fish in hot chili sauce (the most tender fish you will ever have).The meal also came with 2 boxes of white rice, perfect for soaking up all the chili sauce. Though, for some reason, there were no fortune cookies. C'mon Ichiban, you need to get with the game here.That being said, everything was absolutely delicious, and I will definitely be stuffing my face with their dishes sometime soon. One thing of note is that the prices are slightly higher than most Chinese places in Madison, but I'd say it's well worth it.For once, a recommendation for a Chinese restaurant in Madison came through for me.  The food at Ichiban is not the best Chinese that I've ever had, but it's certainly at a different level from what you might find in Madison.  We went and had a vermicelli with minced pork, eggplant with garlic sauce, and the spicy chicken dish.  The spicy chicken dish was very good if you like some heat in your food.  I found the eggplant with garlic sauce somewhat oily, but it went well with some rice.This place is the best Chinese I've had in Madison.  It's rather pricey, but it's not your typical Chinese takeout food and it's worth it.  Come here if you want to expand your culinary experience of Chinese food to more than just General Tso' chicken and orange chicken and be prepared to enjoy some spice.
Prince Restaurant=If you're looking for Serbian food in Las Vegas this is THE place to go.  Even if you don't care (or know) what Serbian food is, and if you're just looking for a huge plate o' meat, this is also THE place to go.  Serbians really, really love meat.  Like, all meat, all the time.When I go to Prince, I'm usually with Serbs and we order the plate of meat for two (it's enough for at least three people).  It includes cevapi (Serbian national dish, looks like ground beef sausage links), chicken, beef, pork, and some cheese-stuffed thing I have yet to identify.  It's really good when you're in the mood for a serious dose of protein.  I've also ordered  the beef soup which, literally, includes like a pound of smoky beef roast.  It's insane.  You will leave this place doubled over in pain from the amount of meat you consumed.  I guarantee it.  This would probably be a great place for body builders to eat.The only downside to Prince is that I always feel really intimidated walking in.  The restaurant is dimly lit inside and it sometimes feels like a "Serbian only" atmosphere.  But, if you feel self-conscious, just go outside to the patio seating and chow down on your cevapi.  The waiters are really nice and will make you feel welcome.  It's definitely an experience.
Williams Fresh Cafe=Williams is kind of like KW's Tim Horton's. Okay, not really, Tim Horton's is flourishing in KW too but there certainly seem to be as many William's coffee locations as Tim's in the city.Williams serves coffee, obviously, but it also serves a wide array of sandwiches, smoothies and desserts. They actually have a kitchen where they prepare meals.They also have free wifi which keeps this place packed with university students and professors alike, all camped out in the booths working on their lap-tops. There's also a small patio.You order and pay at the counter in exchange for a big number you put on your table so they know where to bring your food or drink when it's ready.This location is always buzzing with people so don't expect to get any quiet reading done here, but if you like a bit of background noise, this is the place for you.
Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery=The Tilted Kilt.  The Irish Hooters....Please don't misunderstand....I love me some chain restaurants.  Cheesecake Factory, that's my ish.  This place...not so much.Maybe it's the boobalicious, scantily clad waitresses that turns me off.  Or perhaps maybe it was the terribly slow service we received ($2 cans of Yuengling really take 15 minutes to deliver?!).  Or maybe it was the mediocre to tasteless food we received.  Regardless, this place just left a bad taste in my mouth.  Even after 3 beers.  I'll stick to Jerome Bettis down the street.  At least they have a massive Carrot Cake waiting for me and not massive boobies.Wondering if anyone else here had a very nasty experience with Nick, the general manager.My idea of a general manager is that their goal is customer care and service above all else. I was honestly (and I am not being dramatic here) appalled at how I was treated by this General Manager. Verbally disrespected is a good way of putting it. I wanted to pull up an open table on the patio next to a friends' table as more folks were coming. The waitress, extremely kind and helpful (here name was Elizabeth or Libby), said she had to check at the hostess stand and asked me to come with her. I agreed as she was so sweet, I wanted to do what I could to make things easier for her. Upon our arrival at the hostess stand, where the GM was standing, she explained the situation. He immediately barked something at her about having "no idea what she was talking about" (Which made sense as he barely listened to her before he cut her off) and to take him out there and show him. We go back out to the patio, and I promptly explain I just want to take the open table next to my friends' table and sit next to them. I say I don't even need to push the tables together. Nick, the GM, then says "You can have a chair." I instantly think he's being sarcastic as not only is that table wide open, there are--NO LIE--more than a dozen open tables on the patio. It was 90+ degrees outside so no one wanted to be seated out there. Thinking he's joking I respond something like "Oh, just a chair? I can't have the table?" and he goes "NO and if you keep talking to me like that (Mind you, I do not speak disrespectfully to people so I have no idea what set him off), you're not even going to get a chair." At this point, I realize he is NOT kidding and I say "But you have all these open tables out here" and he responds "I have over a 40 minute wait, you're not on that list" and I say "But what about all these open tables?!" to which he says "you can forget that chair" and storms off.Not only did I leave immediately, my friends who were already sitting and eating were so disgusted by how he (a man) treated me (a woman) that they promptly paid their bill and left. As long as he is working here, I won't be making any visits. I've also contacted corporate.Been to this location a couple of times, and it is always fun! Got here on a Saturday night round 11:30 pm and the place was full, stayed until it closed. THANK YOU for having multiple Sam Adams on tap!!! Arizona is tough to find Sammy A. Place is just always fun, girls are always nice to look at. I believe what makes this a 4 star instead of 3, is that the hot bartenders actually can carry a conversation with you and not just stand there and be hot.Came here for the homie's birthday and I wanted to see what all the hype is about this place. I see why the fellas like it so much. It's like an Irish hooters. Girls in skirts? What's not to love. Haha.  So since it was a Friday and I couldn't eat meat I ordered the Quinlan's five cheese flat bread. I saw that it had a basil pesto sauce and thought yes please! Lol. I was disappointed. It was sooooo bland. Like really bland. =/ Drinkssss... I ordered the Celtic crush. A different waitress brought my drink. When I tried it, it was extremely sour. Our original waitress came and said she  noticed that my drink didn't look how it should've. So they made me a new one. It tasted like a screwdriver. Lol. The second drink was a purple haze. Wasn't a big fan of that thing either. To sum up I wasn't a fan of the food and the drinks weren't anything special. Not to mention parking is horrible!!! I drove around for 20 minutes looking for parking and ended up paying like $15. You'd think they would have their own parking but they don't. I probably wouldn't come again on a normal day. It's a cool place to hang out with the homies though to watch a game or to stop by after the suns game.
BFG Café=It's taken me a year to find out that the BFG cafe wasn't named after a weapon in Doom, and that it therefore wasn't some sort of internet cafe as I had expected. No, in fact, BFG cafe stands for Big Fat Greek cafe, presumably because if you eat here regularly you will be big and fat, and the fact that they serve gyros. Additionally, BFG stands for Bloomfield-Friendship-Garfield, the three nearest neighborhoods to the cafe(Well actually East Liberty is probably closer than Bloomfield but nobody wants to eat at the Enormous Large Fat Greek cafe, it's simply too verbose).Walking in to the cafe is a big open kitchen, well over half the room, a few vending machines for drinks, and a seating area to the side. Seating is actually plentiful here as it appears the cafe is two spaces combined. The food here is my favorite kind: cheap. The most expensive item on their menu is a large speciality pizza for $13. 9" hoagies and gyro sandwiches are $5 and under, fries are about a buck, and "pittsburgh-style" salads and 12" pizzas are about $5-7. Simply put, they're hard prices to beat: a spinach-feta pizza and a gyro(big enough that I didn't even make it to the pizza) cost me $11 after tax. The gyro was excellent, and though not enough to usurp my stomach's other Big Fat Greek champion(My Big Fat Greek Gyro), the price and convenience of this place easily makes up for it.  The pizza had a very thin crust and had a nice seasoning to it. Toppings weren't skimped on, but I had a little trouble finding the feta on the slice I did attempt. They also threw tomatoes on it for free, because the guy on the phone thinks they're a nice touch, and, I did too.Shockingly, BFG didn't replace Salt as my favorite restaurant in this stretch of Penn ave, but for cheap sandwich while I'm working from home or for a pizza dinner when I don't feel like cooking, this is a great place to have in the neighborhoodSorry, but I wasn't super impressed with this place.  While the food's cheap here, I found it to be not that special.  I came here last night with a few friends around 6pm for dinner, since they often come here at that time on Mon.  One thing to note is that the dining area is actually quite a bit larger than it seems when you walk in--the doorway to the right of the area where you order leads to a much larger dining room with several booths.  This area is decorated with art from local artists, which is nice--it's great to see a business supporting the local arts scene.I ordered a chicken gyro ($5) and a small order of fries ($1.25) to go with it.  I was expecting the gyro to be on par with some of the other ones I've had around town (e.g., at Lesvos and the Greek Fest), but alas, it wasn't--I should have taken the hint when I saw only one spit of red gyro meat (I don't eat beef or lamb).  My major complaint with the gyro was its sogginess, which caused the pita to become unpleasantly wet, and the tzatziki sauce to become unbearably runny (it dripped out the entire time I was eating the gyro).  The fries were fresh cut and plentiful, but they were underseasoned, to the point that I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to them.  After trying a bite from a friend, I also decided to get a slice of the chocolate cheesecake with strawberry sauce ($2.50).  While this was the best part of the meal, even it wasn't super impressive--it wasn't as chocolatey as I would have liked, even with the chocolate crust.  The strawberry sauce was good, but it overwhelmed the flavor of the cheesecake itself, which there wasn't a whole lot of.Although I will likely come back here to hang out with my friends, I probably wouldn't return otherwise, since this place isn't super convenient to where I live, and my experience wasn't didn't motivate me to return otherwise.  As others have stated, you can't get much cheaper, but here, I feel that reflects negatively in the quality of the food.  If/when I return, I will try other things, such as the pizza, etc., and will update my review accordingly.Since I've been here several more times and tried several more items since my original review, I feel that an update is called for.  I may have been a bit too harsh in my original review, so I'll try to be more balanced and articulate this time.There are several things that I like about BFG.  I like that it's an unpretentious community eatery that serves the neighborhood in which it's located, a fact that's reflected in the type of food that they serve, the price point, and the employees (yeah, that's right, I refuse to use the term "help") that they hire.  This contrasts with some other eateries along Penn Ave. in the vicinity, which draw a more yuppie East End crowd.  (Disclaimer: I'm an East End yuppie!)  BFG's commitment to the community is even reflected in the wall art, which is from local artists, as I mentioned before.  The owner and staff are very friendly, and are gracious hosts to a group that I attend that meets here on Mon. evenings.On the other hand, I find the food to be rather hit-or-miss.  Some of it, such as the grape leaves and pita with tzatziki, the fries, and the baklava, is pretty decent.  Other items, such as the pizza (which I find too greasy for my liking) and the chicken gyro I mentioned in my previous review, leave room for improvement.  Given the price point, though, I can't complain too much, and since I return regularly, I'll figure out what I enjoy and will stick to ordering that.As a side note, BFG was broken into the weekend before last, and is still struggling to deal with the repercussions of the break in (when I visited last night, the glass on the front door was still broken).  If you're in the neighborhood, consider stopping by to show some support!3.5 stars for providing good hospitality and A-OK food on a consistent basis.
Bratalian Neapolitan Cantina=If you're a fan of Rao's at Caesars or the original in Harlem in NYC, then you know the Pellegrino family and their cooking.  Recently, Carla, the executive chef of Rao's and her husband, Frank, Jr., divorced...she got 10 family recipes in the settlement and has installed her sister who has been by her side at the stoves for the past 10 years along with brother in law, Walter, to run the front of house.Why the name?  Bratalian combines her Brazilian roots (she was born in Rio), with her Italian heritage...but make no mistake, there is nothing Brazilian on the menu.Carla will be opening a new restaurant at the newly renovated Tropicana shortly, she reported - and given its Miami Beach theme by the pool, I'm guessing that's where the Rio flare may begin to show.Most important to know is that while they're newly opened, their liquor license isn't in place until mid April - so it's BYOB, and diners can benefit from no corkage fee for their first month.  One visit isn't enough for a review - but since it wasn't listed yet,  I wanted to get the word out.  The location is where the former Chef's Palate used to be - a nice sized 100+ seat spot on southern Eastern, near Horizon Ridge, as you head to Anthem and Seven Hills.  With the pleasant weather, you can dine on their small but rare patio.They're open for lunch and dinner.  Dishes are classic neopolitan fare - antipasti, primi, secondi and desserts.  We wish them great luck and are thrilled she chose to not only stay in town but to bring her culinary talents to our local neighborhood... p.s. Pasta is not made from scratch but dried.  Marinara sat in the bain marie a little too long which made sauce too salty, but this was just first try...there are lots of dishes to try.We went last night and when we got there found out they didn't have their liquor license yet so we went and bought wine and brought it in, which is fine, actually probobly saved money since we didn't have to buy there.  Then we waited.  Overall service was slow, Walter the general manager was rude, they were in the weeds and needed help even a bus boy would have helped a ton, and the food was just okay.To elaborate if you want to know more.  We probobly sat for 45 mins before being able to order appatizers, which was fine at first because I thought they were just giving us time to mingle but as the night went on realized they couldn't keep up.  Walter was our server (general manager).  I tried three different times to strike a conversation or get any type of personality or opinion out of him and he always responded with short monotoned answers like we were more of a pest then anything.   At that point I thought for how rude they are the food must be outstanding.  The decor I couldn't figure out, there are pictures of Carla everywhere but clothes hung up like on a clothes line (not classy), and siding on the back walls, so I thought we were maybe suppose to be in the backyard type atmopshere but the window had a curtain on it.  I know the decor shouldn't matter all that much but by that time I was irritiable and for the prices you are paying didn't feel like the decor matched.Then we finally ordered our meals and my friend asked to have some sausage with his and the general manager said and I quote, "Nope the chef will kill me."  So we just ordered them on the side and mixed them in but whatever I didn' think it was a tough request.I ordered a pasta with shrimp, which I was really looking forward to and it was just okay.  Way too much butter, just swimiming to the point that that was all you could taste.  My husband asked about the penne vodka which is suppose to be one of her signatures I believe or if the spaghetti and meatballs were better and Walter said Spaghetti which I thought was odd.We sat forever to get our check, and had mine and my husbands food boxed up.  When Walter brought the food back he put it on the floor, which I thought was weird as well.  I have never put anyone's leftovers on the floor in a like cvs bag.  We never actually got the check we had to flag him down to get him to take our credit card.  He asked about dessert but by that time we had been there 3 hours and 15 min and just wanted to leave.  What was even more annoying was there were people waiting to get a table and the restaurant was small so all they would have had to do was be much mroe attentive and we probobly would have only been there 1.5 to 2 hours tops.  Overall I would never go back, and beween us and the table next to us who we overheard don't think this place will last at all.  I give it a couple months unless they turn their service around.Went there yesterday, have been waiting to try the place since it opened, and finally got my lazy ass to Henderson to give Chef P's menu a go.We got there at around 5:30pm and the place was pretty empty, we were seated promptly without reservations and offered a few menu options. We selected the Prefix menu. It was $33 for your choice of app, entree, dessert, and a glass of wine. I was planning on ordering an entree and dessert so the prefix menu made sense.We started with the caprese salad as an addition to the prefix menu, the Mozz was amazing, and the tomatoes were ripe and delicious, it may have been a little high on the price point, but it was a great starter.We also had a few baskets of bread...the bread was good, and they had 2 different types in the basket, one was Italian and one tasted like a sourdough, but both were good, and were served with olive oil and balsamic.I had the Meatballs to start...they were large and 2 were included in the order. I was expecting small little app sized, but no these were pretty big meatballs. They were a pork, veal, and beef combo, they were served in a red sauce that was good for bread dipping. The meatballs were cooked perfectly, they were a little on the greasy side,  but they were great.For my Entree I chose the Penne Alla Vodka, a large portion of al dente Penne tossed in an amazing Vodka Sauce with a little ham thrown in for good measure. When I ordered the Prefix I was expecting smaller portions but they didn't cut back at all.My dessert course was the Ricotta Cheese Cake, a big slice of cheese cake that was around 5" thick. The crust was amazing, and the ricotta cheese cake filling was fluffy and delicious. I was tempted to eat half of it and use the rest as a pillow for my food induced coma.The companion had a chicken dish who's name escapes me but it was really good, and the Tiramisu which was also amazing.The wait staff was a little slow, and there was a length of time between the apps being served and the entrees getting out of the kitchen, and the place was a little warm, but I can't really complain too much about them. My biggest complaint is that I waited this long to try Bratalian!*** Review is for Spring 2014 Restaurant Week Menu ***I enjoyed my dinner at Bacio when Chef Pellegrino was there and I've wanted to try Bratalian since she opneed the place.  I'm glad I did.Since I was alone, I opted to sit at the bar.  Besides not taking up a table meant for two or more, I often have a good time watching the bartenders do their thing.  In this case, I had a direct view into the small kitchen of this restaurant and I could see Chef Pellegrino's sister, Chef Alessandra Madeira, cooking with her staff.  The kitchen seemed to run well and there were some laughs coming from there.  They were also putting out a good number of meals.  There were several take out orders called in while I was there.The three course Restaurant Week menu has a lot of choices.  For the starter, I chose the Polpette Tradizionale--two 6 ounce meatballs made with beef, pork, and veal in a fresh tomato and basil sauce.  What a large starter.  That could have been the meal.  The sauce was very good and the meatballs were soft in texture and had an excellent flavor.For the main course, I chose the Salsicce and Pepperoni--Italian sausage, both hot and sweet, sautéed over red and yellow peppers and onions.  Another winning dish.  The onions and peppers were sautéed just enough to start to soften them but not enough to take some of the crispness away and turn them to mush.  The pieces of sausage were cooked nicely and were very tasty.  It was different to have the sausage served in bite sized pieces and I liked the main course a whole lot.  I did let some of the peppers go.  Can't fill up on fiber!For dessert, I had ordered then Torta di ricotta--classic Italian ricotta cheesecake.  After having had ricotta cheesecake at several Italian restaurants recently, I am convinced that it's the only way cheesecake should be made--with ricotta and not cream cheese.  The texture of the ricotta cheesecake was excellent and the cheesecake was a perfect way to end the meal.Service throughout was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without having to ask.  One of the bus people removed any finished plates.  The staff worked as a team and they worked well together.A few notes:  If you arrive in the early evening, don't think they're not open.  There are wraps on the windows to shade the sun which the restaurant faces much of the day.  The restaurant itself is a small space, cozy, with interesting decorations including the clothes hanging from the line over the doorway area.  This was a grand way to start Spring Restaurant Week.  I hope my other choices turn out this well!  A hearty thanks to Chef Madeira and the staff at Bratalian for a very pleasant dinner.
Viva Salsa=Finally tried Viva Salsa last night and boy am I glad I did. It was hella good and cheap, too!For $5.95 plus tax I got 3 giant steak tacos (which I ate the guts only), chips and salsa and a drink. The bonus is the salsa bar. They have three different mouthwatering salsas to enjoy and also beans! From experience do not even attempt to put the HOT as hell beans in the tiny salsa cups provided. If you are like me you will burn yourself. Be smarter than the beans (and ding dong over here) and put them straight onto your plate. Overall I have to say this is a smokin' deal of a meal in a clean, little nook of the casino. Friendly and fast service, too. I will absolutely be back for more.
Alma Pan-Latin Kitchen=Can a good main course erase the low quality appetizer and drink before it?  That's the hard question I deal with right now (isn't life oh so tough?!).  My caipirinha was good but let's just say it was on the ice-y side....like WAY too much ice and not enough of the good stuff....the booze!  We started with the Crispy chicken marinated in dark rum and lime app.  Sound delicious, right?  It honestly tasted like chicken tenders from the freezer section of Giant Eagle...minus the taste.  Absolutely. No. Taste!  There was even a side sauce that I thought might spice it up.  No luck...how do you make a sauce tasteless??  I don't know...but they somehow did it!  The only redeeming factor is that the other app we ordered, the marinated shrimp with chilis and sweet potato, was fantastic.  Incredibly tasty and well marinated with lime.  I ordered the grilled skirt steak topped with chimichurri and black beans and rice.  It was very good!  The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare with a nice grilled flavor.  The black beans and rice were nothing to report home, but the small (very small) side salad of cucumber and tomatoes was also very good.  We had one more winning entree (braised chicken in ají and cilantro sauce) between my four dining companions (the losers: Beef brisket and a sandwich) .  So we're split 50/50 again!Would I give the place another try?  Absolutely, but I'll be sure to pick wisely again....even then....I'll hope for the best!  And give me more booze!  Then maybe I'll like things more!
Twist by Pierre Gagnaire=I asked Chef Gagnaire if it was a serious challenge to find inspiration in Las Vegas...after all, most of the products, chefs, and clients are from some other far flung destination.  And for a chef who seems to be defined by inspiration, improvisation and art (he's got a serious love for both jazz and modern art...and his recipes read more like Point than Keller), his answer surprised me.'No, zat is not really a probblemm for us, what I find challenging is to find zee line with the clients here in Las Vegas. What and how do zhay want to eeet?'This took me by surprise, as he's someone who's been cooking "famously" for over 40 years. He's already been through all of the ups and downs, fallen in and out of love with the Bibendum...and has garnered a reputation as an artist who doesn't suffer fools.  He's a chef that really doesn't have to answer to anyone. However, that he focuses so seriously on what the diner wants is a true peek into his character.To that end, he's promised that the menu is something that they will be evolving over the weeks and months to come.  In its first form, he offers both a tasting menu as well as a choose-what-you-like a la carte menu for the restaurant...which is also the sole US outpost of Gagnaire's cuisine.Highlights of the tasting menu included a lovely opening salvo of six canapés.  The textures and presentations spanned the spectrum, from Guiness and Jack Daniels gelles, to sardine potato chips.  After these bites, the first course of seared scallops went on to prove two things: 1) seared scallops are far from passé in the right hands, 2) those same hands have a thing for blending together complex and sometimes risky flavors into a delicious whole.  Langoustine Five Ways is an example of Chef Gagnaire's constant evolution.  The presentation maintains a backbone of preparations not unlike Japanese Kaiseki (Seared, Grilled, Mousseline, Gelee, Tartar), but the components of each preparation change considerably.  More, his presentation succeeds where so many "duos" and "trios" fail, as the lesser dishes strive for complexity for complexity's sake.  Here however, the form has function, as the chef manages to tease out what seems like every flavor and texture available in a Langoustine.  There's the delicate flavor of the grilled preparation and the powerful "head" flavor from the gelee.   Even the progression itself is well thought out and while the individual dishes may pull you in five different directions, you end up arriving exactly where the chef wants you. Granted, there were some aspects to the meal that needed refinement (wine list and inventory need to be synced up, a sauce ice cream that couldn't make it to the table without melting), but if everything was already "perfect" then isn't it all too easy?Unlike most "famous" chefs in Las Vegas (JR, TK and a very few others excluded) Twist is more than a brand extension, but a chance to see a man for his art.  Like it or not, he's not taking the task lightly...more than just "consulting," Chef Gagnaire has brought his A-team with him to Las Vegas.  Pascal, the CdC, has been with Gagnaire for 8 years, the Pastry chef, for 6 years, and Chef Gagnaire has even brought on Chef Michel, who has been cooking with Gagnaire for 26 years and is Un des Meilleurs Ouvriers de France...(translation: he's a super super official gangsta).  And while this team is not likely to last more than a month or two in its current form,  I'm sure it will have a lasting impact on the restaurant itself.  So, if you can get out to Las Vegas and the Mandarin Oriental, why not come and see just how carefully Chef Gagnaire walks the line?In a word, Twist.  The mere idea of the word is enough to send your token foodie's stomach into a conniption fit of pure desire.  The mere whisper of the word is enough to trigger endless blogging and tweeting due to sheer sweaty-handed anticipation.  The mere realization of the word is enough a road trip all the way to Lost Wages to see what all the fuss is about.  And so it was done.  Off to the south Las Vegas strip we would go in search of langostine (among other things), prepared in the manner of a man who pretty much put langostine on the map.  Being the gastronomic simpleton that I am, I decided I couldn't pass up a grand opening invite to the first ever dinner service at Twist by Pierre Gagnaire (December 5, 2009).  But in lieu of a ginormous appetite, what I really should've packed was my brain.  Food this complex, this multi-layered, and this (pardon my crude undertone) "weird", simply can't just be engulfed.  It requires several hours of thinking, ruminating, pondering or whatever-the-hell-it-takes to justify paying $400 a head for arguably one of the fanciest and most thought-out meal you'd ever dream of having this west of the Mississippi.  It's been days since engulfing this meal and I STILL can't wrap my head around it (and my stomach definitely had its work cut out for it too).Surprisingly, it took nearly 5 hours to complete this marathon of a 6-course tasting menu plus 6 courses of added appetizer supplements (note: every single thing I ate is pictorially posted here).  And don't you dare go on thinking that I'm slow and that 12 courses aren't all that much, because under Pierre Gagniere's roof, that really means like 36 presentations.  Do the math.  Throughout this marathon dinner complete with cocktails and fine wine, Voss water and a few $8 diet cokes sprinkled in "here and there", I began to realize the perplexity as this:  Pierre Gagnaire is, quite truthfully, an enigma of a man.  Forget that he's Michelin starred-this, iconoclastic-that.  Forget that he practically invented all that we have come to realize is "fusion" cuisine.  And just forget that his so-called eponymous "other" location on Rue. St. Balzac near the Champps Elysees is thought of as being the "3rd best restaurant" in the world by Restaurant Magazine (El Bulli in Spain is the 1st).Pierre Gagnaire creates an inspiring vision for this type of weird food, which is, not surprisingly, just weirdly delicious.  He's even a lovable weird guy himself, so appropriately charming and entertaining us like a "crazy uncle" might do during his brief cameo at our table.And as we were appropriately informed by our server David, the whole idea is to "taste and experience" all the ingredients which God put on this earth, which might occasionally occur in 1 singular dish.  This is most evident in the first of 3 presentations of Gagnaire's "Shellfish Royale" - somewhat of an oyster extravaganza with a backdrop of toasted beef gelée and shallots, as well as his last presentation of "King Sea Bream", a curiously concoction of a "bonito-shellfish gelée" with mozzarella ice cream.  I loved the fact seared scallops aren't even safe from Gagnaire's innovative antics as "black olive gelee" provides a certain Mediterranean setting, but then squab breast and foie gras come in to steal the show.  The end result of these seemingly contradictory flavor combinations and layers is this:  each bite resembles something that you have never ever tasted, with few ways to describe them, save for these vague examples --  My first time eating Pierre Gagnaire cuisine allowed me to taste 5 different representations of the langostine, including the unmistakable "head", allowed me to taste (and like) seafood mixed with cheese mixed with meat, and allowed me to eat something that tasted like the splendor that exists in a tidepool.  Overall, do I have any idea what this means?  Not on your life.  The only thing I can muster up is that a dinner under Pierre Gagnaire's roof is absolutely positively unlike any other eating experience you will ever have.  Ever.  Go there, and you will see.  The originality of it ensures that you cannot and will not be disappointed.I just realized I am about to turn the odometer over to 200 reviews!  I feel that Twist is an appropriate selection for this milestone because it was one of the most unique, memorable and enjoyable dining experiences of my life.I arrived early to enjoy a drink at the bar and ease into my evening.  The moment I walked in I knew this was a special place.  The staff greeted me warmly, as if I was a regular customer and offered me a seat immediately.  I decided to stick to the plan and sit at the bar for a drink first.  As I chatted with the very friendly bartender, I sipped a glass of Louis Roederer Brut and soaked in the beauty of this modern, intimate space.I was soon escorted to my windowside table.  There is something quite humorous about sitting in such an elegant, sophisticated place and looking out over the sea of neon and confusion that is Vegas.  I barely needed to look at the menu because I knew I wanted to try the tasting menu,  also called Pierre Gagnaire's Spirit. Being a completely politically incorrect glutton I added the Foie Gras Degustation.  More on that later.At most restaurants, bread is an afterthought.  Not true at Twist.  A server brought out three excellent selections.   A Wheat, Raisin and Walnut, a Country Rye, and a French Ciabatta.  They came with two butters. An unsalted butter from Normandy and one blended with seaweed.  This bread service is second only to the amazing Bread Cart at Restaurant Savoy.My actual meal started with an "amuse" that consisted of six little bites.  My two favorites were the Salad of Cuttlefish, Haricot Vert, Red Bell Pepper and Celeriac and the Tuna Chantilly with Homemade Rice Crackers.1st CourseSHELLFISH & RED BEETRed Beet Carpaccio, Campari, Shellfish Salad "Baltard Market" Soja glazed smoked Eel.From my first bite I knew I was in for an interesting, confusing, thought provoking evening. The following statement can be applied to all of the courses I had at Twist: I've never experienced this flavor combination before. 2nd CourseSEA AND EARTHSanta-Barbara Prawns, Spicy Grapefruit Syrup, Ginger-Potato Salad, Poached Duck Foie Gras, Iberico Ham, Scallop Mousseline, Baby Greens, Eggplant Tuille, Black & Blue Carrot Gelée, Squid Ink Gnocchetti, Seaweed. This course, as with most, was actually several small bites presented at once. Each one was fantastic in its own right and also worked together with the others.  3rd CourseBLACK CODGrilled Fillet, Poached in Citrus Butter, Molasses-White Balsamic Glaze, Mache, Manchégo Cheese, Asparagus Ice Cream, Green Apple, Paris Mushroom.One of my favorite courses of the evening. I placed the "ice cream" over the Cod and it turned into a sauce as it melted.  My waiter said he was glad to see me playing with my food.4th CourseSONOMA VALLEY FOIE GRAS DÉGUSTATIONTerrine, Dried Figs, Toasted Ginger BreadCustard, Green Lentils, Grilled ZucchiniSeared, Sweet and Sour Duck Glaze, Fruit MarmaladeCroquette, Trevicchio Coulis, Red OnionsThis is the singlemost decadent, over the top course I have ever experienced. Each of the small dishes were wonderful.  I found my self rotating between each one, enjoying the different textures and tastes.  My favorites were the Custard and the Seared.5th CourseHIBISCUSHibiscus Gelée, Mascarpone Cream, Malabar Pepper Braised Turnip, Rosé Champagne-Lime Granité.After the rich Foie course I was happy to see this light palate cleansing course.  Which, like everything else, was unique and different. 6th CourseGRILLED PRIME SIRLOINStewed Celery-Rhubarb, Pinot Noir Jus, Preserved Shallot. Broccoli Salad, Egg "Mimosa", Red Cabbage Gelée, Bolognaise, Grilled Zucchini, Beef Carpaccio, Black Olive Tapenade.A perfect piece of beef surrounded by unique and different sides. Have I said that before?DessertQuince Gelée, Bavaroise, Chartreuse ParfaitNelson Sablé, Meringue, Citrus SorbetCachaça Granité, Cucumber Marmelade, Green AppleFruit Biscuit, Seasonal CoulisGanache, Ginger, Chocolate Ice CreamI expected the meal to come to an amazing end and I was not disappointed.  My favorites were the Fruit Biscuit and the Granite. I finished my evening with a gift from the Chef, a plate of Meringues and Cookies.My experience at Twist was one I will never forget.  I still find myself thinking about it months later.  Twist is a must try for any adventurous food lover.  Hopefully, it won't be a once in a lifetime thing.Beyond what I expected from Michelin rated Pierre Gagnaire.When I first saw the menu, I thought the chef was arrogant; preparing a single primary protein multiple ways for a single dish.  Thankfully he is!Every appetizer focuses on a single primary ingredient prepared with a different cooking technique and accented by supporting ingredients that truly showcase how good it can be.  The contrast in textures this creates is incredible.  Because the same protein is used there is a beautiful continuity in the entire dish.All dishes are well edited.  You can clearly taste each ingredient.  There is an incredible respect for ingredients.If its your first time dining at Twist, I would recommend having multiple appetizers and skipping the mains.  You will get to try the most flavors.For appetizers, the veal sweetbreads, langoustines, and foie gras are to die for.  Favored mains include the john dory and the Confucius duck.The price matches the quality and is well in line with Vegas standards.The space is contemporary and fits with the understated luxury of the Mandarin Oriental with the added flare one expects in Vegas.Three visits and I can wait to go back!We went there for our anniversary last week.My husband ordered the complete tasting menu with wine pairing and I ordered the 3 course tasting menu.The service was horrible. Starving, they made me wait 1 hour for my first appetizer and 1 hour and 1/2 for the second which they made a mistake by serving me my husband's order (it was a mini portion of a cooked fish with the top being cooked but the inside totally RAW- I MEAN IF WE WANTED SASHIMI WE WOULD GO TO A SUSHI RESTAURANT- WHY WOULD WE PAY 400$ FOR TASTING MENU WHEN THEY CAN'T EVEN COOK A PIECE OF FISH????). So in 2 hours and 1/2 I pretty much had 1 appetizer and 1 cocktail. On top of the awful food, for my husband's second dish, the waiter served him his wine 30 minutes before they served him his dish so by the time he got anything to eat the wine was already finished and we were told no refills.  For his third dish, he got the food 30 minutes before they served him his wine so by the time my husband received his wine for his wine pairing he was already done eating.It was truly a horrible experience.I was really starving. We were seated at 6:30pm and furiously left the restaurant by 9pm. in 2 hours 1/2, I've had 1 appetizer and my husband had 3 courses of his 6 course tasting menu with 1 of the 3 being raw.What else can I say about this restaurant?????????We did not expect to get this low standard of service and food for this type of restaurant. It was really disapointing.This was one of the best dining experiences I've had.  I've been going to try Twist for awhile and I went there last night for a special meal.  I got the 6 course chef's tasting menu.  I made a reservation for 6 PM, the time they open. I was going to Blue Man Group later and I wanted to have plenty of time for a relaxed dinner and time to get to the show.David took my order after answering some questions I had about the menu--a menu I had poured over online.  He was a great help.There were five canapés delivered shortly after.  They're small and they were quite interesting in flavor and execution.  They were in/on three items.  My favorite was the salad of watermelon and dragon fruit, passion fruit, and basil.  A close second was the paprika-tomato meringue with smoked salmon and black olive agar.  The almond and ginger sable was none too shabby either.  All 5 were excellent!The first course was glazed Skate with red miso water, spring vegetables and Paris mushroom duxelle.The second course consisted of the 3 small bites--a grilled prawn on spinach velouté with garlic and parmesan.  The second bite was a piece of lobster with poached turnip, toasted sesame, and bisque.  The third portion was a cold, soft-boiled egg with Ossetra caviar in the yolk on a bed of marinated clams, red ahi tuna, and cuttlefish.Course three was Mediterranean John Dory with pink pepper, fine foie gras tart and baby artichokes.The fourth course was a palate cleanser.  It was a champagne sorbet which had some salted cucumber and a Campari soaked Red Beet.  I was blown away by the cucumber and sorbet combination.  Fantastic!Course five was Sonoma Valley Duck Breast with Alexia Potato, berries on a piquillo pepper reduction, and Bigarrde sauce.  The duck was excellent and the tart fruit with the pepper reduction--another superb flavor pairing!The last course was dessert which consisted of 5 different small desserts.  They were a coffee panna cotta with Bailey's, Kahlua, Coffee Gelée and lime sorbet.  Almond-Frangipane cake with lemon-Krisch syrup.  A third was strawberry soup with raspberry and basil, and a "Bella Vista" granité.  Then a fresh coconut tartlet with iced coconut, cilantro, and celery curls.  The last was a chocolate ganache.  As with the entire meal, the flavors developed in the desserts was wonderful!  Coconut, cilantro and celery--who would have thought?Service was excellent all evening, even when things became quite busy.  When my iced tea got low, a server brought me a new glass and switched the two.  I didn't have to ask, it was just done.  A funny example, when things weren't so busy, I sneezed.  Within a few moments, a server was at the table with a box of Kleenex.  Service with a smile and funny!  The same server also brought me a small Mandarin Oriental bag with a copy of all the menu items.  He had heard me mention to one of the servers that I'd never remember all the things.  The server wanted to make sure I had something to remind me.  Classy!The restaurant is very classy and the view is excellent.  I was there during daylight and dined long enough to enjoy seeing the lights come on along the Boulevard!  I wore a jacket and tie--their website requests that men wear jackets.  Most came dressed with business casual.Truly a wonderful dinner, about 2 1/2 hours.  It's worth the cost for the chance to try some unique foods in a unique setting with superb service!I came to Twist for my birthday dinner and It was such a great food tasting adventure. We ordered 6 course tasting menu, Pacific Lingcod, and couple appetizers (Oysters & Langoustine and Hudson Valley Foie Gras). I am not going to talk about details of each dish. I am just gonna share highlights of my dinner. Both appetizers we ordered were superb. My foie gras appetizer came in 2 different forms/ways with apple ice cream. Savory way: Poached foie Gras with Morteau SausageI usually like my foie gras to go with something sweet. But I enjoyed this dish very much. It was such wonderful combination!Sweet way: Glenmorangie Glazed Duck foie Gras Terrine with ginger bread powders and hazelnutsOlala... Yum Yum Yum! There is no other word to describe this dish! The second I put it in my mouth, it melted. Then all the flavors and aromas of foie gras and hazelnut just went together. Two thumbs up!Apple ice cream was very refreshing after eating so much fatty foie gras.Oysters & Langoustine:Kumamoto Oysters were such a beauty. They were big, juicy and sweet. Nom!Fanny Bay Oyster nage, Clams and leek was more like a soup to me. It was a very elegant dish. Honestly, I enjoyed the appetizers I ordered more than the tasting menu dishes. I also felt 6 course menu was a bit too much for me. On my next visit, I would probably order appetizers only and skip entrees. I can't wait to come back soon and carry on this tasting adventure!!Twist continues to impress.  Contemporary dining space with illuminated glass globes suspended throughout, outstanding view of the Strip, warm and efficient service, and incredible food.  What more can you ask for?Straight to the food.  The Hudson Valley foie. Presented two ways.  Poached (sous-vide) served with a horseradish emulsion, tart sauerkraut and smoky Morteau sausage.  A great savory balance between earthy, tart, smoky flavors all cutting the richness of the foie.  Second, "nuggets" of a foie terrine "glazed" with Glenmorangie dusted with sweet and spicy gingerbread power and hazelnuts.  The smoky undertones of the single malt accentuates the mineral, livery taste of the foie.  Delish.  Apple ice cream on the side; perfect.The Dover sole & prawns is hard to top.  The orange scented fish ("glazed" with orange cider) is brought to life by an earthy morel cream and vegetal flavors of turnips, coriander, and spinach.  The addition of prawns adds sweetness and a nice oceanic flavor.  Complex yet refreshing dish.The list of great dishes goes on and on.  The degustation menus are the best way to sample Twist.  Portions are scaled down so no risk of over eating (unless you have the six course grand desert).  Beautiful and delicious; just remember, you've been warned.  Note for beef lovers:  Twist offers the best priced Japanese A5 Wagyu steak in Vegas.  Offered as a New York steak;  10 ounces, $198.   Of course, eating this would be BORING.Multiple revisits, always a twist!Items experienced:Ginger Sable with almonds and sea salt, Lavosh Bread with Tuna foam with Bonito Flakes, Tartlette of Goat Cheese with Cherry Meringue, Guinness GeleeMetamorphosis - Aromatized Gin, Honey Syrup, Lemon JuiceSalted and Unsalted Isigny Butter / Cheddar Bacon, Cherry Walnut, French Baguette, Fennel and HerbRolly Gassman Pinot GrisRavioli of Foie Gras, Seared Langoustine with Dried Orange Zezette Bouillon and Paris Mushroom SaladKallstadtler Annsberg Spatlese 2008 ChardonnayHudson Valley Foie Gras - Seared Duck Foie Gras, Red Cabbage Reduction, Red Beet Wedges / Duck Foie Gras Terrine with Marbled Dried Fig, Date Paste, Carrot Fondant, Pimento Puree / Shaved fresh Foie Gras, Tandori Apple Syrup, Spinach, Green Apple SaladMarotti Campi Orgiolo Lacrima di Morro d'Alba Superiore 2010Muscovy Duck Aiguillettes with Green Pepper, Casis Bigarade Sauce, Braised Daikon Turnips, Marguerite Potato, HuckleberriesCreamy Morels10 year Stilton Cheddar, Brillat Savarin, Humboldt Fog, Fourme d'Ambert, Triple Cream Goat, Milk Gelee, Julien Vegetables, Toast, Winter Fruit Marmalade, Port Fig ChutneySamos Nectar Vintage 2002Beet Raspberry Macaron / Pineapple Saffron Meringue / Choco Taco with Sesame, Green Tea, Chocolate Pearls White Truffle Souffle - Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Caramelzed Pears, White Truffle Simple SyrupGrand Dessert Pierre Gagnaire - Arugula Financier with White Truffle, Pistachio Chantilly, Green Apple Tuile, Sorbet / Crumbly Shortbread, Black Currant Syrup, Caramelized Pear and Passion Fruit Marmalade with Honey / Multicolored Meringue, Golden Raisin, Polignac Almond, Ganache with Old Rum / Lemon Jelly with Limoncello, Chocolate Ice Cream, Mango Veloute and Wedges, Raspberry Sorbet and Coconut Milk with LimeHaving long held Pierre Gagnaire as my favorite chef I'd be lying if I did not admit that the existence of Twist at The Mandarin Oriental played some small part in my Vegas relocation decision and knowing that M. Gagnaire frequents each of his properties it was only a matter of time before I returned; the resulting four and a half hours amongst my ten best meals of 2013 and capped off by two dishes that warrant 'all time' best consideration.  Joined by friends somewhat outside my typical 'dining circle' for a truly memorable experience it was with great poise and frequent smiles that the professional staff worked and with expectedly flawless service the food and wine that followed simply 'fit' the room, the mood, and even the conversation - sometimes serious, often whimsical, at times challenging, but always excellent.  Steeped in the stream of consciousness characteristic to Gagnaire but reigned in and refined to razor sharp precision under the eye of Ryuki Kawasaki it was with expected flare that each course was delivered as a collection of plates and with bold, familiar flavors frequently reinvented by subtle nuance the meal unfolded as a slow moving dialogue without the traditional light-to-heavy structure, instead designing each plate as a segue both forward and back with growing complexity defining progress to the final savory before finally breaking pace for a special request I'll likely never forget - a tall, proud soufflé for the ages first imbued and then crowned with the last of the season's white truffles.Situated 23 floors above the Strip in the MO Hotel, the restaurant offers great views of our cities most famous landmark, and an even better view of it at night. We were seated away from the window in a more casual setting, the three of us enjoyed the atmosphere, we were able to take a couple sneak peaks of the kitchen. Definitely recommend if you are here on a date, I'd reserve a table by the window.It was a tough decision to make, it was my first time there so I was on the fence about choosing the tasting menu or a la carte. I let our server choose, and he recommended the four course tasting menu, and I chose to do the wine pairing as well. Bread basket included a cheddar bacon, cherry walnut, french baguette and a fennel herb roll along with salted and unsalted imported butter. *Rolly Gassman Pinot Gris*Ravioli of Foie Gras, seared langoustine with dried orange zezette bouillon, Paris mushroom salad*Kallstadler Annsberg Spatlese Chardonnay*Turbot, poached fillet in vadouvan butter, grapefruit fondue with tandoori leek, celery & snow peas julienne*Marotti Campi Orgiolo*Wagyu Beef, peppercorn steak, red cabbage marmalade, white beans, lentil & shiitake*Samos Necar Vintage *Grand Dessert- Arugula financier, pistachio chantilly, green apple tuile & sorbet, crumbly shortbread, black current syrup, apple & passion fruit marmalade, multicolored meringue, polignac almond, ganache with old rum, lemon jelly with limoncello, chocolate ice cream, mango veloute & wedges, raspberry sorbet & coconut milk with lime.I enjoyed my meal, but I felt dessert was bit of a let down. I wasn't completely impressed with the tasting menu dessert. Although, the white truffle soufle that was ordered off the menu was amazing. To top off the night, Chef Gagnaire was in house and made his way around the restaurant to each table and introduced himself which was a nice addition to our meal.I still stand firm that Pierre owes me a make out session for what I paid for dinner and wine pairing.***Twist delivers contemporary French cuisine; it is good for Vegas but still a notch below top SF and Chicago spots***Twist is yet another Vegas fine dining restaurant from an internationally acclaimed chef like Robuchon and Savoy.  Twist is newer though.  It is located on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin hotel.  Being newer, I was hoping for more contemporary cuisine than what I've had at Vegas' other fine dining French restaurants and Twist delivered.Twist features a lot of good (and modern) food while still showcasing French ingredients and cooking techniques.  Twist offers several dining options.  You can go for a more value-centric 3-course dinner.  You can also order a la carte where you choose from elaborate plates that feature proteins in multiple interpretations (the multiple presentations of foie gras sounded interesting) as well as big Prime steaks.  Finally, you can opt for one of their tasting menus--a vegetarian option or their seasonal tasting menu (available in 4 or 6 courses).I opted for the tasting menu and it started off very well.  First came a series of tasty amuses.  There were lavash breadsticks with albacore cream and bonito flakes (pate-like in richness), an almond sable, very good goat cheese sandwiched between two light and crispy crackers, and a really good Guinness and Jack Daniels gelee rolled in gingerbread (great burn but also sweet--reminiscent of the cocktail gels at LA's Providence).The bread was also good (several warm options including a warm bacon and smoked cheddar roll, a crusty French baguette, a too dense brioche roll, herb and feta, and cherry pecan bread).My first course was sea bass and haddock carpaccio with citrus and horseradish ice cream.  The fish was good--moist and soft--and went well with the citrus and herbs to give it freshness.  The horseradish ice cream was very creamy and had a noticeable horseradish flavor without being overpowering.My second course was easily my favorite of the night.  It was foie gras ravioli next to seared langoustine in a herb and coconut milk broth (topped with crispy mushrooms).  The foie gras ravioli had a thick pasta skin as well as creamy, buttery and savory seared foie gras at the center.  The langoustine was very nicely cooked--fresh, lightly sweet, plump, and soft.  The broth was very aromatic.  This reminded me of the buttery foie gras ravioli at Providence and the perfectly cooked langoustine at L'atelier de Joel Robuchon (two very good restaurants).Next up was a fish course and it was disappointing.  It was turbot and the fish was a little tough and not easy to flake--definitely far from Baume's soft and flaky turbot.  Worse than the slightly tough fish was the grapefruit (very acidic and bitter).  This felt like something that maybe should have came earlier because the acidity was too much for an entree.A good intermezzo of apple and yuzu sorbet with Dungeness crab came next.  Chicken followed and it was served on warm greens with pistachio.  I do not often see chicken on fine dining menus, but I was glad to see it because chicken can be really good if a crispy skin is achieved and the meat is juicy.  The meat was fairly juicy here, but there was no crispy skin.  The greens were okay, but this course felt overseasoned.Wagyu beef was the final savory course.  It was served over warm sweet and sour red cabbage slaw.  The Wagyu had a fair amount of richness.  Unfortunately, it was overcooked.  It was also more like tri-tip than a true steak so it was slightly tough and chewy.Dessert consisted of a series of mini desserts, which I felt overall were too fruit focused as well as too tart.  The first dessert was really good strawberries with cream and a nice strawberry sorbet.  The pistachio and cucumber parfait was refreshing and had great creaminess, but there were too many leafy greens, which resulted in a salad-like flavor and texture.  There was also a shortbread cookie with blackberries.  The chocolate part of the dessert had rich chocolate ice cream as well as light meringues and a fruit paste.Service was excellent--very polished and personable.  I thought my server Breanne was really good and the male server assisting her delivered food presentations with professionalism and knowledge but also an enthusiasm that really makes you want to dive into the food.Prices were very high, but that is the case with many Vegas restaurants.Twist provides a good view of The Strip; the dining room is nice, elegant and contemporary.I am not a fan of Vegas restaurants and there were a few things about Twist that reminded me why I feel this way (the high prices and how Vegas fine dining does not measure up to SF or Chicago).  The food here felt more exciting than Aureole, Guy Savoy and miX though and it is worth a shot if you are looking for high-end but also contemporary French cuisine in Vegas.CityCenter offers free self parking.I've been contemplating on how to rate my dining experience at Twist. On the one hand, man, did the food (and the view!) totally remind me why I love nice restaurants. On the other hand, the service was downright intolerable. I thought that given the quality of the service we received, it wouldn't be fair to give Twist a 4-star rating. Because when I think of Twist, I don't think, "Yay! I'm a fan".. it's more, "Food was good, BUT..."When my friends and I arrived for our 10 pm Saturday night reservation, we were told by an unapologetic hostess that the party seated at our table was still working on their entrees and may or may not be ordering dessert. She suggested that we go take a seat at the bar and they will come get us.After giving them 15 minutes to come get us, I decided to get the whole story. Apparently the party before us arrived late (about 30 minutes late for a Saturday night reservation) but they decided to seat them anyway. She didn't offer any apologies to compensate for the inconvenience. Plus, here's my other argument: what was the point of making reservations if they're just going to a) seat people whenever they show up and b) make people wait? We may as well have shown up sans reservation - I would've been less irritated.The manager, as if to compensate for the rude hostess, came to find us and said that they would be paying for the drinks we have at the bar and he will personally come find us when our table was ready. When we finally got seated, the service was nothing short of obsequious. We were also presented with extra amuse bouche courses.Although the food was delicious, I can't help but have that negative service taint my memory of this meal and this restaurant. A part of me feels bad because the manager and wait stuff really tried but I still can't get over the rude hostess. I'm not sure if I've had better food in Vegas but I've definitely had better service.Items Selected:Kumquat Meringue Tartlet with Goat Cheese and Short Bread Cookie / Smoked Sable with Chervil and Apple / Carrot Sesame Mousse / Parmesan and Sea Salt Biscuit/ Red Beet Gelee with Hazelnut Crumble / Souffle of Comte Cheese, Lavosh-Baguette, Brioche, Bacon Cheddar, Sauterne Pumpernickel, Cherry Walnut - Isigny Salted, Echire Unsalted-Chanterelle Soup - Coffee Morel Ravioli, Peppered Shrimp, Langoustines, English Peas-Spring - Chanterelle Soup with Parmesan, English Peas, Spring Onion, Swiss Chard / Stuffed Rabbit Saddle, Fresh Herb Jus, Black Olive / Baby Artichoke and Nougatine / Asparagus Custard with Chervil and Mozzarella Ice Cream / Tomato Tart with Basil and Spinach-Foie Gras Terrine - Charred Onion Gelee, Passion Fruit Pulp, Artichoke Cream, Spinach, Crispy Toast, Semillon Vinegar-Hudson Valley Foie Gras - Ringo Starr (Milk Chocolate, Gold, Chantilly of Foie, Terrine of Foie, Smoked Pepper Puree / Foie Gras Ice Cream with White Port, Charred onion Gelee, Passion Fruit Syrup, Baby Turnip, Watermelon Radish / Apple and Shallot Marmalade with Cinnamon, Sliced Duck, Cassis Tuille, Red Beet-Grilled Beef with Fresh Herb Butter - Eggplant Slice, English Mint Pea Puree, Chorizo, Tomme de Savoie/ Bone Marrow Croquette with Ramp and Potato Crisp / Bordelaise Sauce-Maine Lobster - Lobster Fricasse Turner, Chantilly Lace / Green Apple, Cucumber Gel, Lobster Rillette / Jasmine and Basmati Rice with Lobster Bisque-Seasonal Mushrooms-Pont Neuf Potatoes with Iberco de Bellota-Zwart Kaas (5 year aged Sheep's milk Gouda, Netherlands) / Gres de Champenois (Cow's milk Double Crème, Champagne) / Cana de Oveja (Soft-Ripened Sheep's milk log, Murcia) / Carboncino (Charcoal ash crusted Blend, Piedmont) / St. Agur Bleu (60 day Cow's milk Double Crème, Auvergne) / Gorgonzola Pear Ice Cream, Dark Chocolate Trail Mix, Kirsch Cherry Marmalade-Praline Éclair - Vanilla Pastry Cream, Coffee and Cognac, Pear and Caramelized Almond with Hazelnut / Black Sesame Ice Cream, Sliced Apricot, Hazelnut Crumble-Calvados and Caramel Parfait with Milk Chocolate Coated Apple and Kumquat Compote / Nashi Pear Wedge with Apricot and Peach Compote-Grand Dessert - Raspberry Sable with Basil, Mascarpone Coulis, Parfait Glace / Pistachio Biscuit Moelleux & Green Tea Ice Cream, Sweet Wine Cubes / Black Chocolate Ganache, Milk Caramel Ball, Bailey's and Coffee Granite / Cherry Soup, Prune Cream, Cassis Sorbet, Meringue Sticks / Peach and Apricot Compote with Rosemary, Pistachio Sugar Leaf, Orange Almond Cream-Lime Tart, Chocolate Vanilla Truffle, Apricot MarshmallowSuffice it to say that I'm a known entity at Twist and with my predilections to Chef Ryuki's interpretation of Pierre Gagnaire's cuisine well known a meal on Saturday night would prove just as thrilling as those prior, a showering of plates with mostly stellar service lasting over four hours in the butterfly adorned Spring dining room.  With Gagnaire himself present in the kitchen - as well as the dining room, bar, and even lobby - tending to details both small and large it was to an array of innovative canapés plus a quintet of breads with butters from Isigny and Echire that we began and moving next through six courses of meticulous sourcing and style rare would be a lull, a full emersion in the kitchen's stream of consciousness with a leisurely flowing pace. Opting for one tasting and courses a la carte to match 'Spring' began with flavors smacking of the season and although mushrooms both here and later were slightly over-seasoned everything else showed fresh and vibrant, a concept that carried right along to the course that followed - a flood of foie gras comprising seared, salad, torchon, terrine, and even ice cream.  Transitioning to 'surf n' turf' in an eight plate third course of butter poached lobster juxtaposing aggressively peppered beef before progressing to five cheeses novel to even the experienced it was at last in two separate courses that sweets arrived and with Gagnaire himself overseeing the pastry preparation that evening every item arrived with a flourish; a garnish here or an extra plate there to cap another stunning meal.Three of us met at 7 PM for dinner.  Michael U had received notice from one of the employees at Twist that Chef Gagnaire would be in Las Vegas for a range of dates.  It was because of this we booked at this time.  The restaurant, on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in City Center, is elegant and the view is very good.The three of us ended up getting a modified version of the grand tasting menu.  We were brought three rolls each and then the meal began.  First up was an amuse-blouche of two small bites with the server suggesting the correct order to eat the two. Course one was sea urchin mousseline with caviar.  There was gelée of bonito and grilled onion infusion and olive oil infused salsify spaghettini.  It was recommended that we mix the sea urchin with the spaghettini for the greatest flavor.  An excellent dish and an auspicious start for the evening. Course two was lobster fricassee with kaffir lime and enoki mushrooms, baby carrot stew and sweet wine and green tea butter and the dish was topped with some edible flowers.  The lobster was simply superb!Course three was modified by us.  We added an extra course at an extra charge. It was carnaroli risotto with artichokes and pine nuts.  It was topped with some micro greens and a LOT of shaved truffles.  What a grand melding of flavors with the truffles and risotto and the pine nuts added a texture that made this dish another winner.Next was time for a palate cleanser of some sorbet to ready us for the foie gras coming next.Course four was the roasted foie gras with coffee and chestnut velouté, prunes and porcini.  More truffles were shaved on this dish and it was absolutely sublime.  The sauce was so rich and the mushrooms with the foie were the tops!Course five was another divergence on our part.  We asked if we could sub proteins and we could.  Instead of the American Wagyu beef, I got Muscovy duck.  It ha d a green pepper sauce and caramelized pear and pine nuts.  The duck was accompanied by whisky jus eggplant cannelloni with duck confit.  Another winner, but I don't think I need to keep stating that.  A very good switch.Course six was a series of desserts.  One of them we added à la carte--the mille-feuille with praline cream, cassis compote and blackberry sorbet.  We each took a third of this shared dessert but only one (me) slopped on the nice white linen.The grand dessert course consists of three items: 1) Cassis: sorbet, wurtz, marmalade and cane sugar and pink pepper opaline; 2) Honey orange gelée, shortbread, mango and passion fruit topped with fromage blanc ice cream; 3) Chocolate gateau with golden raisins and Amarena cherries.   A suggestion was made in what order we should eat the desserts to get the fullest flavor profiles and it was a grand suggestion.  The dessert were rich, full of exceptional flavors, and very satisfying.  My favorite was the sorbet with grape halves that had been frozen and were around the sorbet.  A great concept.Wait, we're not done yet.  Next we were brought a plate of three lemon meringue bites that had lemon filling between the two sections of meringue.  Each meringue bite was accompanied by three blueberries on an edible toothpick.We're still not done--dessert six was brought for the three of us to share.  It was Gagnaire's Tanzanian chocolate parfait with coffee granité and caramelized hazelnuts.This was rich, smooth, and a perfect chocolaty end to this grand tasting meal.Service was outstanding as you would expect from Twist.  Chef Gagnaire came from the kitchen for a brief hello and the Chef de Cuisine, Ryuki Kawasaki, also came out and chatted with us for a short time and talked about his upcoming move to Bangkok, Thailand.Before leaving, we each received a signed menu from both chefs with the date.  A keepsake for sure!  We also got a small package of two biscotti with the Twist logo to take with us.  Our jackets were waiting for us at the host's stand and we were helped on with them.I can't say too many good words about this wonderful meal.  Three hours of good food, good company, and wonderful surroundings.  This is as good as it gets and a reason why this was my second visit but not my last!!At this point on a first name basis with a reservationist at The Mandarin Oriental who keeps me abreast of when Chef Gagnaire will be visiting his Forbes 5-Starred Twist, it was with somewhat sad news that I was informed my favorite chef would be in town the first weekend of 2015 to see off current Chef de Cuisine, Ryuki Kawasaki - a man soon to rightfully toque his own project in Bangkok, and someone whose cooking myself and two others were lucky enough to experience one more time over the course of three-hours from the 23rd floor room overlooking the dazzling lights below.Written about four times prior, thrice under the care of Chef Kawasaki whose interpretation and execution of Gagnaire's signature style is undoubtedly the best I've seen, the fifth visit to Twist found the room largely unchanged as lighted baubles hung overhead and with a slight change in the soundtrack offering a mix of French tunes and mid-70s American classics a sizable four-top along the "cracked egg" wall served as our table throughout the course a night filled with superlative service and cuisine  most akin to that which was experienced at Le Rue Balzac in 2011, still the best meal of my life.Starting with a truncated amuse consisting of two bites - salt and earth followed by bitter and sweet - to awaken the palate, it was not long after selecting a slightly augmented version of the evening's tasting menu that plated bread arrived, and paired with two butters from Normandy all three fresh-baked selections were as good as ever, the crunchy baguette a showstopper with the salted butter while the buttery brioche proved an amicable sponge for several sauces as the meal progressed.Wasting little time in getting started it was perhaps ten minutes after seating that plate one of the six-course menu arrived and with a spiral of thinly sliced salsify riffing on spaghetti the umami-laden sauce of creamed urchin topped with briny bubbles and hints of onion proved absolutely ethereal on its own, but all the better when blended with the 'pasta' and a base of consommé-clear gelee teaming with flavors of the ocean - a beautiful opening act on which a subsequent plate of snappy lobster enlivened with sweet wine and light bitters would expound before turning to things far more earthy, aromatic, and luxurious to say the least.At this point departing briefly from the night's grand tasting it was in a silver domed supplement that we all indulged and with each plate uncovered simultaneously the unmistakable scent of white truffles soon perfumed the air, each of us breathing in deeply before taking a spoonful of creamy risotto dotted with butter poached artichokes that proved an adept delivery mechanism for the sort of flavor one eats slowly to savor, and only wishes was available year round.Provided with an intermezzo to refresh the palate in preparation for things yet to come it seemed most improbable that anything following the risotto would prove a more memorable dish on the night and yet as luck, as well as fresh black truffles, would have it there were two superior plates to follow - the juicy chicken atop sliced cephalopod as complex as it was impressive while the soup proved to be amongst the best dishes to grace my palate in recent memory - a tender float of foie gras atop brioche finding its foil in a base that was at once sweet and savory with a toasty base-note lurking beneath a generous truffle crown.Opting to order the Mille-Feuille in addition to the included "Grande Dessert" it would be difficult to decide which of the four sweets was the most impressive of the night but with frozen grapes adding an unexpected degree of nuance to the small bowl titled Cassis the scaled back finale was without a doubt the most well conceptualized in my Twist experiences to date - a complimentary taste of the feather-light Tanzanian Chocolate capping the evening alongside fruity mignardises while autographed menus and duos of biscotti were offered as bonus gifts for the road.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Perhaps the most 'straight forward' meal enjoyed at Twist to-date in terms of a diminished selection of amuses, canapés, mignardises, satellite plates, and components to the Grand Dessert it seems that a transition is already underway in the Kitchen as Ryuki Kawasaki plans his departure, but with each dish an absolute gem of taste and presentation with service that remains the most professional and least 'stuffy' of all the formal French dining rooms in the city it seems safe to assume that the future is in good hands - a return visit already in its planning stages, once the new Chef is named.Finally getting the opportunity to dine at Twist, I couldn't resist the tasting menu. The restaurant is located inside the Mandarin Oriental and every seat includes dazzling views of the strip.Without going over each course in detail, I will say every bite was absolutely delicious and I can't think of a better fine dining experience that I have had in the last few years. It was gluttonous, divine and my dining companions left with bright smiles on our faces and full stomachs.Before we left, we each received a personalized signed menu from the evening which was a treat.Service was impeccable, as expected, and I can't think of one thing about the meal wasn't sheer perfection. The perfect way to spend three hours on a Saturday night in Vegas.
Halftime Sports Bar & Grill=I've been to Halftime 5 times since it's opening last year. The food is very plain and distasteful. Granted that they have the typical barroom food, but it's just not good. I've had better from the frozen food isle. The service is slow. The people are rude and a little haughty. Let's face it, this is Buckeye. There's is and never will be a reason to be haughty. Won't return and tell everyone we know that it's an undesirable place to be. It's worth the drive to go a little farther to the Longhorn for a truly delicious burger and friendly, efficient service.First buckeye is hell. Second, when I did walk in the server did say for me to sit anywhere I wanted..and all but one table was dirty. 3rd I couldn't tell you anything about the food because I was sitting there for 10 minutes without anybody asking me for even a drink order or to give me a menu. I walked out...
Mexico Lindo=At first glance it does not look like much, but looks are deceiving. This is straight up authentic Mexican food. Pure awesomeness in my mouth! We were the only people in here, and I was a little hesitant at first. Then, the food came out! It was awesome. There are a 3 signs when I go to a Mexican restaurant that I look for----I'll Tell you them:1.It has to have real Mexican cheese of some sort. Chihuahua Cheese is my fav.2. I need to see Verde----like truly good tasting tomitillo homeade sauce.3. I need a Steak Taco! A good flank steak taco can not be beat.This place knocked them out of the park! Also they brought a nice mixed Mexican veggie bowl that I really did appreciate. It was fresh cactus along with a pico. Totally unexpected and awesome. To really push my in love with this place, I was handed a free piece of cake on my walk out the door filled with fresh strawberries! I almost gave the waitress a hug I was so excited!Great true Mexican food in Madison!
Pittza Rella=I haven't had Pittza Rella in about a year and randomly a few days ago my brain and stomach was craving their unique out of this world delicious steak rolls and pepperoni rolls.  When they came, they were even better than I remember them being.This place puts a lot of love into the rolls.  Rather than separate round rolls they come in a long roll that's cut into slices.  The steak comes with peppers onions and mushroom and cheese.  The outside is crispy and perfectly browned and the same goes for the pepperoni rolls.  If you are a classic Pittsburgher you'll want some ranch dressing to dip them in so be sure to ask for it cause it doesn't come with it.  We also ordered pizza which I never had before and even that impressed me.  The cheese and toppings and everything stayed in its place bite after bite.  The crust was light and crispy, not too cooked not undercooked, just right.If you are in the West Mifflin/Homestead/Munhall area and you want to try an alternative just as good as Pizza Company with its own flare, Pittza Rella is a great game day decision.
Garage Beirut=I passed by this place a few times and was intrigued.  I am really happy I went there to eat yesterday. Kibbeh was deliciously crunchy. Hummus creamy, baba ghanouj real tasty. come here if you want real authentic food.
Red Wok Buffet=I do not normally like to eat in buffets because I do not like to overeat, but my mom wanted to try this place.They just opened, so we decided to try this place for lunch.I thought it was decent, and some of the dishes were actually pretty tasty.I noticed the majority of buffet eaters were gravitating towards the fried and hot food stations. They had a variety of items such as baked salmon, fried shrimp, crab casserole, fried chicken, baked mussels, pork humba and more. My brother liked them, and he said they were remarkably flavorful.I went to the fruit and salad station and tried the sushi bar which had a wide selection.I love the fact that they have edename and kim chee on their appetizer buffet. Good stuff!They also have a stir fry station where food is made to order. You put all your vegetable ingredients, and sauces on a plate, and they will make a stir fry dish for you.The dessert cakes also look appetizing, but I skipped them and tried the ice cream instead.They have various flavors, and you can even put toppings on them.I tried the peppermint ice cream which was quite refreshing.The place was also very clean, and they also offer senior discounts.To sum up my review, I give them 4 stars for having a large selection and great service. Lots of choices both for vegetarians and meat eaters.I think they will do well. They picked an excellent location with ample parking and great buffet price too.For $7.50 plus tip, there's no room for grumbling.So, I really hate buffets in Arizona. They suck, they're shady, and they make me want to cry or vomit or both. I'm a HUGE fan of eating - throw in unlimited eating of half decent foods and we're talking solid gold! Needless to say, Vegas is my kind of town! However, since I don't live in Vegas, finding all you can eat options in Phoenix has become my new life's passion. Enter Red Wok. Now, it's no Fogo de Chao, it's not really even Las Vegas Blvd worthy, but it IS off-boulevard sketchy strip mall worthy in the highest sense of the word! The actual facility is surprisingly beautiful and clean! The food is okay for buffet food (a solid 3.5 stars) but here's the clincher: all you can eat char siu bau, chinese spare ribs, fried plantains, kalbi, and kimchee and it's all GOOD! The soups are a little bland and I pretty much avoided the rice/chow mein fillers but most of the other things were pretty darn delicioso! I saw boiled crawfish and peel and eat shrimp but I haven't decided if I'm brave enough for that venture just yet - I did eat a sushi roll and although it didn't SEEM gross, I think mentally I can't get over the idea of buffet sushi - much like I'm sure tongue tastes great but Jesus man, it's TONGUE! At  just under $9 for an adult lunch with drink, I actually feel like I'm getting my money's worth and then some! I am actually planning to return to try the ice cream and Mongolian BBQ station but considering I just downed half  dozen mini coffee cakes, I think I'll call it a night. I loved the facility, I loved the service, I liked the food, but add the Marvin Gaye and circa 1980's Madonna playing in the background and I'm totally sold! :)I could regale you with a list of every dish available but it is a buffet so you know what to expect before you walk in. It specializes in Asian cuisine so the majority of dishes have a distinctly oriental flavor.They do have some non-Asian dishes including mashed potatoes, pizza, French fries and barbecued chicken. They also have some steak pieces and spicy ribs as well.If you are hungry for sushi you will be able to fill yourself up with standard sushi fare. They also have seaweed salad and edamame.The meal is less than $10 for dinner unless you want to add a soft drink which is $2 more.The most common entree is chicken which is prepared in at least twelve different ways.They have some interesting desserts as well as ice cream so you will not leave here hungry.There is seating for lots of people as well as an additional room that will seat a whole bunch more.This is not a place to take your sweetheart on a first date. Also not a place to impress the boss. Great for large groups if you are paying for everyone. Great for hungry people and people who enjoy stuffing themselves to the gills and then feeling bad because they couldn't control their greed.Red Wok will not appeal to everyone and once in a while it may not agree with you, but it is great value for money.
Mansion Dining Room=In a series of fortunate events, we ended up dining atrium al fresco in the Mansion dining room for lunch today.  You can't even imagine the picturesque nature of the mansion.  Essentially, it is a private boutique hotel nestled under a temperature controlled, aroma controlled glass dome.  The "rooms" are private villas, generally for invited guests.The tables are pristine in the dining room.  Sparkiling silver and china, white linens, polished glassware, sterling carts.....it's all there.  The dining room opens to the atrium.  The peaceful gurgling of fountains, and the soft classical music create a truly tranquil environment.I ordered the creamy artichoke soup and carrot tortellini with short ribs.  My husband had king crab louis salad and dover sole. Our meal started with bread service.  There was a small platter presented with 4 different types of bread and a perfectly shaped rectangle of softened butter.  Each course is served seamlessly by the white gloved, suited waiters with the acompanying utensils.  My soup was creamy, buttery, artichoky, piping hot and topped with cripy artichoke hearts.  The king crab louis was a beautiful plate with lettuce hearts, olives, teardrop tomatoes, bell peppers, cheese, and generous chunks of sweet light crab.  It was all drizzled with a creamy, delightful, and surprisingly light lemon dressing.  On to the main course....my carrot tortellini was knock your socks off, out of this world, delectable!   It was a surpsing portion of braised kobe short ribs, petite turned carrots, and mini hand rolled tortellini.  The tortellini immediately melted in your mouth in a pool of umami beef jus.  It was just so darn savory and delightful.  The dover sole was probably the most beautiful plate of food I have ever seen.  It was cleverly served with pea puree and carrot puree instead of the average "peas and carrots."  It came with a sterling pitcher of herbed clarified butter.  It had onions, fried capers, and fresh peas as an artful garnish.  We finished off with a pot of tea, madelines, and petit fours.  They served chocolate and vanilla madelines, miniature truffles, guava jelly, and miniature almond clusters.The meal was lovely...and it was merely a lunch! I'm sure dinner is an elaborate performance of service and cuisine.  Be ready to pay for this level of excellence though.  Our bill, for lunch, for 8, without any alcohol, was $720.  My tortellini was $48 while the sole was $60....you won't find this out until the end because there aren't any prices on the menu.  But then again, I'm confident the average mansion diner just plum doesn't care.
Giada's Italian Cucina=Wow. Major disappointment.We used the free house wine offer, and gave it to my mom.I ordered the "crispy" (deep fried) and "sticky" (covered in mozz cheese) balls (I guess they are trying to make the old ladies blush when they read the menu) in diablo hot. ($10) for two. I also ordered a Caesar salad. My guy asked the owner (who was our waiter, and parks his lambo on the sidewalk, in front of the place) what dish is their best, especially for first comers. His answer... Chicken Parm.... really? Chicken parm? He got the marsala.We ordered calamari for an appetizer. It was not crispy. It was flavorless. Seriously, needed salt and pepper.My beef balls came (haha, they are suppose to be "gourmet). The extra money you spend to have them "crispy" and "sticky" go to waste. There was no texture to these meat balls. They were pure mush. The sauce was pretty good though, and spicy.When the marsala was delivered, I knew that the veggies on the side were either frozen, or out of a can. The carrots were the circles with the crinkle pattern on them, and the broccoli was just the stems, not the fluffy tops. The marsala sauce was overly sweet.Overall, Meh. No thanks.
Einstein Bros Bagels=Trader Joes, fro yo, nail salon, restaurants, a wine bar, shopping, soon-to-be drug store and now a bagel shop. Yes, this area absolutely needed the bagel shop addition! This is a pretty general Einstein Bagels but it's clean, in a good area, has friendly staff and the bagels are fresh and tasty! I really like how Einstein Bagels added thin bagels to their menu. I love their bagels but they can be to hearty for a breakfast, so the thin bagel is a great option. I also enjoy the bagel bites and bagel sandwiches (breakfast and lunch) as well. The cream cheeses are creamy and delicious, especially the honey almond cream cheese. My favorite bagel is the cinnamon sugar bagel. They also have great soda drinks, coffee, fruit, parfait and juices. There isn't much more to say other than that this is a perfect addition to the area and I'm happy to have an Einstein's close by for my morning breakfast urges.There are very few bagel shops in the Old Town area other than this Einsteins and a couple of others.  So, every now and then, I'll pop into this location to pick up some bagels for the house... they happen to have tasty schmears (aka cream cheese flavors) and quality lox as well.Unfortunately, the last few times I've been to this location, the service has been painfully slow.  Also, they are often out of certain kinds of bagels that I like including the honey whole wheat.  On the bright side, they will slice the bagels for you and/or put them in plastic bags to keep them fresh.  Their coffee isn't bad, and this location has a decent sized parking lot too... and if you need any groceries, you can run next door to Trader Joe's (or around the corner to AJ's) without moving your car!If you have the time and don't mind driving a tad bit further, I recommend both Chompie's and NY Bagel and Bialy over Einsteins, but if your expectations are in check and/or you're in a hurry, this Einsteins will do.  Just keep in mind that it's a chain, the service may be slow, and while the food won't blow you away, it is pretty consistent.
Arepera du Plateau=This place introduced me (and perhaps the city) to the Arepas. These soft corn based bread which is stuffed with awesomeness, be it meat, poultry or veggies.The Arepa (bread) is gluten free, so yay for celiac sufferers, the other ingredients I am not sure. Vege friendly yes, vegan friendly - not to my knowledge.If people LOVE their spicy sauce, they have two excellent sauces. The red sauce has lots of heat (go easy on this one) and their green sauce is avocado based with a touch of cilantro/coriander and is packed with flavour.Messy eaters be warned, the stuffing can fall out so eat in small bites and use food physics to your advantage!
Hey Joe! Filipino Street Food Truck=5 stars for starting up a food truck and solid 3.5 for food. An exciting new addition to the Phoenix food truck scene. They made their Phoenix Public Market debut last night at the Wednesday evening market. They have a short but sweet menu that includes a Lumpia trio for $5, various combos of Grilled skewers of Pork, Chicken or combos that include skewers, lumpia and even chicken feet which range between $7-$10. All entrees are served with rice and pickled ginger "salad". They also offered chicken feet, chicken "ass", and a rare delicacy called balut (which if you finish you get free Lumpia on your next visit.) Deciding I wasn't feeling adventurous enough for the Balut I ordered the Lumpia trio. It was a rather popular selection that evening as others around me were ordering the same. They cook their Lumpia to order and after about a 5 min wait I received 3 HOT and crispy Lumpia. These were very good! and the dipping sauce made them better. Next time I hope to try the chicken "ass"...if this is anything like the Turkey tails you get at some Mexican Deli places I am down for trying these and I love the chicken feet at Chinese Dim Sum so I hope to try these next time.Delicious! The Hey Joe Special is comprised of perfectly tender and moist chicken (served on the bone, slightly awkward/messy but really really perfectly done), beautifully seasoned pork, and lumpia for $8, along with a pinch of salad and a healthy scoop of rice for the sides. The lumpia were (was? i don't know Filipino food) crispy and savory - I'm glad I splashed the sweet/spicy sauce Brian recommended on them. The pork had an intriguing citrus flavor which I loved. The Hey Joe truck will be at 18th Ave & Deer Valley on Mondays from 11-1 for the foreseeable future (your best way to find them is to follow them at twitter.com/heyjoetruck), and I will be there w/ an appetite.I'm an amateur when it comes to food trucks but my friend took me a spot that had 10 trucks parked for a weekday lunch. I chose to eat Filipino food and it was really good. The price is on the high side for it not being a sit down restaurant.  I had the pancit noodles and the lumpia and they were delicious. If you enjoy good Filipino food or you've never tried it, this is a good place to go.
Coach & Willie's=I hate to be the first to review this with such a negative rating, unfortunately opening day did not do the place justice.  I understand that opening on a Friday night has its perks - lots of business, great way to show your nightlife capabilities - and show off in general, fresh crowds and new people to bring in and form into regulars, etc, etc, however if you're going to open on a Friday and be understaffed, it's not going to go very smooth.  My fiance and I showed up around 7pm and were sat promptly outside with no wait, which was nice considering all of the people that were in the bar area.  We didn't notice anything suspicious, everything seemed to be in good order and the place was spotless as far as cleanliness goes.  Then we sat down with the menus and were left alone without a drink order.  10 minutes later, our waitress showed up and took our orders - Arnold Palmer and a Port Brewing Wipeout IPA.  Another 10 minutes passes and the Arnold Palmer and two waters show up, but no beer.  Apparently they're out of most of their craft draft and bottled beer due to their soft opening the night before.  Okay, I guess I'll order something else.  The waitress excuses herself before I can order a different beer and I watch as she takes orders from 5 other tables around us, runs to the bar and kitchen twice before returning with another Arnold Palmer.  I order a Ska beer. "Which one? We have two."  I know, bring me whichever one you have available right now.  She smiles and trots away before we can order food.  We sat for another 15 minutes before my fiance went up to the bar to order me a beer.  The waitress passed us three more times before she brought out a beer for me, Ska Pinstripe red ale in a bottle.  With no glass.  But at least she stuck around long enough for us to order some food.Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against sucking down a beer straight from the bottle, but I wasn't exactly drinking a Corona or a Bud Lite.  Even then, don't most sports bars - and bars/restaurants in general - provide a glass with a canned or bottled beer?  I can even look past if the glass is frosted (yes, I am a beer snob, it happens to be my line of work), but to have no option of drinking out of a glass seems a little...odd to me.  I chalked it up to it being opening night, again, but I was finally beginning to run out of patience when our food still hadn't arrived another 30 minutes later.  I think the kicker for me was that the waitress kept zooming past us and offering up"Just another 2 minutes!" "It'll be out soon!" "I think it's because you ordered the fillet that it's taking so long..." "Thanks for hanging in there!" "2 more minutes!" without stopping to refill drinks or ask if we needed anything else.  I actually regretted not ordering appetizers, though we might have been there another half hour.10 minutes (seemed to be the trend of the night - I know, I know, opening night) later, I get the other beer my fiance ordered at the bar (Ska Modus Hoperandi), though the bartender was nice enough to give it to me on the house for waiting so long.  I could go on and on about how it took us close to an hour and a half to get our food, but in the end, we did get what we ordered (even after our waitress showed up with the next table's food convinced it was ours) and it wasn't half bad.  It is not food I would graciously wait an hour and a half for, but it was satisfying.  I ordered the fillet (I believe it's called Dennis' Fillet) cooked medium with prosciutto wrapped asparagus (which seemed pretty ritzy for a sports bar menu - but then it came with ranch and all was right with the world), and I received a slightly dry medium-well steak with blanched asparagus rested on some thick slices of...ham.  Don't get me wrong, the food had flavor, just not an hour and a half's worth.  Fiance got the blackened Cajun chicken sandwich with a side of pasta salad - the chicken had a nice kick, probably could've been seared a little more so the spices were more ingrained, but you won't hear any complaints about the pasta salad.  It had more flavor than most of my meal combined.  All in all, the place has some fantastic potential, the location is spot on for being in downtown Chandler, and by the time we left, there was a little bit of a wait for people to get in to eat while the bar area was jam packed.  I plan on revisiting in a month or so to see if they can get their act together and find their groove.  All of the people who served us, save for our waitress, were very courteous and helpful - even if at a snail's pace, though they didn't like hearing that we weren't 100% satisfied with our table service (hey, they asked!).  I'm sure this place will pick up some supportive regulars and turn out to be an awesome joint, just give it a little bit of time before you head in there, or at least be prepared to spend 2+ hours of your patience on the staff.
Windsor=Great vibe. After you valet the car (you have to- it's the only option) you walk into an outdoor area very similar to postino Arcadia.  Head inside and be greeted by a lovely hostess.  We sat at the bar with a carafe of wine.  All wine is served in a carafe, ala on tap style.  I like this.  The bar is in the center of the restaurant in a super chic way that you can observe what is going on around you and kinda hideout or be seen- the choice is yours.  We were seated in what I think was the best seats in the house.  It was in a corner booth that was right at the corner of the restaurant.  Once we all slid into our booth seats, we all agreed it was like hunkering down in a basement somewhere on a leather couch.   We were introduced to Dan, the super slim, urban hipster server with a nice face and a witty personality.  When asked if my burger would be better with fries or mac n cheese, he asked me how often I eat burgers with mac n cheese? uhh, so yeah, I ordered the mac n cheese--- GREAT choice! We started with the Smorgash board that had pita, cheese, the most kale chips and largest kale chips I have ever seen, hummus, some veggies and smoked salmon-- it was interesting enough, but I probably won't be ordering that again.  But since they just opened, I am happy to try anything on the menu!Entrees included the waldorf salad that was only so-so, it was called "a bit too much" by a friend, the Barley salad was a huge hit as was the corn chowder.  My burger was good, I recommend going easier on the caramelized onions.  I felt like it started to taste more like a dessert before I even got half way through it.After we ate, relaxed and Dan check on us the perfect amount of time, we walked through and headed next door to Churn for dessert.  We passed the bar, said hello to a few friends we ran into, observed the outdoor seating one more time, and then walked though a hallway decorated in old cassette tapes, that was awesome!   At the end of the hallway was a bathroom marked "ladies and gents"- I absolutely despise shared bathrooms.  So that grossed me out thoroughly.  But as we made the turn, I saw the candies and ice cream that awaited me just around the corner....My taste buds got a sneak peak of Windosr back in March. I was a cocktail judge for the Arizona BBQ Festival and the friendly folks from Postino's introduced Windsor as a contestant in the whiskey competition. As I sipped a refreshing cocktail with only a subtle hint of whiskey, I made a mental note that as soon as Windsor opened their doors, I'd hop, skip and jump there as soon as possible. So with that, today was the day I made it through the whimsical doors of Windsor. I met fellow yelper, Christina P for a patio lunch at this new Central Phoenix restaurant. Similar to its neighborhood brother, Postino's, Windsor's architecture has the same modern and minimalistic feel to it from the exterior, but once you walk through the doors, you enter an entirely different world. Parking is extremely limited at Windsor, but I decided to risk it and found one last spot on the side of the residential street. However, I don't think this residential parking will last long, so I suggest saving yourself a possible ticket and valeting it instead. Atmosphere: Like I mentioned above, Windosr is completely unassuming from the outside. I had no idea that it was so open and airy throughout the interior of the restaurant and they also have two patios in the back. One patio is smaller and more intimate, and the other is a little larger and seats more. Both are quirky and fun as well as airy but protected from the sun by an overhang. I felt like I was lunching on the back patio of a stylish friend's house. The tables are close together, but I never felt like I was in another table's conversation or they were in mine. This is a great restaurant for patio dining and I could see it not being too hot in the summer should I crave an outdoor lunch. The staff was also friendly and attentive and consistently refilled my diet coke, which is always a plus in my book. Decor:I love the decor of the Windsor. Think retro chic. Everything is very clean and minimalistic but once you look closer, you see how retro and fun everything is. Take the cassette tape wall for example. Yes, it's an actual cassette tape wall and all of the cassettes are authentic and awesome. They have everything from Genesis and AC/DC to MC Hammer and homemade workout mix tapes. It's almost like a memory wall for those who are products on the 80s or earlier! The bathrooms are funky, the walls have funky writing on them and the whole decor resembles a classed up garage that's been converted into a bar/restaurant. Food:Now moving on to the food. The menu is just as retro as the decor in the sense that they have classic items with a twist. They have everything from hot dogs and a crab cake BLT to pastrami Reuben and of course plenty of salads and starters. I am excited to go back and continue to try items off the menu, but today I decided to go for the Brown Bag Chicken Sandwich which has pulled chicken with oven dried tomatoes, toasted hazelnuts and herbs topped with avocado, watercress & green goddess goat cheese. Yes, it was as good as it sounds, but note that this is a cold chicken sandwich and not warm. It was a tasty sandwich but I think it would have been better heated. We also tried the Kale leaves as an appetizer. If you are a fan of Kale, you'll probably enjoy them. They also come with a chive mayo sauce that tastes a lot like the sauce you get with artichokes. Between the food, atmosphere and decor, I really like Windsor and plan on adding this to my Central Phoenix rotation. Between Postino and Windsor, I am one happy camper!After a few trips to Churn, I decided it was time to try Windsor. I'd gotten a few tips from friends on what to order and everyone really enjoyed their food.Kammie K was my lunch partner. When I got there, she had a bowl of pistachios in front of her. In. The. Shell. I love that! Good food always takes a little work, right? As we munched on the nuts (hahaha I am a nut muncher!) I saw something on the menu I'd been wanting to try for a couple months: kale chips.The chips came with a ranch dipping sauce, but I only tried a little of it. They were perfect on their own! Garlic hunks and sea salt peppered each leaf perfectly. I can't wait to learn how to make them at home!I also had bite-sized corn dogs. They were pretty good & came with a side of mustard, but some of the batter didn't cook all the way on a couple of the pieces.The patio here is awesome. The misters really keep the temperature down, though I will have to really judge that in July.  They have the BEST soundtrack playing, too. It's a mix of awesome 80s music. Oh, and their wall is covered in cassette tapes. Some of them are mixed tapes. FTW!!!(Bring $5 for the valet. There is street parking, but it's hard to come by.)In my best Charlie Sheen, "Windsor. Winner. Windsor. Winner!"I had the MOST attentive service from our greeting at the door, to our seating in back, to our beverage service...ooops, then a small lapse in service...no biggie I was enjoying the vibe and the ambience.Ordered the Double Dip...sadly the name reminded me of my buddies in college when they would chew tobacco, sometimes they would "double dip"....gross I know. The concept of this dip is a cobb salad made into a dip served with a chipotle salsa (didn't get much smoky chipotle flavor however...which is fine since my little petite self is sensitive to spicy food...I mean my mom would serve potato chips and ketchup and called it chips and salsa...but I digress). I would order the dip again, but I have to say it really tasted just like egg salad. And fortunately I loves me some egg salad!My rueben sandwich was OUTSTANDING and I chose a side of mac n cheese which was total bliss (NOT plugging a restaurant downtown btw)....that was the word I said as cheese and a chunk of elbow macaroni slid down my chin. Pleasant, I know. My friend was doing the Meg Ryan orgasm scene as he enjoyed his bbq pulled chicken sandwich. I'm sure we looked ridiculous. But we were ridiculously happy. Welcome to the neighborhood Windsor. Let's totally hang out more often!I finally got to experience what everyone has been talking about.  Windsor is certainly one of the rather trendy spot at the moment on Central road.  I had the Pastrami Reuben sandwich, which was really salty.  I couldn't even finish it.  However, the Porkwich with kale salad was mighty tasty.  Highly recommend this.  The atmosphere was very laid back and friendly.  The cassette wall was a genius way to recycle old cassettes.The first few times I went to Windsor, I didn't love it. There was nothing wrong, it was just... I think this place is a guy hangout. It feels masculine. Not in a sports bar kind of way, but more like a place two friends that are guys regularly go to have a beer that don't want to drink bud light at a dive. Over time, the $5 pitchers of beer before 5pm have won me over. In addition to the great happy hour, they make some pretty spectacular drinks. The Number 17 is so refreshing. Manny is a fabulous bartender. They also have a few vegan food options - a sandwich and a mixed grain salad in addition to some sides. All have been fresh and tasty. I love that during nice weather they can open the place up, and the patio is great. The bathrooms are pretty cool as well. The parking is the real drawback. You either have to valet, which fortunately is complimentary, or try to find a spot on the residential streets that won't end up getting you towed..Overall I give Windsor a 3.5-4.0 stars.Sometime long, long ago, I had a wonderful brunch at Windsor.  I remember it fondly.A No 2 cocktail (vodka, peach puree, prosecco) times 2.  An amazing bloody mary bar, too bad I don't like bloody marys.  Warm donut holes with mascarpone and jam.  A fantastic breakfast burrito with Schreiner's sausage.  And more than one bite of my husband's strawberry pancakes.Wouldn't have changed a thing, especially when the bill came and it was far less than I would have expected.  Big hug to Shannon M (and an unnamed former Yelper) for introducing us to this gem.I have found a new place close to downtown to eat.  Great place to enjoy lunch and the $5 pitchers are a great enticer.If that does not get you down here maybe the great patio will get you here or the spacious bar.  I could see myself eating at the bar or one of the super comfortable booths.As for the eats....The backyard burger, Windsor style is on my list of must eat again, porkwich is a must eat all the time, and the mac and cheese is a great side.  I can't cook mac and cheese like that at home, nice crisp top of melted cheese and uber yummy cheese and pasta under neath.  The Windsor burger and piggy burger were great.  Just ask for extra napkins since you will look like a Carl's Jr commercial trying to scarf either burger down.  They are both messy, but I could not let the sauce and juice go to waste just dip the burger into the left overs on the plate. :) Let me describe the porkwich please....  Pulled pork, belly braised ham, cold slaw, smoked bacon, and the yummy sweet gold sauce.  All this on a buttermilk bun which is soft and a great absorber of all that sauce and flavor.  Get you eat on quick so the bun does not go soggy on you.  The backyard burger has a great garlic aioli, caramelized onions, sharp cheddar, and some iceberg shredded up to add some color.  This was a great burger and even though it is a must eat again I am really a fan of the porkwich.  My only downside is parking, really only a hand full of parking and then free valet.  Nothings free, I still gotta tip a guy that has to run down the street to get my car.  That's usually where your car will end up is down a side street adjacent to the restaurant.  I think the valet thing does fix the lack of parking problem and the food is so good it really is not that big of a deal.  If you are ever in the general vicinity of Windsor I suggest you give it a shot, great staff, great food, and great overall restaurant.This review is mostly due to the absolutely horrible attitude our table was given and the horrible service by the server named Emma.Why in the world they would have someone so miserable working there is beyond me.The food won't even get a review. We couldn't get past the fact we wet treated as a huge inconvenience to our server.I don't know what I could say that hasn't already been said, but this is one of my 3 go to places for brunch on the weekends.  I totally love it here and the staff always makes you feel so welcome!The drinks alone are fantastic.  (Can I have the NO.2, please!) and they have great deals for brunch on the weekends.  Their Bloody Mary bar is the best with a great variety to mix in (and who really needs to eat after all of those olives!)If you go for brunch, it is a MUST to experience their zucchini bread.  My friends tried mine yesterday, and they ended up stealing the whole thing from me!  HA!  And I also decided not to get the rest of the brunch yesterday and actually get a burger.  I got the Windsor style, and I have to say it was one of the best burgers I ever had!  I was totally impressed!So do yourself a favor, even if you have to travel a bit to get there, and experience the wonderness of the Windsor! :)Headed to the Windsor for bunch for June's Breakfast Club UYE, with a turnout of 17, one of the things that made Windsor a hit from the start for me was the fact that I was able to make reservations! WOOT WOOT! It makes everything so much easier!I can't lie before I even got the Windsor I had checked out the brunch menu and was 95% sure I was going to go with the Windsor Eggs Benedict, and even though they have a Bloody Mary Bar for 5 bucks, I wasn't going to tempt myself with that because honestly Bloody Marys are not my sort of thing.After sitting down and looking at the drink menu, I saw something that looked interesting and needed a try and it was a bloody mary drink too! I was mind blown that I was going down that path, but It's The Verde Bloody Mary, made with cucumbers, roasted poblano, cilantro & watercress, damn this drink was DELISH!  They do have a bloody Mary bar with all your fixings, pickles, spices, salts & garnishes but for me, this drink was perfect, it didn't need anything. It was spicy, it was heaven!  If you do not like spicy don't order it, for me damn it was great!After sipping on my Verde I no longer was interested in the benedict and wanted a spicy dish to go with my drink, so I went with the Matador, two eggs over easy ontop of griddled cheddar potatoes, crispy tortilla, salsa verde & avocado relish, while waiting for everyone's plates to come out I spotted some of the benedict dishes and was starting to get plate envy, they looked soo good!  Then the Matador made it to me, this dish was amazing, the salsa verde was great the egg & potatoes combo with the avocado relish was just explosions of flavors hitting your tongue, and it went very well with the Verde Bloody Mary, the only thing  I didn't really care for was the crispy tortilla, but it was a great dish for sure!I am happy to have tried the Windsor for bunch, look forward to checking them out at all different hours, and I know Ill be back soon because I am already craving that Verde Bloody Mary.Came here for brunch w/ a friend of mine. When we walked up the entrance looked more like it was the back of the building. Weird. Is there two entrances? lol. There was a line outside the door. I wasn't sure if people were just waiting for their names to be called or it was an actual line. Apparently there was no one there to help any of us. This is already a bad first impression for me. We got seated on the patio. 2nd negative was we got there at 1:10 and missed their brunch menu by ten minutes! Darn it! They need to extend their brunch menu. For drinks I ordered the No. 14. Anything watermelon I just have to try. This drink has Silver Rum, Pressed Watermelon, Habanero-Ginger Syrup, Smoked Chile Rim.There was definitely a kick to it. lolI ordered the brown bag chicken sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. It was good but not great. I really liked the mac and cheese. My friend got a side of the potatoes which I got to try. I think I liked their sides better than the entrees. lol. I was a bit disappointed in the customer service here. Our server was not personable, sociable or friendly at all. It was just straight business. What would you like to drink, are you ready to order? Done deal. I might come back to try their brunch menu next time, but other then that, don't think it was worth the drive for me.Who knew all these Hipster places were in Phoenix these days. All the years I have lived downtown, they never had these kind of places. Now Downtown is crawling with them! Yeah!!This is a nice place, on a great day. We chose to eat inside as the sun was to be going down soon, and it was a bit cold for me.My daughter tired several cocktails , she said all were very tasty. Especially one with cucumber. Which I as well tasted and enjoyed.The food took a long time but, the staff is very attentive and check on you a lot. It is like a group event. Everyone checks on you, and they are all very pleasant.The nice thing is before 5o'clock all drinks were only $5.00 no wonder it was so busy there.I got the Lobster roll, it was good but, it has a lot of seasoning on it. Really not necessary, just let me taste the Lobster.  We also got cierviche for an appetizer. Very good, I would order that again. My two dining companions all liked their food as well.A Ruben , and a club type thing. You can change out the bread if you like, and they have Gluten free. I got sweet potato fries, good. The shoe string fries ,not so good.But, it is a great place and worth a visit. Love the decor and the old look about it.Clean restrooms and the parking can be very tight.Every single visit I've had to Windsor has been positive. Whether I'm sitting out on the patio under low lights next to a heater, or inside a cozy booth by their spacious bar inside, it is always a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy with friends or on a date.Enough about the atmosphere, though - the food. I haven't met a dish here that I don't like. They have great salads (my favorite is the ahi tuna salad) that leave you satisfied. The sandwiches are the star here, though. I have enjoyed everything from the Backyard Burger to the Bahn Mi, and they are all spectacular. Great medium cook on the burger, tangy sauces (even a good kick on the bahn mi), amazing pork belly in the porkwitch... it's just so good. My favorite so far though has been the Oyster Po Boy. Giant pieces of lightly fried oysters and a huge helping of slaw to top it in the perfect roll. The sides continue to rock my socks. Most people will rave about their mac and cheese, and it certainly deserves its accolades, but my favorite is the fried okra. The cornmeal breading stays on it perfectly and the dipping sauce they serve with it is perfection. "But Libby!" You exclaim. "Whatever shall I drink with these delicious dishes?" Oh, let me tell you, friend. Do not miss the liquor at Windsor. The Number 63, with burbon, fresh grapefruit and honey syrup is the bomb.com. Not too sweet, not too bitter, not too liquory, just right. My other favorite is the Number 9 with rye, pineapple and mint. They're all worth a go (I just lean towards darker liquors) - definitely give it a shot. (see what I did there?)Overall, this is one of my favorite places in the valley. Upward Projects knew what they were doing when they created this amazing place for everyone (next to an ice cream store, no less) - it's a must in my book!Was having a rough day/night/week, whatever you want to call it and wanted to go somewhere to unwind and just forget about the day, so I suggested to a friend that we do dinner at Windsor, so off we went!The main reason why I wanted Windsor is because I remembered there Verde Mary, and that's what I wanted, something spicy with a kick! Man was I bummed out to learn that's not on the everyday menu, must be just a brunch thing, even Windsor was kickin me when I was down.  But I got over that soon and went with a black cherry lemonade, which was great tasting, fresh and not too sweet.After checking out the menu, we started off with Corn Dog Poppers that came with fried pickles and ballpark mustard.  These lil corn dogs were delsih! It was a corn meal crust perfectly cooked, even the pickles were coated in the corn meal, it just was perfect! The pickles even came in quarters and slices, I thought that was pretty cool.I went with the Grilled Chicken sandwich, it was a spicy curry rubbed chicken breast with a mango jalapeno mayo, red onion, spring greens & tomato on a hoagie roll. I have to say this was perfect! I love when chicken is mixed with fruit, I think mangos & pineapples are the best thing to pair with chicken, so mango jalapeno mayo was on point with me! Loved it!  But I do have to admit at some points I did have plate envy because all around me everything was having these huge beefy burgers, I might have to try one of those next time I am back!Oh my goodness, the food here in incredible! Not to mention their fabulous, dog friendly patio!! My boyfriend and I wanted to soak up our beautiful AZ weather with the pooch and hadn't been here so we gave it a shot! I ordered the brown bag chicken salad sandwich and it was phenomenal! Different than your average chicken salad sandwich, in a good way! Avocado, goat cheese and hazelnuts? Yes, please! I got a side salad with it that was tossed in an amazing mustard-y vinaigrette! We also shared a side of their house made chips which are a must! My boyfriend got the pastrami reuben and holy heaven, it was MASSIVE! But amazing. From 11 AM - 5 PM everyday, they have $5 pitchers of beer (not just any beer, GOOD beer!), cocktails & wine! If you have guests in town, this would be the perfect place to take them!
Mango Thai=I found myself in the middle of a strange city (Mesa), I was down the street shopping, hungry, and armed with the yelp app on my iphone. I saw a yelp $12 for $24, a groupon $15 for $30, and a yelp check in offer. Decisions, which deal to choose. Most of their meals are anywhere from $10-$12 with tax, so choose accordingly.We walked in saturday at 6:00 pm, and there was no one else here. My initial thought was that everyone else *might* just know something I don't; perhaps I should find another spot I eat. I reluctantly decided to stay, then ordered the green curry and yellow curry. A few moments into our meal another couple came in to eat also, which made me feel better, if not just for the restaraunt operator, but for myself also. I'm normally a bit leary of a restaraunt with no customers. Maybe this is just how it is in middle of Mesa, I'm not really an authority on that particular subject though. I usually hang in and around the Phoenix mid-town area.The food was great! Though I did like the yellow curry better than the green; which is what I would suggest if your looking for curry. Go ahead and order it spicy, it was good. They brought the bill and there was a discrepancy. The yelp check-in offer was clearly $15 and they adjusted the check for 15%. I think the check in offer is SUPPOSED to be 15% and not $15, but they still honored it. I felt obliged and gave them a bigger tip than I ever do; an extra 10% on top of my usual.Over all a nice spot to calm your inner Thai-ger. Happy dining all you Yelpers!
Jugoo Chinese Restaurant=Jugoo's location (right next to UNLV) makes it the most convenient place to drop by after class when I want Chinese. You will most likely see a Maserati parked in front. Just throwin' it out there, it's not a wealthy patron with a taste for Chinese food, but in fact the owner's fancy ride.Jugoo was "featured" on Dirty Dining. I generally assume places clean up their act after a hit from the health department--and the news--but not this place! While everything seems clean and hygienic, on my most recent visit, I discovered mold in the chili sauce. The tiny plastic container kept on the table was full of mold--in plain view of the customers. Totally a gross discovery. While the food was generally tasty, the rotten chili sauce AFTER the health department was in there is pretty ridiculous.If they'll put moldy chili sauce on the table, what do you think the food looks like in the back? Reason why spoiled rich kids shouldn't run restaurants. I would prefer not to get food poisoning due to someone's carelessness--thanks.
The Tipsy Cow=I have never gone to Tipsy and been disappointed, let me just say that. Highlights are as follows:*Pickles. They come with your basket (BASKET BONUS) or you can get them as an appetizer. If you get them as an app, make sure you have a decent size group with you. Or make sure you really like pickles. If you really like pickles, you'll really really like their pickles. Paragraph on pickles complete.*Truffle fries. Melt in your goddamn mouth.*Green goddess dressing. I'd bathe in it if it weren't so humid right now.*Specials. They circulate through some pretty creative, limited-time items on a fairly regular basis and I usually order off that menu. The last couple of munchies I tried on special were Goat Cheese Curds and a Caprese Sandwich. Both were way good and I actually think those Goat Cheese Curds were better than their regular ones. Make 'em permanent, make me happy.This review is for Tierney. (I hope that's right. It's what my receipt says.)I don't usually single out servers, but she was so incredible (as was the awesome hostess on Monday night) that I feel like I need to mention her by name. Our group of yelpy trivia players this past Monday grew from 4 to 5 to 7 to 9 to 12 over the course of an hour or so, and each time we needed to add more seats and swap people about, she knew exactly where people were and what they ordered. With each arrival she brought a menu, ran through the food specials time and time again (poor thing... it's fries and wings y'all... half off... every Monday... now you know) and made sure that pints were full of Yelp's Bursting Red Ale and that we felt tended to. Tipsy Trivia is one of my favorites in town, simply because almost everyone who's there on Monday plays. I have to imagine the servers aren't as excited about it as I am. Cheap fries, cheap wings, growing party sizes... it's probably a server nightmare. But ours was a breath of fresh air and for pub grub and beer, it was probably some of the best service I've received in Madison. As for the food, it's what you'd expect. I've always felt the burgers are a little over cooked, but you can stack 'em high, so that's a plus. Parmesan wings were a touch overwhelming, but the standard and the Asian glazed made mouths happy. And rotating taps keep things interesting, and it was exciting to see some "locals" (midwest but not Madison) that I had never heard of.
Mark's Cafe=This small little breakfast place in Tempe is amazing! Mark, himself is the chef! No joke. This is a small, little find of a place that one may be lucky enough to find if you don't blink.. OR if you have yelp, of course! The staff right off from entering is nice and ready to make you happy. We were instantly greeted with waters and told that the pastries were down to two because they are supposedly THAT good! We did not embide, BUT, maybe someday! I loved that they advised us of that, though. I also loved that we instantly got water without having to ask and the coffee we did ask for was on it's way shortly thereafter. From the menu, I would sum Mark's Cafe as being a Benedict place! There are almost a dozen types of Benedict's on the menu and a couple on the 'specials board'. I ordered the Neptune Eggs Benedict. I was pleasantly surprised, (as I always am in the desert), to get REAL crabmeat on this Benedict. Mark's ran out of crab for half of the Benedict, BUT the waitress was super sweet and offered any other Benedict on the menu for me with an apology. To be honest, I was full off the one half of the Neptunes already! Neptunes is obviously a crab benedict underneath the usual hollandaise, but they have a plain hollandaise and a spicy hollandaise. I highly recommend the spicier of the two. It's freshly made by Mark and that makes all the difference in the Benedict. The second half I got to replace what was missing from half of the Neptune was a special on that day: the French Benedict. Same type of typical Benedict but with proscuitto. Yum! It comes with a side of house potatoes too; yummy for that leftover hollandaise sauce! My boyfriend ordered the Biscuits and Gravy. It was a HUGE plate of just that: Biscuits with sausage gravy, both freshly made. It came with a couple of eggs and bacon too. In case, all that sausage in the gravy just wasn't gonna be enough! There was a Blueberry Pancake ordered and on the table by our friend. She asked for just one from the stack order. They happily accommodated her request. That pancake was the size of the dinner, err, breakfast plate it was on. SO huge! The blueberries come on the side for you to spoon out at your delight and are syrupy and a concoction made again, by Mark the Chef , himself. The coffee never ran empty and the staff was super nice and happy. Mark's is a small cafe. We arrived about 1130am on a Sunday and it was almost full and I would imagine it fills up with quite a wait during the busiest times on a weekend. I love a family run business that is local such as Mark's Cafe. I learned after our brunch there that day that Mark's does catering too. Good to know for any events in the upcoming holiday season! If he can perfect a Benedict and it's sauce, I can only imagine what he can do with holiday pies!Mark's cafe is one of those places that you pass by at a strip mall unsure of what kind of restaurant it is, you know those places that don't pique interest unless you stumble upon it on yelp? It doesn't lack character, it's the curb appeal that throws you off because it's not much to look at from the outside but inside meaning the food, it's worth exploring and enjoying. Went with a friend on a random Saturday brunch/breakfast outing. S wanted a place close to home, so, I looked via yelp, and noticed Mark's had good reviews and stars. Read somewhere it's a benedict kinda place. Anywho, the staff was friendly, endearing, and welcoming. They have a wide selection of omelettes, benedicts, and lunch items. They also have many special items, and from what our server told us, they accommodate special requests since Mark has a knack for coming up with good eats. I got the Ultimate Benedict, which comes with prosciutto, tomato, spinach, and avocado over a croissant, with either regular or spicy hollandaise, I recommend you get the spicy because it's not spicy per se but it has this smoky full flavor that grows with each bite. What I love about this benedict is that it's layered on top of a croissant, so, the bread just soaks up the sauce and all the goodness. I also got a single stack pancake (which is the size of the plate, so, get one if you're getting it as a side), and they have toppings, so, our server's recommendation was to get the banana pecan, my friend got the banana pecan combined with the blueberry compote. It was all delicious, and I'm adding Mark's to my breakfast rotation. P.S. they have more than tabasco if you're looking for a spicy condiment, just ask. Happy eats!The restaurant is small, feels crowded and has a slightly grubby feel. On hotter days it can get warm inside too, despite the ceiling fans overhead. The breakfasts here though, are very tasty.We came here a little before 11 on a Saturday, and it was moderately busy, but there were still enough tables available that we didn't have to wait for a seat. The menu consists of breakfast and lunch, with signature egg benedict dishes, omelets, waffles, and sandwiches, just to name a few. I browsed through the benedict selections and decided on the Neptune benedict ($10.95), a Benedict with real crab meat (From a can). I ordered it with the spicy Hollandaise sauce for some extra kick. The delicate sweet flavor of the crab went well with the creamy, perfectly poached eggs and sauce, perched on top of an English muffin. I have to say, I was very impressed with the eggs they use. They are very fresh and high quality, as evidenced by the deep orange-yellow yolks. I also tried some of the chorizo waffle, a hefty meal of superbly seasoned chorizo with a large, lightly crisp waffle.Service was very friendly and attentive. Overall, a good place for breakfast.
Cactus Moon Sports Grill=The owner's of Cactus Moon are self destructive morons.Friday nights have been developing a good country dance scene. Lots of people show up for a free lesson and dance afterwards. They have fun, buy food, drink, and have been telling friends how wonderful the place is (despite bad Yelp reviews). So, last Friday the owners waited until everybody arrived for the Friday dance -- and then announced that for now on they will only play hip-hop and top40. People that came here for their Friday night dance were furious -- and most of them stormed out.Count on at least 60 people to tell every one of their friends how callous and unfriendly Cactus Moon is. The owners could have made an announcement the previous week, so that people's night wouldn't be ruined, but that would have shown too much respect and consideration for their customers. CM owners wanted to be sure to let everyone there know that their loyal patronage isn't needed or even wanted.Oh, and the owners justified their actions by saying that dancers don't generate enough revenue. Of course it couldn't be that the food and service sucks!Businesses that treat customers with such disdain usually go out of business. The Phoenix market is just too competitive for idiots like this to survive. I cannot imagine that a bunch of oblivious young hip hoppers will save the day for CM, but we shall see what we see!Worst place!!!  Surprised has not been shut down yet. Servers are completely clueless, they ignore you and are more interested in talking to friends and having fun.  I asked for a cheese burger and the next question I was asked was; do you want cheese on that?  Even when the place is not busy you can walk in and sit at a table for nearly half an hour before a server even takes a drink order.  On top of that management does not know what they are doing either. Avoid this place at all costs as you will be very disappointed in the service, food, and simply the overall experience.
Fat Moe's Pizza & Wings=My boyfriend and I have been ordering (delivery) pizza and wings from here for about 5 months. The food is great! But their service is awful! We either are missing extras we requested or it takes 60 min+ for the food to arrive. (they are appx. a 1/2 mile away from us). I gotta say, if we didn't like their pizza so much, we would have dismissed this place a long time ago. (wrote this about  month ago)update: Ordered pizza and wings from them a week or two ago and the delivery guy showed up 2 hours after the pizza was ordered, after I had already spoken to the manager and he had offered to make a new pizza and wings if I came to pick it up. He also said they would credit my account $20 so the next time we got pizza and wings it would be free. today: Attempted to redeem my free pizza and wings and they guy on the phone said that we had a credit for 25% off our next order. I explained to him the situation and asked to speak to a manager. He said he would call me back. When he did, he offered a $15 minimum delivery and anything additional would be on us. HORRIBLE customer service. I'm not sure if they just have very consistent turn-over or what. But we are done trying to justify the food vs the service. I hope the owner reads this and does some serious hiring. So disappointing...
Table 274=Oh Table 274 - I'm so happy you're in Cotswold! With a focus on hard work, locally sourced ingredients, supporting local farmers and frankly, making really really delicious food, Table 274 is well on their way. The restaurant is nestled in the back of Cotswold shopping center (behind the toy store) and boasts an expansive space with plenty of tables and large bar area. I've also seen the bar menu - it looks pretty delicious.On to the food...I've been here twice now and here's what I've enjoyed....Italian sausage & sweet potato gnocchi (lunch item): 4.5/5: A really generous portion of practically perfect gnocchi. They make their gnocchi daily (no small feat) and this dish highlights them beautifully. It very sausage-y, so for those who dig a myriad of meat with delicious pasta, get this - you won't be disappointed. Strawberry shortcake: 5/5: Light, fresh and damn delicious. They have a fab pastry chef on board and it showwwwws! I shared the dessert with a friend but I could have easily taken it down myself. Fresh made rolls & honey butter: 4/5: I know it seems odd to comment directly on the bread but it was pretty great. Who doesn't love a fresh baked roll and honey butter? No one? That's right. Fig Prosciutto Flatbread: 3/5: Pretty much the only item I didn't love here. While the portion was generous, this flatbread lacked both prosciutto and cheese. It was super figgy and I was looking for more of the ying and yang w/the meat and cheese added to it. However, the peppery arugula on top was a lovely addition. Toasted gnocchi (appetizer): 5/5: Nabbed this dish before dinner and, again, the gnocchi was wonderful. My Italian grandma would love it. This dish features warm prosciutto, spring pea & carrot - even the veggies were nicely cooked, leaving a bit of a crunch. I would happily order this for a light dinner. I have no doubt that if Table 274 continues on their merry way that they'll earn a 5th star in no time. It's a great addition to Cotswold...get your nom on!
Johnson Public House=As the former owner of "In the Company of Thieves", I can tell you first hand that I did not put very much effort or passion into the business for the last 2 years of ownership.  Without giving personal detail's  I would like to express my regret in acting so poorly.  Many of the negative reviews will forever remind me of that regret.Moving forward, the best decision I made was to sell the shop to Gwen and Kyle Johnson.  They are doing a fantastic job with Johnson Public House.  The ambiance is inviting and the Barista's are all very friendly and well trained in the art.  The food menu is limited, but all very well prepared, and anyone that would expect a larger menu in such a place really doesn't understand the space and limitations that JPH is working with.They upgraded some permits to allow the cooking of eggs on premises.  When I owned Thieves I had to order eggs precooked for my breakfast sandwiches, which coming from a culinary background is downright embarrassing. I was skeptical at first with Intelligentsia being their sole coffee roaster, as I am a Kickapoo loyal, but I've been pleasantly surprised with the quality and consistency.  Again, it helps that the barista's are very well trained.  Along with excellent espresso drinks, they also specialize in pour overs, and individual french presses, which are right up my alley.     The beer and wine license they added is a huge plus to the Johnson st. hood, as don't really have too many other options to mellow out with a cold one, let alone a place with free WI-FI.All this new stuff is great, but by far the most important addition is their passion.  Unlike myself, Gwen and Kyle are in it for the long haul.  They are friendly, down to earth business owners, and a great big breath of fresh air for the Johnson street neighborhood.I wish them the best of luck, although I'm pretty sure they won't need it.Still a solid 5, but wish I could add a few more stars for standout service today!1. They were out of cold brew and typically (I think) don't keep much ice around, so after taking my order the lovely gent ran down the street to grab a bag in order to get their normal pour over method going with ice down below. He strained the ice out and poured the cooled at this point brew into a cup with new ice. It rawked. I want more. 2. Took with me a sammie to go and grabbed greens along side. This is so dorky but check it out: Greens were nicely placed in a recyclable cup w/ lid and the dressing was resting on top in it's own condiment cup. I dressed that puppy, capped it, shook, and boom, it was a little like being there minus the hip vibe and melting pot, no cornucopia of passerbys.
Waffallonia=Ahhh, Waffallonia! The stuff dreams are made of!I had eagerly been awaiting the opening of Waffallonia for months, as I had heard they would be serving liege-style waffles. Having seen several glowing reviews about them throughout several publications, they were certainly hyped up quite a bit before I finally went. I finally made it out for a mini "Squirrel Hill Day" (aka "Diabetes Day" - a trip that consisted of Rita's, Waffallonia, and bubble tea) and indulged myself in some incredible Belgian dessert waffles. Waffallonia certainly lived up to the hype! Their waffles are slightly crispy on the outside, as they have a caramelized exterior and a soft, warm interior. I got a waffle with Biscoff and whipped cream - both of which slowly melted into the crevices (and into my heart!) Seeing as this was the first time I'd ever had Biscoff spread, I was INSTANTLY HOOKED. To this day, I go to Waffallonia on a regular basis just to buy a jar of the stuff.Only setback is that it's REALLY tiny with very few seats. Then again, I kind of find that sort of thing cozy and urban. Don't worry - the prices are decent and it never gets too crowded.Waffallonia is always a good idea. Now that the seasons have changed and the Schenley Plaza location is closed, I had to go to the Squirrel Hill store to get my fix. The shop is tiny and somehow manages to seat 6 at counters inside. Also at the shop they have ice cream that you can add to your waffle. The flavors for ice cream seemed amazing but I was there for one thing and one thing only: liege waffles. I settled on the monthly special which was a waffle with chocolate syrup, whipped cream and crushed candy cane.  Usually my son and I split a waffle with nutella but  we changed it up that day and the change was good.I finally made it to Waffallonia!  One of the only innovative dessert places in Pittsburgh, and it was delicious.  I wasn't expecting to love this place, but the hot waffles with toppings were so much more than I hoped and dreamed.I ordered the Namur Waffle ($4.80 with tax), which was bananas and nutella on a waffle.  One of the Squirrel Hill magazines also had a coupon for a free topping so I added some Speculoos ice cream ($2 value).  The waffles look so small, but they are actually the perfect portion and don't need to be any larger.  The actual waffles are really unique and delicious and would be good without toppings, really.If you can, eat the waffles at their little counter space.  They are the best hot.  Otherwise, they will package them to go.They take credit cards, and there is no minimum.
Smashburger=Son and I were headed to see a movie but being a bottomless pit teenager he was starving and in the mood for food, and Smash Burger was the place picked!Honestly, this was my 1st time at Smash Burger, so I was shocked it was fast food, I always figured it to be a sit down restaurant, idk where I get these ideas from.The menu is simple and easy to follow. I went with the Arizona Smash burger, mainly because I saw it had jalapenos on it, um YES please!  I also parried mine up with rosemary fries that to me sounded good.. My son ordered some chicken sandwich, when I heard it was chicken I lost interest, this boy just picked a burger place then ordered chicken smh, haha, and he got sweet potato fries.We found out seats and waited for the food.  Still not quite sure what he ordered, but it too had fresh slices of jalapenos on it, in which he turned to me and asked what exactly are those,,WHO IS THIS KID????? It's not his 1st time around jalapenos, must have been too hungry that his mind was slipping.The Arizona Smash burger had habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo & fresh sliced jalapenos and it looked great and the flavors were good too, but the bun was lacking, which to me, if you don't have a good bun, you don't have a good burger, also dangit!!!!! This is the 2nd place in 2 weeks that I have encounter shoe string fries!! WHAT IS THE FASCINATION WITH THESE FRIES?? They are not grown up fries, these were little bitty potatoes who aspired to be thick like steak fires but no got picked and fried when they were still so small haha.  They shouldn't be called fries, but other than it being shoe stringed, they had good flavor, even the sweet potato were all right.When we were finished, we went to dump our tray, and were quickly told, no no we got this. That was pretty cool I thought. Great customer service for a fast food type of place.
Krazy Fish=Krazy Fish (and More!) has been taunting me with delayed opening dates for a month or two now, but they are finally open and I must say, it was worth the wait.While the interior decor looks a bit like a performance art version of the mind of an unbalanced person with an aquatic fixation, the food is delicious. Get the tacos. Let me say that again good and slow so you wont miss it.GET. THE. TACOS.I've tried both the tempura shrimp and cuban chicken versions and both were delicious (though I'm partial to the shrimp, with a touch of the pepper oil that is on the tables). Neither was particularly spicy but the flavors were full and bright. I love that their slaw (which tops your protein) is not a mayo-y mess and the tortillas are fresh and fluffy. Tacos come with one side (all this for under $8). I am in love with their jalapeno cheddar grits souffle, to a ridiculous degree, but Jake's mac and cheese put up a strong argument and I look forward to measuring their squash casserole against Dish's.Yes, they serve other things besides tacos. There is shrimp and grits that is certainly on my to do list. There is pad thai. There is curry lemongrass tofu for the veggie crowd. They will even serve you up a quarter chicken, and I look forward to trying any or all of these dishes. But in the mean time (and who am I kidding, it will only be a matter of days before I stroll back) I am glad to have Krazy Fish as my new neighbor.Seriously strange, this place. From the Mad Scientist Acid Trip Under the Sea decor to the banana salsa to the...just...huge, newspaper sized menu, there are some really outta-the-norm things going on at Krazy Fish.And I gotta say, I likey.Things are messy - ya, there's brownie-filled orange cups for dessert for cheap, but they're overfilled, spilling out a bit. A salsa brought to the table in an icy squeeze bottle. A cold, intestinal coil of cheese grits solidifying while your sandwich is steaming hot. Water all over the bathroom floor. Corners, art to run into. Cilantro in everything, all hail the cheapest herb, garnish, chopped, springs tucked into your taco, sandwich, salsa, everywhere.It's almost, kind of a foodie joint, because anything, anywhere, on the menu, can be put in any burrito, any sammich, any taco. There are near-infinite combinations of flavor happening and not a lot of steering going on - a gruff rec by a waitress, that's about it - so it's easy to choose and end up with something freaky-not-good. OR (like moi) you could get jittery with excitement, anticipating what lemongrassy tofu, pickled jalapenos, and coconut curry could possibly taste like, and WHOA it kinda worked, even if it was a little sweet. Things are, here. Sugary. Riding that edge of too much. Not taking the plunge.Other options for veg's - tempura vegetables, potato cake. You can have a potato cake taco. Dare ya.House slaw is riskily weird, but good - toasted cumin, a little bitter, Indian flavors.There are like, 10 salsas. I even enjoyed the banana, sort of.It's beautiful that no one worried about foodie trendy BS when designing this space or menu. It's just all really Krazy, in an homage-to-East-Charlotte-ethnicity kinda way. Tacos, bolillos, banh mi, burritos (er, roti), viet, mex, thai, indo, chinese, whoa.Krazy Fish has been on my radar for quite some time. With crazy steel art festooned on their front patio and dive-y exterior, what more could you ask for in Plaza Midwood? This place is ridiculous. Landing directly on Central Ave, it's not too hard to miss their parking lot. Turn in right before Morningside. Made that mistake once....Glad to see that "Krazy" is first word in the name of this joint. Our server, Chad, was a freaking ray of sunshine. Hilarious and absolutely BLUNT. He had no problems telling us that some menu items were "dumb" if paired with others. He was jazzed to be there. What a great employee. He was fast, efficient and a great jokester. Mystery beer is interesting....$1 and you'll, most likely, get a crappy beer. Haha. Worth the $1 laugh it brought to our table. Bud Light with lime. GAG.Apps:Started out with the potato cakes. These things are awesome. Plenty of veggies and in a creamy curry-ish sauce. I would have mistaken them for falafel had I not been told. I was happy and so were my taste buds. Throw a little sriracha on these bag boys and you'll experience Krazy enlightenment. Entrees:My wife got a fried veggie burrito. This thing rivals the size of a Chipotle or Moe's burrito. Packed full of rice and tons of tasty veggies. Loved the sauce that the veggies were sautéed in. Welcomingly sweet and a came full circle with the rest of her plate. The grits on the side were so thick and creamy. I'd have a full plate on my next visit if it were an entree. Delicious. I tried the blackened tuna tacos. Holy crap. Pineapple salsa? I'd eat that on my foot. It was so good. Perky, cilantro-ey and so FRESH. I love every bit. Huge chunks of rare, seared tuna. The slaw, I'm pretty sure, is tossed in a bit of wasabi powder so it got dumped off my tacos lickity split. No offense. Just not a fan of wasabi. Got a side of the mac n' cheese per Chad's recommendation. So good. Soul food, meet Mexican. Be friends, I say. Sampled the blueberry salsa and the chipotle honey. Very interesting. Look forward to trying them on their respective dishes on our next visit. I'm happy to say Krazy Fish literally is crazy but absolutely intriguing. I can't wait to test more of the menu. Well done, ladies and gents. You've got something going here.
Black Fig Coffee & Bistro=3/19/11After checking out the scene at Degree 270, my friend and I decided to end the evening w/ something sweet at Black Fig Bistro.  We both like chocolate and peanuts, and I'd had the opportunity to try the peanut butter and chocolate tart here a few times before, so I suggested we order this.  My friend LOVED this dessert! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-fig-bistro-scottsdale?select=S_oi-WhT5tat37ZKq79YjA#S_oi-WhT5tat37ZKq79YjA  We practically inhaled it, taking fast turns at the plate!  :)  I was already satisfied w/ my half of the pastry... or was it she w/ hers?  :P  In any case, we decided we'd try another-- a yellow cake w/ chocolate ganache and finished w/ chocolate and white chocolate curls.  Sounds good, doesn't it?  Well, it looked better than it tasted. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-fig-bistro-scottsdale?select=JjytWa_ggHvFBwRJk3TfOg#JjytWa_ggHvFBwRJk3TfOg  The cake was very dry, and the frosting wasn't as creamy, nor rich as we both wanted it to be.  The cute curlicues of chocolate weren't enough to save this pastry--  they tasted old, as if they've been in the fridge for too long.  I'd check out the other desserts, but not very late in the day!
Bambino's East Coast Pizzeria=Part of my Pizza Bender 2011 Edition, I stopped by this place and decided to give their 2 Slice special a try.  2 Slices of Cheese Pizza & a fountain drink for $5.....pretty good deal.  I added Sausage & Pepperoni for an additional $1 ($.50 per topping).The joint is decked out in Boston photos and memorabilia.....be prepared to get a talking to if you walk in here with other sports teams gear.  A guy with a Lakers hat was catching some guff from the owner.  It was all in good fun and they were both having fun talking a bit of trash about the other team.  Hilarious.After a few minutes my Pizza came out.  It's a thin Crust variety, very similar to NY Style.  I'm not calling it NY Style because it's a Boston Pizza joint.  The slices are pretty big and you have to fold it if you want to eat it with your hands.....I like it better that way.  The Pizza was pretty good....above average.  I thought the Sausage was much better than the Pepperoni.  The Pepperoni wasn't anything special.  The Cheese was gooey and had good flavor.  I didn't have to add anything to the Pizza, I enjoyed it as is.Overall, It's a pretty good Pizza.  If I could, I'd give it 3.75 Stars, but I'm rounding up here.Return Factor - 60%....would be higher if I lived nearby.More pizza please!!!!!We went to Bambino's not knowing what to expect and with open minds.  We are pizza lovers and are always looking for the next awesome slice to experience.  What we found was a fun Boston Pizzeria.  This means lots of Red Sox stuff and super yummy thin crust pizza.  It's a great time to be had!Let me just say, the Meat Lovers pizza from Bambino's blew our minds and we ate THE WHOLE THING in under 10 minutes.  10 minutes!!!!  I don't think we even stopped to take a breath between bites because it was so tasty!  We inhaled the awesome pizza because it was simply amazing.  It had flavorful pepperoni, ham, and some of the best sausage I have ever had, EVER!We also tried some yummy garlic knots, cheese sticks, chicken fingers (yes, I steal my baby girl's chicken fingers when she isn't looking), and fries. Oh and the zeppoles!  I have never had a zeppole and didn't know what to expect.  They are Italian style donuts and are one of the best things I have ever eaten dessert-wise.  They were hot fried dough, covered in powdered sugar and other fun spices and were finger licking good!  Everything we tried was delicious, came in a huge serving, and at a very good price.  How can you go wrong?It is a small joint, but it feels super homey.  The staff was always coming out to talk to us and make sure we were happy.  There was a lovely young lady, Stephanie, who was awesome!  I think she was about 13 and was on top of everyone in the restaurant.  She was running the counter and taking food orders, as well as being the welcoming committee.  She would even come out to play with my daughter from time to time, just to make sure she was enjoying lunch too!   It is a great mom & pop place and you feel so welcomed just walking in the door.  I wish Vegas had more places like this one!Every bite I took in Bambino's was delightful and I will be back for more!Finally decided to try this place few weeks ago and now I'm the duke lol... been going at least twice a week. Pizza by the slice can be difficult to find out here... especially at this quality. Love that it is around the corner from me and on my way home from work.But wait... didn't even get to the best part... they have sicilian pies! And they sell it by the slice as well. My new favorite sicilian in Vegas... also convenient that I can see the slices from the window as I pull up to see if they have sicilian lol... yes.. i'm that lazy.Anyway... give this place a shot and support local pizza places! So far everything I have had has been good and very fair priced. The staff is very friendly and the family that owns it recently moved to Vegas from Long Island. Looking forward to many more sicilian slices... now off to reheat one that's in my fridge :)New York style pizzeria?  Oh my!  Cesar Q. and I were out and about getting errands done and decided to make a stop by this great pizza place.  First off we have ordered take out from here one time before and loved the meatball calzone and chicken parm sub.  Today we actually came in and sat down for one of their lunch specials.  Normally we do all our takeout from 2 places close to home.  Villa Pizza being one of them.  This place has great food and great service!  While Villa tastes good their service leaves a lot to be desired (in my opinion).We arrived just as they were opening and received a welcome hello from the guy behind the counter.  We ordered my personal favorite of Chicken Francese.  It's served with a beverage, garlic knots and a side of pasta all for $9.  Not to shabby considering how much food you get.  Everything tasted great and exactly as one would expect.  They offer fresh parmesan cheese, none of that stuff in packets.  There is a soda fountain so you can refill your glass as often as you like.  The location is just off Durango and Sahara close to the 7-11 and next to the Subway.  This place has food that tastes as though grandma was in the kitchen cooking it herself!So happy we found a new Italian spot that has friendly EFFICIENTLY staff and reasonably priced  delivery too!
Big Earl's BBQ=I was excited to check out Big Earl's (BE's), and finally convinced two co-workers to have lunch with me. We got to BE's around 2:00pm on a Wed, and where was only two other tables occupied. We were greeted promptly and shown to a tableWe placed our drink orders, and then put in our lunch request. I ordered pulled pork sammie, my friend ordered a brisket sammie. The food arrived and visually was good looking. We all ordered fries on the side, and they were cooked very nicely. Biting into the sammie, I was really surprised at the lack of flavor. It seemed more like a movie prop, rather then a BBQ sammie. I thought I would doctor it up by adding some sauce which is provided on the table (regular & spicy). The sauce had several problems. First, the consistency was very liquidy and does not have the thickness of traditional BBQ sauce. Sadly, the taste was also absent, and I was really, really puzzled. I switched it up to the spicy sauce, and found that to have the same consistency. I bit into the sammie and was once again really surprised at the lack of bite, flavor, and anything else you would expect.We ordered the cookie chipwiches dessert to go, and those were good when we had them later. One of my peers said "I wouldn't go back there for dry BBQ, but I would go there for dessert."I think this may be a case of BE's trying to be touristy friendly, and have food that is safe, and not too much flavor? The place is really cute inside, and they did a great job with the remodel. The staff was nice, and I really want this place to succeed. It is in a great location, and has TONS of promise, but something needs to be reworked here. Until then, my peers and I will have to pass on BE's, but it is worthy of another shot down the road.This place sucks!  Dry, re-heated, expensive food.I have tried this place twice, the first time I got the pulled pork sandwich and I was really disappointed. It was dry and flavorless. The sauce that they gave on the side tasted like pure vinegar. It was so disgusting that I threw the rest of the sandwich in the trash. It came with a large square of cornbread which somehow drier than the pork..you guessed it, in the trash it went. So far that's a $10 pork sandwich and cornbread in the garbage. I also got a little side of mac n cheese and baked beans (extra 2.99 a piece). The mac and cheese was dry and little more than shell pasta with some shredded cheddar on top, after a few bites I tossed it in the trash. The baked beans were ok...a little better than straight out of the can, and the slaw was ok. I'm not a slaw fan but their apple-cider/vinegar slaw was decent. I've had traditional Southeastern/Carolina slaw and this is pretty close. So after all of that, a pork sandwich with 2 sides, cornbread and slaw was over $16 and $13 of it went straight into the trash.I decided to give them one more shot. I thought maybe ribs and brisket are the way to go. I couldn't have been more wrong. I called ahead and ordered the "Pitmaster's Pick" which is a rib and brisket combo for $19.99. Unlike most other places I've been, this $20 meal does not include your choice of sides. So I decided to try the mac n cheese one more time for an additional $2.99. I was surprised that the guy on the phone said 5-10 minutes because I just ordered ribs and brisket which you can expect to wait on for a bit. Anyway when I got there I was surprised that on a carryout order I was charged a 10% carryout gratuity, and my food was waiting on me.The brisket was unlike any I've ever had, one huge hunk of mostly fat, the actual meat was tough and dry. It smelled smokey but I didn't taste any smoke. There was some kind of rub on there that was kind of chalky. The ribs were even worse, they were very tough and dry, they came sliced half-way between each bone and I still could not rip them apart. They had the same chalky rub type substance on there and a little bit of store bought sauce on top. I wont get into the mac n cheese and the corn bread because it was just as bad as before.After forcing me to tip on a carryout order my tab was just shy of $30. I salvaged what I could of the edible meat, and well I'm still hungry. So in 2 trips I have spent over $46 on just myself and I will never give them another dime of my money. Do yourself a favor and eat ANYWHERE else but here.You walk in and are greeted by ESPN on the tv, gypsy kings on the radio, and a BBQ restaurant that almost exclusively serves gourmet Mexican.  Talk about an identity crisis.  We wound up ordering Mexican and every dish was underwhelming and not worth the price tag.  They also charged our party of 6 a 20% gratuity to boot.  Guys, I recommend you go back to the drawing board and come up with a consistent concept.
La Cave Wine and Food Hideaway=One of the most enjoyable Sunday Brunches I've had to date. It's advertised as "Butler-Style Brunch" or, American Dim Sum, I was a bit confused by what they meant until it was explained to us. Small plates that are brought around to your table by the servers, and you pick what you want. My previous experience at La Cave was great, the outside patio option, and the view of the pool, plus the food was excellent, made me anxious to come try brunch. A little kink in the service, we did sit for awhile before being offered a drink, after someone had noticed, we were started out with bottomless mimosas ($20 extra on top of cost of brunch) but it did include a variety of drink options if mimosas aren't your thing.  They included; Bloody MaryCaipirinhaMargaritaMojitoSangria (white or red)MimosaI liked that you are able to switch them up.Table side items inlcuded:Heirloom Tomato and Mozzarella SaladChilled Tomato SoupFresh Fruit SaladYogurt Parfait with GranolaCornflake Crusted Brioche French ToastNY Style Egg SandwichScrambled EggsAngus Mini BurgersMushroom GritsBaked Potato Loaded Tater Tots w/ Brown GravyTomato Mozzarella FlatbreadChef's Selection Ham & Egg FlatbreadEggs Benedict with Chorizo, Canadian Bacon or FiletVeal Short Rib HashPancakes with Berry CompoteBacon and Chorizo Sausage CupsEverything we had was really good, but a few really stood out, I'm not a huge french toast lover, but the one served was by far the table favorite. I had 3 servings (don't judge, they're small). The mushroom grits and the Eggs Benedict Filet, oh and the Fresh Fruit Salad (sounds boring but it was outstanding) were  my favorites. I'm not sure if it was intentional, but we did wait quite awhile in between servings, not sure if this is to let you rest and digest before the next server comes around with items, but we did have to ask a few times for refills on our drinks and well as food. There seemed to be plenty of staff. Service wasn't bad enough to knock a star off, we really did enjoy our food. Already making plans to come back.I've been here for dinner many moons ago and it was a great experience. I went here for brunch for Easter and I'm glad I did. I think I enjoyed their brunch menu more than their dinner menu.For about $50, you can enjoy 16 butler-style table side items and for an additional $20, you get unlimited brunch cocktails (mimosa, sangria, Mojito, margarita, Bloody Mary, and caipiranha). About $30 for kids under 12. Servers with plates/trays of food go around the restaurant. We were sitting in front of the kitchen so, we always got first dibs on everything.Items we got just for the heck of it (non mind-blowing but expectations weren't set high in the first place):Heirloom Tomato and Mozzarella SaladFresh Fruit SaladScrambled EggsAngus Mini BurgerChorizo Sausage CupPancakes with Berry CompoteTomato Mozzarella FlatbreadVeal Short Rib HashWhat we enjoyed and ate the most:Cornflake Crusted Brioche French ToastMushroom Grits (I smelled truffles when the server passed by so, I had to have this!)Baked Potato Loaded Tater Tots with Brown Gravy (do you like Poutine?)Ham and Egg Flatbread (raw quail eggs)Eggs Benedict with Chorizo (one of the best eggs Benedict's I've ever consumed)Eggs Benedict with Filet (you can't go wrong with steak and eggs)This is supposed to be a leisurely dining experience so, if you have to be somewhere at a certain time, go somewhere else. I like my Lazy Sundays so this was an excellent choice. Laidback, no worries...just sit, eat, sip and enjoy life!This is my go-to Date location in Las Vegas. I think its the perfect first-date spot on the strip because of thr Tapas style dining. What could a better ice breaker be than talking about which food items you would like to share?Def order:Bacon Wrapped datesSangria Sliders FiletRequest:A table on the Patio. The view is simply amazing! The only downside is that it is slightly pricey. I haven't had a bill less than $150 after drinks/apps. The drinks in particular are super what adds up quickly. They are so tasty that you want to order them again and agian!La Cave is an alluring, quaint little restaurant within Wynn that was my second gastronomically-bookmarked stop in Las Vegas. It's a potentially dressy but not too dressy, intimate but not too intimate venue, with both indoor and outdoor seating. I enjoyed the ambiance within La Cave, especially the hammock swings, but the nonchalant attitude of our hostess and server put a bit of a damper on brunch.Jumbo lump crab lettuce cups with citrus segments:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-fnYvr2bthdzOn_LhMx8mA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)The lightness of this dish was very refreshing, but the straight-out-of-the-refrigerator coldness of the lump crab meat kept me from loving the preparation. The presentation, as shown on the picture, was also a bit lacking. I liked the acidic balance of the citrus segments, but I would have preferred they be sliced into smaller bits and interspersed throughout the crab.Kale salad:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ko9BBn19wVjVCnKSiKhqWA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)I love the taste of kale by itself, so it's very hard to go wrong with kale in my book. The fresh kale itself was tender and springy, but the dressing was deathly sweet. It was so sweet that I had trouble tasting the actual taste of kale, which was disappointing. As I'm allergic to apples, I requested that they come on the side (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=q2HJIqSFmGU7syb3UvF8NA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA). I would have also preferred that these be cut into thinner, smaller slices. Warm beet salad with goat cheese:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ZcU6FdfmQS_6Y76YjiMWkA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)This warm beet salad was probably my favorite dish of the meal, as the beets were cooked perfectly and cut into the perfect bite-sized cubes. There was a generous amount of melted goat cheese that was flavored well, and it was almost fondue-like how I was able to dip the beets into the goat cheese for a tasty morsel. The presentation was also adorable; this is a must-order for beet-lovers. Lamb shank atop bed of couscous:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Co3RQUf9w82XKO1zHQeScQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)The couscous was blatantly undercooked and underseasoned. The lamb shank was cooked well, but also a tad underseasoned, which I didn't mind because I like the natural taste of lamb. For someone who minded gaminess though, it may have been too much. It was an elegant dish that just fell a little short of the mark. Shrimp with piquillo peppers and fingerling potatoes:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=d1i5jsyqWYdq8xXTnrcQZw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)We added this dish on at the very end, so I'm not sure if it was because I was pretty full by the time it was served or if I was just not really that big a fan of it.. I liked the tangy citrus notes of the sauce, and the fingerling potatoes were cooked well, but there were maybe two total.. and they were cut into halves. The shrimp also just didn't have much of a shrimp taste, which is something that always bugs me: when food misses its nature-made taste.Bacon and quail egg flatbread:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=CJQ-fBIpDVVd-3El6GlF4Q&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)Out of the two flatbreads, this was definitely my favorite, and I'm usually not a fan of bacon (I know, I know). The huge chunks of fatty bacon were a bit more like ham in my book, and the runny quail eggs (more please!) somehow cut the heaviness of the meat and cheese. The perfect toastiness of the flatbread, with its crunchy outside and fluffy inside, set off the dish nicely. Fiery artichoke and pepperoncini flatbread:(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=H9hg3GRikNP-ce7mAjuHNg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)The large portions of flatbread with glaring deficiencies of toppings made me immediately "meh," and the unimpressive flavors just reinforced that sentiment. I remember the pepperoncinis being very sour, but not much else. The flatbread was a tad overbaked compared to the previous one. I'm not sure if I would return to La Cave, as the price point was a little high for mediocre quality, and the small tapas-like plates tend to add up quickly. If I do, I'll definitely order the bacon and quail egg flatbread and warm beet salad again.The No1DP found this restaurant as a recommendation from the Encore concierge as a restaurant with portions and environment friendly for single travelers. Though it makes for the concierge to make a recommendation within the hotel, the No1DP had a nice meal out of it. When I joined him several days later he took me here on our first dinner date before the AWS re:Play party.LOCATION: One of the restaurants that line the Wynn Esplanade, the shopping strip inside the Wynn/Encore.We got to sit right next to the kitchen where all the hot items were grilled and the flatbreads were baked. We got to talk to one of the chefs and we witnessed how they prepared some of our food. - Diver Sea Scallops, Polenta Cake, Shrimp Sauce ($18). Medium-sized juicy scallop with an equal portion of polenta, which is easily becoming one of my favorite presentations of cornmeal. The small plate is deceptive that eating the entire plate could get a person full quite quickly.- Mushroom Grits, Pecorino ($10). Though not a lot of mushrooms it had full of mushroom flavor. It was also the most carb-heavy dish so I was able to get more full because of my portion of grits. It's served in a cask-iron skillet to keep it hot. - La Cave Caesar, Prosciutto, Lemon Anchovy Dressing ($11). Several stalks of lettuce doesn't make it a salad. It's essentially lettuce wrapped in prosciutto and served with a savory cream puff. It's a decent attempt at interpreting caesar salad as a small plate.- Prawns, Baby Corn, Long Beans, Chili Vinaigrette ($18). We got to see this made right in front of us from the grilling of shrimp to its final assembly of baby corn and long beans. This dish is meant to be eaten whole as the individual components are just average. Shrimps were a big portion.- Beef Filet, Caramelized Onions, Mushrooms, Blue Cheese Flatbread ($17). Our dining companion of the night offered me a slice of flatbread. The flour used is double zero, a high-quality flour used for making pastas and pizzas. I took a bite of the beef and it was soft yet packed with so much mushroom flavor. If the No1DP was used to eating beef he would certainly enjoy it. If dining for two flatbread can get you full quite quickly so we're glad in retrospect that we got non-flatbread dishes - it allowed us to try more small plates.Server was knowledgable in our requests of wine glasses for the night. No1DP enjoyed his white while I was happily sipping my light Pinot Noir. The place is definitely pricey (as is all Vegas establishments) but a reliably good restaurant for small plates.
Greco Fresh Grille=My husband is Greek.  100% Greek.  As in, Easter means the family roasts a whole lamb on a spit. Uncle Dimitri will offer you the whole head of the lamb.  Meaning our wedding, yes was very similar to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, the movie.  AND...everyone's last name ends in OPOLOUS or ISIS. We know Greek food!  Greco Fresh Grille is the real deal, and like the name says, FRESH. GFG is bright and cheery inside, and immaculate.  There's a definite blue and white Greek theme going on-- but it's modern and fresh.  Most Greek restaurants, I'm sorry to say, don't serve real tzatziki sauce.  Most places use a cheap pre-made, preservatives-laden substitute, or they'll use sour cream.  (GROSS!  For sour cream, have Mexican food, mmmkay?) Not here.  You can tell the sauce is yogurt, you can tell someone has shredded cucumber into it, and the garlic is nice and strong.  Just how it should be. Another pet peeve of most Greek joints, is the gyros are made from a pre-molded mystery meat that just gets shaved off a spit to look like it's the real deal.  It's not greasy and Pepto-Bismol-inducing.  It tastes distinctly of lamb and spices. The gyro is moist, the pita nicely warmed on the flat top, and full of flavor.  The really friendly woman who served it to us, suggested keeping the foil on, and unwrapping like a present as you ate, so not to make a mess!My husband's lamb burger was delicious and unexpected.  Very clearly this was lamb, and it was served on a pita, not a bun.  Our only suggestion would be to season the patty itself more, and to include yogurt sauce with it. Instead of fries with our combo, we subbed salads-- not the traditional salads, but the shredded cabbage and arugula one. (The Lahano) It was crisp and refreshing.  I'd like to have seen more arugula, but bottom line, it was a very nice accompaniment. After we ate, my husband was in the mood for fries, after seeing someone else with a piping hot basket.  The lemon oregano fries are killer!  Think hot, fresh FIVE GUYS-like fries with the skins on...and freshly cut...except crispy on the outside and tender and fluffy on the inside.  Then add plenty of lemon juice for tart...salt and oregano...mmm, we ate it all!After overhearing another customer say "...since I had the hummus here, I can't eat the stuff at the supermarket..." we asked the cashier if she thought the hummus was good.  She said it was great, and gave us a small sample cup with two flavors, a traditional one and a roasted red pepper feta.  Alongside, were 4 mini pita wedges.  Again, super fresh. (I'm used to more tahini in mine, but I suppose this is different than Lebanese hummus.) The most rockin' way to end a meal...the galaktompoureko.  This is a traditional Greek dessert made of an eggy, custard, set with farina, between sheets of buttery phyllo.  HOLY MOLY don't tell my mother-in-law...but this is the best version I've ever had.  It's flavored with orange zest, and super light but creamy and milky....oh how to describe it.  Just give it a try.  If you like flan and rice pudding you'll like this. Bottom line, we were really impressed to find a Greek place that does things right.  They're owned by Greek people, and obviously hire good employees, because every single person we talked with was kind and helpful. My only wish, is there was a Greco Fresh closer to where I live!Finally ventured into this little Blakeney gem. My wife had been before and had great things to say so, needless to say, we were long overdue. Resting amongst more attractive and simple options for suburban folk, I'm happy to say Greco Fresh Grille is local-biz lover's haven. Small, shotgun setup on the inside and a handful of tables out back. The outdoor seating is great, but goes quite fast if it's a nice day. Get at it quick! Always nice to see filled tables at an off hour. Telltale sign this place is doing something right. Friendly service behind the counter. Welcoming and helpful. Here's our order: Got cups for water. They have pepsi products. (No hard feelings. I'm just a coke guy through and through. I'll make an exception for Cheerwine, however. Viva NC)Spinach Pie. To the Greek-savvy, Spanakopita. Amazing. The phyllo is perfectly crispy, flaky and crunches/dissolves with each bite. The spinach filling is savory and not too rich and creamy. Comes with 6 pieces, so perfect for a table of two. If you're sharing with more than two, you'll have to fight for more than one piece! I'd get this every time. My wife got the veggie gyro. Great mix of roasted red peppers, cucumber, red onion and great tzatziki. I'm a fan. The pita is thick and chewy, but not offensively so. I'd be hard pressed to shove a few pieces of the spinach pie in this bad boy! Loved all of the textures and flavors. Not overpowering and a great veggie option. I got the lamp gyro. Voted best in the QC by the Observer. I say rightfully so. Generous helping of lamb, balanced well with fresh veggies and, yet again, a nice slather of that great tzatziki. Each bite was great and I was only disappointed once it was gone. Prices are very reasonable. We ate for $20 and were happily full!Parking can be an issue, as there aren't many spaces directly in front of the shop. Not uncommon for Blakeney spots. I'd park over near the Starbucks. Can't wait to head back and stuff my face with more Greek food. Opa!Cheers.WOW WOW WOW!!!  This little hole in the wall is amazing!!  My best friends when I was a child were Orthodox Greek straight from the islands and one of my best friends now is Greek and she and her Mother make AWESOME Greek food.   With all of that being said, I'm a major Greek food snob and I have unreasonably high standards, as a result.  I have been to dozens of Greek restaurants over the years and a handful from Charlotte, NC to Columbia, SC and, hands-down...Greco is far superior to any other that I have been to.  The freshness of the ingredients, the flavors and seasonings, and the quality of the meat is just like my Greek friends have made me accustomed to.I visited Greco for a late lunch.  Even at 2:00 on a weekday, there were several people in their enjoying their meals and more coming in as I was waiting.  The decor is unpretentious and captures the essence of Greece beautifully.  It has a bit of a Greek Diner feel, which I LOVE!  The service was fast and friendly and I enjoyed watching the chef  (owner, maybe??) prepare my food..."FRESH' is the key word in the title here.  I watched intently and everything was homemade (Tzatziki, Greek dressing, Lamb patties, etc).I ordered the Lamb Gyro combo with Lemon and Oregano Fries and a Peasant Salad.  The lamb patties for the Gyro are made onsite with fresh lamb and the most perfect Greek Lamb seasoning blend.  It's cooked on the grill-top to order (not made from greasy pre-fab mounds kept warm on a a spit).  This is real deal!!  The meat was moist, tender, and delicious!  It was served with housemade Tzatziki and tomato on a warm pita (I asked them to hold the onions).  The Tzatziki is made with yogurt, fresh shredded cucumbers, fresh herbs, and TONS of garlic....it's a flavor sensation!   The fries...OMG, the fries!!!  The most incredible seasoned fries I have ever tasted.  Tastes like traditional Greek Potatoes, but in french fry form (brilliant marketing move, BTW...everyone loves french fries!!).  French fries are fresh cut with skins, fried crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle and then they are tossed in a bowl with salt, lemon juice, and oregano.  I will have dreams about these fries!  LOL   Last, but not least, is the Peasant Salad.  The Peasant Salad is everything that you love about a traditional Greek salad, minus the lettuce.  Giant wedges of plump red tomatoes, thinly sliced red onion, sliced seedless cucumbers (with the skin on), Kalamata Olives, and big cubes of deliciously salty and tangy feta cheese.  Again, all of the ingredients are put into a bowl and hand-tossed with Greek dressing and an extra dash of seasoning.  Salad is served with warm pita wedges.   It was a fantastic salad and the serving was huge!  Salads can also be topped with their house-marinated Chicken or Shrimp or their yummy Lamb.  They also have a Vegetarian Pita made with Red Peppers, Eggplant, and Zucchini and a kids menu.  They also offer Whole Wheat Pitas for a mere .25 charge.Prices are excellent as well.  I paid $15.00 (Gyro combo with Fries and a Drink and a full-sized Peasant Salad) and I made two meals out of it!  BTW, the Fries reheat perfectly in the oven!  If you are looking for heavy Greek dishes such as Pasticio, Baked Fish, or Leg of Lamb, this isn't the place.  If you are looking for delicious Greek quick dishes, this is a must-try!I can't wait to go back with my husband....he is going to love it!!!   I must try the Spanikopita next time!I have a new favorite lunch place!!Update Oct 8, 2012: I have been back 3-4 times since my original review and the 5-star rating still stands!  The service is always excellent and the ingredients are always very fresh.  My Husband, Son, and Mother have also eaten here with me and they love it, too.  I truly can't say enough about the house-made Gyro meat...it is moist and perfectly seasoned every time!   We have also tried the Spanikopita and it is very good, too!  This is "the" place for Gyros!
Ben & Florentine=The food is a solid OK, but nothing more than that. The portions are good, a little too big for me but good for someone with an average appetite I guess. I'm rating them 3 stars because it's close to home, they have adequate seating, parking in a lot, and the prices are reasonable. I don't understand why the eggs on the Eggs Benedict are soft-cooked and not a runny poached as is traditional though...I suppose you should ask for that specifically if it's a deal breaker. On the other hand, I love their Raisin Apple Rave which is french toast made from raisin bread with caramelized apples and wouldn't change a thing about it.Overall, solid and better than any other breakfast chain restaurant.
Sugar Factory American Brasserie=I am writing this review 1 month after eating a 5 star breakfast at Sugar Factory because I wanted to see how long this meal would haunt me....the answer? It still does. When I wake in the morning I still dream of having the same breakfast I had here....and then I do the math and realize that if I left now, I wouldn't get there till lunch or dinner anyway....sigh. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Applewood Smoked Bacon instead of Canadian Bacon. It was the most delicious breakfast I have ever had. The flavors were perfect and the bacon melted in my mouth. The poached eggs are atop a bed of scalloped potatoes....mmmmmmm. The mimosa on the side was a perfect beverage and the icing on the cake. I am actually thinking of staying at Paris again, just so I could be sleeping above the kitchen that made this breakfast....and if you have read my review on the Paris Hotel, you would know how much of a sacrifice that is. If you have a Harrah's card you get a discount on your meals here, so I recommend stopping by the players club which is steps from the Sugar Factory, inside the casino. I also recommend their Happy Hour at the bar. The drinks are dazzling, but way over priced unless you are there for HH. The drinks are buy 1 get one free at that time which is a life savor when the drinks are $16-$24 a piece. Of course the $24 drinks are about a 1/2 gallon of sugary-sweet alcohol concoction, so make sure you are walking back to your hotel.So here are the highlights:- this place is open 24/7- they have an expansive and interesting cocktail menu inspired by your most favorite sweet candies- the terrace seating has a great view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip for people watchingWe had a late dinner here after watching a show and the huzbeau and I shared a french dip sammy which our server kindly split into separate plates.  It came with fries that were nice and crispy and the sammy was not bad.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw?select=dTGLNYS7_gZszDoRvzSW-QAlso shared the french onion soup - more notable than the sandwich, I remember the crouton and broth tasting pretty good.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw?select=QRBqJAV-0AN9Ke9SWAcQBwThe couple that was with us shared their banana split waffle which they enjoyed.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw?select=P5br39xhOBQfhQCoNLYF3g  I had a bubble gum cocktail which was pretty to look at but not as strong as it was pricey. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw?userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJgNice, dark decor and fitting to be part of the beautiful Paris hotel.  But you know what?  I dont' know what it is but I'm not exactly pining to come back.  Just A-ok for me.You know...it sure takes a lot for me to give a 1-star review; that being said, this is my first one in almost 50 reviews. Sugar Factory "American Brasserie," you let me down so hard. After careful consideration, this was probably one of the Top 5 Worst Dining Experiences I've Ever Had (future Yelp list, anyone?) I'm all about eating well and paying a high price for it-- especially in Vegas-- but, after eating here, I wished that my dining partner, David, and I just went to a normal cafe or even McDonald's on the way back to our resort.  I'm typically lenient with this type of fare, but our foul experience is just beyond my comprehension.Granted, we came in here very late. Around 4:00 AM. However, the restaurant was still busy and seemed well-staffed. The menu looked appealing enough, so we were sat immediately for a table for two. We were just desperate for some supposedly decent food (Yelp here had it at 3.5 stars, cumulatively...what the hell). Waited a while for water...okay. Waited a while to order...okay. Now, never to see our waiter again. Well, correction: we saw our waiter, but he never came within a 15 foot radius of our table. Cool, thanks.The lone highlight of this disaster: we waited under 30 minutes for food. It never should have taken this long to begin with, but whatever. I had just a simple burger. How hard is that, right? I could barely stomach half of it. I'm pretty confident that the bun was made back when the Paris resort was actually built...completely inedible. I took the bun off eventually and even the rest just wasn't good. I know that's not descriptive, but I was just turned off by it. Seemed almost as old as the bun and I've had better cheese and bacon toppings at a Denny's. Now, the worst: David had their basic chicken sandwich. This made my burger look like a star. The grilled chicken was probably rolled around the Strip like some hockey puck, picked back up, grilled into oblivion, then smashed between the same, nasty bun. He had a quarter of it, tried to just eat the meat, and couldn't. The waitstaff couldn't come by quick enough to scoop it up, not once asking our opinion.Ohh, it gets BETTER. We couldn't get our check. I mean, really, REALLY couldn't get our check. Our waiter was still M.I.A., the other members of the waitstaff were snobby and just kept saying "K" to us, like they were 6th grade girls. Never in my life have I considered getting up and walking out, but it kept running through my mind in the TWENTY minutes we waited for our damn piece of paper stating the damage. Well, well. Still no check. The manager comes by and asks us how things were. David didn't say much. ...But I did. Every detail of our atrocious meal escaped my mouth like word vomit (+5 bonus points if you catch that reference). He seemed a bit surprised, and loosely apologized; and, instead of comping our meal (the right thing to do if he had any hope of having repeat customers), he said he would fetch our check. UM, NO.  He came back and dropped off our check with a 20% discount. Normally, fine. But this was just ridiculous. Never, EVER again. The Sugar Factory Brasserie attempted to emulate that of a high-class, Vegas restaurant...and miserably failed. I would never come here again even if I was paid; there are so many other better options in this fabulous city.IF you are thinking of going to Serendipity DO NOT, come here instead.If you like the Cheesecake factory you will like this place.With 3 major differences:  1) they have a wide selection of crepes which I suggest the ratatouille crepe as it's fab and priced right at $13 2) they have a plethora of sugary sweet stuff that are served in glasses and called one of my favorite words "martini"3) they have breakfast everyday of the week till like 1 or somethingIt's located on the strip, there's an outside dining option, and there's typically a small wait.Also, the Bloody Mary's are deliciously devine, so if you need a big girl cocktail that's my suggestion.  This place is also Kid approved in my book!  It's also very loud and the bar tends to get backed up, so it will take you longer than you would like for your cocktail, so order that right away!Another CES show, another new place to try for breakfast.  I decided to try the Sugar Factory for breakfast and I'm glad I did.I had looked over the menu online before going, but I still looked again and was torn among three or so items.  I ordered the chocolate French toast which the menu described as dark chocolate stuffed brioche, strawberries, and chocolate syrup.  My server, Mariela, asked if I wanted maple syrup or chocolate syrup.  Hell, in for a penny in for a pound--I'll take the chocolate syrup.  She then asked, dark, light, or white chocolate.  I went with the dark.The breakfast was not long in coming but it was long enough that I could enjoy watching the tourists think sitting on the patio was OK for this cold morning.  I also watched as the fountains at the Bellagio just shot upwards steadily for about 2 minutes.  The crew were out there doing maintenance.The French toast was delightful.  It was a small portion, but for something this rich, that's exactly what you want!  I found myself breaking a small piece of brioche off and dipping the bread into the chocolate sauce.  Dessert for breakfast!  That's the way to go!Service was OK but it could have been better.  It wasn't until I was done with my French toast that I was asked about more coffee.  Considering how few people there were this morning, Mariela should have checked back with me long before this to see how things were and offer more coffee sooner.  Still, I rate the breakfast 4 stars because it was great tasting, the people watching was good, and it was a good choice to go here.Edit:  I asked when the check was brought if they give Total Rewards credit for the cost of the bill.  They don't, but if you give them your card, they'll give you a 20% discount off your entrée.Let me start by saying that this is all based on our waiter, Sloan.My friend and I came here for lunch one day, at a time when the restaurant was not in any means full- maybe like four tables were occupied. Let's get the pros out of the way, since there were only a few:PROS- We both got the veggie burger, which was fantastic. It is made with real veggies and on a bun that is purple. PURPLE! And tastes great. For dessert we got the crepes (Nutella and Smores) and they too were very delicious. But, not even this great feast was enough to make up for crappy service and lackluster surroundings.CONS- Who came up with the idea to cover every inch in tables and chairs, and in such a way that even Janga would be shamed? Seriously, not only was there no room (and I cringe at the idea of how it really would have been with a lot of people in there) but our table was lopsided, and kept rocking back and forth. The hostess who sat us even knew it- she moved it around a bit and said it would be fine. No. It was not.Next up prices; yeah whatever, it's expensive. I get that. 100$ for lunch for two.Now for the main one star review: Sloan, our waiter. Yeah, I remember his name. He was that bad. The first sign was the fact that we waited 20 minutes for our food to come out, and when it did, the person (who was not our waiter but some random chick) just dropped them off and ran away. Literally ran away. That's ok. Not like I was going to ask for ketchup. Oh wait, I was. So I waited for our actual waiter to come over so I could ask for some sauce. Ten minutes later out of the hole of hell he came up and I started with "Could I get some ranch...." and he turned to walk away. My friend had to yell 'wait' for him to return since she too wanted sauce.Next up, after eating and ordering dessert we waited another 20 minutes, all the while our dinner plates were in front of us and never cleared. Not until the crepes came out did our waiter walk over and clear it off. Finally, the wait time for the check was ridiculous. Not only had we been there for an hour and half already, we had to wait even longer for Sloan to notice us.And where was Sloan this entire time? I shit you not, speaking to the bartender. THE ENTIRE TIME. Seriously? You only have like three tables to take care of and you stand around and talk with a bartender for the entire day? My friend had to wave him over to get a check, and even THEN we were forced to wait until he picked it up from the table- SINCE HE WAS RIGHT BACK WITH THE BARTENDER!Not one person who works here seems to care about anything but standing around and talking to one another- there were plenty of other workers there, but I never saw one, NOT ONE doing anything. Well, except for the only other waitress there, who was actually doing her job. But she was the only one.I don't ever expect to come back, at least not at the same time since that seems to be the shift where all the lazies are put on.Hubby and I decided to stop here to have a drink and share a dessert after having dinner somewhere else. I have really wanted to try this place for a while, but it was not what I had hoped. I ordered a "Banana Mango Margarita" priced at $16 and it came garnished with a few banana gummies. The drink tasted good and I liked the banana sugar that rimmed the drink, but the banana gummies were so rock hard that they couldn't be eaten. Bummer. Hubby ordered a "Reese's Martini" also priced at $16 and it was rimmed with peanut butter. I tried a couple drinks and thought it looked much better than it tasted. We ordered the "Sugar Factory Fondue" priced at $21.95 and was disappointed. You can choose white, milk or dark chocolate and we decided to go with the milk chocolate fondue. It came with gummy bears, homemade marshmallows, white chocolate bread, brownie bites, strawberries and bananas. The gummy bears were so hard like the banana gummies that we didn't bother with them. The homemade marshmallows and strawberries and bananas were actually good, but the bread and brownie bites were dry and bland. We sat near a window so the Bellagio water show made for a nice view. Our server was nice, but our total including tax was $60.86 and that is just way too much for 2 cocktails and 1 dessert that were nothing special. I came, I tried, I doubt I will be back if I am picking where to eat.So because Britney Spears licked one of their lollipops this place can tax the hell out of people? Everything on the menu is overpriced. We ordered a couple drinks both at $16 each and they were tiny. The fondue we had for dessert came out with very few things for the price and most of it was either dry, had no flavor or was stale tasting. Not worth $60 or purchasing a groupon. OH and I saw pretty Christmas lights of blue and red while here. Cops pulled up right along LV Blvd and their lights suddenly turned the inside of Sugar Factory into a night club. As long as it's an episode of COPS I'm not in we are good. I wanted to start playing "bad boys" from my phone. Once the po's took off the place turned back into what it was supposed to be. Overpriced and boring. On the plus side we were seated by a window where we could see the water show at Bellagio.First: the CNF charge on the bill, aka "Concession & Franchise Fee" which we couldn't seem to get a straight answer about what exactly we were paying for... appeared to be a 3.5% charged on the bill (which, for our large party was a substantial surprise), and is supposedly related to fees charged to venues by the casinos they're attached to, sort of a surcharge for a restaurant having a prime location. According to my research (and thank you Anthony Curtis), there are very few places in Vegas that do this, and Sugar Factory was one of, if not THE, first to do this. This fee was not disclosed to us and I did not even notice it on the bill until another person pointed it out. The waiter, who provided fair service, could not explain it to us so he asked an associate to try to explain. She couldn't explain it either so we asked for a manager. A very nonchalant 'manager' (at least I think he was a manager, as he didn't introduce himself or formally state his position) said the disclaimer didn't make it onto their new menus. He said the tax was 4.75% (huh? 3.5%, 4.75% which is it?) added on separately so they wouldn't have to raise the prices of their dishes. And that it was "normal" because Cabo Wabo down the street charges it too. Did we ask about Cabo Wabo? Is there value in what we're paying for? No and no. We asked if there was anything he could do for us, as this started as a happy family gathering but at the end of the dinner we all sat around talking about this BS fee and feeling very dissatisfied. He did not care about our level of dissatisfaction, would not credit anything, not even give us a coupon for a future visit, or a free dessert (which I can see why, as their sundae is $49.95).Sugar Factory at Paris, we hope you're listening to your customers, because not only have you made a party of 8 unhappy customers, each of us and ALL of our social media connections are hearing us too. Trip Advisor, Twitter, Facebook...All you had to do was make us happy customers when we were there. Why is that so hard for you to do?Second: the lighting kept going from blinding-bright, to dark-are-we-having-a-blackout.Third: the food? I don't even remember. We were so upset about the customer service. Oh yes, they brought with our bill a little dish of complimentary yogurt covered mini pretzels: 4... for a party of 8.As stupid as this may sound, I went back to this place the following day for breakfast after a mediocre dinner.  I have to say that this location will not substitute anything.  They do not want to be bothered with any variations in their menu. I ordered the egg white scramble with crispy fries.  Unfortunately, the fries were not crispy.  The bacon was very average and did not taste like the applewood smoked bacon they claimed it was.  I ordered a banana but French toast. It was actually a slice of banana nut bread topped with some fruit and whipped cream (about $15).  I tried a few bites and pushed it aside. On a good note, they do serve Peet's Coffee and it was delicious. This place could be so much better, but they really don't care, IMHO.  I wanted to try it for myself and now I have. Too many other places to spend your dollars without all the heartache and grief.Came here with my cousins for a goblet. We were directed to sit at the high tables when we informed the front desk that we just wanted drinks. BAD IDEA. Our server ended up practically ignoring us the whole time. What should have been a 30 minute experience turned out to be an hour long due to the amount of time we had to wait for our server.So, if you want better service, take an actual seat. -_-Anyways, the Lollipop Passion goblet was absolutely yummy. I don't typically drink alcohol, but barely tasted it in this. (Maybe there's not much in there?!) We also ordered the Upside Down Pineapple Cake, which was very yummy paired with the vanilla gelato it comes with.I'm mostly removing my stars because of the service. And when I checked my credit card bill a couple days after, I noticed that my written tip was rounded up. It might not be a lot of money added onto my bill, but I'm annoyed that such a move was pulled. Shady.Went here on a Saturday afternoon for brunch for a bachelorette/bachelor lunch gathering. While we weren't able to sit in the same area, we were able to make two separate reservations for about 20 people each for a 1pm time slot. Parties of 30 or more will have to do some expensive buffet arrangement. We just wanted food. After a night of going out, the need for food was real. With such a large party, our food took a little while longer but once it arrived, it hit the spot. I ordered the Signature Burger and a side of fries, with a beef patty, tomatoes, cheese, and fried onion straws. Not healthy at all, but it's Vegas! Not a place known for healthy lifestyles.  Looking around the table, everyone's portions were HUGE. Club sandwiches piled high with turkey, a grilled cheese BLT with TWO grilled cheeses. I definitely took half of the burger home for a snack later on. With their prices though, it made sense to have big portions. Extremely over priced, but expected. Especially on their drinks. While the drinks were tasty and fun to drink, very expensive for the volume and quality you got.With a large party, would go here again. Solid selection for lunch, a good amount of space to fit big parties, and central on the strip.
Russo's Pizza Kitchen=First order (February 2013): I picked up a Russo's special which was topped with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers and onions.  The pizza was mediocre all the way and we were in no rush to order from here again.  Second order (September 2013): We had last minute guests coming over to watch the Sunday afternoon football games.  Since this is the closest pizza to my house, I gave it another shot and ordered a large sausage mushroom for pickup.  This pizza was actually pretty great.  Even our guests thought so and I was pleasantly surprised.  I couldn't believe this was the same place to be honest.  Third order (November 2013): An old buddy living in Boston was raving about chicken parm sandwiches around the Fenway area.  So that got me thinking to the last time I had a great chicken parm sub which was probably when Clinton was president.  I bit the bullet and got one to go.  Although the bread was decent, the chicken was bland and under seasoned as was the tomato sauce.  It was pretty blah overall.  The sub came with a small side of potato salad that was FROZEN.  My initial thought was that the crunch in my mouth was celery but it was ice!  Nice!  I called to inform them of this and the cashier simply just said "Sorry."  The owner called me 3 minutes later to apologize again.  He said there was something wrong with his fridge, everything froze over and blamed his cook for not noticing.I'll probably end up ordering from here again due to proximity but will drive that extra few miles to get pizza elsewhere for sure.  I wonder how many pizza chefs they have?  Maybe I need to obtain their shift schedule.Just okay for pizza and salads- cheese slice is $2.50, crust is perfectly thin and crispy but sauce was on the bland side. The Greek salad has scant non-lettuce ingredients and no protein for $10 but an incredible dressing- it's called a house italian, but it's a creamy version that tastes like a really good Caesar. Another table got a $16 steamed mussels special that looked to be a small portion, but the great garlic fragrance was enough to make me rethink my selections. Overall I feel like it's a bit overpriced for what you get.The space is small, walk-up style but dining in is nicer than you'd think- there's also a large TV tuned to sports above the counter and individual flat screen TVs at some of the booths.
32 Shea=Update. Tonight the owner of this place saw my hubby and I at a Thai place and remembered us apparently. Thought it was funny after 8 months she recalled my bad review even called it entertaining. And paid our bill for dinner and added 10 straws. Guess she misses us!!!!!   Thanks for the dinner Rebecca. until today I would of given this place 3 to 4 stars, I liked that it was a local business. My husband and I went to this spot once a week for almost a year now, even made this the place to go to start my 40th birthday. despite having to send my food back once and getting the wrong drink once or twice I came back and chalked that up to basic mistakes.Today the owner came out of left field on me using 2 straws and that it was costing her a lot of money and as a business owner I should respect her and only use 1 straw. my hubby even joked ok we will go to Dunkin Donuts then and she said you should. At first I thought she was kidding, but she wasnt. Really you would rather loose 2 loyal customers who come to you and have recommended you to others over 2 extra straws per week? if that hits your bottom line.. I am totally schocked at this and will NEVER go back now. Too bad Iove supporting local companies and such but apparently you would rather have the 2 cents than the 20 to 40 we spend there a week plus tipping your staff.If you go to the place and spend hundreds of $$$ over the course of a couple years......don't expect more the $5 off your second bottle on Tuesday.........even if the online ad doesn't mention that....And if  you complain.......you will be thrown out and police called.PatheticVery. Rude. Owner.Enough said.1 star is being generous after our last experience here.  Cant say enough great things about the bartender Josh, and servers Rachel and Darcy.... Its too bad that we wont get to experience their services because of the owner.  The owner may know how to light up an open sign, hire great employees, and set a great atmosphere... but she lacks class and needs to know what customer service stands for.  Im all about supporting small business and local businesses at that... but I will not support a classless piece of trash.  We were regulars there bringing in friends family and referring this place to anyone we could.  I will never go there again and dont think it is appropriate to treat customers the way she did us.  Not only did she eavesdrop on our quiet conversation, but then she butts in to tell us that we are being rude talking about how we disagree about her not advertising that only the 1st bottle is half off wine night but fails to tell us until after we have ordered 2 bottles.  Common courtesy would have been to tell us that the 2nd bottle is only $5  off when we ordered the 2nd bottle.... not wait til we question later and she wants to point to the menu stating the fine print says otherwise.  Im sorry, but i didnt look at a menu to look for the fine print when i see your Half off bottle wine night posted all over facebook.  But besides the fact,  after the disagreement, she proceeds to tell us that if we dont like it, we can leave.  Fair enough.....  let us finish our wine we bought and we will never be back.  She then threatens to call the cops if we dont leave that moment.  Unnecessary!  we werent causing a scene.  She made the scene on her own.  I will take my group of 7 that visits there 2-3 times a week and support another business.   In an economy like today, a business owner like herself should really take a step back and see where she will be if she continues to treat loyal customers and/or new customers like she did us.  I work with small business owners on a daily basis,,, and they arent successful by treating their customers rudely.  She should take this feedback as a gift.Lovely night!!! Perfect weather outside now, and you have the option of inside the cafe or outside in their lovely patio!! We picked the patio area, open aired, and not noisy at all, being that it's close to the street. Great customer service!! A++_ Delicious food, we ordered the Mango Shrimp!! Oh soo delightful with well proportioned mango squares, avocado, cilantro and lime!!! YUM!! ** Oh and we also went with the Tuesday special, which was Bruschetta and your pick of Wine, for the Bruschetta, you can pick three and we chose, the Fresh Mozzarella + Basil + Tomato, also the Brie + Apples + Honey and the famous Prosciutto + Mascarpone + Figs + Honey!!! OH SOO YUM!! An explosion of full flavors inside your mouth, everything from sweet to sour!!!  :) What a Great Combo, as for wine, we went with their ever soo fruity New Age, Torrentes!! Which was indeed a great pick!!! Fully satisfied!!! :)If you are a) in a hurry or b) claustrophobic, just turn around. Turn around now and RUN. You will be sitting close enough to hear the wisdom of neighboring randoms in love with the sound of their own voice. (A favorite quote from the next table: "If you want to be CEO, you gotta get your MBA.")You will wait. A long time. A disproportionately long time. Your server is super friendly and kind, but harried and unapologetic, even when shrimp end up in your dinner uninvited. ("Oh, oops, good thing you're not allergic to shellfish.......... are you?")The wine and beer list? Meh. Abbreviated.The menu? Bruschetta, salads, light sandwiches: your typical wine bar fare.So why in the eff is the place so successful? Location, location, location. What would be average in Arcadia is novel and exciting in 85028. Really. There is nothing else like it in this part of the valley and for that it wins. Its patio is big, decor is cute, food is decent, and it is god damn chic and exciting if you are used to Applebee's. So why does 32 SHEA garner four generous stars? BECAUSE THE NUTELLA MARTINI IS PROOF THAT GOD EXISTS. Pure. Genius.Oh i hate to do this, (food and drink quality is still good). 32 has been my favorite spot for awhile now for coffee.  Now where do i start on my new review... I struggled between 2 or 3 stars, but i am being biased and letting them live with the 3 instead.I haven't been to 32 in 2 weeks, and decided to stop by and get some drinks with my wife. When we get there it is all new people working there, that is a little depressing. I will reminisce that the first baristas i met here have been hands down my favorite and none have filled the shoes they left.Back to my experience.. I have my loyalty card with one punch left. That means my wife and I only need to pay for one of our drinks! Yay! Sounds like my day is going pretty well. The next event was waiting for this girl who was just tinkering on the Ipad to get done and greet us and get our orders. We order or drinks, and she says "I can't give you your free drink."I was just honestly confused and stunned so i didn't say anything.girl-"You are doing this in one purchase right?me-"yes...." at this point in my head i am thinking...WHAT!?!? it has NEVER been like that..for the 3 or so years i have been coming here it has NEVER been like that...girl-"well you can do it in two transactions"me- "yeah do that." ... at this point to prevent me from being over involved in this conversation i flip open my phone and wait for her to figure this all outThe girl turns to the person working on the bar and asks some question about the situation. YAY it's the manager working at the bar, finally a familiar face. She was as confused as i was about the situation.girl- "well i don't want to give them a double discount, a punch in the card and a free drink"At this point i just space out because this is the most ridiculousness i have heard. NO WHERE does that,  or acts like that...let alone in front of a customer. Granted i did not say anything else and just got my drink and left. WOW...i just don't even want to express how sad this is for me that 32 is starting to be one of "THOSE" placesAfter a busy morning and playdate at Imagination Avenue, my friend Jane B and our two almost two year olds had worked up quite an appetite... We wanted a quick lunch before their naptime, so logically, we checked Yelp for nearby lunch spots.  We didn't have to look far as 32 Shea is literally right across the parking lot... we decided to check it out and we were both very impressed.  32 Shea is a tiny little gem of a restaurant  on the corner of (you guessed it) 32nd Street and Shea.  It's colorful on the outside and inside both literally and figuratively... the staff couldn't have been friendlier - and that's even with 2 toddler boys making a mess as Jane and I tried to order and scarf our food down.We each had "the chop" salad and shared two muffins with the boys.  The salads were fresh and a good portion size, and the muffins were delicious... (we had a carrot muffin and a raspberry muffin).  They actually tasted more like cupcakes, so I don't know how healthy they were, but I'll tell myself they were healthy ;)The menu has plenty more to choose from as well:  all kinds of coffee drinks, smoothies, breakfast including egg sandwiches, burritos and oatmeal (served until noon), lunch and even dinner!  It sounds like at night the place becomes more loungey with candle light and table service (as opposed to the order at the counter style they have during the day).  I'll have to check that out!32 Shea reminded both of us of the type of cafe you'd find in a more urban environment like NYC or perhaps even Europe.  The building used to be a drive-thru photo mat and was then transformed to another restaurant before the current owners took it over in 2011.  They've done a fabulous job with it, and it still has a working drive-thru and a nice patio too.I have one request of the owners: please get some lemonade on the menu!  I wanted an Arnold Palmer but was told you don't have lemonade, so that is something I'd suggest.  Other than that, it looks like you've got something for everyone and I can't wait to return to try more from the menu!It was an uncommonly rainy night when I met a friend here for dinner and drinks so the patio area was closed.  I was sad that I couldn't enjoy the patio because it was honestly the one thing that really drew me in from the photos I saw here from other yelpers.  The interior was as packed as a small place this could be.  At this point I'm a little unsure about staying, no patio and tight quarters. The staff was immediately very happy to see me and showed no signs they were at all put out by the weather.  I ordred a beer and the pizza of the day.  The waitress tried to tell me what was on the pizza of the day but I really wanted to be surprised so I asked her to stop.  All she got out was "it's called black and blue".  I was told the beer I wanted wasn't in stock or going to be carried anymore so I said surprise me with a random beer that is similar.  They brought me one of my favorites so I was very happy with their choice.  The pizza took a lot longer to come out than I would have expected but I really didn't mind.  The atmosphere was so comfortable that had I not looked at the time I wouldn't have realized so much of it had passed.  The pizza was great, I had fun figuring out why they called it Black and Blue and the waitress asked me if I had figured it out.  The blue cheese flavor wasn't overpowering nor was the blackened steak.  It was a very well balanced flavor over all and I enjoyed every bite.I'm sure I'll be back so I can explore more of their menu and hopefully try out the patio area.I was a little disappointed, I have been asking the organizer of my twins mom group to do a night out at this place.  Finally, she sets the date.  My husband was going to be out of town, so I had the nanny come, since I didn't want to miss it, this place being my suggestion.  I got there on time as usual, so I was the first one.  I asked the lady inside if we had a spot reserved since we were a group, and she confirmed and told me I would be seating outside in a minute.I sat down on the bench outside to wait to be directed to my table.  Five minutes later a couple arrived and went inside.  What do you know, the server was guiding them to a table outside.  That was a little rude, but I decided to just walk myself to the table.  My friend who organized the event got in just then, and I had only one menu for me.  The server again, said she would be right back.  I ended up going in and grabbing another menu. By the way, there were only 2 other tables with customers besides ours.  Not really a happening night, it was St. Patty's day after all, so people where drinking somewhere else.  We ordered our drinks.  They are really good.  A few other friends arrived and again we were struggling to get her attention and more menus.  One of the ladies ended up going inside to order her drink, she said the server was rude to her inside also.  We ordered a few bruschetta.  Mine was pretty good, but I wish it would have been a better experience."Let's have coffee!" Amanda B. said.So I got there early. I hooked myself up to super fast wi-fi. I cursed myself for having stuffed myself already as the menu looked delicious. After hugs were shared I watched enviously as Amanda returned to the table with wine. At lunch time.Apparently Happy Hour is a twelve hour thing.TWELVE HOURS.Did you hear me?(Dine in only. This is stipulated on the menu. Who tries to take HH to go? Apparently SOME PEOPLE. 32 Shea does have a drive thru.)So from 6AM to 6PM folks can enjoy the following:$4 bottled craft beer$5 wine, mimosa, bloody mary$6 martinis, cocktailsAND then (!) they have a 2-hr munchie hour4pm-6pm (again, dine in only kids)$3 bruschetta$5 munchie menu (which they put on the chalk board)See here's the thing. If you're a writer, this place is dangerous. You'd never get a damn thing done. You'd show up bright and early for breakfast (which is served until noon), enjoy coffee, move onto a smoothie and then lunch. (The green smoothie is *excellent*.) At some point a beve would make sense, right? And then, well, it's drinking time?This is an adorable cozy space. You will fall in love with it. Oops! I got all sorts of excited and left something out. You place your order up front at the cashier and food is brought to you. Tables are cleared for you. I took a menu to keep in my car. YES, I did that. This place isn't in my neck of the woods. However, I cannot wait to grab food the next opportunity I'm up here again!UPDATE: While you're here be sure to try the New Mexican burrito. The green salsa is to die for. (I'm hoping they start selling this to go soon.) Garlic, jalapeños, cilantro, tomatoes, onion, and some other heaven. I can't remember what else Rebecca, the super cool owner, described with zest. She's currently sporting purple short hair. All the employes rock. There's a punky and fun vibe going on here. Good times :)I love Shea 32 for the amazing patio and laid back vibe. I was surprised to find this little gem in a half empty strip mall at the edge of a residential neighborhood. I have now been there a number of times- both for lunch and dinner- and have liked everything I tried. They have a killer sandwich called the OMG that I just can't get enough of - figs, prosciutto, mascarpone and honey on perfectly chewy ciabatta. For dinner they have excellent Bruschetta as well as revolving daily specials and an excellent wine selection. This is the perfect place for a romantic dinner outside on the Patio in the cooler months.I have tried so hard to support this place, but honestly its not working for me.The owner has some real attitude and its challenging to support.Once I was in there and she started to push my table back telling me rudely I needed to "move in" to make room for others. Another time , I received the incorrect drink order and she told me it was because I ordered it wrong.I was in yesterday and ordered my kids the nutella mocha....the barrista was so swamped filling both in house and drive through orders that she forgot entirely to put the "nutella" in their drinks. Zero consistency here.Don't even bother to order the juice smoothy, its just Costco juice blended over ice. Erroneously they list all of the ingredients in the Costco juice...making you think you are getting actual vegetables....32nd st café..calling you out on this one.The owner also likes to rave about how much money she is making, so clearly, short changing customers is the way to go.
The Henry=I came here on a random moment after leaving the club, since my guy friends asked if I wanted to eat. After dancing my butt off for a few hours, you work this appetite, but I wasn't that hungry. I decided to meet up with them anyways, since good company is always nice to be around.The Henry is right across from this performance bar called BOND. They had some loud house music bumpin' and I asked the hostess if she could seat us somewhere that we can hear each other and the music isn't ringing in our ears. She walked me over to this Huge round booth that could fit a large party of six. I asked her if she was sure this is okay, since I didn't want to occupy a table when it's only three of us. She told me, since it's a slow night, it's fine and this is the only table that is the farthest from the music. It was nice and comfy. I do love the decor of The Henry, being it's open 24hours.. this place looks ravishing! A lot of warmth in this place from the colors. The men ordered some "healthy" egg whites omelets and even though I didn't try any.. I'm sure it was good, since they finished everything. I love when a man has a great appetite and isn't afraid to try new things. It makes the whole dining experience much more enjoyable and you actually have a bigger appetite yourself. That was the case with me this night. I asked the server what he thought was the highlight of this place for late night dining. He suggested many, but the Cinnamon French Toast he mentioned was the one I was curious about and I haven't had that in a long time.. So that was my pick of the night.The food came out shortly after and when I saw my dish.. I was already beaming with joy. Not only did it smell good.. It looked So delicious! Now this isn't your regular French Toast you make or order at IHOP or something. It was enormous for the size and thickness of the bread.. Lovely :) Even the maple syrup tasted yummy!!! I poured some on top of the toast and took the first bite... Sky rocket of flavor! Perfect perfect perfectly made French Toast. The texture from the thickness of the bread was unbelievably addicting.. so light, fluffy, soft, and had the most amazing flavor! The four thick slices of bread are dipped in french vanilla custard and I swear it was divine. Simply put... you could be having the best dessert/breakfast of your life. It tasted like candy, but in a good way.. not too sweet, but you have this happy smile in your tummy that candy sometimes give you.. yes that kind of feeling. Then the texture makes you want more and more and... I love eating the corners of this toast... when you try this.. you'll get what I mean ;) It also had candied pecans and creamery butter to finish off this brilliant breakfast creation. I loved it. If I ever wanted French Toast again and by the way... I Love French Toast. This place would be my #1 spot. It was SO good. I shared a few pieces with my guy friend and he loved this dish too. I thought he wouldn't want any since he works out hard and all, but with this dish I had.. he didn't care at all. He even said.. it's so good!!! Every time I asked him if he wanted another bite... he just opened his mouth without Any hesitation :P The plate was shining clean. Remember when I said I wasn't really that hungry... well after tasting this Cinnamon French Toast.. I magically became starving for another bite!!! Crazy I know!?!! This Cinnamon French Toast is the best to satisfy any hunger anytime in your day... Breakfast, lunch, or late night eats. So happy I came here and caught up with my friends. The BEST!!!Henry, oh Henry. Long line at the popular Pizzeria at the Cosmopolitan hotel?My friends decided to split up to order food at a couple places. Do you like how we multitask in getting crazy amounts of food?2 bitter champagne cocktails + 1 spinach artichoke dip = $50+Service was non-existent, yet rushed. The waitress kept asking if we were done with the menus when we did not even give her the order.My friend had a to-go box from another restaurant, and they threw it away. When we asked about it, they defensively replied, "IT'S NOT OUR FAULT."1 extra star because they open late and they let us eat our outside food (cosmo pizza) inside the restaurant.The Henry is a great spot to go for a late night dining spot.  The big plus is that it's 24 hours so you can come here anytime during the day.I came knowing about their French Dip sandwich and Truffle Tots because so many folks have ordered it and posted pics of it on yelp.  So when I came there for a late night munch fest, it was a no-brainer that that would be what I would order.French Dip -- tender prime rib, melted swiss cheese, horseradish sauce & au juswith truffle tater tots http://bit.ly/11JiTeYThis definitely hit the spot, especially at 1am in the morning!  A nice heavy portion of hot beef and cheese and then able to soak it all in to the au jus was just great comfort food all around!  And the Truffle Tots just made it even more epic!The Henry has definitely made my rotation of places to eat at any time of the day.  Their late night and breakfast menus are pretty solid and I would most definitely come back again.Considering The Cosmopolitan is the newest resort on the Strip, it's not surprising that nearly every aspect of the hotel is so trendy and nice.  However, it's still pretty surprising that even their 24-hour diner/cafe looks great.  Definitely nicer than some random Denny's or IHOP!Unlike the vast majority of Cosmo''s restaurants and eateries, The Henry is located on the ground floor (by the entrance closest to the Bellagio) as opposed to the second and third floors.  Despite being so close to the casino though, it's pretty cool how the restaurant isn't at all loud or smokey.  Although there seemed to be a decent sized crowd waiting to be seated, it only took about 10-15 minutes to get a table for brunch on a Sunday.While I normally would have opted for an actual brunch type of dish, I decided instead to go with the CORNED BEEF REUBEN with a side of Truffle Tater Tots based on what others had mentioned on Yelp.  The dish sounded pretty good, but to be honest, the truffle tater tots was what got me excited.  It's a combination of two fantastic things!As far as portions go, the reuben was certainly a winner - the sandwich was practically bursting open.  However, I don't think it tasted as amazing as how others have described.  I certainly appreciated all that meat, but the abundance of sauerkraut was very overwhelming (think sauerkraut with corned beef rather than corned beef with sauerkraut).  Conversely, the tater tots were just as good as I had hoped.  They could have been a little crispier, but that's a minor quibble.  I just wish there had been more!Even though the service was good enough for me to round up from THREE AND A HALF STARS, I'm rounding down specifically because of price.  The reuben wasn't awful at $16, but $5.00 for a diet coke?  That's ridiculous, even by Vegas standards.  Next time, I'll just stick with a cup of water and get my diet coke comped at the tables..After another decadent Vegas night, I wasn't about to be up at the crack of dawn for some breakfast and there was no way in heck I was going to drive to dine at a ill mom n pop place despite high recommendations by my reliable Yelp buddies. I'm just too tired, too lazy and too dang hungry and nobody got time for that!So I end up rolling out of bed at 12:00pm, brush my teeth and hobble down stairs for some much needed grub.  Just when I'm about to exit the hotel, what do I see? The Henry. Right across from Bond at the strip entrance. They serve a limited breakfast menu all day, I don't need to leave my hotel so that sounds good to me! The wait for a seat was a tolerable 5-10 minutes, and our server Billy, was energetic and friendly, albeit it on the frazzled side but he kept our coffees topped off and waters full, which was fine by meHe served up my coffee in a jiffy and since they proudly serve Illy, they get extra points!We had to wait a bit for our food but it came out piping out and delicious! I highly recommend the breakfast burrito. This beast was packed with all sorts of good stuff: melts cheese crispy potatoes fluffy scrambled eggs and a side of zesty salsa and cool sour cream. We built our own burger with avocado cheddar and caramelized onions. I ordered a medium rare patty and it came out medium, no biggie. Oh but those truffle Tate tots were a plus! They were crunchy and had the most irresistible truffle aroma despite me immersing them in loads of ketchup! YumBoth dishes were quite substantial so we decided to forgo dessert. We charged the bill to the room (hello identity points) and we were out of there in record time. Thanks Henry, you're the perfect cure for a Vegas hangover Happy Eats!The French Kiss is a must if you are going to come here, it is a cocktail drink consisting of Ford's gin, st. Germaine liqueur, rose syrup, and prosecco. Just the perfect strength when mixed here, and it is just delicious. What I usually love to get from here is the Reuben, you will never find a better Reuben than at Henry's! Always nice and friendly service, a highly recommended place to grab a bite all day and night!Honestly, I have no idea why this rating is so low. We stayed in the Cosmo recently, on a girls trip, and we ate here 2 of the 3 days, the other group of girls ate here 3 of the 3 days for our breakfast meal.Their Dill/Cucumber smashed Bloody Mary is to die for!!!  Their coffee is divine. The service was great both times AND there was little to no wait times to eat!The first day 2 girls ordered the Short Rib Benedict- Hot Damn is that good!  It was so good, in fact, they wanted it AGAIN the next day and sure as shit they both ordered it AGAIN!!!!!  But truly the most AMAZING THING is their Gruyere cheese hashbrown cake of LOVE. I actually thought it was a Risotto cake at first, but BY GOD IS THAT GOOD!  It's hashbrowns, onions, and cheese in a latkes style hashbrown circle of mouth watering, tongue tingling DELECTABLENESS. Need I say more?  Don't even think of not getting this thing. It's so good other people did without fries or tater tots; which by the way, they have as well, to get this as their side item instead. It can't be good for you, but by golly is it good!I got a burger the 2nd day as it was 11 o'clock on Saturday and they had a brunch menu, it was delicious as well.I would eat here again and again! I'd be 500 lbs but I would do it!The Henry inside the Cosmopolitan is a 24/7 diner with lounge and table seating. Great for late night snacks but nothing extraordinary for sure. If you're hanging out at Vesper or any of the Cosmo bars around, The Henry is probably your best choice to grab a bite.The menu has everything from burgers, chicken wings, salads... you name it. Average pricing (burger $12) but kinda slow service.Our table got the FRENCH ONION SOUP ($12) and the CHICKEN FINGERS W/ FRIES ($15) which tasted as expected. The soup was a good value though.Would come back if everything else fails.After arriving in Las Vegas, I was absolutely famished and didn't want to travel far for breakfast.  The Henry has a prime location at the Cosmo -- which happened to be where I was staying -- and fit the bill nicely.  Almost every hotel-casino in Vegas has at least one 24-hour diner-type restaurant, The Henry is Cosmo's version.  And since it's the Cosmo, it's shiny and gorgeous to look at, with abundant chandeliers and glittery surfaces (natch).  It's located right off the casino floor, across from the Bond bar. (Watch your head, since selfie stick-wielding tourists are everywhere.  I may or may not have been smacked by one.)  The place was quite busy on a Friday morning, but there was plenty of room at the bar, where the full menu is available.  I ordered a whole grain waffle with a side of chicken apple sausage.  The waffle was extremely delicious and even somewhat healthy, thanks to the abundant yogurt and fresh strawberries.  Unfortunately, the chicken apple sausage wasn't nearly as good -- it tasted slimy, like it had been sitting in the fridge for too long.I washed down my breakfast with a much-needed cappucino, which was quite tasty.  I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but getting through a day on the Las Vegas Strip always seems to require that extra jolt of energy.Another plus about The Henry: very friendly staff.  I've found that most Strip restaurants have a cold or stand-offish staff with major chips on their shoulders, but not here.  They make their customers feel at home.  That's reason enough to come back!I have had The Henry bookmarked for a long time because of the much raved about French Dip. I finally knocked the bookmark off this past week. It was about 11 pm when we arrived and the hostess seated us right away. We were put into a corner that left us no elbow room, so hubby asked the hostess if we could move to a different spot. She moved us to a half booth and half table. That didn't end up much better at first, but we moved the table around a bit so we had room and it turned out fine. Our server was nice however we did have to flag him down for drink refills. French Dip ($18) - Shaved prime rib, Swiss cheese and au jus on a French roll. I asked for the horseradish sauce to be left off. This also came with my choice of a few different sides and I chose the Truffle Tater Tots. The sandwich was not as great as I has hoped for. If you look at other pictures of yelp of this sandwich you will see there is a lot more meat in those ones compared to mine. The prime rib was tender, but lacked a lot of flavor. The bread was stiff even after dipping it into the au jus. The tater tots were nothing special and I tasted nothing truffle whatsoever. The total was $50 including tax (before tip) for just 2 sandwiches, 2 sides and 2 sodas. I wasn't impressed and have experienced better at other places both on and off the strip, so I can't see coming back.I hoped for a far better meal coming from a restaurant inside the Cosmo. Seating sucks depending where you get put. I ordered The Henry Burger and it comes with mushrooms, caramelized onions and cheddar cheese however I had the shrooms left off. The bun was toasted and hard and the burger was dry. Just because a burger is big doesn't mean it's going to taste good. The onions were in abundance and and the cheese was good and since there was a decent amount of cheese it helped me get the dry burger and bun down. It came with a side of fries that were actually cooked perfect. I had no issue inhaling the fries. I did have a problem with a $18 burger that wasn't great let alone wasn't even good and $5 for soda is a complete rip off. Service was okay but I wish I didn't have to wait as long as I did for drink refills.
Chou's Kitchen=This place is brand spanking new, serving up the culinary delights of Northeast China/Manchuria. The meat patty in fried pastry is absolutely to die for. They come 3 in an order and I saw people order it for lunch and wolf down all three in one sitting. The pastry is pan fried and the meat is somehow miraculously bathed in a savory soup. When you take a bite, the soup gushes out and overwhelms you, very much XLB style (Xiao Lung Bao). The dumplings, pot stickers, and hand pulled noodle soups are also quite good, as well as the noodle in the dark thick peanutty sauce. The ladies working there are pleasant and friendly. The restaurant is commendable for its cleanliness.This place totally rocks and I recommend you all flash mob this place to keep it alive and well, serving up goodies for years to come.I am excited about this place, even though I have not had many opps to try northern style Chinese food.  Think dough, and don't mistakenly believe it's the same dough steam/cooked/fried/stuffed in different ways.  The kind owner lady proudly told me each of our 3 dishes was made w/ a unique dough recipe... At first I was worried all the dough would overpower my tastebuds, until I asked for some dipping sauce... they kindly made me a black vinegar, ginger, and scallion sauce... that just upleveled everything.  Who knows if it's traditional or not, but I implored the owner to start dishing this out when Americans like me (smiley face) come over and eat.The off-menu items are written on a small whiteboard sitting atop the freezer stuffed w/ to-go dumplings... luckily the folks there speak English, so I'll be working my way thru this secret menu and who knows.. this might go 5 stars!SW corner of Ray and Alma School, next to the JCC.My mom picked this place for her birthday lunch.  We drove 50 mins (1 way).  It was a little place stuck in a strip mall.  We were greeted right away.  The staff was super friendly.  Before we ordered, the server brought waters and these yellow soups.  I have never seen yellow soup before, so like a little kid, MOM - What is this???  She told me it was a corn congee-like soup.  It was tasteless but then I found it you put sugar it in.  Ah, I just I am a Northern Style Chinese food newbie.  Since I have no idea, I left it up to my parents to order the food.  Beef Pies - Excellent!!!  Very tasty and yummy.Pork Potstickers -  Freshly made and cooked.  These are very good.  But found out Northern style, you do not use soy sauce for dipping sauce.  Vinegar is the thing.Green Onion Pancakes -  It was fresh but the layers of dough were not there.  OK.Fried Beef Bun - These are actually steamed.  Doughy but good.Lamb Skewers - My family inhaled them.  And said it was great.  Spicy Pork Intestines Stir Fry - Again my family ate it and said it was good.  I am the only person in my family that is not that brave.  1 con:  It was super HOT!  I was sweating the entire lunch.  Please turn on the AC!If someone tells you that you are the ginger vinegar to their xiaolongbao, marry them.  Sooo... instead of listening to my fellow Yelpers, I took some blind advice given on Instagram and ended up getting an unsatisfying meal.We had ordered the Green Onion Pancake [103], The Pork Soup Dumplings/Xiaolongbaos (XLB) [111], the Pickled Vegetable with Pig Intestine Clay Pot [39], and the Sweet & Sour Fish [86].  I had completely forgot to order the Beef Pie, which is apparently juicier/saucier and more flavorful, much to my disappointment.  Anyways, what I really wanted were the XLB and they were decent!  Everything is handmade and the skins on these babies were tender and delicate.  Sadly, it was so delicate that three out of seven of the soup dumplings had been punctured and spilled its soup before we could even pick them up to eat.  The ones with the soup didn't have much soup but they were pretty good.  My companion's dish, the pickled veggies with intestines in a clay pot, was flavorful and the intestines were thankfully clean.  Ain't nobody got time for particles-filled intestines!  The onion pancake and the sweet & sour fish were lacking luster.  The onion pancake lacked any flavor or seasoning and the fish dish came out soggy.  It was such a bummer! The service can be pretty slow since it's a really popular joint that's much too small.  There was a line out the door!  Halfway through our meal, we were asked to relocated to a booth so we can give our table up to a single lonely diner which I understand but it was kind of a drag to walk across the restaurant balancing your purse, jacket, and plate.  I never did get a water refill either.  All in all, I think I'd come back for the XLB and to try their Beef Pies [get your mind outta the gutter!].
Urban Picnic=Organic yumminess! The chicken pressed quesadilla is the best quesadilla I've had in a LONG time :)The ingredients were fresh & tasty! It came with 2 dips, a salsa (not my fav) & a chipoltle sour cream (my fav!!!). If I could have gotten away with licking the little container, I totally would have, lol. The location is cute but small. Get there early if you want to sit & eat. Also, there are a few tables outside, so dress for a picnic ;)
Rivas Mexican Grill=I was disappointed when the little BBQ place that once occupied this space closed, and I was perplexed when I noticed that a new Mexican restaurant was opening up in its place. A Roberto's had recently opened up in the same small shopping center. Why would they choose to set up shop so close to the competition? As it turns out, Roberto's is no competition at all. My boyfriend and I decided to check out this new shop and see if the menu looked any good. We had a back up plan... "If the menu sucks, we'll go to Roberto's." We walked up, and checked out the menu through the window (I hate walking into small businesses, making eye contact with the prideful business owner, and walking out. I feel bad, REALLY bad.). All it took was two words and the boyfriend was sold, wet burrito. I had already seen a few things that looked tasty including some fresh salads, fajitas, quesadillas, tacos, nachos, and combo plates. In we went. We were greeted by a super friendly guy who was all smiles. He had a great energy, and I could tell he was passionate about the food. Upon further inspection of the menu, we discovered something so sinful and amazing that we agreed that there was no way we were getting out of there without giving it a try... Fries. Fries? Yes. Fries. Fries covered in cheese, beans, cream, guacamole, and Mexican salsa with your choice of chicken, steak, or shrimp. YUM! The final order was a wet steak burrito for him, a dry steak burrito for me, and an order of steak fries. I knew it was going to be a ton of food, but I had no idea what was in store for us. The food and two regular drinks came to about $25.00. It might seem kind of pricey, but the fries were NOT an appetizer. They were a meal for two by themselves. After placing our order, he immediately got to work preparing our food. The kitchen was very clean, and everything was prepared fresh to order. I swear that there was nearly an entire cow on the grill. There was that much beef. As he was cooking, we carried on a conversation. I asked how business was going and he said, "Everyday it gets better. It's been three weeks, and we're doing good." He also shared that there was another location near the Boulevard Mall that has been open for 11 years. Then I asked the dreaded question, "Is Roberto's giving you guys some competition?" His reply was a simple, "No," followed by a big smile. I said, "So your food is THAT good huh?" Again, he smiled and nodded. The food was indeed THAT good. The steak fries came out first, and we immediately got to work devouring the delicious mountain of yummy goodness. After our burritos arrived, we moved to the outdoor seating. I will be honest. I never made it to the burrito, but my boyfriend did, and he says it was delicious. He asked me what night of the week should be Rivas night, so we are already planning on becoming regulars. I had to go in and ask for boxes to go, and I can't wait until lunch tomorrow when I will get to try my burrito.
Majerle's Sports Grill=Yes, Marjele's has made it to Old Town. Yes, this is the same Marjele's that you have probably been to before a sporting event in Downtown Phoenix, but this is Marjele's with the Old Town twist. That means, this is Marjele's; Scottsdale edition. However, so far it's doing pretty good in my book! Old Town lacks good sports bars and the ones they have fill up within 20 minutes on the day or night of a big game. So with that, I was pleased to hear that Marjele's gave us another sports bar option. I visited for the first time several weeks ago. Marjele's might have been open all of three days so we decided to check it out. Prior to going, we called to see if there was a chance they accepted reservations. And guess what? They did! Now, I don't know if this will last forever, but at the time, they took a reservation (I hope it stays like that!) The staffer on the phone was extremely polite and friendly when I talked to them. We arrived as one of the games was ending and before the next one started. The sports bar was jam packed so they didn't have our table yet, but they were extremely apologetic and got us one as soon as the first one opened up. So for that, they get a point for customer service. The scene: Considering this is a sports bar, I'm not shocked to say that this place was packed with men. All men. There might have been all of 15 girls in the bar when we were there. I assume this will change over time as girls realize that the ratio is in their favor. There is a nice long patio and then room inside with several tables and high tops, two bars and a standing area. TVs surround the entire bar, just like in the Downtown location. I think this Marjele's is bigger than the Downtown location, but it's a toss up. Now, like I said above, this one is definitely Scottsdaled up. At night, it's dark and "sceney" but it's still not bad yet. We'll see how long they keep it as a chill sports bar, especially since it's by PCL and now next door to the new El Hefe. I think this is a good option to watch a game or to visit on a night you want to go out in Old Town. The food: thumbs up in my book! This is generic bar food but decent bar food. The wings have a spicy kick to them. For my meal, I got the buffalo chicken wrap. It was tasty and tangy with a twist. The sandwich filled me up and unlike some other sports bars around town, I would be ok with eating here again. But again, remember...this is just sports bar food so don't walk into Marjel's expecting fine dining. Expect beers and fried food and you'll be set. So in conclusion, check out Marjele's if you're up for being out in Old Town, you're ok with running into the Old Town crowd, you want to watch a game at a place that will be crowded and social and you want to enjoy some food and drinks along the way...served by friendly staff of course!This place has so much potential but it's inconsistent customer service prevents it from being a top notch joint.  We come here every weekend to watch college football games.  The food is decent for a sports bar.  Over the course of the season I've had:Gorilla Wings - $9Basket of Fries - $3.50Fully Loaded Pizza (Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Onions, Black Olives, Mozzarella, Parmesan and Cheddar) - $12Italian Panini - Genoa Salami, Pepperoni, Ham, Provolone, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Vinaigrette, on Sourdough Bread) - $9.50Buffalo Chicken Wrap - $9.50Chicken Quesadilla - $9.50Yes, the prices are a bit high...but you're in Old Town Scottsdale, where prices are high everywhere.  During the football season, pints of domestic draft Beer are cheap so it makes up for the food pricing.The food quality is mediocre.  By far my favorite items are the Italian Panini and the Gorilla Wings served with Maniac Sauce, which is pretty hot.  The Chicken Quesadilla is ~meh~, a bit soggy and doesn't have much flavor.Where they really fall short is their inconsistent service.  When they're not busy (during ASU home games) the service is great.  However, when they're busy (ASU road games) the staff is overloaded and can't handle large crowds.  I think it's because they hire young, inexperienced kids who have an attitude.  On at least 3 occasions I've been told "I'm real busy right now, I'll come get your order when I can" or "I don't know, ask someone else, too busy right now"....come on!They'll never change because being in Old Town, they'll always have the business and don't have to worry about repeat, loyal customers.  If my friends didn't come here every week, we wouldn't come here as often as we do.Return Factor - a begrudging 80%, 30% if we didn't meet up here to watch college football
Brueggers Bagels=Your service SUCKS and is s-l-o-wWhy don't you drink a cup of Joe?Or just do a line of blow?To help with the logisticsPreparation of bagels should be quite simplisticOr maybe I'm being too realistic?Good thing your "breakfast bagel" is delicious!Employees snicker, "Oh she was merely being capricious."Add some bacon for THE meal that's most nutritiousSurprisingly, your coffee was pretty strongI really don't want to complain for too longWish this was a more upbeat songSo hopefully you'll get your sh*t together All doubts gone foreverCZ' I really am about to severAnd say never, ever, everBe stuck going to Einstein's even though your bagels are better
Island Style Restaurant=Island Style Restaurant #2 is located in the food court of the Greenland Supermarket and they hail from the original Island Style restaurant on West Sahara.The Mom and I headed to Greenland for lunch and did a tour to check out each place to see what interested us.  They shouted their wares and specials, hoping to hook us in.  Island Style was our last stop, and for some reason, the Mom was more interested in what they had to offer.She was eyeing the Bibimbap for $7.95, and I mentioned that the Husband likes that dish too, but with the stone pot version.  We inquired and found out their Dolsat Bibimbap was $8.95.  (She wasn't very familiar with the dish.)  As I pondered what to get, an order of fried dumplings were placed in front of us for another customer.  The Mom was immediately impressed by it and the smart guy at the counter pointed out that you get the dumplings for free if your order was $20 or more.  Of course, that easily sold us and we added the Kalbi Plate ($12.95) to our lunch to get that order of dumplings!We took a seat nearby and waited for our order.  The order of 10 dumplings were ready first, and they do usually go for $5.95.  It was piping hot and we loved the extra crispy texture.  It was filled with pork and noodles.  Two banchan were given to us as well - kim chee daikon and kim chee cabbage.The Dolsot Bibimbap came with a side of soup, and it was definitely a generous portion.  We ate as much as we could and packed the leftovers.The Kalbi Plate came with mac salad and rice, and I enjoyed the tasty beef - lots of flavor indeed.  We also had leftovers of this dish too.The Husband ended up getting all the leftovers for lunch today and he was a bit skeptical about the bibimbap (sans the hot pot).  However, upon arriving home this evening, he proclaimed that the bibimbap was very good and the kalbi tasted really good for leftovers.  Overall, sounds like everyone was happy with Island Style - and they make for good leftovers too! Aloha Promotion: Free soda with meal (mandu and spam musubi excluded) or free mandu (dumplings) with purchase of $20 or more.
Capriotti's Sandwich Shop=If my stomach had a Hall of Fame, it would have a section dedicated to Capriotti's.Last night, I went to the Tempe location for the first time, and man-o-man, was I in for a treat. I've been a fan of this chain for a couple years. I discovered a location near my home in Las Vegas and ever since, I have been a huge fan! Of course, I hopped on my trusty Yelp app, and made sure that the Tempe location was the closest to Scottsdale (for now...there is one coming soon), but then...like a Coke machine in the middle of the freaking Sahara desert, I saw it....a YELP DEAL....for CAPRIOTTI'S! SWEET BABY JESUS! HELL FREAKING YEAH! I paid $7 for a $15 deal and parkoured my way down to Tempe like it was nobody's business. Parking was a bit of a problem since it was a game night. I also had to deal with the traffic from the ASU/USC traffic, but I love Capriotti's enough to brave any kind of traffic.The shop is small, but nice. Two TV's. Enough seating. Friendly staff. Tonight's addition to my imaginary Hall of Fame: Large Cole-Turkey with Ham. Yeah, I added the ham. I'm renegade like that. I guess you can say that I just go with it. The Cole Turkey is: pulled turkey, cole slaw, provolone, russian dressing, and mayo. So, so good. If you are a Capriotti's virgin, the large is a 20' sandwich. It's no joke. It can feed four people. I had my sandwich cut into four pieces. I ate one of them, put the other three in my fridge.  All in all, I really like this location. Staff, food....everything. Perfect. If I ever come back to Tempe, this is my spot...even over Jimmy John's. Yes.Capriotti's GREATER THAN Jimmy John's(no characters allowed)Amazing sandwiches. If you are ever craving some Thanksgiving loving, theres a perfect sandwich you! Pretty much T-giving in the palm of your hands, its the one and only Bobbie! Thy are also super fast, friendly, and the place is really clean.
Our Families Country Cafe=Very weird place for a restaurant in my opinion... ha. Well, at least for now it is. Before I know it, that whole place will probably be filled with businesses. But, for those of you that want to try it.. I know the address says it's on Rainbow - but Rainbow does not go through all the way yet. So, if you're on Blue Diamond, Get onto Buffalo, turn left at Cactus and go all the way down, and you'll see it on your left. I'm not really sure what I was expecting when I walked into the place, but I liked what I saw. The place was decorated with a crap load of Christmas stuff. A little own of miniatures houses and a huge Christmas tree ! I'm not sure how festive the restaurant is on a normal basis, but it looks cute now. I really wanted to try this place for two reasons:1. I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF BREAKFAST FOODS !2. I'm on a mission to find the best Chicken Fried Steak in Vegas. The CFS here was good. Almost comparable to my favorite in Vegas so far [Babycakes]. It was good, very good...[not chewy at all!!] but a little too peppery for my taste [not overpowering or anything]. Now, if you're a person who likes pepper, then you'll probably enjoy this. It's safe to say that this is the 2nd best [at least in my opinion] CFS in Vegas. The portion of the CFS is also quite smaller compared to Babycakes, but still big enough to fill you. The gravy was a very nice. Probably the best gravy I've gotten on any CFS. It was rich, thick, and had bits of sausage throughout it. Very, very good ! I ordered the scrambled eggs with my CFS, as well as the battered potatoes. The scrambled eggs were underwhelming. Well seasoned, but definitely overcooked. Potatoes were good. I'm not a big potato fan at all, but I actually ate quite of few of their potatoes. They were nice and crispy.I'm excited to go back and try the rest of the offerings.  The service could have been better, but it wasn't quite bad enough to knock this review down to four stars.I've been here twice already. I remember not liking something about the place last time I came, but I couldn't remember what it was. Once we walked in here the other day, I was immediately reminded. The waitress just stared at us when we walked in. I said, "Do we just seat ourselves?" She responded, "Well that's what the sign says." Obviously I didn't read the sign if I asked the question, but she didn't need to be sarcastic about it. Maybe they should have a recorded message that says, "Please seat yourself" when you walk in the door, since they get irritated when people ask. It took us about 15 SECONDS to find a table and sit because I couldn't decide if I wanted something by the window, a 2 seat table, or a 4 seat table. I didn't think that was long at all, but when the waitress came up to us with our menus, she said, "Wow, I didn't realize finding a table was so hard." Then she took our drink orders (coffee and water). The coffee was $1.55 with unlimited refills. When she came back, we both ordered veggie omelets ($7.75 ea.)The veggies omelets were average. I just found it weird that they put whole slices of tomatoes in the center (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eDX3TWDnGMXq4hXmwgBkJg/l.jpg).  The coffee was very good though and I got about 3 refills. Overall, I don't think I'd come back here even though I live a couple miles away. I just don't like the service and the food is just mediocre. If the waitress was completely quiet the whole time, it would've been better. Tip:Directions: Go south on Buffalo, make a left on Cactus and when you get to the end, it'll be on your right.I have lived in Las Vegas for fifteen years and just, officially, had the best cheeseburger this town has to offer because of this restaurant.Warning, it takes a good moment to find this place.  We felt like after every turn we would be arriving there until another sign popped up for us to make another turn.  Then, when the signs stop, you assume you've gotten lost, but you just have to keep going until the end of the road...if you hit train tracks, you've gone too far.  ;)When you walk in, the interior matches everything you think a "country cafe" should look like.  Actually, it really reminded me of my grandmother's house back home in Texas...very cozy, very homey and knick knacks everywhere.  Also, they play country music from a local radio station.  Not even places that are supposed to be country ::cough Stoney's cough:: do that.We sat down and placed our orders, mine for the lunch cheeseburger and my friend for the breakfast burrito.  That's another thing, they don't stop serving breakfast until 3:00 PM, which is very beneficial when you're constantly out with someone that would prefer eat breakfast items at all three meals.Our check wasn't too high, the service was pretty good and the food was AMAZING!!!  I can't believe I didn't know about this place sooner!  I DEFINITELY intend to go back!03/23/13 DINNERI was tempted to give this place only 1 star, but since the owner/server was a nice guy, I went with 2 stars.On 02/27/12 spouse and I had dinner here. We brought a GROUPON along, and as it turned out, it was worth the long drive and price for what we had. Spouse really liked the chicken fried chicken.So a few months ago a repeat of the GROUPON was offered. I got one.Well, we were extremely disappointed this time. It had a few ups, but mostly downs.We came this night for their announced Saturday night special, which I will copy verbatim from their Facebook page: IT'S SATURDAY MARCH 23rd AND....TODAY'S SPECIAL IS....ROASTED TURKEY BREAST WITH DARRELL'S HOMEMADE CORNBREAD STUFFING (THIS IS DELISH!!) SERVED WITH FRESH MASHED POTATOES AND GRAVY(made from the drippings mm mm good) VEGETABLE, DINNER ROLL AND CHOICE OF HOMEMADE SOUP OR CRISP GREEN SALAD!!!We arrived. I saw a sign at the front door announcing "Saturday & Sunday only, check in with Facebook and get unlimited mimosas for $10 or half priced bloody marys". I said to myself, Why Not?, and proceeded to check in. I showed my phone to the owner/server (Darrell?), and he said "Oh, that's only offered at brunch, and as I don't own the bar, I can't make that offer for dinner." It's a tavern with him (Darrell?) subleasing the restaurant side of the building. That's fair enough. (It's similar to what Carluccio's did, moving from the Liberace center to a Henderson tavern.) But he (Darrell?) proceeded to bring us a free basket of fried mozzarella sticks, which was very nice of him (Darrell?), and were actually pretty good.We got the bloody marys after all, and it was one of the worst I've ever had. Why? For one, my olive was previously attacked by a bug (no lie, a chunk bit out of it, obviously insect-eaten) and the cocktail tasted metallic. I probably should've returned it, but then there were those free moz sticks, sitting there...After ordering said Saturday night special, next up were cup of soup or salad. I got the homemade chili, which was good. Spouse got the salad, and was quite happy. It even had dandelion greens. In the 2.25 years of living here in Vegas I don't think we've seen those in a salad. (Was it a packaged salad? If it was, it was surprising.)But then the main course comes. It was not turkey BREAST, it was turkey LOAF. Lots of white and grey-dark meat, sliced from a loaf, perfectly circular, falling to pieces. It was OK, but it wasn't anything special, or worth the price charged. And the "veg", the green beans, we forgot about this part from the last visit, they were sadly canned. Remaining was some cranberry sauce (OK, likely canned, no problem), the potatoes (a small scoop of homemade, these were good), the dressing (also seemed homemade, good) and the gravy (which I think wasn't from "drippings" because the last time I cooked a turkey loaf I don't recall all that many drippings, so we think it was bottled/packaged). The dinner roll was a version of texas toast, no garlic, just a grilled roll.Didn't order the homemade, just out of the oven, peach cobbler, offered by the owner/server (Darrell?). We promptly left after dinner. A lot of the turkey loaf came home for the kitties.If I hear they've improved, we might again make the trip out there. But I doubt that will happen.PS One other problem. We arrived to find a couple of uncontrolled kids running around the VERY SMALL restaurant, at times screaming. It continued throughout most of our visit. I guess the word "Families" in the name of the place should've been a clue of the possibility of an undesired child "carnival", supplied by their uncaring-of-other-patrons parents. (At the same age as those kids, if I had behaved that way in a restaurant with my Navy Commander father at the table, I would've been beaten to a pulp. Times have certainly changed.)My husband & I went to this place due to a groupon I found for it. The groupon deal was good, the food was good, but the service was HORRIBLE!! I've definitely experienced better. First, the drive to this place was coo-coo! We almost thought this place didn't exist. My husband thought it was a "groupon scam" but we finally found it. I kinda wished we hadn't though. As I said before, the food was good, but the service was NOT!! It all started w/the tall, dark-haired guy that greeted us at the door; he spoke in a monatone & he had no personality whatsoever. :(  Then, our server, a full-figured, blond-haired lady, came to take our order, & when she saw that we had a groupon, she gave a weird, attitudy look; a look that said, "Oh great, some more cheap-skates that only came here for the groupon deal". She had so much attitude, she definitely needs an attitude adjustment. Then, it took so long to get our food. Eventhough they were busy, it took FOREVER to get our food. We only ordered some common breakfast meals. My husband got the bacon & eggs w/sourdough toast & batter bites, which are only seasoned cubed potatoes that are crispy. I got a denver omelette, homefried potatoes, which have onions & bell peppers, w/biscuits & gravy. The biscuits were good but the gravy was very peppery & had no sausage, which it usually would have. The only good service we got was by the two guys who kept checking on us, about our drinks mainly, but they were cool still. We over-heard our server curse in the kitchen about all the people who were coming in w/all the groupons. I thought if they don't want people to come visit their restaurant w/groupons, then they shouldn't put their restaurant on the groupon website. I would only recommend this place for the food, but not for the service.If you are looking for just OK food, very rude and mediocre service this is the place!!. My friend and I went this morning for breakfast with our babies and we had THE WORST experience. Shyla almost yank the menu out of my babies hands when my baby was only looking at it! agh! the more I think about it the madder I get!!! some people just don't care about customer service anymore! we will never ever again return to this place...and I am sharing this with all my friends!If you're looking for a diner-esque type place, look no further. It may be a bit hard to find for those of you not familiar with Mountain's Edge.I found the staff to be friendly and pleasant and there was not long wait for our service.I got the Honey Stung Fried Chicken, it wasn't the best fried chicken but it was tasty and not at all greasy. I wasn't a big fan of their mashed potatoes (could they be instant-maybe?). The roll was tasty. I also got a cup of their Cream of Chicken Soup...wow! this stuff is good. I'd go back just for the soup!My husband got the Rib Eye Sandwich with Fries. The sandwich was good, no grisle like you get in some steaks. The fries were also good, I stole my share from his plate!I would definitely go back, friendly staff, prices are decent, food is good and it's close to home!Pros:The food is very good.Conveniently located in Mountain's Edge.Cons:SERVICE!!!! Bad and rude customer service from the brother and sister that usually work in the restaurant. We have eaten at this establishment a few times over the last couple years. Each time we don't know what type of service we will receive. The scale ranging from just ok to bad.As I mentioned before the food is very good and you can't beat the convenience for us, it's less than a 5 minute drive. Hence, continuing to come back.This is the last time though. We were there this last Sunday morning on 02/15/15We arrived and they were busy. We waited about 1/2 an hour before we were seated.The busser came over and took our drink order and brought out our drinks promptly. Our server also came over and took our order.Our food didn't come out to our table until ONE HOUR+ after taking our order. NO ONE, not our server, not the manager,  not a single person stopped by our table to tell us anything! Nothing at all. They just kept walking past our table several times while we were waiting. 45 minutes into want we flagged down our server to ask if there was a problem with our food? It was taking so long? She just replied that it shouldn't be too much longer.  5 minutes later the manager/head server came to our table to let us know that they have been very busy and that it shouldn't be too much longer.My husband and I both ordered steaks, medium rare at that. His was a sandwich and mine a regular small steak.Another 10 minutes passed and our food finally came out. WRONG ORDER for my husband.  They brought him a chicken fried steak. At this point we were just DONE!No we didn't want to wait for who knows how much longer to get the order right! As the manager/lead server was suggesting. Poor to nonexistent customer service will continue to drive people away. The owners really need to look into experienced servers with good customer service.That's too bad. But hopefully Mountain's Edge will have more choices soon!I ate here when my family came to visit. Seeing some reviews, I wanted to try it for myself. Everyone raved about the country fried steak so I tried it. Honestly, the food was mediocre. The guy who served us was very direct and rude. He would ask us a question and if we didn't answer quick enough, he would walk away. He did this a couple of times. The food came out fast, we waited about 10 mins till it came to our table. I read other reviews about people waiting longer.Okay, brace yourself for this part... My 3 year old needed to use the restroom so my husband took him. In the restroom was our server. My husband saw him walk out of the stall and not even wash his hands!!!!! As my husband walked back to our table with our son, I watched our server serve another customer their plate and a coke!!!! GROSSS!!!!!! Just because of that incident, we are NEVER going back. Their not very welcoming or friendly there anyway.
Ron's Steakhouse=I was told that I needed to take my GF out on a date to dinner and a show. I wanted to see Absinthe again but after checking the restaurant prices at Caesars and being told a trip to McDonald's wasnt going to cut it to night we picked Rons steakhouse.Don't let the crazy people in and around the Casino scare you. This is a great place to escape the heat, the hustle and bustle of the strip and better yet most of the people in the casino couldnt afford the restaurant so its quaint and yet classy sit down experience you dont want to miss.We both had a 3 course steak dinner of perfectly cooked Fillets, house salads that came wrapped in tasty cucumber bowls and for desert it was cheesecake.The server was an Expat from France and very knowledgeable about all the dishes. He was even very entertaining as he made jokes about himself and his not being from America. It was very personal and engaging and all the staff made you feel at home. (So much so an elderly lady had a personal cell phone conversation in the booth next to us like she was sitting in her own living room. I hope whomever she was talking to gets her meds figures out, the laundry folded and the pets fed) If you are in the mood for a great steak dinner at a great price that will impress just about anyone; GIVE THEM A TRY!
Comptoir 21=Bear in mind, Montreal is close to no ocean so though we are on an island fresh seafood can be hard to find. When fish and chips is fresh and perfect it's probably in my top 5 favourite foods, and when it's anything less than perfect it kinda breaks my heart because it just doesn't bring those same memories back. Le Comptoir 21 today was perfect - the fish was so light and fresh and buttery and not at all fishy I couldn't believe it; according to the owner it comes up from Boston (which explains it's bold Maritime-y American attitude =). The batter was perfect, especially squirted with the bottles of malt and regular vinegar provided, and dipped in the homemade tartar. I had a pint of local blonde beer from the tap, but saw they also had bottles of that lovely and inexpensive C'est La Vie wine from the Pays D'Oc. The fries were perfect and my date said his steak sandwich was above average: the panini was warm and light and full of peppers, mushrooms and onions and gooood with the hot sauce. We also really dug the communal seating at the counter wrapped around the smiling franglais waitress who seemed happy working in 360, dealing out the little baskets lined with blue and white check wax paper full up with breaded shrimp, calamari, burgers and darkly golden fries. You could almost almost hear the ocean and on this fall day in Canada we were just loving it.Il n'y a pas une grande panoplie de restos à fish n' chips à Montréal, alors quand l'envie d'un bon poisson avec une belle panure et des frites vous prends, le Comptoir 21 devient un incontournable!Ils ont une super bonne variété d'option même si le focus est vraiment mis sur le fish n'chip. On peut aussi y manger des burgers en version carnivore, poisson ou végétarien. La poutine est aussi végétarienne mais ç y goûter la sauce, vous ne pourriez pas le deviner au goût seulement. Elle est boooooonne!Et le poisson, bien que quand même un peu gras à cause de la friture, est simplement cuit à perfection. Il se défait seul tout en restant bien juteux. Et pour les sauces, mes préférées sont la thaï et la paprika. Toutefois, parce qu'on avait de la manière à décider, la serveuse a été tellement gentille et nous a offert de toutes les essayé (avec nos calmars en entrée) avant de faire notre choix finale pour le repas principal et elles étaient toutes très bonnes.L'endroit est tout petit et le décor vraiment cool. Tout le monde s'assoit à un long comptoir en forme de " U " et c'est quand même propice à la jasette avec des inconnus. On s'y sent bien en petit groupe ou même seul vu la disposition des sièges le long du comptoir. En fait, je ne les ai pas compté, mais si j'avais à prendre une chance, je dirais qu'il y a probablement 21 sièges au comptoir! Quelqu'un le saurait pour sûr?Quelle belle surprise!Disons-le, de l'extérieur, le restaurant n'a l'air de rien. Par contre, en y entrant on trouve une ambiance chaleureuse et des employés plus que gentils! Je m'attendais à ne trouver que quelques choix sur le menu, mais j'ai eu de la difficulté à choisir. La très sympathique employée à la caisse ma suggéré le classique Fish N' Chip et ne j'ai pas été déçue. La panure n'était pas trop lourde et le poisson, miam! On voyait (et goûtait!) qu'il était vraiment frais. Les frites étaient également délicieuses. Vous pourrez choisir la sauce qui accompagne votre poisson : la classique tartare, la piquante au jalapeno, la thaï et j'en passe. Ayant un petit appétit, j'ai pris la petite portion, mais ouff! La petite portion était une assez grosse portion pour moi, je n'ai pas réussi à tout avaler, même si c'était hyper bon. J'en ai donc eu beaucoup pour mon argent. Parlant d'argent, les prix sont plus qu'abordables compte tenu de la qualité de la nourriture et du service. Mon amie a quant à elle choisi les croquettes de morue avec la salade et son plat était tout aussi bon.J'y retournerai assurément pour essayer autre chose!We went there last night, wanting to enjoy some fish'n chips. We really appreciated the atmosphere set by the counter, which was great. We had the fried squids which were light and not too greasy, the paprika sauce with them was delicious too. The clam chowder was a bit thick but really good nevertheless. We then had the 21 Burger (with fried fish), I found the fish really too greasy and lacking in taste, and the shrimp tempuras which we found a tad too oily as well. The food was good, though all this fried and oil and grease did leave a weight on our stomachs but then it is North America I suppose. I have lived in London and eaten fish'n chips there and never had such a weight afterwards... All in all, for the food served, the price is right and the staff quite friendly, next time I might try something less greasy though!
China Gourmet=China Gourmet has quickly become my go-to fast food Chinese eatery.  It's conveniently located down the street from my house and next to Food 4 Less so I can go and grab a few groceries on the way home as well.  I came here on a whim one day because I saw one of their fliers in between all the other junk mail and ads.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the quick service!  Granted, the first time I visited was the same week that they opened so it wasn't too busy and they managed to hook about one or two other people to try their food while I was there but I tend to believe it's still somewhat of a secret.  The first time here I opted for the Black Bean Shrimp plate and it was actually pretty killer (better than most of the Chinese eats in my area but I dare not mention any names haha).  The second time around I ordered the Salt and Pepper Shrimp and was appeased again.  Both times my food came with Egg Drop Soup, Wonton Crackers, and a couple of Egg Rolls.  Plus, they give you a whole plate (yes a whole regular sized plate) of just rice!  So awesome!  I left both times happy and full.  The price was actually pretty good as well and they also offer lunch specials for the run-and-go cheap eats peeps out there.  I will definitely come back to visit again and I hope the quality of the food doesn't diminish in the future and end up another one of those "fast food" joints that fade into the background.Yum!  See ya soon, China Gourmet!
